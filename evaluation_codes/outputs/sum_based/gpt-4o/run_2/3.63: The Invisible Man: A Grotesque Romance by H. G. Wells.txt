### 2. Characters:
- **Review:**  
The characters are well-developed and serve the story effectively. Griffin, the Invisible Man, is a fascinating and morally complex protagonist whose descent into madness is both tragic and terrifying. His brilliance and ambition are offset by his arrogance and lack of empathy, making him a compelling antihero. Dr. Kemp provides a strong foil to Griffin, representing rationality and ethical responsibility. Supporting characters like Mr. Marvel, Mrs. Hall, and Colonel Adye add depth to the narrative, though some, such as Mr. Wicksteed, feel underutilized. The villagers of Iping contribute to the atmosphere of paranoia and fear, enhancing the story’s tension.
