### 2. Characters:
- **Review:**  
The characters in the novel are well-developed, with distinct personalities and motivations. Griffin, the Invisible Man, is a fascinating and complex protagonist-antagonist whose descent into madness is both tragic and terrifying. His moral corruption and obsession with power make him a compelling figure, though his lack of redeeming qualities may alienate some readers. Dr. Kemp serves as an effective foil to Griffin, embodying rationality and ethical responsibility. Supporting characters like Mr. Marvel, Mrs. Hall, and Colonel Adye add depth to the story, though some, such as Mr. Wicksteed, feel underutilized. The villagers’ reactions to Griffin’s invisibility provide a realistic and often humorous counterpoint to the darker themes of the novel.

### 4. World-Building and Setting:
- **Review:**  
The novel’s setting is richly detailed, with the small village of Iping and the surrounding countryside serving as a vivid backdrop for the story. Wells effectively contrasts the mundane, everyday life of the villagers with the extraordinary and unsettling presence of the Invisible Man. The world-building extends to the scientific aspects of the story, with Griffin’s experiments and theories adding a layer of realism to the fantastical premise. While the setting is immersive, it is somewhat limited in scope, with much of the action confined to a few key locations. Expanding the narrative to explore the broader societal implications of invisibility could have added depth to the story.
