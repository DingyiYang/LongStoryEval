- **Review:**  
The plot of *Crime and Punishment* is masterfully constructed, blending psychological depth with suspense and philosophical inquiry. The story’s pacing is deliberate, allowing readers to immerse themselves in Raskolnikov’s mental state and moral struggles. The murder, which serves as the inciting incident, is followed by a gradual unraveling of Raskolnikov’s psyche, creating a compelling narrative arc.

### 2. Characters:
- **Review:**  
The characters in *Crime and Punishment* are richly developed and psychologically complex. Raskolnikov is a fascinating protagonist whose internal conflict drives the narrative.
