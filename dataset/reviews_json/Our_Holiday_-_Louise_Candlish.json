            "This novel is a masterfully crafted slow-burning psychological thriller, with a simmering tension that captivates from the very beginning. Its intricate layers and subplots consistently engage the reader, while the dramatic escalation in the final act feels organic rather than over-the-top.",

The story reveals hypocrisy, double lives, and escalating tensions, creating a devious and dangerous atmosphere."

I wished the writer had established the characters more before adding new ones.\n   - The characters are not likeable; they all have an air of self-entitlement and selfishness. The parents, in particular, are flawed and set poor examples, which made me cringe during their scenes.\n   - The locals are portrayed as angry and confrontational, especially towards the holidaymakers who own second homes in Pine Ridge.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**\n   - The story is a slow burner with a complex plot. It took me a while to get into the narrative, and the ending felt prolonged.\n   - The dual timeline aspect, where the story opens with a shocking event and then goes back in time to show how events led to that moment, was engaging and helped unravel the mystery.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**\n   - The book has an underlying political message, particularly about the clash between locals and holidaymakers, and the injustice of second homes being left empty while locals struggle to find housing.\n   - The narrative reflects current affairs, such as the housing crisis and immigration, which felt too close to reality. I would have preferred more escapism rather than a critique of daily life.\n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**\n   - Despite the slow start and the unlikeable characters, the shocking opening hooked me, and I was keen to see how the mystery would unfold.\n   - I was engaged by the narrative at times, especially with the way Candlish slowly revealed clues about the central event.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this book was a mixed experience for me.

While I have enjoyed Louise Candlish’s previous books, this one was a frustrating and tedious read, saved only by my loyalty to the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2/5 stars"

            "From the very first chapter, I was captivated. The story unfolds through the first-person perspective of Rockstar Activist Robbie, who witnesses a house tumbling off a cliff. The narrative alternates between the present and the past, employing a third-person viewpoint across two timelines that lead up to the dramatic opening. The plot unfolds at a deliberate, slow-burning pace, gradually revealing the complexities of the characters and their lives. Tensions rise as double lives and hypocrisy spiral out of control, compelling readers to stay up late turning pages. The ending perfectly aligns with the novel's themes, delivering a satisfying conclusion to the story.",
            "The cast of characters is wonderfully crafted, though deeply unlikable. Their richly developed stories stand out as a highlight, showcasing a diverse mix of age, class, and gender. Initially horrendous, these characters ultimately offer nuanced perspectives. Their misdeeds catching up with them creates a satisfying narrative arc. The author captures the essence of people we all recognize, demonstrating a keen eye for self-awareness.",
            "I have a mixed relationship with this author's work. Some books kept me up all night, while others felt like a slog. Even in the less engaging novels, she skillfully weaves multi-layered twists and explores modern societal issues. The author adeptly portrays the class divide through complex characters that evoke both dislike and empathy. She seamlessly integrates topical, newsworthy themes into her narratives with style and flair.",
            "The story beautifully captures the essence of an English summer, blending brilliant satire with thrilling elements that provide an ideal escape. A palpable sense of anxiety and trepidation permeates the narrative, creating an exhilarating tension that keeps readers on edge.",
            "This novel weaves a compelling thread of dark humor, effectively satirizing the UK’s class system. Its timely exploration of second-home owners outpricing locals in seaside towns offers engaging and thought-provoking commentary. The narrative clearly delineates divides not only in class but also in intergenerational and other relationships, which become increasingly strained throughout the story. The subplot featuring Bettie and her clothing beautifully underscores the main themes, enriching the overall narrative."

The narrative revolves around two affluent families and their holiday homes, which put them in conflict with the NJFA (Not Just For August) protest group. As hostilities escalate between the families and the protesters, the story foreshadows a disaster at one of the holiday homes, culminating in a death. However, the buildup to this event feels drawn out, with excessive focus on minor details, secrets, and musings about renovations. The true tension emerges after the death, as characters scramble to conceal their involvement and navigate the pacts they are forced into. Their panic and the looming threat of exposure are the most compelling aspects of the book.",
            "The characters in the story are exceedingly wealthy and comfortable in their status, rendering them unsympathetic to the locals being priced out of their own communities. Early on, it becomes apparent who the victim will be, and this character feels somewhat dispensable, which slightly undermines the class issues the author explores.",

Their panic and the constant threat of discovery were the most intriguing parts of the book.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The book explored class issues and the conflict between wealthy second-home owners and locals struggling to afford living in their own communities.  \n   - The protest group’s tactics and the families’ reactions highlighted the growing divide and tension between these groups.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book had the classic Louise Candlish elements—multiple perspectives, time shifts, and a carefully crafted domestic thriller setup—it felt like a middling entry in her repertoire.

Initially, the introduction of numerous characters can be overwhelming, making it difficult to track their family connections.

The village is divided between affluent Down from London (DFL) residents, who infrequently visit their lavish properties, and the local villagers, who harbor resentment towards the DFLs for purchasing and renovating homes. This tension is central to the plot, particularly through the actions of the vigilante group NJFA (Not Just for August), led by Robbie Jevons, who express their frustration through minor acts of vandalism."

The narrative then reverts to the beginning, gradually building up to this climactic event.\n   - The story is cleverly interspersed with extracts from Robbie’s perspective at the end of August, adding depth and tension to the unfolding drama.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - Charlotte and Perry’s friends, Amy and Linus, have recently bought a property nearby, and both families are looking forward to a restful time with their children. However, secrets soon emerge, causing cracks within the families and escalating animosity between them and the resentful locals.\n   - The conflicts are relatable and compelling, with a wide mix of characters and personalities that often collide. The relationships are explored in an interesting and nuanced way.\n\n- **Pacing and Complexity:**\n   - Initially, there are many characters introduced, which made it a bit challenging to keep track of who belonged to which family. However, as the story progressed, the characters became more distinct and their roles clearer.\n   - The drama and tensions build up effectively, leading to an exceptional and satisfying conclusion that ties back to the initial incident of the house falling off the cliff.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - I thoroughly enjoyed the book and found the plot to be a brilliant drama. The story is engaging and would make an excellent TV adaptation.\n   - I highly recommend this book as a \"must-read\" for 2024.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a compelling drama that masterfully explores the tensions between wealthy outsiders and resentful locals in a picturesque village. With a clever narrative structure, relatable conflicts, and a wide array of interesting characters, the story builds to a satisfying and dramatic conclusion. It’s a highly enjoyable read and would translate well to a TV adaptation.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Overall Enjoyment: 5/5\n- Plot: 5/5\n- Character Development: 4.5/5\n- Pacing: 4/5\n- Recommendation: 5/5"

            "Set against the stunning backdrop of the Dorset coast, the author vividly captures the landscape.

The plot is intricate and well-constructed, with numerous twists and turns that kept me engaged. Once I got a clear grasp of the characters, I raced through the book. The story takes a darker turn with the destruction of the summerhouse, leading to shocking revelations about who was responsible.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The story revolves around two families—Charlotte and Perry, who own a luxurious second home, and Amy and Linus, who have just purchased a rundown property nearby. There is also a large cast of supporting characters, including their children, friends, and locals. Many of these characters are not who they initially appear to be, adding depth and intrigue. The locals, resentful of the wealthy incomers, make their displeasure known through small but illegal acts, escalating to more serious and dangerous events.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The author effectively highlights the tension and imbalance between the wealthy Londoners and the locals who have been priced out of the property market. This theme is woven throughout the story, adding a layer of social commentary to the narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n  Louise Candlish’s writing is engaging and descriptive, creating a vivid sense of place and atmosphere. The portrayal of Pine Ridge, Dorset, and the dynamics between the characters feels authentic and immersive.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was satisfying and unexpected, which added to the overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping and entertaining read, filled with complex characters, shocking revelations, and a well-crafted plot. The social commentary on wealth disparity and community tensions adds depth to the story, making it more than just a thriller. Louise Candlish delivers another compelling narrative with a satisfying and surprising conclusion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book opens with gripping action but soon slows as I navigated its large cast of characters. The multiple viewpoints initially made it difficult to connect with them, resulting in a slow start. However, once I acclimated to the structure, the pace picked up, and the story's layers unfolded rapidly, featuring numerous plot twists—some anticipated, others completely unexpected. The dual timeline—one set after the incident and the other leading up to it—worked effectively, allowing the pieces to gradually fall into place and creating a satisfying sense of cohesion. Tension builds steadily throughout, keeping me eager to see how everything would resolve. The story is rich with undercurrents and subplots that kept me thoroughly engaged.",
            "The characters are richly complex, with their flaws and motivations fully revealed. The narrative delves deeply into themes of secrets, lies, criminal activities, male rivalry, and tumultuous relationships. It unflinchingly portrays the darker aspects of human nature, adding significant depth to the story.",
            "Set in a charming Dorset village, the book explores the challenges faced by locals, including housing crises, second-home ownership, seasonal employment, and social tensions. The author boldly tackles pressing societal issues such as alcoholism, violence, vandalism, and protests. Through a sharp satirical lens, the divide between the affluent \"haves\" and the struggling residents is vividly portrayed, illuminating the extremes of human behavior and the stark realities of societal inequality."

It centers on two families: Charlotte and Perry, long-time owners of a prestigious holiday home in Dorset, and Amy and Linus, friends from London who have recently purchased an old bungalow nearby. The narrative leans more towards domestic drama than thriller, exploring the tensions between the couples and the village's local activists protesting against second-home owners.

            "This novel is a gripping, twisty thriller that makes for a perfect summer read. Although it begins as a slow burn, the exceptional writing keeps you engaged throughout. The plot centers on two couples with holiday homes in Pine Ridge, Dorset, who find themselves at odds with locals protesting against second-home ownership through the NJFA (Not Just For August). By summer's end, Pine Ridge gains notoriety for murder rather than its usual appeal as a holiday destination. The story's use of multiple perspectives and timelines adds depth and complexity, while subtle clues keep readers on their toes. With numerous twists, turns, and red herrings, predicting the victim or the outcome proves to be a delightful challenge.",

The resolution reveals crimes and the irreversible damage to relationships, culminating in the loss of a life. Central to the narrative are two city friends, Amy and Linus, who purchase a second home near Charlotte’s summerhouse.

While enjoyable, it lacks the same level of complexity and ingenuity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I found it difficult to stay engaged with the narrative because of this.  \n\n- **Author Comparison:**  \n  While I generally love Louise Candlish's work, this novel fell short compared to her other books. It didn’t meet the high standards I’ve come to expect from her.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was disappointing for me. The lack of compelling characters and the overwhelming number of subplots made it hard to enjoy, especially when compared to the author’s previous works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
