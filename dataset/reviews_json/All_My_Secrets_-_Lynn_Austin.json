The story emphasized following one’s heart in relationships but lacked a focus on seeking the Lord’s guidance or blessing.  \n\n- **Positive Aspects:**  \n   - The grandmother’s character was enjoyable and added charm to the story.  \n   - The exploration of historical events like the Gold Rush and the Civil War provided fascinating new perspectives.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this book, it ultimately fell short for me. The writing style, lack of emotional depth, and underdeveloped characters made it difficult to fully engage with the story. However, the grandmother’s character and the historical insights were highlights. If you enjoy slower-paced historical fiction, this might be worth a read, but it wasn’t my favorite. I remain hopeful for Lynn Austin’s next novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this story, romance takes a backseat to the primary exploration of the complex relationships among three women. The narrative centers on the sudden death of A.B. Stanhope and the ensuing fallout within his family. His will bequeaths the family business and wealth to the closest male relative, leaving his wife Sylvia, daughter Adelaide, and mother Junietta with only the family mansion, a yacht, and a modest income.\n\nThe main conflict arises from the divergent aspirations of these three women. Junietta views this moment as a chance to break free from their opulent lifestyle and encourages Adelaide to pursue her own passions and love. In contrast, Sylvia is determined to preserve their luxurious existence by pushing Adelaide to marry a wealthy suitor. As the plot unfolds, buried secrets come to light, posing a threat to the family’s unity while also offering the potential for deeper connections.\n\nThe storytelling is engaging and unfolds naturally, with the characters' revelations enhancing the narrative's emotional resonance. The choice to have them disclose their truths directly, rather than relying on flashbacks or a dual timeline, adds depth to the overall impact of the story.",
            "The characters are uniquely crafted and well-developed. Junietta and Sylvia, though they have conflicting views on Adelaide's future, are presented with sympathy. Adelaide herself, caught in the middle of their tug-of-war, emerges as a compelling protagonist. The author skillfully sidesteps a dual-time plotline, allowing the characters to reveal their secrets organically, which enhances their depth and development.",

His will leaves the family business and wealth to the closest male relative, while his wife Sylvia, daughter Adelaide, and mother Junietta are left with the family mansion, a yacht, and a small income. The central conflict arises from the differing visions of the three women for their future: Junietta sees this as an opportunity to escape their gilded lifestyle and for Adelaide to pursue love and her own passions, while Sylvia insists on maintaining their luxurious lifestyle by pushing Adelaide to marry a wealthy man. The plot thickens as secrets are revealed, threatening to either tear the family apart or bring them closer together.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are uniquely drawn and well-developed. Junietta and Sylvia, despite their opposing views on Adelaide's future, are portrayed sympathetically. Adelaide, caught in the middle of this tug-of-war, is a compelling protagonist. The author, Lynn Austin, avoids using a dual-time plotline and instead allows the characters to reveal their secrets organically, which adds depth to their development.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  The plot develops naturally, and the storytelling is engaging. The decision to have the characters reveal their secrets directly, rather than through flashbacks or a dual timeline, enhances the narrative's emotional impact.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The Christian message of God's forgiveness is a strong and recurring theme throughout the book.

Sin is not merely missing a target; it represents moving in the opposite direction of God’s holiness. True repentance requires a complete turnaround, not just a slight adjustment.  \n  - The recurring refrain “follow your heart” was another concern. While I assume the intention was to encourage Adelaide to reject societal pressures, this advice is unbiblical. Scripture teaches that the heart is deceitfully wicked, and we must follow God’s Word, even when it contradicts our feelings.  \n\n- **Author’s Track Record:**  \n  - I have always enjoyed Lynn Austin’s books, finding them both enthralling and biblically encouraging. However, I was extremely disappointed by the counter-biblical ideas expressed in this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *All My Secrets* is an engaging and relatable story, it falls short in its theological accuracy, particularly in its portrayal of sin and the advice to “follow your heart.” Despite my appreciation for Lynn Austin’s previous works, this book left me disappointed due to its departure from biblical principles.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Story: 5 stars  \n- Theological Accuracy: Lower due to concerns mentioned."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Captivation:**  \n   - The book was excellent and very captivating. I was hooked early on.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Clarity:**  \n   - The story is told by three different women: Junietta, her daughter-in-law Sylvia, and Adelaide, the daughter of Sylvia and granddaughter of Junietta. The storytelling worked well this way and did not get confusing.  \n\n- **Historical Setting and Themes:**  \n   - The story is set in the 1800s, going back to before the Civil War, with most of the book occurring in the late 1800s. It was an interesting time period, touching on the rise of industrialists and the wealthy class, as well as a bit of the women's suffrage movement.  \n\n- **Resolution and Ending:**  \n   - The big issues do get resolved, but without a tidy and neat wrap-up, which I appreciated. I knew things were going to be okay for everyone without having to have every detail spelled out.  \n\n- **Character Authenticity and Modern Sensibilities:**  \n   - At times, I wondered if the characters were more modern than their time period. There was a big emphasis on following your heart, which felt very modern and didn’t seem to fit the time period well, though it did fit within the story.  \n\n- **Preachy Moments:**  \n   - On a few rare occasions, one or two characters got a little preachy. It didn’t last long, and I agreed with what they said, so it didn’t really bother me.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - I listened to the audiobook and thought the narrator did a great job.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n   - Thank you to NetGalley and Recorded Books for my advance copy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an excellent and captivating book with a well-structured narrative and an engaging historical setting. While there were minor issues with character authenticity and occasional preachy moments, they did not detract significantly from the overall experience. The resolution was satisfying without being overly tidy, and the audiobook narration was excellent.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- This is really between a 4 and a 5 for me."

This shift was troubling, given the Biblical admonition that \"the heart is deceitful above all things.\" Additionally, the subtle undertones of feminism were unappealing; it would have been more uplifting to see Addy celebrated for wanting to be a wife and mother, particularly in light of the broken family narratives presented.

            "This novel presents a tri-POV narrative that traces three generations of Stanhope women during the Gilded Age, primarily set in the late 1890s, with engaging flashbacks to Junietta’s and Sylvia’s pasts. The flashbacks are the standout moments, adding depth and intrigue that surpass the present-day sections. In contrast, Sylvia’s perspective feels less impactful; her narrative could have been omitted without significantly affecting the story.",
            "In this story, Junietta, the matriarch, emerges as a compelling character who inspires her family to prioritize God's purposes over societal expectations. Sylvia, a recent widow, grapples with the challenge of preserving her wealth, though her contemporary perspective feels somewhat underdeveloped. Meanwhile, Adelaide is caught between her mother’s demands and her grandmother’s encouragement to pursue her dreams, making her a relatable and engaging character.",
            "The Gilded Age setting was expertly crafted and enjoyable, particularly after my recent visits to New York City and the Newport mansions, which allowed me to visualize the story more vividly.",
            "This novel thoughtfully examines the tension between societal expectations and personal desires, as well as themes of faith and generational influence. While I appreciated the portrayal of faith throughout the narrative, I found the recurring message of “follow your heart” somewhat misaligned with my beliefs, feeling more worldly than resonant."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*All My Secrets* is a thought-provoking novel with a rich Gilded Age setting and strong faith-based themes. While the flashbacks were more engaging and the narration style could have been more consistent, the exploration of generational dynamics and personal desires made for a compelling read. However, the recurring “follow your heart” message felt somewhat misaligned with the overall faith-driven narrative.",

            "In the beginning, Adelaide, the protagonist, comes across as flat, overshadowed by Sylvia and Junietta, who seem to think and act on her behalf. Her eventual growth and decisions were disappointing, as they fall into a familiar trope in Christian fiction that dismisses the significance of motherhood and wifeliness in favor of more \"glamorous\" ambitions. Although Junietta provides comic relief, her constant mantra of \"follow your heart\" feels shallow and contradicts biblical teachings, such as Jeremiah 17:9. The depiction of love and romance lacks depth, prioritizing self-fulfillment over authentic connection. Additionally, one character's illicit relationship, despite being acknowledged as wrong, is downplayed, which I found problematic.",
            "The book's central message advocates for following one's heart and pursuing personal desires, a stance that conflicts with a more grounded, faith-based perspective. While I support aspects of the suffragette movement, such as voting rights and protecting the vulnerable, I find it challenging to reconcile these themes with the broader feminist agenda often presented in Christian fiction. This felt like an agenda being pushed, which I found troubling.",

I was thoroughly engaged throughout, which is impressive considering my typically scattered attention span. The book left me 98% satisfied with the character development, showcasing the author's storytelling prowess.",

        "conclusion": "While *All My Secrets* showcases the author’s signature ability to craft engaging stories with strong spiritual undertones, it fell short in originality and thematic depth for me. The familiar tropes, underdeveloped romance, and heavy-handed messaging detracted from my overall enjoyment. That said, I still appreciate the author's heart for the Lord and their talent for storytelling, and I would encourage readers to explore other works by them, many of which are truly phenomenal.",

Additionally, while Junietta is seen nursing \"Artie\" at his bedside, it remains unclear whether they reconciled or how that part of her journey unfolded.",
            "In this story, Addy’s character feels underdeveloped, perhaps intentionally, to illustrate her lost identity amid life's expectations. Junietta continually encourages Addy to express her opinions and interests, underscoring this lack of depth. Additionally, the male Cinderella scene comes across as clichéd and awkwardly placed, especially after Junietta advises Addy on how to respect Howard should she marry him.",
            "I appreciated how the story weaves faith elements seamlessly without being preachy. The gospel is presented in an accessible manner, inviting further reflection and questions. However, I share the concerns of other readers regarding some counter-Biblical advice, such as \"follow your heart.\" I believe this language refers more to individual convictions, like Addy's sense of responsibility in how wealth is utilized.",

I appreciated the intertwining narratives of Junietta, Sylvia, and Addy, with Junietta resonating with me the most—even though I'm closer in age to Sylvia. This was my first experience reading a story from three perspectives, and I thoroughly enjoyed that narrative structure."

The narrative unfolds through a series of flashbacks that uncover family secrets, placing the three women at a pivotal crossroads where difficult choices arise. Central to the story is the conflict over whether the family should fight to preserve their mansion and lifestyle, even at a significant personal cost.

Overall, the alternating viewpoints of Adelaide, Sylvia, and Junietta offer a compelling exploration of their intertwined destinies.",

While I appreciated Sylvia’s story, her youthful romance felt unconvincing, lacking the depth needed to make it engaging. I also wished to see her return to painting, as this could have rounded out her character more effectively. \n\nAdelaide, on the other hand, was difficult to connect with. The author mentioned that she initially intended to tell the story solely from Adelaide’s perspective, and I can’t help but feel that this might have allowed for a deeper connection with her character.
