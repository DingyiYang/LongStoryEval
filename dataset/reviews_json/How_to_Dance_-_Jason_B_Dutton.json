This story features Nick, a paralyzed protagonist, marking a positive step in that direction. I appreciated the character development throughout the narrative.

I’m unsure if this happened to anyone else.  \n\n- **Romantic Content (Spice Level):**  \n   - Without having listened to Chapter 46, there’s a chapter where the characters go to what the kids call 2nd base.

            "The plot is frustrating, as characters consistently make poor decisions and neglect their issues until the very end. The writing misses the opportunity to highlight their problematic behaviors early on, making it hard to empathize with them or feel satisfied with their arcs. The resolution feels rushed and unconvincing, especially Nick's abrupt transformation and his \"reward\" of ending up with Hayley.",
            "The novel had the potential to be a groundbreaking inclusive romance featuring a protagonist with a disability, but it ultimately falls short due to the characters' toxic behaviors and lack of meaningful growth. The representation of disability is overshadowed by Nick's entitlement and anger, which detracts from a nuanced exploration of his experiences. The characters in *How to Dance* are largely unlikable, with nearly everyone exhibiting abhorrent behavior at some point. Nick's anger, which borders on incel behavior, stems not from his disability but from his belief that women reject him solely because of it, rather than acknowledging his toxic personality. Hayley faces criticism for emotionally cheating and justifying her actions, a frustrating trope in romance novels. Meanwhile, Kevin, her neglectful and judgmental boyfriend, creates the conditions for her emotional infidelity, driven by his own insecurities about Nick's disability. Although Nick shows some growth by the end of the book, it comes too late to redeem either the story or his character.",

            "The recurring theme of Nick's difficulty in accepting love, help, or advice comes across as overdone and self-inserted by the author. The third-act breakup and character growth follow a predictable formula, while the resolution lacks depth, as the characters fail to adequately address their issues.",

His tendency to mask his true self is both relatable and frustrating. As his anger becomes more pronounced towards the end, it makes him a more complex character, but also less likable. \n\nHaley is generally likable, but her reasons for leaving her previous job and moving to Ohio remain unclear. Her personal struggles feel underdeveloped, and dance seems to be her defining trait. Her flirtation with Nick while still in a relationship with Kevin raises concerns of emotional infidelity, despite the absence of physical involvement. Kevin comes across as a one-dimensional character, lacking depth. \n\nWhile Nick’s friends show promise, they feel underutilized, which is understandable given the challenge of fully developing 15+ years of friendship within the confines of a single book.",

            "While the book is marketed as a romance, I found the personal growth of Nick and Hayley to be even more compelling. Nick, who uses mobility aids due to cerebral palsy, grapples with insecurities about how his disability impacts his dating life. He compensates with bravado and seeks one-night stands until he meets Hayley. A talented dancer, Hayley is dealing with mental health issues from a toxic work environment. She moves to Ohio for a fresh start but finds herself worn down and struggling in her relationship with her boyfriend. \n\nThe deep friendship that develops between Nick and Hayley, rooted in mutual support, is heartwarming and enjoyable to read. Despite Hayley having a boyfriend, the deterioration of their relationship makes it easy to understand her growing feelings for Nick. Additionally, Rosie, the daughter of Nick’s childhood friends, is a delightful scene-stealer who adds a layer of sweetness to the narrative."

            "The story arc lacks urgency and central conflict, relying primarily on the main characters' internal struggles. While it offers a realistic take on the friends-to-lovers trope, some readers may desire more tension. The pacing is steady, emphasizing the gradual development of Nick and Hayley’s friendship and romance.",
            "Nick is a great listener, a loyal friend, and a charismatic karaoke singer, though he wrestles with a cynical outlook on life. He yearns to be recognized for who he truly is, rather than being defined by his cerebral palsy. On the other hand, Hayley is vivacious, dedicated, and expressive, yet she often feels overwhelmed trying to juggle her passions, relationships, and mental health.\n\nThe tentative friendship between Nick and Hayley blossoms as they support each other's growth. Nick grapples with his attraction to Hayley, fearing that his inability to dance might deter her. Meanwhile, Hayley's crumbling long-term relationship becomes a turning point, fostering her personal development and deepening her bond with Nick.\n\nWhile Hayley’s parents play significant roles in the narrative and Nick's best friend’s family is mentioned, there's a lack of exploration regarding Nick's own family, which feels like a missed opportunity.",

Nick discovers that dancing transcends mere physical movement, while Hayley learns that her worthiness of love is not contingent on constant activity. The narrative beautifully underscores the significance of relationships and the reciprocal nature that enriches our lives.",

Their initial meeting was awkward, but it ultimately led to a rewarding connection. Both genuinely sought to make each other happy and deepen their bond.

I acknowledge that people can love more than one person, but it felt like so much was missing when Nick and Hayley exchanged \"I love yous,\" considering Hayley was committed to another man throughout most of the story.  \n\n- **Narration (Audio Performance):**  \n  David Bendena delivered an outstanding audio performance with his smooth and engaging voice. As a female listener, connecting with a female character voiced by a male narrator can be challenging. I generally prefer a distinct narrator for each character, even if not through dual narration, as it enhances the overall listening experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book offers a strong representation of disability and relatable character struggles, particularly with Hayley's life transition. However, the romance felt underdeveloped, and the narration, while excellent, could have been improved with distinct voices for each character.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

Their personal growth and mutual support were standout elements of the story. However, I found the characters somewhat flat, as they appeared defined primarily by their conflicts—Hayley’s struggles with dancing and Nick’s challenges with cerebral palsy—rather than being fully developed individuals beyond these issues.",

            "I appreciated the refreshing perspective of a contemporary romance told through dual POV by a male author. A standout feature was the representation of disability, which introduced me to an area I knew little about. The author effectively conveyed the frustration of the male lead, Nick, at times. However, Hayley was difficult to understand and connect with; her character seemed overly consumed by her passion for dance, leaving little room for other dimensions. By the end of the book, she showed minimal growth or emotional awareness, making her feel one-dimensional. \n\nNick’s attraction to Hayley appeared superficial, largely based on her dancing rather than a deeper connection. His backstory, meant to explain his behavior, felt weak and inadequate, leading him to come off as a jerk focused on superficial dating concerns and generalizations about others' perceptions. Although I appreciated his friend's intervention, it would have been more impactful if it had occurred earlier for better character development.\n\nOverall, the romance lacked depth, failing to incorporate meaningful discussions or a genuine exploration of the characters as individuals. There was a distinct absence of angst, curiosity, or effective communication, rendering their relationship shallow and unengaging.",

Hayley, a key character, was in a committed relationship with someone else for most of the story, which left the romantic tension lacking and ultimately impacted my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had many strengths, including its representation of disability, engaging plot, and well-developed protagonist, the lack of a satisfying romantic subplot and Hayley’s existing relationship made it an okay read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

            "In this story, Nick, a character with cerebral palsy, is well-developed and undergoes a compelling emotional journey. His inner dialogue often veers into self-loathing, adding layers to his complexity. Meanwhile, Hayley, a dancer, is both sweet and relatable as she navigates the end of a long-term relationship while grappling with her burgeoning feelings for Nick. Their romance unfolds as a slow burn, characterized by pining, longing, and swooning, creating a heartfelt and emotionally resonant connection. However, I would have appreciated more intimate moments between them—perhaps something to explore in your next book. The narrative also benefits from strong friendships, particularly with the delightful Mel and an adorable child character, enriching the overall story.",

As someone with a close friend who has CP, I appreciated seeing this representation, as it’s not often featured in books. The disability representation was amazing and offered insightful commentary for able-bodied readers on how we treat, react, and respond to disabled individuals, and how these actions can be interpreted.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The main characters (MCs) helped each other navigate life and truly “got” one another. They never felt fully “seen” until they met each other, which added depth to their relationship and the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The book had a lot to say, and while it occasionally got a bit wordy, the themes of self-discovery, mutual understanding, and the importance of being seen for who you are were powerful and well-executed.  \n\n- **Personal Connection (Dance Theme):**  \n  As a dancer, I deeply connected with Hayley and her inherent need to dance. The book also explored the feeling of being consumed and burnt out by performing for others, rather than dancing for the joy of it and for oneself.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing was engaging, though it did get a little wordy at times.

He initially feels isolated and undervalued, but as he interacts with the dance show cast and learns the true reason he was hired (his inspiration as a math teacher, not his disability), he begins to feel a sense of belonging and acceptance.  \n\n- **Inspiration and Joy:**  \n  The story emphasizes that joy and inspiration are not confined to physical abilities. Hayley’s encouragement helps Nick understand that he can experience joy even if he cannot dance like a professional. The admiration and love he receives from his fellow cast mates further reinforce this message.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt exploration of self-discovery, friendship, and the power of joy. Nick’s journey from self-doubt to self-acceptance is both inspiring and relatable, and the relationships he forms along the way add depth to the narrative. The story beautifully conveys that true worth and happiness are not defined by physical limitations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was refreshing to see characters mess up, be emotional disasters, and then work hard to repair their connections with others and each other.  \n- **Romantic Development:** While the story leans into the \"friends to lovers\" trope, it uniquely explores the idea of \"we were never friends because we wanted to be lovers.\" The characters are careful and sweet with one another, striving to build a genuine friendship while understanding and caring for each other without crossing boundaries.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt and engaging read, blending humor, angst, and passion with relatable characters and a thoughtful exploration of relationships.

Dutton's work is superior to Waller's, even if it doesn't achieve the same level of mainstream success (e.g., a film adaptation).  \n\n- **Authenticity and Expertise:**  \n   - Dutton demonstrates a deep understanding of cerebral palsy and how it shapes the protagonist's life.  \n   - He also convincingly portrays the mindset and experiences of accomplished dancers.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The romance between Nick and Haley is well-written and has a lasting impact, exceeding initial expectations.  \n   - Secondary characters, while somewhat stereotypical (seemingly \"right out of Central Casting\"), are still believable and serve their purpose effectively.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The novel is set in the Midwest (Ohio), but it doesn't strongly cultivate a sense of place.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Resonance:**  \n   - The story is infused with hope, and Dutton excels at conveying this theme.  \n   - The novel is described as \"interesting\" and \"surprisingly wise,\" leaving a positive impression.  \n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n   - The reviewer expresses eagerness to read whatever Dutton writes next, indicating a high level of trust in his storytelling abilities.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJason B.

            "Nick is a compelling character who uses his disability as a shield to protect his heart, presenting himself as the fun-loving guy while shying away from deep connections. His relationship with Hayley evolves from an unconventional beginning into a genuine friendship, with both characters developing deeper feelings over time. However, their emotional bond forms while Hayley is still dating Kevin, creating a tension that feels like a slippery slope toward an emotional affair. Although there is no physical cheating, this aspect detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story. I was particularly eager to read about a hero with cerebral palsy, and the author skillfully infused Nick's character with real-life experiences, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.",
