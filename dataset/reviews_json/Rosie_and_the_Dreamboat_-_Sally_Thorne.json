This is likely why I hadn‚Äôt explored her other stories until now.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The main character is a bit of a unlucky person. She gifts her more successful sister an expensive wellness experience, but it backfires when she ends up trapped in a flotation tank‚Äîcompletely naked. The situation escalates when firefighters are called to rescue her, which is something no one would want to experience.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed this story, even though it was too short. The protagonist, Rosie, was very likable, and I could easily imagine myself in a similar situation. However, I doubt I‚Äôd be rescued by a sexy firefighter like she was.\n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n  The author should write more humorous books like this one because she truly excels at it. The humor was spot-on, and the story felt lighthearted and fun.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This story was super cute and left me with a warm, happy feeling after finishing it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis romantic short story was a delightful read. Despite its brevity, it was engaging, humorous, and relatable. Sally Thorne‚Äôs talent for crafting lighthearted, funny narratives shines through, and I hope she writes more stories like this in the future.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Leo, in particular, stood out as a refreshing change from the typical grumpy love interests, and his bubbly, cute personality added charm to the narrative.  \n- **Plot Development:** The plot was unusual, as Rosie and Leo couldn‚Äôt see each other for most of the story. While this created an interesting dynamic, the ending felt rushed, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n- **Length and Depth:** The story felt too short, and I wished it had been a full-length novel. This would have allowed for a more developed love story between Rosie and Leo, giving their relationship more depth and emotional resonance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its rushed ending and short length, the story was enjoyable due to the strong chemistry between the main characters and the refreshing portrayal of Leo as a love interest. However, the plot‚Äôs unusual structure and lack of depth left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Sally Thorne, however, pulls it off beautifully.  \n\n- **Plot and Circumstances:**  \n  The circumstances in the story are wackily entertaining, making it a delightful read.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characterization is exceptionally well done, especially considering the short length of the novella.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Banter:**  \n  The flirty banter is off the charts‚Äîit‚Äôs fun, quirky, and adds a lot of charm to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Appeal:**  \n  The novella is cute, fun, and highly bingeable. It‚Äôs the perfect Valentine‚Äôs read, with themes like #strangerstolovers, #firefighter, and #sisterbonds adding depth and relatability.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSally Thorne delivers a beautifully executed novella with strong characterization, witty dialogue, and an entertaining plot. It‚Äôs a fun, quirky, and binge-worthy story that perfectly captures the charm of a Valentine‚Äôs-themed read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their banter was fun to read and had me giggling, which is always a plus.  \n\n- **Romantic Development (Insta-Love):**  \n  This one was a little bit too insta-love for my taste, but that's just personal preference and not something negative about the book.  \n\n- **Series Comparison and Epilogue Preference:**  \n  Now that I've read two more books in this series, I think I've stumbled upon what made *Exception to the Rule* so good. So far, that has been the only book to give us some sort of epilogue, which shows the happily ever after. On the other hand, both this book and the previous book end with a first date (if that). Having that epilogue/HEA really elevated the reading experience for me because I don't have to sit there and wonder if this relationship will last.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Delivery:**  \n  I know I'm asking for more than what I was promised since I was only promised a meet-cute. But is it that hard to write 3-5 more pages that show me a happy ending?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun read with delightful character dynamics and humor. While the insta-love aspect wasn‚Äôt my favorite, it didn‚Äôt detract from the book‚Äôs charm. However, the lack of an epilogue or a clear happily ever after left me wanting more, especially compared to another book in the series that delivered a more satisfying conclusion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

He seems like a good match for Rosie, but only once she realizes her own self-worth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel has a charming premise and likable characters, particularly Leo. However, Rosie‚Äôs excessive self-deprecation and lack of self-love were somewhat frustrating. Her growth in this area felt incomplete, as it seemed tied to external validation rather than internal realization.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

Leo, the firefighter, emerges as a witty, charming, and calming presence, making their meet-cute both engaging and enjoyable. However, Bree, Rosie's sister, ultimately contributes to a challenging and unsettling situation for Rosie, which I found less appealing.",

The majority of the plot involves them talking without seeing each other, as they can‚Äôt unlock the device.  \n\n- **Humor and Dialogue:**  \n  The story definitely puts the comedy in romcom! There was some super funny dialogue between Leo and Rosie, which added a lot of charm to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development and Meet-Cute:**  \n  I liked their meet-cute, but I would have liked a bit more from this one. It felt a little rushed, and I wished for more depth in their interactions and relationship development.  \n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  I listened to the audiobook and thought Bailey Carr did a great job bringing the characters and story to life.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and humorous short story with a unique premise and entertaining dialogue.

It made it difficult to fully engage with the romance.  \n  - The story felt limited because the entire plot revolved around the flotation pod, creating a sense of monotony and lack of variety in scenes.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - The banter between Rosie and Leo felt forced, chaotic, and unnatural. The excessive use of baby talk gave off an uncomfortable dynamic that resembled a \"daddy + child\" vibe rather than a romantic connection.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a unique and creative setting for a meet-cute, the execution of the plot and character dynamics fell short.

While she does face some unfortunate situations‚Äîlike being naked and trapped‚Äîher misfortunes, such as a missing shirt button, losing her earrings during a spa day, and working at a plant shop, seem more like bad luck than a true hot mess persona. The meet-cute between Rosie and Leo, a charming firefighter, is engaging, but the ending feels rushed. After spending the entire book watching Rosie and Leo bond while she‚Äôs trapped, their reunion is abrupt. They share a brief hug and make plans for pizza, but the actual time they spend together is only about five pages. I would have appreciated a more developed conclusion to their story.",

Rosie's grandmother's prediction about her meeting her husband was confusing, and the choice of Leo's last name, Husband, didn't resonate well. Additionally, the scene where Bree helps Rosie shower and get dressed while Leo waits outside came across as overly clich√©, reminiscent of typical romantic comedies. While I appreciate the author's intent, it didn't translate effectively on the page.",

The author skillfully develops Rosie's character, particularly her deep love for her sister and the insecurities that arise from their relationship. Their bond is heartwarming; despite her sister's perceived perfection, they share laughter and joy, adding depth to their connection. \n\nThe chemistry between Leo and Rosie is delightful. Rosie's humor captivates Leo, and their interactions feel authentic, especially amid the heightened tension of their circumstances. It's clear they're destined to be together, and the anticipation builds beautifully while Rosie is trapped. Their reunion is charming, showcasing their \"hot dork\" personas, with memorable moments like Rosie playfully admitting she forgot to pee in the clam for him.",

Rosie gets stuck in a flotation tank and is rescued by Leo, a firefighter. The premise is cute and humorous, with elements of fate and strangers-to-lovers tropes. However, the plot felt underdeveloped due to the novella's short length (44 pages), and I wished it had been longer to explore the story more deeply.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Rosie is portrayed as insecure, often putting herself down and comparing herself to her sister, which I found a bit off-putting. Leo is sweet and funny, but some of his dialogue felt \"icky,\" and his firefighter team came across as immature. Despite these flaws, Leo's charm and humor stood out.  \n\n- **Writing Style and POV:**  \n  The book is written in a single POV (Rosie's), which limited the depth of Leo's character. I would have preferred a dual POV to better understand both protagonists. The writing was engaging and made me laugh, but the brevity of the story left me wanting more.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Books in the Series:**  \n  Out of the three novellas I've read in the Improbable Meet-Cute series, this was my least favorite. While it was cute and funny, it lacked the depth and charm of the previous installments.  \n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n  This was my first Sally Thorne book, and despite my mixed feelings about this novella, it piqued my interest in her work. I‚Äôm eager to explore her other books to see if they resonate with me more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Rosie & The Dreamboat* had its moments of humor and charm, it fell short compared to the other books in the series. The characters had potential, but the story felt rushed and underdeveloped due to its short length. Despite my lower rating, I remain excited to continue with the series and explore more of Sally Thorne's writing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5-3/5"

While it's a work of fiction, rom-coms should allow readers to relate and escape into a happy place, which requires a certain level of realism.  \n   - As a novella, the story didn‚Äôt have enough time to develop the characters deeply, making it harder to connect with them or fall in love with their journey.  \n\n- **Humor and Wit:**  \n   - The humor was a standout feature, particularly the recurring pickling references, which were clever and entertaining. Lines like, \"You like pickles? You'd like me right now,\" and, \"Is that the biggest pickle jar you've ever opened?\" were highlights.  \n   - There was a laugh-out-loud moment when Leo says, \"I'm getting the pearl out of this f*cker,\" which added to the book's charm.  \n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n   - This was my first Sally Thorne book, and while this novella didn‚Äôt fully meet my expectations, I‚Äôm hopeful her other works will be better. She‚Äôs on my 2024 summer reading list, and I‚Äôm looking forward to exploring more of her writing.  \n\n- **Reader Experience:**  \n   - Some readers loved this book, and I hope others have a similar positive experience. While it didn‚Äôt fully resonate with me, I can see why it might appeal to others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novella had its moments of humor and wit, particularly with the quirky pickling references, but it fell short in terms of believability and character development due to its shorter format. While it didn‚Äôt fully meet my expectations, I remain optimistic about Sally Thorne‚Äôs other works and look forward to reading more from her in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Their interactions are engaging and add depth to the story.  \n- **Character Development (Rosie):**  \n  Rosie‚Äôs self-deprecating nature at times felt excessive and brought down the mood of the book. This aspect of her character seemed unnecessary and detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n- **Plot Elements:**  \n  The car story and how Leo felt due to his colleagues' actions were plot points that negatively impacted the tone of the book.

This behavior felt unrealistic and disrupted the flow of the story.  \n- **Memorable Quotes:**  \n  My favorite quotes include:  \n  - \"Did you already have lunch, while you were locked inside that dystopian-nightmare pod?\" - Leo  \n  - \"I did make a sandwich in there, but I could still eat.\" - Rosie  \n  - \"Rosie, wake up.\" - Bree  \n  - \"I am awake.\" I am quite indignant for someone who was just asleep.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the dynamic between Rosie and Leo and found some of the dialogue memorable, certain aspects of the story, such as Rosie‚Äôs self-deprecation, the car story, and Bree‚Äôs behavior, detracted from my overall enjoyment.

The pacing kept me engaged enough to complete it in a couple of days.  \n\n- **Tone and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story had moments that were cute and endearing, but there were also parts that made me physically cringe. I found myself laughing out loud (LOL) at times, though it was more out of secondhand embarrassment for the characters than genuine humor.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The main character‚Äôs ‚ÄúRomeo‚Äù act was so over-the-top that I couldn‚Äôt help but question how he managed to get away with it for so long. It added a layer of absurdity to the story.  \n\n- **Medium-Specific Experience (Audiobook vs. Written):**  \n  I feel like the cringe-inducing moments might have been less pronounced if I had read the book instead of listening to the audiobook. The audio format seemed to amplify the awkwardness, whereas the written version might have come across as cuter or more charming.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story had its charming and amusing moments, the overall experience was marred by cringe-worthy scenes and secondhand embarrassment.

However, it also had several great and funny lines that made me giggle.  \n- **Plot/Storyline:** The storyline felt boring to me, though this might be due to the length of the book.  \n- **Character Dialogue:** Some lines stood out, such as:  \n  - *‚ÄúMay I have his full name and date of birth?‚Äù Leo asks sweetly. ‚ÄúI need to commit a murder, please.‚Äù*  \n  - *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here, with me, and I‚Äôll get you out like I wish I could have back then.‚Äù*  \n- **Commitment to the Series:** Despite my mixed feelings about this book, I‚Äôll definitely continue the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this installment didn‚Äôt resonate with me as much as others in the series, it still had its moments of humor and charm.

It was just okay, but the issues with character development and plot elements made it hard to fully enjoy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had potential but fell short due to its reliance on clich√©s and unrealistic romantic developments. While it wasn‚Äôt terrible, it didn‚Äôt leave a strong impression either.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations and Initial Impressions:**  \n   - I went into this anthology with medium expectations, as it included a mix of authors I‚Äôve previously read (Lauren, Thorne, and Jimenez), new authors I wanted to explore (Guillory and Poston), and authors completely new to me (Wilson).  \n\n- **Overall Rating and General Thoughts:**  \n   - As a short story collection, I would rate it 3 stars overall. Some stories were stronger and more engaging than others. I appreciated the little references and nods to the other stories, such as characters knowing each other, shared locations, and events. However, more than half of the stories tried to condense too much story and development into too few pages, which caused me to lose interest. This was disappointing, as the beginning of the collection was very promising.  \n\n- **Personal Ranking of the Stories:**  \n   - #1: *Worst Wingman Ever* by Abby Jimenez  \n   - #2: *Exception to the Rule* by Christina Lauren  \n   - #3: *With Any Luck* by Ashley Poston  \n   - #4: *Drop, Cover, and Hold On* by Jasmine Guillory  \n   - #5: *Royal Valentine* by Sariah Wilson  \n   - #6: *Rosie and the Dreamboat* by Sally Thorne  \n\n- **Critique of Specific Story (*Rosie and the Dreamboat*):**  \n   - This story was a letdown, earning only 2 stars. It started off well but quickly lost its charm. I‚Äôve read *The Hating Game* by the same author and didn‚Äôt enjoy it either, so I think Thorne‚Äôs writing style just isn‚Äôt for me. Her characters, especially Rosie and the ‚Äúdreamboat,‚Äù felt unnatural and caricature-like. The improbable circumstances of their meeting, which should have been adorable, came across as silly. While I don‚Äôt mind zany plotlines, the writing style, characterization, and execution of the plot fell flat for me. The ending, in particular, was eye-roll-worthy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe anthology had its highs and lows, with some stories shining while others fell short. The interconnected references were a nice touch, but the overall execution of many stories left me wanting more. While I enjoyed a few standout tales, others, like *Rosie and the Dreamboat*, were disappointing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall anthology: 3 stars  \n- *Rosie and the Dreamboat*: 2 stars"

The themes didn‚Äôt align with my expectations, and the writing style didn‚Äôt resonate with me. However, I acknowledge that Sally Thorne may have other works that are more enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5 stars."

It serves as a \"palate cleanser\" between genres, transitioning from historical fiction to fantasy romance.  \n- **Series Context:**  \n  This is the third book in a six-part \"meet cute\" series. The reader expresses interest in reading all six books, indicating some level of engagement with the series despite the book's shortcomings.  \n- **Length and Commitment:**  \n  The book is noted as \"super short,\" which makes it a low-commitment read. The reader feels that \"nothing [was] lost\" by reading it, implying it was a quick and easy experience.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The book is described as \"just ok,\" indicating a lukewarm reception. It didn‚Äôt stand out as particularly good or bad, earning it a 2.5-star rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was a light and quick read, it didn‚Äôt leave a strong impression. It served its purpose as a palate cleanser between genres, but the hokey tone and lack of depth made it merely average. The reader remains interested in continuing the series, suggesting some redeeming qualities or potential in the overarching story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars."

            "The progression of the relationship feels unrealistic, with the characters planning marriage after just a brief conversation. This is hard to believe. The male character's overprotectiveness seems unwarranted, especially given their limited acquaintance. Lines like \"Who did this to you?\" come off as forced and detract from the narrative. While the story's premise is unique and holds potential, the spa setting where the female character is locked in adds a humorous touch. The firefighter element is intriguing, but the dynamic between the characters often feels more like a father-child relationship, which is uncomfortable and off-putting.",

Phrases like \"Just wait until you see my sister,\" \"I'm a soaked rat,\" and \"You'll leave me for her once you see her\" feel repetitive and cringeworthy. The female protagonist embodies the traits of a typical \"pick me\" person, which makes her unlikable.",

It primarily revolves around a girl being locked in a sensory deprivation tank and a firefighter calming her down and staying with her until the tank is opened. There was no depth or complexity to the plot, leaving me underwhelmed and surprised by how abruptly it ended.\n\n- **Character Interaction and Dialogue:**  \n  The banter between characters was unremarkable and didn‚Äôt stand out. Interestingly, there was more engaging banter among the firefighters than between the main characters, which made the interactions feel flat and uninspired.\n\n- **Series Consistency:**  \n  This installment felt like a significant step down in quality compared to the earlier books in the series. It made me question whether the series is on a steady decline or if this was just an unusually weak entry.\n\n- **Engagement and Satisfaction:**  \n  The book failed to hold my interest or provide a satisfying experience. By the end, I was left thinking, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù It lacked the emotional or narrative impact I expected, and I wouldn‚Äôt associate it with anything as memorable as a Taylor Swift song.\n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  Despite the shortcomings of the story, the audiobook narration by Bailey Carr was enjoyable and well-done, earning a high rating in this aspect.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a disappointing addition to the series, with a weak plot, lackluster character interactions, and minimal engagement. While the audiobook narration was a highlight, the story itself fell short of expectations and left much to be desired.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n‚≠êÔ∏è = 2/5  \nüå∂Ô∏è = 0/5  \nüéß = 4/5 - Bailey Carr"

His character felt underdeveloped, which detracted from the emotional impact of their relationship.\n\n- **Romantic Connection:**  \n  The story leaned heavily into the trope of instant love connections. While this might appeal to readers who enjoy quick, intense romances, it felt rushed and somewhat unrealistic given the lack of character development for the MMC.\n\n- **Appeal to Specific Readers:**  \n  This book would likely resonate with readers who enjoy stories featuring men in uniform and instant love connections. The trope of a victim falling for their savior, combined with the FMC's trauma, adds a layer of emotional intensity that some readers might find compelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story had a cute concept and effectively explored the theme of a victim falling for their savior, the lack of depth in the MMC's character made the romantic connection feel rushed and less believable.

The introduction of a firefighter character added an appealing element to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dialogue:**  \n  Rosie and Leo's banter was cute, but it felt somewhat childish for characters in their late twenties. Their interactions didn‚Äôt fully resonate with me, and their maturity level seemed inconsistent with their age.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some interesting ideas, this book was a miss for me on multiple levels. Without giving away spoilers, I found it lacking in several areas that made the previous books enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some creative moments and an appealing setup, it ultimately didn‚Äôt live up to the expectations set by the first two books in the series. The childish banter and overall execution left me disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I liked the concept, the execution fell flat due to the unlikable and bizarre characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had an interesting concept that initially drew me in, but the characters were poorly developed and unrelatable. The FMC's insecurity and the MMC's odd behavior made it difficult to enjoy the story. Ultimately, the characters overshadowed the potential of the concept, leaving me disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (initially considered, but lowered due to the characters' negative impact on the story)."

The scenario feels contrived, and the execution lacks depth, making it difficult to fully engage with the plot.",

Leo, the fireman, is portrayed as unprofessional, using work time to flirt and complaining about his coworkers not taking him seriously. Bree abandons her sister, Rosie, in a potentially deadly situation to enjoy the spa, hoping Rosie will \"make the most\" of her time with a stranger. Rosie, who is reliving the trauma of being trapped in a car trunk during her college years, is portrayed as stressed and dehydrated, which is not an ideal state for forming romantic connections.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre Expectations:**  \n  The story leans heavily into the zany and silly tone typical of rom-coms, but it pushes the boundaries of believability. For instance, the claim that Rosie looks hotter after being in salt water for three hours while panicking feels unrealistic and undermines the emotional stakes of the scene.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement and Context:**  \n  The lack of context and minimal character development makes it difficult to bond with the characters. The scene feels isolated, and without a deeper understanding of the characters' backgrounds or relationships, the emotional impact is limited.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the story has potential, the execution falls short due to unrealistic character behavior, a lack of emotional depth, and an over-reliance on zany, rom-com tropes. The isolated nature of the scene and minimal context make it hard to connect with the characters or fully invest in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5 stars"

Her tendency to overshare her insecurities on the first date made her come across as inauthentic and desperate for validation.  \n  - The hero's primary conflict was his frustration with being admired solely for his physical appearance rather than his intelligence, which felt shallow and unrelatable.  \n\n- **Authenticity and Relatability:**  \n  - The characters' struggles and dialogues felt overly exaggerated and corny, making it difficult to connect with them or take their issues seriously.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The narrative tone came across as overly dramatic and clich√©d, detracting from the story's potential depth and emotional impact.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Hating Game* remains a beloved favorite, this novel fell short of expectations. The characters' exaggerated insecurities and shallow conflicts made the story feel corny and unrelatable, ultimately leading to disappointment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Oh Sally, they could never make me like your stories.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the ending had a sweet touch, the overall story was negatively impacted by Rosie's low self-esteem and the inclusion of baby talk. The novel fell short of the expectations set by the author's previous work, *The Hating Game*.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

One sister abandons Rosie to continue her spa treatment, leaving Rosie trapped in a sensory deprivation tank until the fire brigade rescues her. This shocking scenario is both frustrating and hard to digest. Rosie, the female main character, is deeply unlikable due to her extreme self-loathing and lack of self-esteem, which feels exaggerated and unrealistic. Additionally, the immature behavior of the fire brigade adds to the story's absurdity, making it difficult to take the narrative seriously."

The sister left Rosie to continue her treatment at the spa (to avoid causing a fuss) while Rosie was stuck in a sensory deprivation tank and had to be rescued by the fire brigade. This situation was shocking and frustrating to read.\n\n- **Main Character (Rosie):**  \n  Rosie, the female main character (FMC), is unbearable and has the lowest self-esteem I have ever seen. She constantly hates herself and all her choices, which makes her character unlikable. Her lack of self-confidence is extreme, to the point where it feels overdone and unrealistic.\n\n- **Secondhand Embarrassment:**  \n  The secondhand embarrassment I felt for Rosie was overwhelming. Her actions and the situations she found herself in were cringe-worthy and hard to read.\n\n- **Supporting Characters (Fire Brigade):**  \n  The immaturity of the fire brigade department was baffling. Their behavior and actions added to the overall absurdity of the story, making it hard to take seriously.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel was a frustrating read due to the unlikable main character, poor sisterly dynamics, and absurd situations involving immature supporting characters.
