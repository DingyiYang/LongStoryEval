        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Depth and Tone:**  \n   - The book is described as \"achingly tender,\" capturing both sweetness and pain.  \n   - The exploration of girlhood, motherhood, and growing up is beautifully nuanced.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Audrey, the protagonist, is portrayed with depth—she is anxious, perfectionistic, and yearns for her mother’s approval while grappling with self-loathing for that desire.  \n   - Camilla, Audrey’s mother, is not a one-dimensional character; she is complex and human, avoiding the trope of being an easy-to-hate, out-of-touch parent.  \n   - The evolution of the reader’s perspective on Camilla is highlighted, from initially rooting for Audrey to cut ties to understanding Camilla’s imperfections and humanity.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n   - The book delves into the realization that parents are imperfect people who make mistakes, a key part of coming of age.  \n   - It emphasizes that adulthood doesn’t bring perfection or all the answers, but rather involves muddling through and apologizing when necessary.  \n   - The exploration and celebration of the mother-daughter relationship is a standout theme, overshadowing the romance subplot.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n   - The story follows Audrey as she spends the summer on tour with her mother, navigating love, taking risks, and attempting to mend their strained relationship.  \n   - The 25th anniversary of her mother’s book, *Letters to My Someday Daughter*, serves as a backdrop for the narrative.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n   - While the romance is present and enjoyable, it is not the central focus of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis coming-of-age novel is a heartfelt exploration of girlhood, motherhood, and the complexities of growing up. Ellen O’Clover crafts deeply nuanced characters, particularly in Audrey and Camilla, and avoids simplistic portrayals of their relationship. The book’s emotional depth and celebration of the mother-daughter bond make it a standout, even as it includes a satisfying romance subplot.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars."

The plot skillfully builds tension as Audrey confronts the expectations placed upon her, culminating in a satisfying resolution. Although I initially anticipated a more prominent romance, I was pleased to find that it doesn't overshadow the narrative. Instead, it enhances the main themes and enriches the overall experience.",

However, her growth and the resolution of her arc are masterfully handled by the end, leading to a satisfying transformation.",

            "This book delves into themes of girlhood, mother-daughter relationships, and the struggle between societal expectations and self-discovery. It beautifully captures the grief and joy woven into these connections, making the emotional journey relatable. The exploration of anxiety and the challenge of releasing past versions of ourselves and others particularly resonated with me."

The author effectively portrays the complexities of their dynamic, but the unresolved tension left me unsatisfied. Audrey continually faces disappointment and fails to assert herself, missing the redemption arc I anticipated. Though the story is character-driven, the characters themselves lack depth. Audrey, her boyfriend, and Silas (the intern she is drawn to) all feel underdeveloped, resulting in a notable absence of chemistry in their interactions, which ultimately renders them flat."
