It stands out as well above average in terms of both writing and storytelling within its genre.  \n\n- **Author’s Perspective and Expertise:**  \n  Olivia Muenter, the author, hosts the *Bad on Paper* podcast and is an influencer herself. While the book explores the extreme end of influencer culture, it also highlights the pitfalls associated with the profession.  \n\n- **Personal Interest and Relevance:**  \n  I’m not particularly interested in influencer culture as a rule, but I respect it as a legitimate profession. I find trolling and hate-following distasteful, and this book addresses the impacts of such behaviors, as well as the accountability of influencers (or their stage parents) for their online fates.  \n\n- **Pacing and Thrill Factor:**  \n  The pacing of the book is excellent, and it includes several chilling moments that make it a worthy thriller (e.g., the creepy doll scene).  \n\n- **Ethical Exploration:**  \n  The book’s strongest aspect is its thoughtful exploration of the ethical debate surrounding parents monetizing their children online and the consequences when those children grow up and begin making their own decisions.  \n\n- **Tone and Accessibility:**  \n  While the book tackles serious issues, it remains fun and compelling, making it a great beach read that doesn’t lack substance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a surprising and engaging read that combines thrilling elements with a thoughtful examination of influencer culture, particularly the ethical dilemmas surrounding child influencers.

            "The first 40% of the book felt disengaging, as the story seemed to stall without progress. However, the transformative ending tied everything together beautifully, sparking a desire to re-read. The storytelling approach, characterized by deliberate information withholding and cliffhangers, may be polarizing—some readers will love it, while others may not.",
            "At first, I found the main character, Hazel, to be pretentious and self-righteous. However, her authentic portrayal as a 28-year-old grappling with her family's social media fame and her younger sibling's disappearance added significant depth. The older detective's dismissive attitude toward the younger generation felt genuine, underscoring generational insecurities. The cast is impressively diverse, featuring characters of mixed ethnicities, various skin tones, and a spectrum of LGBTQ+ identities, including lesbian and cisgender representation. Additionally, Hazel's choice to be childfree introduces another layer of representation.",
            "Set against the backdrop of Phoenix, Arizona, and parts of California, the story captures the essence of desert sunsets, McMansions, and true crime podcasts. Its reflective mood blends beige family photos, hard drives, and sponsored content, resulting in a distinctive aesthetic.",
            "This book offers incisive commentary on social media stardom, the challenges of growing up online, and the mental toll of influencer careers. It thoughtfully explores family dynamics, including unhinged mothers and complex sibling relationships, as well as the impact of generational trauma. The depiction of narcissistic parents, emotional incest, and the darker aspects of fame is particularly compelling.",
            "The first half of the book left me feeling disengaged, as Hazel's perspective overshadowed the narrative. However, the twisty, open-to-interpretation conclusion reignited my interest and made the earlier frustrations worthwhile. I appreciated the inclusion of a Spotify playlist at the end, though I wish it had been introduced earlier."

        "conclusion": "Despite a slow start and initial frustration with the main character and narrative style, the book’s transformative ending and rich thematic exploration made it a memorable read. The innovative use of mixed media and realistic portrayal of social media’s impact on mental health and family dynamics were standout elements. While the pacing and withholding of information may not appeal to everyone, the twisty conclusion and layered storytelling ultimately won me over.",

However, it's not the kind of book I'd usually buy, since it's a thriller and those aren't stories I tend to re-read.\n\n- **Acquisition and Value:**  \n  I had it on hold at my library, but when I got an unexpected $20 from my mom, I went to pick this up from a local HPB, and it was so worth it.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  I can't explain my love for a book with interstitial texts/podcast episodes/Reddit threads/etc. included, but it runs deep. I think I just really appreciate how it breaks up the chapters and pushes the story along in a different (and often quicker) way. This book was a good balance between regular prose and these extras.\n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I easily sat and read for hours (I finished this in two big stretches). It's a mystery/thriller that comes across as very, scarily real, and keeps you hooked until the very end.\n\n- **Relatability and Appeal:**  \n  I think anyone who is online (so... all of us) will be interested and invested in Hazel, Evie, and Erin's story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a thrilling and engaging read, with a unique narrative structure that kept me hooked.

            "The pacing of the story was inconsistent. The initial disappearance and drama unfold quickly, but the majority of the book drags on with little action until the end. By the 65% mark, I was eager for something to happen. However, the ending was exceptional—1000/10! While I would rate the book as a solid 3 overall, the conclusion deserves a 5. Kudos to the author for delivering such a shocking and satisfying finale, especially for a debut novel. This work leans more towards a slow-burn family drama with mystery elements rather than a suspenseful thriller, so readers expecting the latter may be disappointed. The influencer storyline, though often overused, felt fresh here. The author’s unique approach of focusing on an influencer who has been in the spotlight since childhood resonates with current trends of parents showcasing their children online. The narrative prompted me to reflect on our motivations for sharing online and the influencers we choose to follow, which I found thought-provoking.",
            "The novel is character-driven, and I found Evie, the influencer protagonist, to be a compelling figure. Her journey and the complexities of her fame from childhood were both intriguing and relatable.",
            "While the pacing had its flaws, I admired the author's skill in creating a compelling ending and addressing relevant themes. I look forward to reading more of her work in the future."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This was a fun, easy audiobook with a slow-burn family drama and mystery at its core. While the pacing was uneven, the full-cast narration kept me engaged, and the ending was absolutely worth the wait. The influencer storyline, though familiar, was given a fresh and thought-provoking twist. If you enjoy character-driven novels with shocking endings, this is worth a listen.",

The full-cast narration was really fun and helped me stay engaged, especially since the pacing was slow. Without the audio, I likely would have DNF’d the physical book.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n   - The pacing was all over the place. The disappearance and drama happen early on, and then the majority of the book felt slow, with little happening until the end. Around 65% in, I was begging for something to happen.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending was 1000/10! While the book as a whole was a hard 3 for me, the ending was a solid 5. Bravo to the author for crafting such a shocking and satisfying conclusion, especially for a debut novel.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - This is more of a slow-burn family drama with a mystery element than a suspense or thriller. If marketed as the latter, it might disappoint readers. The influencer storyline, while overdone, was refreshing here. The author took a unique spin by focusing on an influencer who has been famous since childhood, which felt timely and relevant given current trends of parents putting their children online. The story made me reflect on why we share what we do online and who we follow, which I found thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The novel is character-driven, and I enjoyed following the life of the influencer protagonist, Evie. Her journey and the dynamics of her fame since childhood were intriguing and relatable.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Potential:**  \n   - Despite the pacing issues, I appreciated the author’s ability to craft a compelling ending and explore relevant themes. I will certainly read more of her work in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a fun, easy audiobook with a slow-burn family drama and mystery at its core. While the pacing was uneven, the full-cast narration kept me engaged, and the ending was absolutely worth the wait. The influencer storyline, though familiar, was given a fresh and thought-provoking twist.

However, the middle portion (20-60%) felt slow and disorganized, which detracted from the overall experience. A tighter pace, more pronounced mystery elements, and a deeper development of Hazel's character could have elevated this book to one of the year's standout reads.",

This ambiguity was a persistent distraction throughout the book.

Despite some scattered and confusing writing (with entire sentences that didn’t make sense), the content felt incredibly important and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n   - Readers should approach this book as a commentary on social media rather than a mystery or thriller. While it had hints of both genres, it didn’t deliver the typical puzzle-piece ending or a trail of clues that one might expect from those genres.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending was a shocking reality check. While I hated it, I also recognized its necessity and impact.  \n\n- **Character Development (Hazel):**  \n   - Hazel’s character felt underdeveloped. Her relationship with Evie was inconsistent—one moment they seemed close, and the next, their bond felt uncertain. This ambiguity bothered me throughout the book. Additionally, the boyfriend house subplot felt unnecessary and uncomfortable. There were better ways to show Hazel’s flaws without resorting to that.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The middle section (20-60%) felt slow and jumbled, which detracted from the overall experience. If the pacing had been tighter, the mystery elements more pronounced, and Hazel’s character more fully developed, this could have been one of the most important and best reads of the year.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book left me with mixed feelings.

            "The novel centers on the disappearance of Evie, an 18-year-old social media influencer, and examines the aftermath through the eyes of her sister Hazel, her mother, the police, and her boyfriend. It effectively highlights the superficial and controlled nature of an influencer's life, revealing the pressures of living in the public eye. The plot introduces new suspects seamlessly and resolves all loose ends by the end. While the suspense was inconsistent throughout, the final 60 pages were gripping, keeping me awake late into the night. The buildup felt more like a mystery than a thriller, with tension escalating significantly as the story approached its conclusion.",

I loved her comfort in numbers and her tendency to over-analyze, which made her feel authentic.  \n   - Erin Davis, on the other hand, gave off strong Kris Jenner vibes, which I found off-putting.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The book delves deeply into the disturbing aspects of influencer culture, making me reflect on its darker side. Moments like Evie’s comment about earning $50,000 for a teeth-whitening ad (which is nearly my yearly salary as a teacher) and Erin’s podcast remark about selling bidets alongside stories of murder and rape were uncomfortably accurate.  \n   - The portrayal of children on social media and the exploitation involved was horrifying, especially in Evie’s case. However, the ending made me question my initial sympathy for her.  \n\n- **Quotes and Insights:**  \n   - One quote stood out to me: “Have you used your face, your body, your interests, your humor to convey who you are, what you like, what you want? Have you posted an affiliate link or clicked on one? Have you simply realized that people feel safer with the doctors, designers, writers, accountants that they can find online and know immediately? A dentist who you know nothing about: sketchy. A dentist with a golden retriever named Stanley: charming, trustworthy. Appointment booked.” This resonated deeply, highlighting how social media shapes perceptions and trust.  \n\n- **Personal Reflection:**  \n   - The book made me question my own relationship with social media. As an artist, I rely on it for visibility, but it also raises the question: How far is too far?  \n   - I also found humor in my typo: “I hate sociopaths” instead of “social media,” but it’s oddly fitting in a way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a thought-provoking and unsettling thriller that effectively critiques influencer culture. While it had its frustrating moments (especially the ending), it was well-written and engaging, with strong characters and a unique narrative style.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n  - I love thrillers and mysteries, and this book fits perfectly into that category. It’s a slow-burn family drama that makes you reflect on your own family dynamics, thinking, “Maybe my family isn’t that kooky after all.”  \n  - The book offers a really great commentary on the world of family vloggers and child influencers, which I found thought-provoking and relevant.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  - The podcast portion of the story was hilarious, and I could easily identify the real-life podcast it was based on (it rhymes with “shmorbid”).  \n  - However, I felt the ending didn’t quite align with the rest of the book. It left me questioning its coherence and how it tied into the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters were dynamic and interesting, adding depth to the story. Their interactions felt current and real, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Writing and Editing:**  \n  - The book could have benefited from a few more rounds of thoughtful and eagle-eyed editing. While it was entertaining, some parts felt like they needed polishing.  \n\n- **Unique Features:**  \n  - I absolutely loved the playlist at the end of the book. It was a creative and fun addition that enhanced my reading experience.  \n\n- **Spoiler Thought/Question:**  \n  - If ***** was the SABI writer the entire time with 20,000+ paid subscribers, why did she complain throughout the book about being poor, having no money, and living in a terrible apartment? Where did all that money go? This inconsistency left me puzzled.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a few critiques about the ending and editing, this was a highly entertaining book with a unique and thought-provoking premise. The dynamic characters and current, real-world themes made it a compelling read. The playlist at the end was a delightful touch that I truly enjoyed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

Its abruptness and lack of explanation enhance its impact, prompting intriguing questions about the characters' motivations and relationships. I particularly appreciate the realism of the conclusion, which avoids a simplistic resolution for Evie. This story unfolds as a slow-burn family drama infused with suspense, rather than a fast-paced thriller. The deliberate pacing builds tension and unease, creating a pervasive sense of foreboding. While some readers may be put off by the slower tempo and lower stakes, the simmering tension and emotional depth are essential to the narrative.",

These dynamics add depth to the characters but also highlight their flaws.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel explores the impact of living life for online validation, examining how the pursuit of likes and engagement from strangers might have contributed to Evie's disappearance. It critiques the exploitation of children for public consumption and the emotional toll it takes on families.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  The story is told through multiple formats, including Hazel's perspective, online message boards, and a podcast transcript. While this approach adds variety, it can feel disjointed and confusing at times, particularly when explaining the events surrounding Evie's disappearance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel presents an intriguing mystery with a thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of living life in the public eye. While the plot can be confusing and the characters are flawed, the twist at the end and the social commentary make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The mystery began with great promise, but the pacing ultimately felt uneven and awkward. The big reveal was disappointing and anticlimactic, leaving the ending feeling rushed and abrupt—I even questioned whether I had accidentally skipped chapters. However, I appreciated the unique format that intertwined the main narrative with intermissions of social media posts. The audiobook version was particularly well-executed, featuring different voice actors reading comments from a r/blogsnark-style forum, which added depth and variety to the experience. The social media segments effectively conveyed the author's themes without resorting to unnatural expository dialogue from the characters.",

The narrative offers insightful commentary on influencer culture and the commodification of youth through platforms like Instagram and TikTok. While these themes may not be groundbreaking for those well-versed in online culture, they could provoke thought for less digitally engaged readers."

            "Every character in the book is flawed, yet their imperfections are relatable, making the injustices they endure feel personal. There are no clear heroes, and it’s often difficult to determine who is the worst among them—whether it’s the overbearing momager, the lovestruck cop, the distant sister, the obnoxious boyfriend, the former best friend, or the faceless internet at large.",

It examines how well-intentioned actions can sometimes overreach and become harmful, prompting readers to consider the possibility of achieving balance and the nature of change. Additionally, it underscores the lack of legal protections for underage children working online, drawing parallels to the minimal safeguards present in Hollywood and the influencer industry."

The use of podcast transcripts, Reddit posts, and other media enriches the storyline and adds a contemporary, engaging dimension. Though the pacing is slow for much of the novel, the action intensifies in the final 100 pages.",
            "The characters are exceptional—fully developed and authentically real, each with their own quirks and flaws. The narrator, Hazel, is relatable in her struggles, while the manipulative mother adds depth to the family dynamic. Evie, the missing influencer, is depicted with genuine complexity, enhancing the authenticity of the family drama.",
            "This book offers a sharp critique of social media, delving into themes of dependence, ownership, autonomy, and privacy rights. It also highlights the darker sides of influencer culture, including trolling, gaslighting, and the erosion of personal boundaries. These thought-provoking themes make it an ideal selection for book clubs, sparking meaningful discussions.",
            "While the book unfolds at a slower pace, it remains both thought-provoking and entertaining, featuring intricately layered plot twists and unexpected turns. The dysfunctional family dynamic and well-developed characters maintain engagement, even if it falls short of typical thriller standards. Additionally, the author skillfully weaves humor throughout, providing a welcome levity to the darker themes.",
            "While marketed as a thriller, the book falls short of the genre's hallmark propulsive writing and pervasive tension. Its slow burn and minimal action may disappoint readers seeking a fast-paced, high-stakes experience. Additionally, the big reveal and conclusion come across as anticlimactic, ultimately diminishing overall satisfaction."

While it may not deliver the thrills expected from its marketing, it excels as a family drama and mystery with a modern twist. The slow pacing and anticlimactic ending may not appeal to all readers, but those who enjoy character-driven stories with deeper themes will find much to appreciate.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n  The novel read more like a family drama rather than a thriller or mystery, which was disappointing given the expectations set by its categorization.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The pacing was too slow, and the story lacked the tension and thrill expected in a thriller. The audiobook's 13-hour runtime felt excessive, with much of the content being repetitive.  \n\n- **Editing and Repetition:**  \n  The book could have benefited from another round of edits. A significant portion of the narrative was overly repetitive, particularly the critique of mommy influencers, which was hammered home excessively.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was a standout, deserving of a 5-star rating. It was well-executed and satisfying, contrasting sharply with the rest of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a strong and compelling ending, the overall experience was marred by slow pacing, excessive repetition, and a mismatch between the expected genre and the actual content. The book would have been more enjoyable with tighter editing and a better balance of tension throughout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Ending: 5 stars  \n- Overall: Lower than expected due to pacing and repetition."

            "The epilogue left me bewildered. I was hoping to finally understand the cult's purpose, but instead, I was met with confusion. Was Evie framing Hazel as the SABI writer, or was Hazel genuinely the author? Hazel's narration of SABI contradicts the idea that she could have written it, especially since she repeatedly emphasized that it was \"in Evie’s voice\" and had reacted to the Ashlyn accusations. Are we to believe that Hazel, who seemed reliable from the start, is suddenly an unreliable narrator? What motivation does Evie have for setting her sister up like this? Is it meant to show that Evie remains as calculating as ever? If so, the setup is excessively elaborate—prewriting a note to her sister, waiting for her to write, sell, and publish a book over two years? Even Amy Dunne didn’t take that long to manipulate Nick! The ending felt disjointed, even if it coincided with the recent 7m docuseries, which is uncanny. The cult aspect and the ReBrand twist left me confused and unsatisfied. It simply didn’t make sense.",
            "The choice of the last name Davis seems intentional, especially considering Taza's departure from the internet and her role as a prime example of monetizing children for content. I found the mystery intriguing, and the mother character was chilling; I would have appreciated more exploration of her character.",

            "The pacing of the story was uneven, with an engaging first half that lost momentum in the second. The plot felt rushed, particularly with Hazel and Evie's reunion occurring too late for a satisfying conclusion. The initial 45% of the book was gripping, especially the mystery surrounding Evie's disappearance. However, the latter half shifted from a mystery thriller to a family drama, which was disappointing. The thriller elements diminished, leaving the story feeling rushed and incomplete. The resolution, where Evie returns after two years and accuses Hazel of being a bad influence, felt abrupt and unsatisfying.",
            "Hazel, the protagonist, serves as an unreliable narrator, adding depth and intrigue to the story. Her clouded judgment often skews her motivations and actions, making them more suspicious. Both Hazel and Evie lack moral clarity, which isn't necessarily a flaw. Evie's selfishness and Hazel's overbearing nature render them more relatable. While Evie's choices—like faking her disappearance and getting a teacher fired—are reprehensible, they also enrich her character, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.",

The thriller elements were minimal, and the story felt rushed and incomplete.  \n   - The resolution, where Evie returns after two years and accuses Hazel of being \"Such A Bad Influence,\" felt abrupt and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The pacing was uneven, with the first half being engaging and the second half losing momentum.  \n   - The plot felt rushed, especially with Hazel and Evie only reuniting near the end, leaving little time for a satisfying conclusion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book starts strong with an intriguing exploration of influencer culture and a compelling mystery, it ultimately falls short in the latter half, shifting focus to family drama and losing its thriller elements. Olivia Muenter's writing style and authentic portrayal of social media are highlights, but the uneven pacing and unsatisfying resolution detract from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5/5 stars, rounded up."

            "The ending felt abrupt and unsatisfying, particularly regarding Evelyn's mysterious disappearance and the resolution that followed. The revelation that SABI is actually Hazel seemed implausible, especially considering Hazel's disdain for social media and her deep love for her sister. It would have made more sense for their mother to be SABI, given her jealousy and waning influencer status. Additionally, Evelyn's choice to falsely accuse Hazel of being SABI on national television highlights the disturbing impact social media has had on her mental health and moral compass.",
            "Hazel’s perspective highlights their mother’s abusive and manipulative nature, particularly in how she groomed Evelyn to become an influencer. The sisterly bond between Hazel and Evelyn feels genuine and relatable, especially for those with older sisters. However, Hazel’s insistence that she knows her sister completely becomes frustrating, as it seems unrealistic given that she has been living in New York since college, and teenagers naturally change and evolve.",
            "The novel delves into the dark side of social media and the exploitation of minors within influencer culture. The mother’s obsession with documenting Evelyn’s life, including unsettling interactions with strangers, underscores the perils of overexposure. While the themes of grooming and coercing children into influencer roles are compelling, the link to Evelyn’s disappearance feels somewhat tangential and underdeveloped.",

While the novel was well-crafted leading up to the reveal, the ending left me unsatisfied. The mystery surrounding SABI’s identity was intriguing, yet the resolution felt forced and inconsistent with Hazel’s character. Additionally, the mother’s surveillance of Evelyn’s life added an unsettling layer of creepiness, but this thread was not fully explored or resolved."

While the initial chapters were slow and somewhat unengaging, Hazel's background information proved essential. However, the story became less realistic and more fantastical once it transitioned to the ReBrand setting. The plot's twists, turns, and dead ends were intriguing and kept me engaged. Unfortunately, the ending fell short, leaving key questions unresolved and resulting in a sense of dissatisfaction. The ambiguity surrounding whether Hazel or Evie was SABI needed clearer resolution to fully wrap up the plot. On a positive note, the use of various communication methods added depth and a modern touch to the storytelling. The unreliable narrator aspect, particularly with the SABI reveal, left me questioning the entire narrative.",

            "The ending of the story is open to interpretation, eliciting mixed reactions from readers—some found it sweet, while others perceived it as creepy or vindictive. I'm still processing the final scene and haven't fully grasped the author's intended message. The inclusion of Reddit comments and podcast episodes added a modern touch, grounding the narrative in reality. However, I found the podcast segments somewhat annoying due to their minimal impact on the plot, though I appreciated the creative choice to vary the structure and reflect the public scrutiny surrounding Evie's life. The story is primarily conveyed through Hazel's memories, which made it feel somewhat one-dimensional. Additionally, the pacing was inconsistent; some sections dragged, while the ending felt rushed and lacked adequate exposition. The twist at the end was inventive but came across as a jarring shift rather than a clever red herring.",
            "Hazel, the protagonist, lacked depth and failed to engage me. The supporting characters were similarly underdeveloped; they were introduced, had one significant scene, and then faded from the narrative. Interestingly, the podcast characters, though not central to the plot, exhibited more personality than the main characters, highlighting both a strength and a weakness in the storytelling.",

The author skillfully examines the exploitative nature of the influencer industry, revealing how it commodifies pain and erodes privacy. This timely theme addresses a contemporary societal issue that remains largely unexamined in literature."

The attempt at social commentary and the inclusion of random elements like cults and influencer references felt disjointed. The parody-like ending, which seemed to reference Jeanette McCurdy’s memoir, further detracted from the story. Overall, it didn’t meet my expectations as a thriller and left me disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5, maybe 3."

However, Erin was excellently written—she had complexity and was by far the most interesting character in the novel.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the plot idea was good, the pacing was slow and drawn out for the majority of the book. There was too much description and internal monologue from Hazel, which made the story feel sluggish. The action only picked up in the final third of the book, but even then, it felt like there was too much \"tell\" and not enough \"show\" in the final act.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had potential with its plot and Erin’s character, but the flat writing style, unlikable characters, and uneven pacing made it a less enjoyable read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5-3/5"

            "The story would have been stronger if it focused less on Hazel's criticisms and more on Evie's experiences during her disappearance. I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of how one navigates identity after living with a crafted digital persona. However, the ending was rewarding, as noted in other reviews, which prevented me from marking it as a DNF (Did Not Finish). The book could have easily been 100 pages shorter without sacrificing its core message. The pacing lagged, especially due to Hazel's repetitive critiques of her mother, which became tiresome early on.",
            "Hazel, the protagonist, comes across as excessively self-righteous, which can be quite irritating. Her repetitive characterization and the background setting led me to skim through certain sections of the book.",

Unfortunately, it may have suffered because of those expectations.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The book felt a little boring at times, with not much happening throughout the story. The pacing was slow, and the plot lacked the excitement I was hoping for.  \n\n- **Twist/Reveal:**  \n  The twist or reveal at the end left me confused and underwhelmed.

Not much growth was evident.  \n- **Plot and Expectations:**  \n  I was kinda hoping for more out of it. It would have been better if Evie was actually kidnapped.

The predictable ending, however, was not a major issue for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The novel explores the impact of constant online exposure and the monetization of a child's social media presence.  \n  - It delves into the subculture of podcasts and Reddit threads, where people analyze and judge social media posts.  \n  - The story takes an unexpected, jaw-dropping turn with a disturbing ending.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - The key characters—Hazel, Evie, and their mother—lack the nuance found in similar novels, such as *Allow Me to Introduce Myself*.  \n  - Hazel is portrayed as desperate to find her missing sister, Evie, who is a mega-influencer.  \n  - Evie reassures Hazel that she is happy, but her sudden disappearance raises questions about her mental state or potential sinister motives.  \n\n- **Relevance and Social Commentary:**  \n  - The novel reflects on the consequences of growing up in the social media spotlight, particularly for the first generation of \"Instagram kids.\"  \n  - It highlights the ethical concerns of parents exploiting their children's online presence for financial gain.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Such a Bad Influence* is a thought-provoking novel that tackles the dark side of social media fame and its impact on family dynamics. While the plot takes an unexpected and disturbing turn, the characterizations lack depth compared to similar stories. The book effectively critiques the culture of online exploitation and raises important questions about consent and the long-term effects of growing up in the public eye.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She came across as unintelligent and lacked depth, resembling a \"dumbed-down version of a protagonist.\"  \n   - The boyfriend was the only character who seemed invested in finding the missing influencer, which felt unrealistic and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Editing and Quality:**  \n   - The book contained numerous errors, suggesting a lack of proper editing or proofreading.  \n   - The overall quality of the writing was disappointing, contributing to the book's lack of coherence.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n   - The book was described as \"weird\" and nonsensical, leaving the reader frustrated and confused.  \n   - Despite being the author's first book, the lack of polish and coherence made it difficult to enjoy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a frustrating read due to its disjointed plot, poorly developed characters, and numerous errors.

The so-called mystery was resolved less than halfway through, and the story lacked the dramatic tension I anticipated.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Hazel, the narrator, is insufferable and whiny, constantly complaining about her life and her mother’s favoritism toward her sister, Evie. Evie, though slightly less annoying, is also unlikable.

Her actions and motivations often felt exaggerated and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot was underwhelming. Hazel’s search for her missing sister, Evie, was far less intense than the book’s summary suggested. Instead of a dramatic descent into danger, she mostly interacted with kind influencers, making the story feel flat.  \n   - The ending was as boring as the rest of the book, with a twist that felt stupid and undeserved.  \n\n- **Writing and Themes:**  \n   - The sinister motives of the characters were well-written. Hazel’s seemingly innocent facade hid her manipulative tendencies, and Erin, the mother, was portrayed as a calculated and untrustworthy figure. These layers added some depth to the story.  \n   - The exploration of social media culture and its impact on the characters’ lives was intriguing, but it wasn’t enough to save the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The book failed to meet my expectations in terms of genre, plot, and character engagement. While there were some well-executed elements, they weren’t enough to make up for the lackluster story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell short of its potential.

            "The book is slow and repetitive, especially in the first 275 pages, where the narrator reiterates her points about her relationship with Evie, their mother, and Internet culture. While the suspense surrounding Evie's fate kept me engaged, the resolution arrived too late, resulting in uneven pacing. The ending, which sparked some controversy, required reflection. It revealed Evie's strategic nature and her ability to manipulate her family and social media for personal gain, ultimately prioritizing her financial interests. The 55% cut of the book's profits marked just the beginning of Evie's calculated ascent in her new online presence.",

While the mother character flirts with being a trope, she still exhibits some complexity. Notably, Evie emerges as more calculating and self-aware than her family realizes, leveraging her life experiences to orchestrate a comeback that serves her interests alone.",

While it briefly touches on life without social media, this aspect feels superficial and lacks depth. The exploration of influencers and the ethics of profiting from social media is compelling but could benefit from a more thorough examination."

            "The story felt unnecessarily stretched, as if a 40,000-word narrative had been expanded to 80,000 words. The main plot progressed sluggishly, hindered by frequent flashbacks that only tangentially related to the present timeline. These flashbacks focused too heavily on Evie's social media persona rather than her personal life, diminishing their impact. The introduction of ReBrand and Charlie felt abrupt, steering the story in a vague and less compelling direction. The indecision about Evie's feelings regarding her situation failed to engage me, as I found it hard to care about the characters or their journey. The ending aimed for a shocking twist, but it left me uncertain about whether I was meant to root for Evie, given her questionable actions. The moral—that a flawed social media influencer could emerge as a hero—felt neither satisfying nor uplifting. While Hazel facing consequences for her actions was a positive note, it wasn't enough to redeem the overall narrative.",
            "I found it difficult to empathize with Evie, which diminished my investment in her fate. None of the characters were particularly likable or relatable; they all felt shallow in their own ways. Evie unjustly got a teacher fired, her mother squandered her earnings, Hazel enabled their mother, and the boyfriend prioritized appearances over Evie."

I kept reading only because I wanted to know how it ended, but the pacing didn’t improve much.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  The plot felt anticlimactic and confusing. I guessed early on that Evie had left voluntarily, which made the story predictable and uninteresting. The cult aspect was poorly explained, especially the \"tiers,\" which made no sense. The ending was bizarre and felt out of left field—Hazel, who constantly complained about being broke, was suddenly revealed as the mastermind behind a successful newsletter, and her sister called her out on TV. It didn’t feel believable or satisfying.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  There was no resolution regarding Evie’s relationship with her mom—it was just mentioned that Evie stopped talking to her. This lack of closure left the character dynamics feeling incomplete.  \n\n- **Editing and Quality:**  \n  The book had noticeable typos, and at one point, the author mixed up the names Hazel and Evie, making the sentence confusing. I don’t understand how such errors weren’t caught during the editing process.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the book intrigued me, the execution fell flat. The story was boring, confusing, and anticlimactic, with poor pacing, unresolved plot points, and editing issues.

I couldn’t tell whether the sister was supposed to be the bad influence or which way it was going.

            "The story comes across as overly simple and straightforward, which undermines its effectiveness as a thriller. Key elements are introduced too late, creating a sense of disconnection from the narrative. Plot points that initially seem significant ultimately fizzle out without leaving a lasting impact. The reveals lack the necessary buildup, resulting in confusion rather than shock.",

The plot lacked the complexity and pacing needed to keep me engaged, the characters felt underdeveloped, and the reveals failed to land with the intended impact.

            "The novel primarily revolves around familial melodrama, which overshadows the narrative for most of the book. Genuine mystery and intrigue are largely absent until the final quarter, resulting in uneven pacing that only gains momentum in the last 50 pages. The concluding paragraphs are bizarre and confusing, feeling out of place and detracting from the overall experience. This abrupt and disjointed ending diminished what could have been a moderately enjoyable read."

        "conclusion": "While the novel has moments of potential, particularly in its exploration of familial dynamics, the lack of a compelling mystery for most of the story and the jarring, confusing ending significantly detracted from my enjoyment. The rushed pacing in the final section further weakened the overall experience.",
