            "The synopsis captured my attention, even though I was unaware that this book is part of a trilogy. The story centers on a long-married couple whose relationship is not built on love. The husband confesses that he chose to marry her because he loved her, yet her father has been manipulating their relationship due to past events that tarnished his own reputation. Faced with the truth, the husband gives his wife an ultimatum: either trust him and commit to making their marriage work or opt for a divorce.",
            "I typically enjoy arranged marriage stories, but this one fell short for me. I found it unfair that the wife had to suffer due to her father's manipulation, bearing the weight of his actions.",
            "I found the story enjoyable and entertaining, though it wasn't among the best books I've read. It was merely okay‚Äînot bad, but also not remarkable."

The story revolves around a couple who have been married for a long time, but their marriage wasn‚Äôt based on love. The husband reveals that he was in love with her and chose her exclusively, which is why he accepted the marriage. However, the wife‚Äôs father has been manipulating their relationship because he couldn‚Äôt stand the idea of his daughter marrying him due to past events that damaged his credibility. The husband decides to reveal the truth about her father‚Äôs actions and gives her an ultimatum: believe him and give their marriage a real chance or divorce.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I usually enjoy arranged marriage stories, but in this case, I didn‚Äôt like how the wife suffered because of her father‚Äôs manipulation. It felt unfair that she had to bear the consequences of his actions.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  I enjoyed reading the story, and it managed to entertain me. However, it wasn‚Äôt the best book I‚Äôve read, nor did I love it. It was just okay‚Äînot bad, but not outstanding either.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an engaging premise and kept me entertained, the unfair suffering of the female protagonist due to her father‚Äôs manipulation left me somewhat dissatisfied.

            "The author expertly brings the story full circle in Book 3, showcasing her talent for redeeming even the most flawed characters by the end. Many characters in her novels have the opportunity to evolve from antagonist to protagonist, and I appreciate her willingness to offer second chances, especially to those who have played the villain. This is exemplified by Dante, Scarlett's father, who ultimately confronts his past mistakes, confessing his lies and manipulations. His moment of reckoning catalyzes Scarlett's growth and maturity, transforming her into the woman Axel loves and the person she was meant to be. \n\nAxel quickly became my new book boyfriend. His captivating blend of physical and emotional traits is irresistible. He embodies a compelling mix of sexual prowess, possessiveness, consideration, and humor, making him a genuinely appealing character. The tension between Axel and Scarlett throughout this trilogy is electrifying. In Book 3, Scarlett makes significant progress, and while she was occasionally frustrating, her reactions were understandable given her circumstances. Their love story is a true tale of star-crossed lovers, where they are only whole when together. \n\nI also enjoyed Theo‚Äôs character and eagerly await his story. He reminds me of Bartholomew from another trilogy, as both exhibit admirable qualities as leaders within the Skull Kings, operating with their own brand of ethics despite their criminal backgrounds.",

Dante finally had his day of reckoning.  \n\n- **Main Characters (Scarlett and Axel):**  \n   - The results of Dante‚Äôs confession were the MFC‚Äôs (Scarlett‚Äôs) growth and maturity from that point on in this story. She not only became the woman that Axel loved but also the woman she was meant to be.  \n   - Axel is my new book boyfriend. I loved his character and the combination of his physical and emotional traits. He had it all and knew how to use the entire package.  \n   - Axel was a genuine character who possessed strong sexual prowess, was possessive, considerate, loving, tough, smart, and had a nice touch of humor.  \n   - The angst Axel and Scarlett experienced in this trilogy was explosive.  \n   - Scarlett made so much headway in book 3 that I really applauded her character. She had been frustrating at times in this trilogy, but considering the information she had to work with, it was understandable.  \n   - Scarlett and Axel‚Äôs love story was one of star-crossed lovers who were only complete when they were together.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Future Stories:**  \n   - I loved Theo‚Äôs character and look forward to his story. His character reminds me of Bartholomew‚Äôs character in his trilogy.  \n   - Both were leaders of different facets of the Skull Kings and had admirable qualities in how they did business‚Äîcriminals with their own set of ethics.  \n\n- **Emotional Resonance and Symbolism:**  \n   - The song by Lady Gaga from *A Star is Born*, \"Always Remember Us This Way,\" seemed an appropriate song to represent Axel and Scarlett‚Äôs love story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis trilogy was an emotionally gripping and satisfying read, with well-developed characters, a compelling love story, and themes of redemption and growth. Penelope Sky masterfully tied the story together, leaving me eager for more of her work, particularly Theo‚Äôs upcoming story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While he remains as cocky as ever, it's a trait that becomes endearing over time. This book showcases significant development, not just in relationships but also in personal growth. Scarlett and Dante's dynamic resonated with me, echoing my own relationship with my father‚Äîconstantly seeking approval and wanting to make him proud. I deeply empathized with Scarlett's heartache when she didn't receive the validation she craved from Dante. The evolution of Axel and Scarlett's relationship was challenging to watch, yet it culminated in a beautiful transformation. No one will ever love her as I do; I was smitten from the moment I laid eyes on her. Although Dante's selfishness permeates the narrative, I believe he genuinely loves Scarlett. While I disapprove of many of his choices and the way he often made her feel, I cannot deny the depth of his feelings for her.",

I related a lot to Scarlett's feelings and heartache when she didn't get what she was looking for from Dante.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationships:**  \n   - Watching Axel and Scarlett's relationship grow and change was difficult but ended up beautiful by the end.  \n   - \"No man will ever love her as much as I do... I loved her the moment I saw her.\"  \n   - Although Dante was incredibly selfish throughout the entirety of this series, I do believe he loves Scarlett. I hate some of the decisions he made and the way he made her feel most of the time, but I can't deny his love for her.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - Penelope's writing is my favorite. Everything is fast-paced, so I am never bored.  \n   - There is enough detail to allow me to watch everything unfold in my mind while reading.  \n   - There is enough chaos to keep me intrigued and enough spice to make me need to fan myself while reading.  \n\n- **Emotional Connection and Relatability:**  \n   - I think a lot of people with \"daddy issues\" can relate to Scarlett and Dante's relationship.  \n   - I was satisfied with the ending and can't wait to see what the 4th book holds.  \n\n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n   - Can we talk about the last chapter though?!? Uhm, WHAT. I was on the edge of my seat reading it. Everything was just perfection.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Books:**  \n   - I am beyond excited for Theo's book!! I was quick to fall for him too, which is no surprise. The shadier they are, the more I want them... toxic, I know.  \n   - I am eager to learn more about his relationship with Axel and the Skeleton Kings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a fantastic conclusion to Axel and Scarlett's story, filled with character growth, emotional depth, and a perfect balance of chaos and romance. Penelope Sky's writing kept me hooked from start to finish, and the ending left me eagerly anticipating the next installment in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 5 stars (implied through the statement, \"I will continue to believe that anything Penelope Sky writes is 5 stars.\")"

I was anxious to see what treachery Dante would inflict on Axl and Scarlett, and the tension in the early chapters made me constantly anticipate what terrible event would happen next.  \n  - The plot took a satisfying turn when Dante began to act like a father again, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Dante‚Äôs transformation from a seemingly antagonistic figure to a fatherly role was compelling and well-executed.  \n  - Scarlett‚Äôs character intrigued me, but I was disappointed that her mother‚Äôs backstory was left unresolved. Despite being mentioned multiple times, we never learned why she wasn‚Äôt in the picture, which felt like a missed opportunity.  \n\n- **Author‚Äôs Writing Style:**  \n  - I thoroughly enjoy this author‚Äôs storytelling and find their books engaging. The narrative style kept me hooked and eager to continue reading.  \n\n- **Series Continuity and Future Interest:**  \n  - The book left me excited to read about Theo in the next series. I‚Äôm curious about the dynamic between Theo and Axl, who call themselves brothers despite not being related by blood. This unanswered question has piqued my interest for future installments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a highly enjoyable read with a suspenseful plot and strong character development. While I wished for more closure regarding Scarlett‚Äôs mother, the story‚Äôs twists and the author‚Äôs engaging writing style kept me invested. I‚Äôm now eagerly looking forward to the next series to uncover more about Theo and Axl‚Äôs relationship.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, my enthusiasm for the series remains strong, and I‚Äôm looking forward to the next book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

My admiration for Axel deepened in this book, as his love for Scarlett was both profound and genuine. It pained me to see him in a situation where he had to make Scarlett question his true feelings. Conversely, my disdain for Scarlett's father, Dante, intensified. He was controlling, selfish, and deceitful. No parent should dictate their child's life or whom they should love, and it would have been fitting for Scarlett to sever ties with him permanently."
