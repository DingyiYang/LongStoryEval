            "The story is well-paced, but the ending feels rushed. The resolution of Isabella and Leo's relationship would have benefited from an additional 2-3 chapters for deeper reflection and a more satisfying emotional payoff. Isabella's realization of her feelings for Leo comes across as abrupt; a more gradual development or additional pining would have enhanced the emotional impact.",
            "Isabella serves as a powerful protagonist who takes charge of her life within a patriarchal society, using her choices about sexuality as a means of emancipation. Her motivations are clearly articulated and compelling. Conversely, Leo is a gentle, shy, and somewhat reclusive character, who grapples with his own struggles. The evolving dynamic between Isabella and Leo is beautifully portrayed throughout the narrative.",

However, the second half felt rushed and less satisfying, particularly the hurried ending, which was marred by stilted dialogue. I found Lady Irlam's scheming to deepen Isabella and Leo's relationship off-putting, especially since her deceit seemed inconsiderate given Isabella's recent widowhood. It was disappointing that Isabella never engaged in a meaningful conversation with Leo about their boundaries and relationship, despite recognizing his willingness to acquiesce to her every wish.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the dynamic between Isabella and Leo in the first half of the book. Leo's instant devotion to Isabella contrasted with her slower development of feelings, as she remained attuned to his emotions. However, I found Isabella's sudden love for Leo in the second half unconvincing; it felt abrupt and lacked a believable buildup. I would have appreciated more scenes showcasing their interactions beyond her list to lend credibility to her newfound feelings. While Isabella's obsession with her list was a recurring theme, I hoped to see her gradually move away from it or incorporate non-sexual items as she grew closer to Leo. Instead, this aspect felt unresolved, and the shift in her feelings lacked depth."

However, her pragmatic approach to tackling her list of experiences ultimately added depth and amusement to her character.

Isabella's journey from grief to a fulfilling future is compellingly portrayed, illustrating her growth from clinging to a list to ultimately letting it go. Leo is endearing, deeply caring for Isabella despite fearing she may never reciprocate his feelings. His impatience and hurt during rejection add tension and establish his boundaries. Their intimate relationship is dynamic, with Isabella taking a more dominant role while Leo discovers his instinct to comply, adding both depth and steaminess to their connection.
