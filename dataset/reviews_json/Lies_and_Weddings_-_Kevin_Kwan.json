The pages fly by despite its length, making it an engaging read.  \n   - Kwan maintains a playful and entertaining tone throughout, which keeps the story enjoyable.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - Kwan reimagines Anthony Trollope’s *Doctor Thorne* with humor and hyperbole, highlighting the ridiculousness of excessive wealth without becoming overly moralistic.  \n   - He successfully blends his own style with a modern exploration of issues while creatively paying homage to the source material.  \n\n- **Inspiration and Homage:**  \n   - The novel is a reimagining of *Doctor Thorne*, with many main plot points and character names directly inspired by Trollope’s work.  \n   - Kwan includes several inside jokes and character references for fellow Trollope fans, showcasing his respect for the source material.  \n   - The publisher’s failure to acknowledge Trollope’s influence in the book’s description is disappointing, as it overlooks a significant part of Kwan’s creative genius.  \n\n- **Publisher’s Oversight:**  \n   - The absence of any mention of Trollope in the Penguin Random House description is a missed opportunity to highlight the novel’s inspiration.  \n   - Unlike Kwan’s previous book, *Sex and Vanity*, which acknowledged its inspiration (*A Room with a View* by E.M. Forster), this omission feels unfair to both Kwan and Trollope.  \n\n- **Appeal to Fans:**  \n   - Fans of Kevin Kwan will love this book, as it delivers his signature style and wit.  \n   - Readers familiar with Trollope’s work will appreciate the clever nods and references throughout the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Lies and Weddings* is a fantastic novel that combines Kevin Kwan’s unique voice with a creative reimagining of Anthony Trollope’s *Doctor Thorne*. While the book is highly enjoyable and engaging, the publisher’s failure to acknowledge Trollope’s influence is a significant oversight that detracts from the full appreciation of Kwan’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The pacing of the plot kept me turning pages over a two-day reading marathon.  \n\n- **Homage and Adaptation:**  \n  I recognized the delightful homage to *Doctor Thorne* by Trollope and appreciated how Kevin Kwan made the story his own by focusing on Chinese British characters.  \n\n- **Themes and Nuance:**  \n  Kevin Kwan is able to explore and ask questions about race, class, wealth, colonization, etc., in a light and joyful way.  \n\n- **Setting and Descriptions:**  \n  The globe-trotting and the signature extravagance that he details were vivid, and each of the wedding scenes had me guessing what drama would occur.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really enjoyed Eden and Rufus as characters, and I was almost surprised by how beloved the elder Doctor Tong became as I was reading, even though I was familiar with the adaptation. Kevin Kwan does an excellent job with minor characters because they’re so rounded and memorable, and I can usually recall a quirky fact or two about each character.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  Another treat was the short vignettes of genre changes that altered the novel’s rhythm and made the story even more colorful.  \n\n- **Author Insights and Event Experience:**  \n  I’m thankful for the chance to attend the Kepler’s bookstore event featuring Kevin Kwan and Laurel Braitman. Laurel asked wonderful questions, and Kevin shared insights into his writer’s block and inspiration, including his time on the Big Island as invited by Laurel. There was even a video call from *Crazy Rich Asians* director Jon Chu, via his mother. Hearing Kevin and Laurel’s conversation gave new meaning to Kevin’s storytelling, especially the topics and tensions he takes on and the tone he uses. Afterwards, he graciously signed four of my books that hadn’t been signed since a previous event at which he appeared.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Lies and Weddings* is a vibrant, engaging novel that masterfully blends humor, drama, and social commentary. Kevin Kwan’s storytelling shines through his vivid descriptions, memorable characters, and clever narrative techniques.

I especially enjoyed the snippet at the beginning about Henry and figuring out the connection of that anecdote to the current characters.  \n\n- **Desire for Continuation:**  \n  I really hope Kevin Kwan writes a sequel to this book, as I am dying to know what happens to a few of the characters and their relationships!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Lies and Weddings* is a highly entertaining and engaging novel that captures the over-the-top lifestyles and family dynamics characteristic of Kevin Kwan's writing. The story is a delightful guilty pleasure, leaving me eager for a sequel to explore the unresolved fates of the characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In the novel, the romance between Eden and Rufus is underwhelming due to their limited interactions, which diminishes its centrality. While their relationship evolves from friends to lovers, it lacks depth, as their transition to romance feels effortless. As the most stable characters, they come off as somewhat bland compared to the exaggerated, memorable cast surrounding them. Notably, the Countess, Arabella (Rufus' mother), shines as a villainous yet entertaining figure, her narcissism and arrogance adding a humorous twist to the story.",

I ultimately opted for the printed version, which I found much easier to read.",

She accurately points out that Rufus, who dreams of a simple life in a Hawaiian surf shack creating art, can only afford that lifestyle because of her financial support. The costs of such a lifestyle can be surprisingly high. She has a deeper understanding of struggle and racism than her children. Ultimately, though, her actions are utterly diabolical and reflect her unstable mindset.",
            "While many readers have criticized the extensive detail in the book, I actually found it captivating. The lavish descriptions of the clothing and cars of the elite, along with the education of each character, drew me in. As someone from a public school and state university background, I typically shy away from such intricacies, but in this case, they effectively painted a vivid picture of a world so foreign to me.",

What a blast!  \n  - The ending is a foregone conclusion from the first chapters, but that doesn't make the journey any less entertaining.  \n\n- **World-Building and Detail:**  \n  - I know others complained about the immense book details, and I get it. He spends not so few words describing the clothing and cars of the .001%, not to mention every character's education.  \n  - I (Public School, State School, State School) actually loved these details, and I usually don't. But this world is so incredibly foreign to me, and those details sold it so well.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - While the mother is quite the villain, we do get where she's coming from. She's right that Rufus, who wants nothing so much as to live the simple life in a Hawaii surf shack doing art, only gets to live that life because she pays for it. The \"simple\" life can be quite expensive.  \n  - She knows better than her children what struggling and racism are like. However, she is also completely diabolical and off her rocker.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  - I'm curious if those who read *Crazy Rich Asians* might find some repetition in this story. After all, there are a lot of crazy rich Asians and some other races too.  \n  - There's also the Chinese mother of a gorgeous son determined to marry him off to someone better than he loves.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Format:**  \n  - I'm still confused as to why Martha wanted to play such a role in the family chaos.  \n  - Warning to those on Audible: I downloaded this but gave up when the second chapter was a list of character names and their titles to help us keep everything straight. I decided a printed book would be much easier to read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book despite its predictable ending and the overwhelming details that some readers might find excessive.

The book successfully immerses readers in the world of high society and Asian culture, with a particular highlight on the representation of the Philippines. While the beginning was slow, the story quickly became compelling and engaging, making it hard to put down. The inclusion of explanatory notes added a unique touch, enhancing the connection between the readers, the author, and the characters.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.5/5 stars"

She correctly points out that Rufus, who dreams of a simple life in a Hawaiian surf shack creating art, is able to pursue that dream solely because of her financial support. Living a simple life can be surprisingly costly. While she possesses a deeper awareness of struggle and racism than her children, her actions are undeniably ruthless and unhinged.",

He spends a lot of words describing the clothing, cars, and education of the .001%.  \n   - As someone who attended public and state schools, I actually loved these details, which is unusual for me. This world is so incredibly foreign to me, and those details sold it so well.  \n\n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n   - The ending is a foregone conclusion from the first chapters, but that doesn’t make the journey any less entertaining.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - While the mother is quite the villain, we do get where she’s coming from. She’s right that Rufus, who wants nothing more than to live a simple life in a Hawaii surf shack doing art, only gets to live that life because she pays for it. The \"simple\" life can be quite expensive.  \n   - She knows better than her children what struggling and racism are like. However, she is also completely diabolical and off her rocker.  \n\n- **Format and Accessibility:**  \n   - Warning to those on Audible: I downloaded this but gave up when the second chapter was a list of character names and their titles to help us keep everything straight. I decided a printed book would be much easier to read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book despite its detailed descriptions and predictable ending.

However, this awareness doesn’t seem to influence the other characters, who continue living in their privileged bubble.  \n  - The novel subtly addresses racism within and toward Asian communities, suggesting that Kwan is beginning to incorporate social responsibility into his otherwise extravagant tales.  \n\n- **Balance Between Fun and Depth:**  \n  - While the book is undeniably fun to read, it also gives a nod to social issues, which adds a layer of depth. If these are baby steps toward more balanced storytelling, it’s a promising direction for Kwan.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Kevin Kwan novel delivers the glamour, humor, and escapism readers expect, with an added layer of social commentary that hints at a more thoughtful approach to storytelling. It’s a fun read with a touch of depth, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The cast of characters was impressive, each feeling authentic and well-developed, even the minor ones who shone alongside the main players. Arabella stood out for me, despite her frustratingly overbearing and judgmental demeanor, which only added to her realism. In contrast, Rufus came across as somewhat superficial; I found myself agreeing with Arabella's critique of his failure to grasp the true struggles of poverty, as his artist-surfer lifestyle isn't exactly frugal. Eden, while occasionally self-righteous, emerged as the voice of reason in a world dominated by the wealthy, though she too came from money—just not to the same extravagant degree.",

However, the similar voices used for many characters made it hard to distinguish between them at times. Despite this, the voice acting was good.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The cast of characters was amazing. Each character felt real and fully fleshed out, including the minor ones, who stood out just as much as the main characters.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Realism:**  \n  Arabella was a standout character for me, though she often made me furious with her over-the-top, overbearing, and judgmental nature. Despite this, she felt very realistic. Rufus, on the other hand, fell a little flat for me. I found myself agreeing with Arabella’s critique of his lack of understanding about what it truly means to be without money, as his artist surfer-boy lifestyle isn’t exactly cheap. Eden, while occasionally self-righteous, served as the voice of reason in the otherwise fantastical world of the rich. That said, it’s worth noting that Eden was also wealthy, just not to the same extent as the others.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Themes:**  \n  The book reminded me of *Gossip Girl* but with adults, diversity, and a likable Dan.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved this book!

The plot, characters, and details kept me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  The story delves into the lives of Rufus and his family as they uncover truths about their past and themselves. It’s introspective, much like the author’s previous books, encouraging readers to reflect on the characters' emotions rather than just focusing on surface-level details like their actions or appearances.  \n\n- **Adaptability to Film:**  \n  I could easily envision this book being adapted into a movie, though it’s worth noting that the tone is more introspective compared to the fun and action-packed nature of the films based on the author’s other works.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing an advanced reader copy (ARC) of this book. #sponsored  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating and introspective read that maintains the high quality of the author’s previous works. It’s engaging, thought-provoking, and has the potential to translate well into a film adaptation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

They bring the story to life in a way that feels engaging and immersive.  \n\n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n  Spoilers ahead, though I found the twist really obvious. However, this wasn’t a problem for me, as I still enjoyed the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  This book definitely follows a pattern set by the *Crazy Rich Asians* trilogy. It plays on the idea of \"Aren’t rich people super ridiculous, haha?\" while contrasting them with the heroine, who is portrayed as a totally normal, smart, down-to-earth middle-class woman. She happens to be naturally beautiful, have great taste, and is in love with the One Good Rich Boy. The central conflict revolves around her not being accepted by his family—until she inherits billions of dollars from a relative of her mysterious dead parent.  \n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  Despite the predictable elements, the story is super juicy and fun! It’s an enjoyable read that keeps you entertained.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the plot twist was predictable and the story follows familiar tropes from Kevin Kwan’s previous works, the book remains a delightful and entertaining read.

I found myself so immersed that I googled the designers, restaurants, and posh places mentioned in the book.

The narrator’s performance is so exceptional that you’d swear she was Kitty Pong herself. I’m eager to listen to the audiobook next to experience the story in a new way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was an engaging and enjoyable read, offering a fascinating glimpse into a luxurious and culturally rich world. The audiobook version comes highly recommended for its outstanding narration.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I'm sure you know how hard it is to do charming decay.” or “Are you that cruel of a son, to stand there and watch your helpless parents wither away when all you have to do is marry a billionaire?” Additionally, the observation, “Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination,” resonates deeply.",

One standout line encapsulates its biting humor: “As for your mother, I can’t believe you would want to condemn her to a life as an interior decorator of all things. I can’t imagine a worse job in the world. To be at the beck and call of tasteless vulgarians, forcing her to recreate rooms with suicidally neutral palettes!” The witty exchange, “Hold your horses, Sad Keanu,” perfectly captures the book's clever tone."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I consumed this as an audiobook, and it elevated the experience thanks to the narrator, Jing Lusi. Her voice acting brought the characters to life, making the story even more engaging and memorable.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Kevin Kwan creates an immersive and flamboyant world that feels incredibly real. The setting is so vivid that I found myself marveling at it throughout the story.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are distinct, memorable, and well-developed. The side characters, in particular, stood out as the real stars of the story, each with their own unique personalities. The villains are well-crafted and evoke strong emotions, while the main characters, though initially a bit clichéd (e.g., the \"not like other rich boys\" male lead and the \"not like other girls\" female lead), grew on me over time.\n\n- **Plot and Tone:**  \n  The plot is juicy, flamboyant, and filled with drama, as expected from the *Crazy Rich Asians* series. It’s balanced perfectly with comedy and heartfelt moments, making it both entertaining and emotionally resonant. I laughed, cried, and even found myself gripped by the mystery elements.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was engaging, though it took me a while to warm up to the male lead. His initial \"not like other rich boys\" persona felt a bit eye-roll-worthy, but he eventually became more layered and likable. The female lead, despite a slight \"not like other girls\" trope, was someone I rooted for.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I couldn’t stop listening from the very first chapter. The story felt so real that I was shocked to realize I wouldn’t be reading about these characters in real-life gossip columns. I’m already suffering from withdrawal and eagerly awaiting a TV adaptation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis audiobook was an absolute delight, thanks to Kevin Kwan’s brilliant storytelling and Jing Lusi’s exceptional narration. The characters, world-building, and balance of humor and heart made it an unforgettable experience. I laughed, cried, and was completely immersed in the story. Now, I’m eagerly hoping for a TV series to bring this world to life again.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The characters are well-developed, and the omniscient POV allows readers to connect with their inner worlds.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The novel features familiar Kevin Kwan tropes, such as a romance between a wealthy individual and someone from a middle-class background. The themes of wealth, deception, and societal expectations are central to the story.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Appeal:**  \n  As a fan of Kevin Kwan’s previous works, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The lavish descriptions and immersive storytelling create a delightful reading experience.

A devoted admirer of Trollope, the author’s novel *Lies and Weddings* serves as a modern retelling of *Doctor Thorne*, closely mirroring its plot while enhancing its themes.",

Both novels delve into themes of hidden truths, extravagance, debt, class prejudice, addiction, and debauchery, blending humor with poignancy. The author adeptly adapts the class prejudices in *Doctor Thorne* to confront racism in *Lies and Weddings*. Arabella Gresham, a Hong Kong native, grapples with internalized racism as she seeks to secure wealthy European marriages for her mixed-race children.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Consistency and Style:**  \n   - Kevin Kwan returns to his signature style, which includes a similar structure, tone, and storyline as his previous works.  \n   - The novel employs familiar narrative devices, character archetypes, and developments, which some readers might find repetitive but others find comforting.  \n\n- **Relevance of Themes in Current Times:**  \n   - There was initial skepticism about whether the extravagant displays of wealth and excess, which were a hit in *Crazy Rich Asians*, would resonate as strongly in today's sociopolitical climate.  \n   - The timing of *Sex and Vanity* (released in June 2020) was less favorable due to the global context, but *Lies and Weddings* manages to feel more satisfying and relevant.  \n\n- **Entertainment Value and Immersion:**  \n   - The book is described as entertaining, dishy, and perfect for light, immersive reading, such as by a pool.  \n   - It provides a \"whole meal\" of a story, leaving the reader fully satisfied.  \n\n- **Artistic Evolution vs. Consistency:**  \n   - The review questions whether authors need to reinvent themselves with every new book or if sticking to a proven formula can still be valuable.  \n   - Kevin Kwan's consistency is seen as a strength, offering comfort and familiarity in challenging times.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n   - The novel includes brief violence, mentions of eating disorders, racism, and sexism, which readers should be aware of.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKevin Kwan's *Lies and Weddings* is a delightful return to his signature style, offering a familiar yet entertaining escape. While some may question the relevance of its themes in today's world, the book succeeds as a satisfying and immersive read. Kwan's consistency in storytelling is appreciated, proving that not every novel needs to break new ground to be enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "This entertaining story features dramatic interactions among the obscenely wealthy and an ambitious mother whose chaos masks her own pain. I felt the narrative would benefit from a deeper exploration of the Greshams facing true insolvency, which could have added a compelling layer to the plot.",
            "Arabella is a complex character; I found myself sympathetic to her critiques of Rufus' carefree, opulent lifestyle, despite her flaws. Rufus, though charming, lacks self-awareness regarding his privilege, an issue that Arabella hints at but which could be explored more deeply. His oblivion to the consequences of his casual lifestyle makes him feel like a repetition of his father. Initially portrayed as a typical laid-back character, Eden evolves into a strong, principled figure. Her dedication as a doctor and her disinterest in becoming a countess add depth to her character. The antagonist is humanized through Eden, though his resolution feels too tidy and reminiscent of works like *Crazy Rich Asians* and *Sex and Vanity*. I wished for more development of Hemsworth and Martha, as they seemed underutilized. A delightful nod to Kitty Pong was a highlight, and I remain firmly #TeamKittyPong.",

Arabella hints at this, but I wish it were explored more deeply. He seems unaware of the true cost of his casual lifestyle, and his character feels like a rehash of his father.  \n  - Eden starts off as a typical go-with-the-flow character but evolves into someone with a strong backbone and integrity. Her role as a doctor and her disinterest in becoming a countess or lady adds depth to her character.  \n  - The villain is humanized through Eden, though his resolution feels too neat and reminiscent of Kwan's previous works like *Crazy Rich Asians* and *Sex and Vanity*.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The story is entertaining, filled with obscenely rich people being dramatic and an ambitious mother causing chaos to mask her own pain.  \n  - I found myself wanting more exploration of what would happen if the Greshams lost everything and became truly insolvent—this could have added a compelling layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  - I wanted more of Hemsworth and Martha, as they felt underutilized.  \n  - The throwaway line about Kitty Pong was a delightful nod, and I remain firmly #TeamKittyPong.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is an entertaining read with its signature blend of humor, drama, and opulence.

Spanning diverse locales like England, Hawaii, Hong Kong, Marrakech, Beverly Hills, and Venice, the story features lavish events such as weddings, engagement parties, and a dramatic will reading. The narrative is packed with soapy twists and sitcom-style misunderstandings, including an unplanned pregnancy, hidden financial struggles, and a long-standing family mystery from 1995. However, the pacing is uneven, with certain sections feeling overly drawn out or extraneous.",

Her kindhearted but ineffectual husband, Francis Gresham, grapples with financial mismanagement. Their children—diligent Augusta, artistic Rufus, and the charmingly superficial Bea—each represent familiar archetypes. Eden Tong, the relatable \"girl next door,\" serves as a conduit for the audience, while her connection with Rufus introduces a romantic subplot.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The novel follows the Gresham family, a wealthy and privileged British-Asian family, as they navigate love, scandal, and financial troubles.  \n   - The story spans multiple locations, including England, Hawaii, Hong Kong, Marrakech, Beverly Hills, and Venice, featuring extravagant events like weddings, engagement parties, and a volcanic will reading.  \n   - The plot is soapy and scandalous, with sitcom-like miscommunications and dramatic twists, including an unplanned pregnancy, secret financial woes, and a mysterious accident from 1995 that still impacts the family.  \n\n- **Characters and Archetypes:**  \n   - Arabella Gresham, the overbearing, status-obsessed Tiger Mom, is a central figure who drives much of the drama.  \n   - Francis Gresham, the kindhearted but ineffective father, struggles with financial mismanagement.  \n   - The children—Augusta, Rufus, and Bea—each embody familiar archetypes: the dutiful older daughter, the artistic middle son, and the lovable but vapid younger daughter.  \n   - Eden Tong, the “girl next door,” serves as a relatable audience stand-in, while Rufus’s love for her adds a romantic subplot.  \n\n- **Themes and Satire:**  \n   - The novel satirizes the excesses and obnoxiousness of the ultra-wealthy, with detailed descriptions of luxury real estate, fashion, and art.  \n   - It critiques the lack of environmental care and the shameless displays of wealth among the elite.  \n   - Despite the satire, the author seems to simultaneously envy and delight in the excesses of his characters, which may alienate some readers.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n   - The novel features numerous footnotes and detailed descriptions of wealth, which can feel excessive and distracting.  \n   - The pacing is inconsistent, with some sections feeling overly long or unnecessary.  \n   - The narrative lacks the incisive clarity and succinctness of Kwan’s earlier works, such as the *Crazy Rich Asians* trilogy.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement and Appeal:**  \n   - The novel is entertaining for its frothy, soapy drama and social satire, but it may not resonate with readers who are uninterested in the lifestyles of the ultra-wealthy.  \n   - The first chapter is particularly strong and ties well into the ending, but the overall payoff feels less satisfying compared to Kwan’s previous works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Lies and Weddings* is a globetrotting, satirical tale of wealth, love, and scandal, filled with familiar archetypes and dramatic twists. While it delivers on the soapy, over-the-top entertainment that fans of Kevin Kwan’s work expect, it falls short in terms of narrative clarity and character depth compared to his earlier novels. The excessive focus on wealth descriptions and inconsistent pacing may alienate some readers, but those who enjoy social satire and escapist drama will likely find it an engaging read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Entertainment Value: 7/10  \n- Character Depth: 5/10  \n- Writing Style: 6/10  \n- Overall Satisfaction: 6/10"

            "I have a consistent appreciation for the female protagonists in the author's works, though I often find the male leads less appealing. In *Crazy Rich Asians*, I felt Rachel should never have reconciled with Nick Young, given that he kept his entire family a secret from her. Regarding Rufus, I found him to be incredibly naive. One standout scene features Arabella confronting him, highlighting how he claims to be content with his $5 million surf shack—funded by her—while she struggles to install a new septic system for it. Rufus drifts through the story without making difficult choices; although he isn’t marrying Eden for her wealth, it certainly benefits him. I struggled to connect with the romance between Rufus and Eden, as it felt contrived and relied on an implied long-standing friendship. I personally would have preferred Eden to end up with Freddy. While I liked Eden, her character often feels overshadowed by her relationships with others. In a cast consumed by wealth, she serves as an ascetic figure; in a world rife with rage and selfishness, she appears measured and controlled.",

How can you marry a man who keeps his entire family a secret from you?  \n   - My issue with Rufus is that he's incredibly naive. I loved the scene where Arabella screams at him, pointing out how he claims to be \"perfectly happy in his little surf shack,\" which actually cost $5 million of HER money, and she had to install a new septic system for it.  \n   - Rufus just swans through the novel, and while he isn't marrying Eden for her money, it helps that he never has to make a hard choice.  \n   - I didn't buy into the \"romance\" between Rufus and Eden. It feels forced and comes out of nowhere at random points, relying on readers imagining a long friendship between them.  \n   - I was hoping Eden would end up with Freddy instead.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Personality:**  \n   - I liked Eden, but it was hard to get a sense of her personality. She mostly exists in relation to the other characters.  \n   - The other characters are money-obsessed, so Eden is portrayed as ascetic. They are prone to fits of rage and selfishness, so she is controlled.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n   - In all of Kevin Kwan's books, the underlying message is to not rely on money or be superficial. However, the characters all have some giant windfall at the end that renders them \"finally\" marriage material, which feels contradictory.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate Kevin Kwan's strong female characters and the satirical take on wealth and relationships, I found the male characters, particularly Rufus, to be frustratingly naive and underdeveloped.

It’s mostly about rich people being rich.  \n   - It’s a social satire while also being an escapist read.  \n\n- **Narrative Shifts and Tone:**  \n   - It’s mostly escapist until Luis Felipe comes into the picture, making you remember why billionaires shouldn’t exist, and the narrative turns into an overt commentary on excessive wealth.  \n   - It actually got pretty chaotic and not so fun in the end. This book was all over the place.  \n\n- **Overall Reading Experience:**  \n   - It was a unique reading experience. If you’re a brat about writing like me, just pretend you don’t see the “haha’s” spelled out in the quoted dialogue and simply let Kevin Kwan take you on a wild ride through his psycho rich people universe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a rollercoaster of emotions and tones, blending escapism with sharp social commentary.

The familiarity of the characters and plotlines provided a sense of comfort, as I knew what to expect when picking it up.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  As the fourth book in the series about the extravagant lives of \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" some characters felt repetitive to me. It seemed like I had encountered them before, which made their arcs less fresh or surprising.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Certain plotlines felt repetitive, leaving me with the thought, \"Haven't we been here before?\" Additionally, some scenes were confusing in terms of timelines, though everything eventually clicked together. However, the ending became fairly obvious long before the book concluded, and the remaining hours felt drawn out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I found comfort in the familiarity of the characters and plotlines, the book's length and repetitive elements detracted from my overall enjoyment. The predictable ending and pacing issues made the reading experience feel longer than necessary.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

It added some intrigue but didn’t feel particularly deep or compelling.  \n\n- **Name-Dropping and World-Building:**  \n  I was most annoyed by the constant name-dropping—fashion, jewelers, furniture, art. I understand that’s part of what Kwan’s books are all about, showcasing a world of money and status. However, it’s a world I have no knowledge of (and little interest in), which made it feel excessive and distracting.  \n\n- **Footnotes:**  \n  The footnote comments were another annoyance. Most of the time, I didn’t even see the asterisk and only noticed the footnote when I reached the bottom of the page. I think these comments should have been included in the main text of the story for better flow and readability.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was okay, but it didn’t fully engage me.

The creative liberties taken with the characters and their actions made it challenging for me to accept and engage with the story as I usually would.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I am a fan of Kevin Kwan’s signature style and extravagant storytelling, this particular novel fell short for me. The characters, especially Arabella, felt unconvincing and disrupted my ability to fully immerse myself in the story. The over-the-top elements, which I usually enjoy, came across as forced and less authentic in this instance.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The luxury brand/famous people name-dropping was entertaining and almost felt satirical at times (I think).  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Not my favorite read, but not totally unenjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some entertaining elements, such as the footnotes and Arabella’s character, the overly complex plot, unnecessary storylines, and predictable ending made it a disappointing read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story felt repetitive, with only a few instances of social commentary (#woke) to differentiate it.  \n\n- **Suggestions for Improvement:**  \n  The formula works, but it might benefit from a fresh perspective or a new twist to keep it engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was an enjoyable read that delivered the same charm and elements I loved from the *Crazy Rich Asians* series.

The book felt overly lengthy, with a substantial focus on opulent settings and fashion that detracted from both the plot and character development.",
            "The characters in this story feel repetitive and lack depth. The author recycles familiar archetypes: the cruel, wealthy Chinese mother; the kind yet passive female protagonist; and a wealthy male lead devoid of backbone. Eden Tong, the protagonist, is frustratingly self-unaware, particularly regarding her position of privilege. Rufus Gresham is spineless and overly influenced by his domineering mother, Lady Arabella, who embodies self-hatred and internalized racism—a complex trait that is poorly explored and comes across more as an excuse than meaningful characterization. Among them, Thomas Tong stands out as the only relatable character, although the overall standard is quite low. The romance is underwhelming; Eden and Rufus lack chemistry, and their relationship feels forced and unconvincing. The romantic scenes ultimately fall flat, lacking emotional depth and engagement.",

The author introduces themes such as classism, racism, self-loathing, and environmentalism but doesn't fully commit to any, rendering the commentary hollow. The plot is predictable, with the ending easily anticipated. Nevertheless, the fast-paced and absurd nature of the story keeps readers engaged. The family dynamics and exaggerated scenarios are its most compelling elements, making it addictive and difficult to put down.",
            "The romance between Eden and Rufus feels underdeveloped, as their time together is minimal, rendering their relationship unconvincing. Their childhood friendship serves as a weak foundation for their bond, lacking emotional depth and satisfying moments. Arabella, a central character, is depicted as abusive and self-loathing; however, her redemption arc seems unearned and poorly executed, further weakened by the absence of accountability for her actions, which undermines the overall narrative.",

The main characters, like Rufus, mirror the very behaviors they condemn, undermining the commentary's effectiveness. Additionally, the author’s uncertainty in portraying the ultra-rich—whether to glorify or condemn them—leaves the narrative feeling inconsistent and lacking in conviction.",

            "The book employs a montage-like structure in two chapters, shifting between various perspectives, such as a maid, a butler, and a party planner, while another chapter captures a festival through brief eyewitness accounts. I appreciated this narrative technique; however, its abrupt introduction in the final quarter felt inconsistent. Ideally, it would have been woven throughout the story for greater coherence. Additionally, the plot twist lacked surprise, as I predicted it about 10% into the book. \n\nThe narrative is overly detailed, particularly in its descriptions of clothing, furniture, jewelry, and artwork. Each item often comes with extensive information about the designer or artist, sometimes including their backstory, leading to a wordy and exhausting read, especially in straightforward scenes like characters entering a room. The urge to skim was palpable. Additionally, there’s an unexplained shift in the color of Arabella’s folder from burgundy to blue, which adds to the narrative's inconsistency.",
            "The villains are the standout characters in this story. Countess Arabella is delightfully unhinged, while Luis, though appalling, is surprisingly well-developed. His backstory sheds light on his reprehensible behavior, evoking a degree of sympathy. He serves as a striking, realistic portrayal of younger social media influencers who, with their wealth, feel entitled to act poorly. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters fall flat; some are more developed than others, but Rufus' sisters, for instance, are nearly interchangeable. Additionally, the sheer number of names can be overwhelming. The chemistry between the couples leaves much to be desired, making it a less engaging experience overall.",

Countess Arabella is unhinged, and Luis is horrific but oddly one of the most fleshed-out characters. His backstory makes sense for why he behaves so poorly, to the point where you almost feel for him. He’s a jarring but realistic example of younger social media influencers with too much money who use it as an excuse to act like assholes.  \n   - The other characters are meh.

There are also too many names to keep track of.  \n   - The chemistry between the couples is underwhelming.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n   - Two chapters use a montage-like structure, bouncing between several points of view.

It would have made more sense if it had been used a few times throughout the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The \"reveal\" wasn’t much of a surprise. I figured it out about 10% into the book.  \n   - The book is overly detailed, especially with descriptions of clothing, furniture, jewelry, paintings, etc. Each item often includes details about the designer or artist, and sometimes even their backstory. This makes the book very wordy and exhausting to read, especially in simple scenes like two people entering a room and sitting down. The temptation to skim was real.  \n\n- **Continuity and Errors:**  \n   - There are two noticeable continuity errors. While neither affects the plot, they were distracting.  \n     - The color of Arabella’s folder changes from burgundy to blue without explanation.  \n     - A timeline inconsistency occurs when Thomas is described as both leaving LA immediately after Luis is taken off life support and attending Luis’ wake and seeing his remains off to Manila. Later, lawyers mention Thomas leaving \"yesterday,\" which contradicts the earlier timeline.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was mostly a fun read with some enjoyable elements, like the immersive settings and the unhinged \"bad\" characters. However, it has its flaws, including inconsistent narrative techniques, underwhelming character chemistry, excessive detail, and distracting continuity errors. Despite these issues, I would still watch a movie adaptation, as it could be a visually stunning and entertaining film.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Eden and Thomas Tong are lifelong doctors residing in a quaint cottage on the grounds of Greshambury Hall, always living in the warm shadow of the Gresham family. Eden is drawn into attending her friend Augie's extravagant wedding in Hawaii, initially tasked with finding her best friend Rufus a suitable romantic match. However, her well-intentioned plans spiral into a series of comedic misadventures. As rumors swirl, Eden and Rufus find themselves separated—Eden travels to Los Angeles while Rufus heads to Morocco. Complicating matters, Rufus's mother, Arabella, disapproves of Eden, yet Rufus is determined to keep her in his life. \n\nWhile the plot often feels predictable and lacks emotional depth, relying on setting changes to maintain interest, the unexpected sub-plots add intrigue and engagement. The novel serves as a modern spin on an Austen-esque comedy of manners. While it works well, it occasionally feels like recycled material.",
            "In this book, the characters lack the charm found in the author's earlier works. Arabella comes off as irritating and overly ambitious, while Bea and Augie feel one-dimensional. Eden resembles Rachel from *Crazy Rich Asians* but is more altruistic to the point of annoyance. The will-they-won't-they dynamic between Rufus and Eden is predictable, with the main obstacle in their relationship apparent from the outset.",
            "The author's unique style is evident in his witty footnotes and vivid portrayals of the ultra-wealthy. This book offers a delightful, escapist journey filled with travel and an exploration of various levels of affluence.",
            "The author explores themes of racism, particularly how Asians are often perceived as help due to their financial circumstances. Unfortunately, this commentary feels underdeveloped and awkwardly woven into the narrative.",

Eden is roped into attending Augie's wedding in Hawaii, where she experiences a new level of opulence. Her mission to get Rufus, her best friend, to fall in love with a \"suitable match\" goes awry, leading to a comedy of errors. Eden and Rufus are separated as they deal with rumors, with Eden heading to Los Angeles and Rufus to Morocco. Arabella, Rufus's mother, disapproves of Eden, while Rufus wants to keep her in his life.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**\n   - Kevin Kwan's distinctive style shines through with his amusing and contextual footnotes and his ability to vividly depict the lives of the ultra-wealthy. The book is a fun, escapist read with lots of travel and exploration of different levels of wealth.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters in this book feel less lovable compared to those in the *Crazy Rich Asians* series. Arabella is vexing and a social climber, Bea and Augie are flat, and Eden is similar to Rachel from *Crazy Rich Asians* but more altruistic to the point of being grating. The \"will they, won't they\" tension between Rufus and Eden is predictable, and the main obstacle in their relationship is obvious from the start.\n\n- **Plot Creativity and Depth:**\n   - The plot lacks emotional depth and creativity, relying heavily on setting changes to distract from its predictability. However, the sub-plots are unexpected and engaging, adding a layer of intrigue. The book serves as a modern update on an Austen-esque comedy of manners, which works well but feels like recycled material.\n\n- **Social Commentary:**\n   - Kwan touches on themes of racism, particularly the experiences of Asians with money being mistaken for \"the help.\" However, this commentary feels underdeveloped and awkwardly integrated into the story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - Despite its flaws, the book is a fun, frothy summer read. Fans of *Crazy Rich Asians* will likely enjoy it, though it may feel too familiar.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA fun, escapist novel with a predictable plot and underdeveloped characters, but still enjoyable for fans of Kevin Kwan's previous work. The book offers a modern take on a comedy of manners, though it lacks the emotional depth and originality of the *Crazy Rich Asians* series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The uneven pacing further contributes to a lackluster conclusion, ultimately leaving me unsatisfied.",

Arabella, the matriarch, is exaggerated and stagnant, evoking feelings of hopelessness and disgust. Rufus exists in an unrealistic fantasy, pretending to be a commoner while living in wealth. Overall, the characters lack depth and fail to evolve, rendering them unrelatable and uninteresting.",

            "The story's focus shifts from Rufus, as suggested in the summary, to Eden and her father, Thomas, the true main characters. The surprising twist revealing that Thomas is actually Eden’s uncle, not her biological father, adds an intriguing layer to the narrative. The Countess’s manipulative behavior—particularly her scheming to ensnare Rufus and later pressuring Eden to marry Luis—provides a frustrating yet essential conflict. However, the resolution feels somewhat contrived, with Eden inheriting the property as Rene’s last living relative and the Countess inexplicably becoming her best friend. While Eden and Rufus's eventual romance is satisfying, it also leans towards predictability.",
            "The Countess proved to be an exceedingly frustrating character, making it difficult to understand how anyone could tolerate her. In contrast, Eden emerged as a likable figure, though she was frequently mistaken for the help. Bea faced challenges as she navigated her desire to stand up for herself and others against her mother's influence. While Rufus and Eden's relationship felt predictable, their long-distance connection added some depth. Luis, Rene’s son, was portrayed as entitled and unpleasant, although his troubled childhood provided some context for his behavior.",

            "The novel draws significant inspiration from Anthony Trollope's *Doctor Thorne* (1858), incorporating familiar names and similar themes of marriage, finance, and secrets.

However, the early chapters feel brief and fragmented, making it challenging to establish a smooth narrative flow.",
            "The central romance revolves around Rufus Gresham, a free-spirited artist, and Eden, an NHS doctor who appears to live a life of luxury, rarely working and often seen in designer gowns and private jets. Unfortunately, Eden's sanctimonious and unrelatable demeanor diminishes her character's appeal.",
            "The tone is lively and effervescent, with a brisk narrative that captures the essence of *Doctor Thorne*. The author's clever, fourth-wall-breaking footnotes provide a distinctive and delightful element to the storytelling.",
            "The novel immerses readers in the exclusive realm of ultra-wealthy Asian and Eurasian elites, frequently referencing prestigious fashion houses, renowned interior designers, and contemporary artists. While the meticulous research behind these names is clear, the lack of detailed descriptions of the gowns, designs, and artworks results in a rather vague impression of wealth and taste."

        "conclusion": "While the novel doesn’t reach the heights of the author’s debut, it offers an entertaining exploration of ultrawealthy Asian society, with a frothy tone and witty footnotes. Despite some disjointed pacing and unrelatable characters, it’s a worthwhile read for fans of the author’s niche.",

            "The plot feels scattered, as the author attempts to weave together travel writing, art history, fashion, a diverse ensemble of characters, multiple plotlines, and social commentary on the 1%. The excessive detail, especially the frequent name and brand dropping, clutters the chapters and creates a tedious reading experience.",
            "The novel boasts a large cast of side characters; however, their introductions become repetitive as they are often tied to the schools they attended, losing impact after about 150 pages. The main characters and plot feel underdeveloped, overshadowed by excessive detail and disposable side characters. Notably, Rufus's struggle with his appearance and his mixed-race identity provides a compelling exploration of societal notions of passing. Similarly, Eden's realization of Arabella's internalized racism stands out as a significant moment in the narrative.",

            "The vivid, beautifully written descriptions of Hawaii stand out; however, the brief time spent there makes the extensive paragraphs feel misplaced. In contrast, later locations are described with less detail, often emphasizing art, fashion, and ties to celebrities or the ultra-wealthy, which detracts from the visual richness and hampers plot progression."

However, the author's creativity feels lacking, as the story comes across as derivative. While the conflict between the Tong family and the Greshams is engaging, its resolution is overly simplistic and predictable. The ending is unsatisfactory, as it builds up too much tension for such a straightforward conclusion. The narrative reveals all its secrets halfway through, reducing the potential for further drama. Consequently, the resolution is both unsurprising and protracted, taking too long to deliver a simple outcome.",

The MFC is portrayed as weak, while the mother does not acknowledge or atone for her harsh behavior. Additionally, the introduction of numerous characters detracts from the narrative, as many feel irrelevant to the plot.",

The narrative is unnecessarily lengthy, with the last three-quarters feeling particularly drawn-out. While the detailed imagery is vivid, it can also be excessive; descriptions of educational backgrounds, luxury brands, and jewelry become tedious.

Fans of Kwan’s previous works may enjoy the vivid imagery and escapism, but those seeking a strong romance or well-developed characters might be disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "This story is an entertaining read filled with unexpected twists and turns. The vivid descriptions of wealth, fashion, and food create an immersive experience of opulence. While the book is marketed as a romance, the love story is underdeveloped and unsatisfying, with the main characters spending most of their time apart. Additionally, the mention of a murder in the description feels misleading, as it has a minimal impact on the overall plot.",
            "Eden, the protagonist, is both relatable and engaging, particularly as she navigates the complexities of wealth from the sidelines. Her father is portrayed with warmth and depth, adding to the story's emotional resonance. However, the wealthy characters often come across as shallow and frustrating, embodying a repetitive formula of beauty and affluence that leads to tacky behavior. Rufus, the romantic interest, feels naive and spoiled, lacking the self-awareness and growth that would help readers connect with him. This makes it difficult to champion their relationship.",
            "The author’s writing is vividly descriptive, making it easy to envision the luxurious settings and lifestyles. The portrayal of stunning locations is particularly compelling and engaging.",
            "The story delves into the corrupting influence of wealth and the delusions of grandeur prevalent among the upper class. It poignantly illustrates that money cannot purchase happiness or resolve internal conflicts, and it can vanish just as easily as it is gained. However, the ending falls short; the characters remain ensnared in their illusions, and money ultimately remains the solution to their problems.",
            "The book fell short of its promises, lacking both the romance and murder mystery suggested in the description. Additionally, most characters lacked development, and the absence of a clear, articulated message was disappointing."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Portrayal of the Super-Rich:**  \n   - The novel presents a slightly terrifying and horrific account of the super-rich, depicting them as conscienceless, self-absorbed individuals who spend exorbitant amounts of money on trivialities.  \n   - The author, Kwan, uses footnotes to suggest a level of insider knowledge about the behavior of the super-rich, adding a layer of irony to the narrative.  \n   - The story highlights the insane importance placed on branding, celebrity names, and connections to royalty, which feels both absurd and unsettling.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n   - While some reviewers describe the book as escapist, I found it to be a stark and icy dive into a world where the wealthy are indifferent to global issues like climate change, suffering, and refugees, as long as their wealth insulates them.  \n   - The novel feels more like a realistic exposé than an escape, offering a “shove it in your face” portrayal of the excesses and unaccountability of the rich.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - At the top of the social hierarchy is Arabella, the “Rich Mom,” who is relentless in her pursuit of securing a wealthy and titled wife for her son, regardless of the cost.  \n   - Contrasting with the super-rich are the more relatable characters like Eden, her father, and Arabella’s son, who have less money and attempt to distance themselves from the absurd antics of the wealthy. These characters work in fields like medicine and art, which adds a layer of groundedness to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n   - The novel includes a romance that feels glossed over, serving as a light veneer over the otherwise critical and unflinching portrayal of wealth and privilege.  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n   - While I didn’t personally enjoy the book, I recognize its value in shedding light on the power and unaccountability of the super-rich. It’s a necessary, if uncomfortable, read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a biting and ironic exploration of the excesses and moral indifference of the super-rich, framed by a light romantic subplot. While it doesn’t offer escapism, it provides a stark and thought-provoking look at wealth and privilege, making it a worthwhile, if not entirely enjoyable, read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While I was initially okay with this familiar setup, the story felt overly long and predictable. Predictability isn’t inherently bad in light reads, but the pacing dragged, making it less enjoyable.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Kevin Kwan excels at writing biting wit and satire, which shines in the first half of the book.

They repeatedly get themselves into problems but simply wait for everything to magically resolve, which feels unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  The lack of self-awareness among the characters could be interpreted as a commentary on the uber-wealthy.

            "The characters, despite being depicted as broke, frequently flew privately to destinations like Venice, LA, Hawaii, and London, rented luxury cars for spontaneous road trips, and dined at high-end restaurants. This inconsistency felt jarring and unrealistic. Additionally, the new heiress's decision to give away her entire $90 billion fortune during her lifetime was hard to believe; setting aside even a portion for future generations would have made her choice more relatable. While the revenge story was engaging, the main character's overly kind demeanor weakened its impact. Overall, the book took me a week to finish, but it was excessively lengthy and lacked the excitement to justify its page count.",
            "While I know I'm meant to hate Arabella, her character was simply unbearable. Her toxic parenting, racism towards her own people, incessant whining, and constant meddling were exceedingly frustrating. The lack of character growth was disappointing, and the ending, where she is forgiven as if it’s all a whimsical joke, felt unsatisfying. The minor consequence she faced—a mere paper cut—was insufficient. Eden, on the other hand, was a people pleaser who allowed characters like Luis and Arabella to walk all over her, showing little growth by the end. Given the abundance of extra pages, I expected more development, but unfortunately, it was lacking."

This inconsistency was jarring and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Plot Decisions (Heiress’s Choice):**  \n   - The new heiress deciding to give away her entire $90 billion fortune during her lifetime felt unrealistic. While she doesn’t need to save all of it, setting aside even a small amount for future generations would have been more believable.  \n\n- **Strengths (Setting and Descriptions):**  \n   - Kevin Kwan excels at creating rich, lavish settings and descriptions. His ability to depict the opulent lifestyles of the characters is a standout feature.  \n\n- **Strengths (Revenge Plot):**  \n   - The revenge story was engaging, though the main character’s overly nice demeanor diluted its impact.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - While it wasn’t as good as *Crazy Rich Asians*, it was still a decently enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had its moments, particularly in its vivid settings and revenge plot, but it was hindered by its excessive length, lack of character growth, and unrealistic financial portrayals. While not as strong as Kwan’s previous work, it still provided some entertainment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

(I plan to.) This is the reason I was so interested in *Lies and Weddings*.  \n   - I can totally see why people love his writing. This one was entertaining to listen to.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - What I enjoyed the most was how the rich people in the story complained about their privileges and how they felt they were being wronged. That was the funniest thing.  \n   - Or, them complaining about the most minor things. SMH. I did enjoy how Kevin Kwan played upon that within the book.  \n   - Their classism was insane, and that was just one of the “isms” in the book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - I will say, there were some slow parts in this one, and that is the reason it has taken me so long to finish it. I would have to listen in spurts.  \n\n- **Potential for Adaptation:**  \n   - However, I can say that this one would be amazing if it were moved to screen. I could visualize these hilarious scenes as if it were a movie.  \n   - I do hope it is moved to screen in the future because I would be all over it.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - The audiobook was also well done. The narrator, Jing Lusi, did a wonderful job with the characters and their different voices.  \n   - I was able to clearly distinguish each character, which is important when there are several different ones.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Lies and Weddings* was an entertaining and humorous read, with sharp social commentary on classism and privilege.

The broad strokes are very similar: rich Asian families behaving badly (this time located in Britain instead of Shanghai), a domineering matriarch trying to control her children, and a handsome, famous male heir who just wants to be with the girl next door.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story features a lot of infighting, gaslighting, guilt-tripping, and over-the-top excess (e.g., a wedding on a sacred volcano in Hawai’i). It’s a fun, escapist read that offers a guilty pleasure of peeking into the lifestyles of the obnoxiously wealthy and seeing how they make just as big a mess of things as we do.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The sharp-tongued matriarch in this story doesn’t feel sympathetic; unlike in *Crazy Rich Asians*, where we disagreed with her but understood her motivations, the mother here feels purely controlling and manipulative, with no redeeming qualities even by the end. The ensemble cast is varied and amusing but doesn’t feel as deep or developed as in *Crazy Rich Asians*.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The novel is a great romp, perfect for when you want something funny and light. It’s an enjoyable, fast-paced read, though it doesn’t quite hit the high notes it aims for.  \n\n- **Comparison to Series Length:**  \n  It might not be entirely fair to compare this standalone novel to the *Crazy Rich Asians* trilogy, as the latter had three books to delve deeper into the characters’ lives.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Lies and Weddings* is a fun, escapist novel that fans of Kevin Kwan’s *Crazy Rich Asians* will likely enjoy.

In my opinion, no one writes about luxury better than Kevin Kwan. The slightly cynical, bitter thread running through the book added a tiny hint of reality to an otherwise over-the-top world.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were extreme yet very flat.

There was no character development, no transformation, and no depth added to any of them.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  The bitter thread in the story ended up going nowhere. No changes were made, no person was transformed, and no situation improved—not even on a microscopic level. There were no wrongs righted, and little justice was served.  \n\n- **Potential for a Sequel:**  \n  Maybe there will be a sequel where we see some character development in Arabella, some action from Rufus, and some depth from Eden.

            "This novel resembles *Crazy Rich Asians*, showcasing a light and extravagant narrative. The story follows English Lord Gresham, on the verge of losing his vast estate, and his Chinese wife, Arabella, who devises a plan for their son Rufus to marry into wealth to preserve their property. Rufus is in love with Eden, the next-door neighbor who works as an NHS doctor and is the adopted daughter of Thomas, Lord Gresham’s best friend. A pivotal twist reveals that Eden is the daughter of Mary, who, despite facing pressure to abort, chose to have Eden and later moved to Canada. After Mary's death, Thomas adopted Eden, who eventually becomes a billionaire, making her the perfect match for Rufus and securing the family's ancestral home.",
            "Arabella is openly manipulative, showing blatant disdain for Eden. In contrast, Rufus is a romantic, placing his love for Eden above his family's financial concerns. Eden, a strong and independent doctor and billionaire, challenges Arabella's initial judgment of her as unworthy.",

            "The story offers intriguing insights into the racial dynamics of colonial Hong Kong, particularly the unspoken hierarchy that favored the British. Arabella's awakening to her deeper animosity towards the silent locals, rather than the British, underscores the internalized racism and societal tensions of the era."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Wealth and Excess:**  \n  The novel showcases an extraordinary level of wealth, far beyond what is typically considered \"rich.\" The term \"crazy rich\" barely scratches the surface of the opulence depicted. The story is filled with imaginative excesses, from luxury cars like the Ferrari 250 GTO to exotic locations such as Venice and Marrakech.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The plot is a friends-to-lovers story set against a backdrop of high society, family drama, and secrets. While the plot itself is not the main draw, the global setting and the intricate web of relationships add depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Humor and Satire:**  \n  The book is a comedy of manners, filled with witty commentary and satirical elements. The author employs fourth-wall-breaking footnotes and Easter eggs to add layers of humor and cleverness. The law firm of Carlisle, Caffey, Wiedlin, Shock, and Valentine is a particularly delightful nod for those in the know.\n\n- **Representation and Escapism:**  \n  The novel offers a refreshing dose of Asian representation, which is a welcome change in the genre. It serves as a perfect escapist read, providing a satirical glimpse into the lives of the ultra-wealthy.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a lavish, humorous, and satirical exploration of extreme wealth and high society. While the plot may not be its strongest suit, the book excels in its imaginative excesses, witty commentary, and rich representation. It’s an ideal summer read for those seeking escapism and a peek into the world of the .001%.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

She legit made my blood boil, and I dreaded every conversation she was a part of.  \n\n- **Dialogue Authenticity:**  \n  Some of the dialogue sounded Riverdale-esque.

I found myself thinking, “No way you just made that up.”  \n\n- **Descriptive Overload:**  \n  The super long, frequent, and overly detailed descriptions of people’s outfits, mansions, private planes, or yachts became overkill. While I understand the story revolves around absurdly wealthy people, the excessive descriptions felt unnecessary. I started skipping the full-page descriptions that appeared almost every other chapter. These lengthy descriptions also made me dislike the relevant characters, even if we weren’t supposed to, because I found myself thinking, “Why are you such a gluttonous freak?”  \n\n- **Plot Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the issues, I enjoyed the plot and thought it was a fun read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its flaws—particularly with an unsympathetic main character, unrealistic dialogue, and excessive descriptions—the engaging plot made it an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

            "The novel offers an enjoyable, light read with moderate stakes. The author's penchant for hyperbole is evident, portraying characters who are excessively beautiful, impeccably dressed, and situated in the most exclusive settings. However, these characters lack self-awareness and indulge in extravagant behavior driven by their wealth.",
            "The central moral of these stories advocates for marrying for love rather than wealth, with the unexpected twist that the meek often find themselves inheriting fortune and happiness. In Chapter 10, the author shifts focus from luxury brands and exclusive settings to address broader societal issues. He critiques excessive consumerism in America and its repercussions on immigration, urban housing, and even Donald Judd’s art in Texas. While applauding NHS workers, he also sheds light on their challenging working conditions and the housing crisis. This shift introduces a layer of depth and awareness to the novel, contrasting sharply with the lighter tone of the earlier chapters."

While the excessive focus on materialism and the morally ambiguous actions of some characters can be overwhelming, the inclusion of relatable and sympathetic characters keeps the narrative engaging.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, like much of the nobility, they are secretly broke (reminiscent of *Downton Abbey*).  \n   - Rufus's mother wants him to marry for money, but he is in love with Dr. Eden Tong, who grew up next door.  \n   - A mysterious Filipino billionaire, who is dying of cancer, plays a significant role in the story.  \n   - The book is centered around misunderstandings, the lives of crazy rich Asians, lies, and a wedding.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The characters are well-crafted and intriguing.  \n   - However, the Hong Kong mother character doesn't measure up to Nick's mother from *Crazy Rich Asians*.  \n\n- **Storytelling and Execution:**  \n   - While the premise is excellent, the storytelling falls flat compared to *Crazy Rich Asians*.  \n   - The depiction of opulence in *Crazy Rich Asians* was much more impressive.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending is partly satisfying but could have been better executed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book has a strong premise and engaging characters, but the storytelling doesn't live up to the standards set by *Crazy Rich Asians*. While the ending provides some satisfaction, it leaves room for improvement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She was very one-note.\n   - The rest of the characters seemed like some of the expensive accessories that were constantly described.\n\n- **Luxury and Lifestyle Descriptions:**\n   - I enjoy vicariously reading about luxury and bougie lifestyles, but this was just too much and kind of nauseating.\n\n- **Engagement and Completion:**\n   - Despite its flaws, I didn’t stop reading (DNF) because some part of me still enjoys these types of mindless commentaries on the uber-rich and their ridiculous lifestyle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book didn’t live up to the charm of *Crazy Rich Asians*, it was still an entertaining read due to my investment in the characters and the allure of the over-the-top luxury. However, the lack of nuanced character development and the excessive focus on materialism made it less enjoyable than its predecessor.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance lacks the classic \"will they or won't they\" tension, which diminishes its engagement. Instead, the main plot focuses on the mother’s attempts to maintain their lavish lifestyle, providing much of the drama.",
            "The story features a female protagonist who is a medical doctor and a close friend of the Gresham family, a half-Chinese British aristocratic lineage. In contrast, the male lead's mother is depicted as manipulative, preoccupied with preserving their extravagant lifestyle. However, the portrayal of this mother is criticized for being unrealistic, particularly her dramatic loss of control, which appears inconsistent with her background as a woman who triumphed over racism to ascend to the upper echelons of British society.",

I missed the character antics from his previous books, and I hope his next main character is a little more like Rachel and a little less of a snore like Eden.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  I did enjoy reading about all of the different luxuries of this world, and it was fun to hop from one glamorous setting to the next.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I thought the two main characters, Rufus and Eden, were kind of a drag… I would honestly just describe them as giant dweebs! I’m not sure if this was because Kwan was writing from a British perspective this time or not.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  I thought the mystery element to the story was incredibly obvious from the beginning and still tied up a little too neatly in the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the luxurious settings and glamorous world-building, *Lies and Weddings* fell short compared to Kwan’s previous works. The main characters lacked charm, and the mystery felt predictable and overly tidy. Despite this, I’ll continue to read Kwan’s future novels, hoping for a return to the engaging characters and spark of his earlier stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story felt very predictable, and everything moved too fast, leaving little room for depth or emotional engagement.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  A lot of characters were introduced, but none of them, not even the main characters, were developed in-depth. The lack of depth made it difficult to connect with them or care about their journeys.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Relationship Build-Up:**  \n  The ending didn’t evoke the emotional response I hoped for. There wasn’t enough build-up in the relationships or emotions to make the conclusion satisfying or impactful.  \n\n- **Antagonist's Role and Depth:**  \n  Arabella, the antagonist, was effective in her role of annoying the readers, but I wished she had some redemption or explanation for her behavior. Instead, her character was reduced to a stereotype of a \"Chinese mother,\" which felt shallow and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  I loved *Crazy Rich Asians* and tried not to compare this book to it until I finished reading. Unfortunately, this novel didn’t reach the same level of quality or enjoyment for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I typically enjoy Kevin Kwan’s writing, this book fell short in several areas, including pacing, character development, and emotional depth.

This dynamic is central to the story and shapes the characters' actions and relationships.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters are well-drawn, with some being kind-hearted, while others prioritize money above all else. Many of them are preoccupied with appearances and impressing others, which adds depth to their personalities and motivations.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story is engaging and enjoyable, blending both happy and sad endings.

Their last interaction, marked by an unreciprocated kiss, added an extra layer of sadness. I would have preferred an alternate, happier ending for him, as I genuinely liked his character. On the other hand, Rufus comes across as overly perfect, bordering on annoying, while Eden is similarly portrayed as flawless.

While the author still crafts a story about the insanely rich engaging in over-the-top displays of wealth, I wasn’t as swept away as I was with the earlier series.  \n\n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n  The plot felt entirely predictable to me. There was some curiosity about how the characters would navigate their way out of financial ruin, but the resolution lacked the excitement and surprise I was hoping for.  \n\n- **Character Relatability and Endearment:**  \n  None of the characters really stood out as endearing to me. Even the Tong family, who are portrayed as down-to-earth, had an air of unbelievability that made it hard for me to fully connect with them. Their situations felt like too much of a stretch to be convincing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel maintains the author’s signature style of showcasing the extravagant lives of the ultra-wealthy, it fell short of the charm and engagement I experienced with the *Crazy Rich Asians* trilogy.

The narrative focuses on a wealthy family living on a large estate and a doctor and his daughter residing in a cottage on the same property.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The Asian mother is a central figure who is desperately trying to marry off her daughters to wealthy men to maintain her lavish lifestyle. This creates tension and drives much of the conflict in the story.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  The family's financial situation unravels as they discover they are broke and owe a significant amount of borrowed money to a rich businessman. This leads to the threat of their home being repossessed, adding a layer of urgency and drama to the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has an engaging story and well-developed characters, the reliance on misunderstandings and prolonged separation between the lovers detracted from my enjoyment. The financial downfall of the family and the resulting conflict were compelling, but the overall theme didn't fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I feel like my imagination didn’t fully capture the richness of his writing, and seeing it on screen would be spectacular.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Initially, I found it a bit challenging to keep track of all the characters, but as I got to know them better, I became more invested in their stories.  \n- **Consistency with Author’s Style:**  \n  The novel aligns perfectly with what I’ve come to expect from Kevin Kwan—witty, engaging, and full of the same charm as his previous works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful read, filled with Kevin Kwan’s signature humor and vivid storytelling. It’s a worthy addition to his body of work, and I would love to see it adapted into a movie to fully bring his descriptions to life.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story leaves the reader wanting more closure and a stronger sense of justice.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

While the overall tone was engaging, some exchanges felt like bad fan fiction dialogue, which detracted from the experience.\n- **Format Recommendation:** The audio version might be a better choice for those who can overlook the occasional weak dialogue, as it could enhance the overall enjoyment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel is a highly entertaining and fast-paced read, especially for those who appreciate its over-the-top style and Houston references. However, the writing quality is uneven, with some dialogue feeling subpar. If this isn’t a deal breaker, the book is worth a try—perhaps even more so in audio format.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The inclusion of these themes detracted from my enjoyment.\n\n- **Personal Preference and Expectations:**  \n  This is my least favorite of Kevin Kwan’s books. While I appreciate his storytelling, the shift in tone and focus didn’t align with what I typically seek in his work.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I remain fascinated by Kevin Kwan’s depiction of the ultra-rich, the inclusion of political themes in this book diminished my enjoyment. I prefer his works to focus on escapism and pleasure rather than delving into heavier, opinion-driven topics.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot felt predictably straightforward, which left me frustrated for much of the novel. It seemed to hint at a potential social commentary on the elite and the discrimination faced by certain characters, but I was left wondering if that was the author's true intention.",
            "The characters lacked development, remaining static from beginning to end. Annabella stood out as the most fully realized character, yet she felt like a rehash of familiar tropes from the author's prior novels. I struggled to connect emotionally with any of the characters, except for feeling frustration towards Annabella. The romantic tension between Rufus and Eden was minimal, and the dynamics with Rufus’s two sisters felt flat and lacked depth."

This lack of realism undermines the plot.  \n\n- **Author’s Formulaic Approach:**  \n   - Kevin Kwan hasn’t deviated from his established formula since *CRA*.

            "The story gains traction when it tackles contemporary economic struggles, such as debt payments, making it relatable. However, this momentum is hampered by unnecessary details, like Eden's observations of furniture after waking up from a hangover. Additionally, the plot feels predictable and geared toward a younger audience, relying on clichéd conflicts like Solene’s jealousy and the mother’s self-centeredness.",
            "The story features several unlikable characters, particularly Solene, the male protagonist's love rival, who is entirely unsympathetic. Eden, the protagonist, appears oblivious to the lifestyles surrounding her, which contradicts her upbringing. Solene's dual nature is evident when she apologizes for mistaking Eden for the help, only to later reveal her jealousy. The mother is selfish and manipulative, turning the wedding into a spectacle centered on herself while disregarding her son’s past relationship with Eden. Overall, the narrative feels dated, relying on clichés such as men being overly enamored by the mere presence of women and extravagant weddings lacking meaningful substance.",
            "The author tends to tell rather than show, often stating that the love rival isn’t Solene’s type instead of conveying this through her actions. Additionally, the detailed descriptions of settings, like the room where Eden wakes up, feel excessive and out of character for her to notice right away. The reliance on overly sophisticated adjectives comes across as forced and unnatural, as if the author is trying too hard to achieve a refined tone.",
            "The inclusion of lengthy footnotes and extensive lists of schools feels excessive and detracts from the narrative. Additionally, the character names lack creativity and memorability, which diminishes the overall immersion in the story.",
            "The story reinforces stereotypes and fetishization, particularly in its portrayal of \"exotic, foreign\" women and its emphasis on royal European whites and Asians."

Her lack of awareness about her son’s childhood relationship with Eden is frustrating.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story begins to get interesting and relatable when addressing modern economic struggles like debt payments, but this momentum is disrupted by unnecessary details, such as Eden noticing furniture after waking up from a hangover.  \n   - The plot feels predictable and middle-grade, with clichéd conflicts like Solene’s jealousy and the mother’s self-centered behavior.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n   - The author relies heavily on telling rather than showing, such as explicitly stating that the love rival isn’t Solene’s type instead of demonstrating it through actions.  \n   - Descriptions of settings, like the room Eden wakes up in, are overly detailed and out of character for her to notice immediately.  \n   - The repetitive use of specific, overly sophisticated adjectives feels forced and unnatural, as if the author is trying too hard to sound refined.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n   - The story perpetuates stereotypes and fetishization, particularly with the portrayal of “exotic, foreign” women and the focus on royal European whites and Asians.  \n   - The narrative feels outdated, with tropes like men being overly enamored by a woman’s arrival and extravagant weddings that lack depth.  \n\n- **World-Building and Details:**  \n   - The inclusion of lists of schools and overly long footnotes feels unnecessary and adds little to the story.  \n   - Character names are forgettable and lack creativity, which detracts from the overall immersion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel touches on some relatable themes, such as economic struggles, it is overshadowed by unlikable characters, predictable plotlines, and a writing style that feels forced and repetitive.
