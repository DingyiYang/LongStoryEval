She is secretly a \"chosen one\" due to her goddess descendant blood and is sent to the court of The Half King, who is cursed to be a half-drunk king by day and a ghostly figure at night, destined to fade away entirely.  \n\n- **Execution and Writing Style:**  \n  The execution of the book was bland and uninspired. It felt like the \"unbuttered dry white toast of the romantasy world,\" lacking depth and flavor.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Value:**  \n  I do not recommend purchasing the sprayed edges edition. If you are still curious about the book, consider borrowing it from Kindle Unlimited (KU) or your local library instead of buying it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the book was intriguing, the execution fell flat, making it a disappointing read.

The beginning suggested a king who didn’t care about his people, but by the end, he suddenly had a lot of supporters, which felt inconsistent.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story moved quickly, which kept me engaged, but the twist at the end seemed to come out of nowhere and left me questioning certain aspects, like the ages of the characters.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  There were some really great side characters who added depth to the story. However, the main characters, particularly the king and Cerise, could have been more developed, especially in their romantic relationship.  \n\n- **Ending and Potential for Sequel:**  \n  The ending was intriguing and left me curious enough to consider picking up the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an amazing premise and some strong elements, such as engaging side characters and a fast-paced plot, it fell short in areas like romance development, world-building, and consistency. The instalove dynamic and underdeveloped magic and politics were disappointing, but the intriguing ending leaves potential for improvement in a sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

For instance, Nina's indifference toward her baby—knowing it's not her firstborn and therefore not cursed—and Father Padron’s physical decline during his journey, which parallels Celise’s near-death experiences, serve as subtle yet effective foreshadowing. The ending hints at the potential for a sequel, which I would eagerly welcome, particularly to learn more about Nina's fate. Overall, I found the conclusion satisfying, despite some lingering questions.",

This combination didn’t work well and detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Audio Narration (if applicable):**  \n  The audio narration was the strongest aspect, earning a higher rating. It was well-done and added some value to the experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was a letdown. While the premise had potential, the execution fell flat, particularly in terms of the romance, character development, and tonal consistency. The audio narration was a highlight, but it wasn’t enough to save the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Story: 2 ⭐️  \n- Steam: 3 🔥  \n- Audio: 4 🎧"

The story leaned heavily into YA tropes, which might not appeal to readers seeking a more mature narrative. Despite these shortcomings, the book showed potential, particularly in its magical elements.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It has potential but feels underdeveloped.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book is a swift read, skillfully weaving together mystery, romance, friendships, and adventure. I see it bridging both YA and NA genres due to Cerise’s naivety and the presence of a sex scene. Although the tone leans more towards YA, the mature elements elevate it into NA territory.",
            "Cerise, the main character, embodies optimism and resilience, her sunny disposition occasionally bordering on naivety. However, her genuine heart and capacity for love are undeniably refreshing. Kian, the half-king, and his best friend Daerick form a humorous and dynamic trio with Cerise. Their youthful antics align well with their ages—Kian is just shy of 21—though at times, I wished they exhibited a bit more maturity. The romance unfolds gradually but culminates in a steamy scene. Cerise and Kian's quick connection feels appropriate for the story, and I appreciated how conflicts were resolved through open communication.",
            "The world-building is captivating, centered around the allied realm that reveres the goddess Shiera. However, a curse has befallen the people, particularly affecting Kian, who transforms into shadows at night, ultimately leading to his disappearance. The rich setting and magical elements enhance the story's depth.",
            "The story tackles dark themes such as self-harm, gender inequality, and religious questioning, yet Cerise's optimism brings a light-hearted touch. It also examines the complexities of difficult choices and culminates in a surprising twist."

        "conclusion": "This was an engaging read with a mix of mystery, romance, and adventure. Cerise’s sunny personality balanced Kian’s shadowy curse perfectly.

The allied realm worships a goddess named Shiera, but an event cursed the people. Kian’s curse, in particular, is to turn into shadows by night until he eventually disappears. The setting and magical elements added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Cerise, the main character, is sunshine personified—optimistic and resilient. While she came off as naive at times, her heart and willingness to love were refreshing. Kian, the half-king, and Daerick, his best friend, formed a funny and dynamic trio with Cerise. Their youthful behavior made sense given their ages (Kian is just shy of 21), though I occasionally wished they acted a bit older.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance starts slow but develops into a steamy scene. Cerise and Kian fall for each other quickly, but their relationship felt fitting for the story. Conflicts were resolved through communication, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The story explores dark themes like self-harm, gender inequality, and questioning religion, but Cerise’s optimism kept it light-hearted at times. The book also delves into making difficult choices and features a surprising twist at the end.  \n\n- **Pacing and Genre:**  \n  The book was a quick read, blending mystery, romance, friendships, and a quest. I categorized it as both YA and NA due to Cerise’s naivety and the inclusion of a sex scene.

            "This book captivated me with its themes of cursed heirs, a shadow king, and a richly detailed world accented by purple stenciled edges. The story follows Cerise, a sheltered seer in training, who is selected as an emissary to the cursed King Kian. The slow-burn romance and the quest to break the curse maintained my engagement, although the pacing lagged around the 70% mark before it picked up once more.",
            "Cerise, the female protagonist, begins her journey as a naive young woman, a reflection of her sheltered upbringing. Her determination to break the curse, despite lacking a clear gift, makes her a captivating character. King Kian, the male lead, embodies tragedy—consumed by shadows and struggling with his own curse. Following the development of their character arcs is genuinely rewarding. Initially, both characters may come across as unlikable, but they experience significant growth, both individually and as a pair. The well-developed side characters, particularly the cursed families and the magic-wielding priests, add enriching depth to the narrative.",
            "The third-person perspective in this story is highly effective, offering a wider view of the characters and their world. The descriptive language and vivid imagery, like the purple stenciled edges, enhance the book's charm.",

His shift from a bitter drunk to a lovestruck figure seemed abrupt and unconvincing. Lacking insight into his inner thoughts, Kian never emerged as a fully realized individual. **Side Characters:** Most were enjoyable and engaging.

The shocking revelation that Cerise's father is Father Padron and her sister Nina is her mother was unexpected and expertly handled. The epilogue left me stunned, particularly with the twist of Nina's resurrection by Sheira. While the ending was satisfying, it also left me eager for the next installment. Cerise's ascension to high priestess and her preparations to become queen hint at an exciting future. Additionally, the unresolved tension surrounding Father Padron's escape and the potential dangers of Nina's revival suggest a darker, more complex conflict ahead.

            "The story unfolds at a rapid pace across its 512 pages, propelling readers through a whirlwind of relationships, quests, and survival. While this creates a compulsively engaging read, it can also feel rushed at times, offering limited opportunities for deeper exploration of events or character dynamics.",
            "Cerise Solon is a captivating protagonist grappling with her inability to foresee the future, alongside her unique capacity to alter the course of visions. Her journey from the temple to the capital, intertwined with her mission to break the curse, is engaging. However, the story would benefit from deeper character development, especially for Cerise and King Kian Mortara, whose fate—vanishing at night and disappearing forever at 21—adds emotional depth to the narrative.",

Additionally, the political machinations and power struggles within the capital further enrich the world-building.",

It delves into themes of fate, power, and betrayal, with Cerise believing that the goddess Shiera is poised to bless their mission to lift the curse. The blend of political intrigue and supernatural elements enriches the narrative, adding depth to the unfolding drama."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story races along, covering a great deal in its 512 pages. Events move very quickly, with barely time for the characters to draw breath before leaping into relationships, quests, and survival. While this makes for a compulsive read, it sometimes feels rushed, leaving little room for deeper exploration of events or character dynamics.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel introduces a rich and intriguing world, including the temple of Shiera, the kingdom of Mortara, and the history of the Great Betrayal. The concept of the goddess Shiera, with her two faces (one benign and one wrathful), and the curse on the four families adds depth and mystery to the setting. The political intrigue and power games in the capital further enhance the world-building.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Cerise Solon is a compelling protagonist, struggling with her lack of foresight and her unique ability to change the pattern of visions. Her journey from the temple to the capital and her involvement in the quest to end the curse are engaging. However, there is a desire for more character development, particularly for Cerise and King Kian Mortara, whose fate—disappearing at night and vanishing forever at 21—adds emotional weight to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Conflict:**  \n  The central conflict revolves around the curse on the four families and the search for the Petros blade as a potential solution. Themes of fate, power, and betrayal are explored, with Cerise feeling that the goddess Shiera is ready to bless their efforts to end the curse. The interplay between political intrigue and the supernatural elements creates a layered narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is engaging and keeps the reader hooked, making the book a compulsive read. However, the rapid pacing sometimes detracts from the opportunity to delve deeper into character relationships and emotional moments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a promising start to a new series, with a rich world, intriguing characters, and a fast-paced plot. While the story is compelling and hard to put down, the rapid progression of events leaves little room for deeper character development and emotional exploration. I look forward to seeing how the story and characters evolve in future installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "The synopsis hinted at a compelling political fantasy set in court, but the story ultimately centered on the main characters searching for magical objects, which felt tedious. The characters achieved success in nearly every endeavor, and the rapid-fire revelations at the end left me feeling disoriented.",
            "The romance in the story felt rushed and underdeveloped, lacking the depth needed to engage readers. In contrast, the bromance was both believable and quotable, further emphasizing the shortcomings of the central romance. Additionally, the characters came across as flat and one-dimensional, contributing to the overall lack of depth in the novel.",
            "I appreciated the concept of the curses, the magic system, and the rich lore that accompanied them. The novel has a solid foundation but would benefit from more thorough editing to enhance its depth. The worldbuilding and themes of religious trauma and the oppression of women were effectively portrayed. However, I would have liked to see more supporting female characters, as the female main character is predominantly surrounded by men throughout the story.",

The plot dragged, the characters lacked depth, and the romance was underdeveloped.

It felt like a very mid novel, particularly due to the characters and the long travel plot.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Themes:**  \n  The worldbuilding and themes of religious trauma and oppression of women were well done. However, I wish there had been more supporting female characters instead of the FMC being surrounded by men almost the entire time.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The synopsis promised a strong political fantasy at court, but instead, the story focused on the MCs finding magic objects, which dragged. The characters succeeded in nearly every attempt, and the breakneck revelations at the end gave me whiplash.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  There were no content warnings for the FMC’s heritage reveal or the on-page deaths of children during a battle, which I found disappointing.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  The romance felt very insta-lovey and underdeveloped. The bromance was far more believable and quotable, which highlighted the lack of depth in the main romance.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt flat and one-dimensional, which contributed to the novel’s lack of depth.  \n\n- **Magic System and Lore:**  \n  I liked the idea of the curses, the magic system, and the lore surrounding them. The novel has good bones but needed stronger editing to fully flesh it out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had potential, particularly in its worldbuilding and themes, but it fell short in execution.

After the Reverend Mother tests her abilities without finding clarity in her path, Cerise is sent to the royal court to serve as the King's Lady of the Temple.

Why were they isolated in different cities? More detail in these areas would have greatly enhanced the story.",

Set in a kingdom cursed for its ancestors' sins, the narrative follows Cerise as she transitions from a sheltered life in servitude to the Lady of the Temple for the \"Half King.\" Her journey revolves around breaking the curse, saving the kingdom, and protecting her beloved. With secrets, hidden adversaries, and a race against time, the plot remains engaging and filled with tension.",

His intriguing relationship with Delora contrasts with his evolving dynamic with Cerise, creating a compelling narrative. **Supporting Characters:** The interactions among characters, particularly between Kian and Delora, are well-crafted and enrich the story. While the romance between Cerise and Kian is central to the plot and develops quickly, it is enjoyable and brings emotional depth.

However, her sheltered upbringing has left her emotionally immature, giving her a youthful demeanor despite being in her early twenties. The supporting cast is charming and adds to the narrative, featuring a handsome young king with a penchant for playful banter, his witty best friend who always has a smile, and an adorably ugly puppy with a hint of goblin lineage. There's also a grouchy old priest whose feelings toward Cerise are intriguingly ambiguous.

She’s very naive and stubbornly religious, but then suddenly abandons her convictions and believes strangers without much hesitation. This inconsistency made it difficult to get a clear sense of her character. I would have loved to see more depth and inner conflict as she grappled with her biases and came to terms with her feelings.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story suffers from a few too many plot holes and uneven pacing. The writing style skips briskly from scene to scene, leaving little time for characters—or readers—to process major revelations. However, the last third of the book really picked up. The fast-paced events in the final chapters were exciting enough to keep me hooked.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I struggled to stay fully engaged due to the underdeveloped characters and pacing issues.

            "One drawback was the noticeable amount of telling rather than showing, which felt somewhat jarring at the beginning. However, this did not significantly diminish my overall enjoyment of the book.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the magic system, especially the intriguing concept of firstborn curses and the contrasting perceptions of magic within and outside the temple. The unique element of a King who literally vanishes into shadows each night added remarkable depth to the story.",

However, this did not detract significantly from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Author’s Perspective:**  \n  - I felt a strong connection to the religious themes, as if the author had a religious background and understood the performative pressures of growing up in such an environment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis romantasy novel is a captivating blend of escapism, slow-burn romance, and epic adventure, with a well-crafted magic system and timely themes of compassion and leadership.

            "The book had great potential but ultimately fell flat and felt one-dimensional. The Half King's curse of disappearing into haunted shadows each night was intriguing but underutilized, failing to enrich the story. His primary role appeared to be his relationship with the female main character, which inexplicably boosts her magical powers.",

The female main character's frequent references to her piety become tedious, while the Half King shifts from a compelling antagonist to a passive figure who lacks meaningful involvement in the plot. Additionally, the side characters are poorly fleshed out and lack depth.",

For instance, Kian, the Half King, declares, \"I like you. I like you very much,\" while the FMC struggles to respond, which feels immature given their ages of 19 and nearly 21. Despite this childish tone, the book is not intended for a younger audience due to its spicy scenes.",

            "I found Cerise to be a charming character—sweet and sheltered, she proves that not every female main character needs to be a strong, fighting badass to be engaging. However, the book often overshadows her. Despite being the titular character, Cerise feels somewhat irrelevant, especially with most of the supporting cast being male, including the one who helps her access her powers—powers she discovers through a sexual relationship with a man.

I almost wish it had been marketed as YA.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I liked Cerise as a character. She was sweet and sheltered, and I appreciated that not every female main character (FMC) has to be a strong, fighting badass to be interesting. However, the book overshadowed her. Despite being the titular character, she felt fairly irrelevant, and most of the other characters were men, including the one who teaches her to access her power—a power she discovers through sex with a man.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationships:**  \n  The relationship between Cerise and Kian felt forced and rushed, lacking believability. I almost wished Kian wasn’t involved with her and instead had a relationship with the courtesan, or perhaps for that relationship to eventually end. It might have flowed better if developed over multiple books.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Dynamics:**  \n  I enjoyed the banter between the friends—Daerick, Kian, and Cerise. Their interactions added a layer of charm to the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The magic system and world-building were intriguing, though they could have used more elaboration to feel fully realized.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book seemed to attempt a critique of male-dominated religions and their efforts to take power from women. This theme was interesting and added depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its strengths, such as the likable protagonist, engaging banter, and thought-provoking themes, it also had notable flaws, including overshadowed characters, rushed relationships, and underdeveloped world-building.

            "While I wouldn't classify this as a spicy book, it does contain a few intimate scenes that feel purposeful rather than gratuitous, unlike many recent romantasy novels. However, I felt there was a lack of build-up to the relationship; the main characters spent little time together before making declarations of love, which made the romance feel rushed. Additionally, the love interest lacked depth and seemed to exist solely as a romantic figure, making it difficult to connect with their role in the story.",

            "When approaching this book, it's essential to anticipate a story that follows the pacing typical of YA fantasy. Although the characters are 19-20 years old and the book is marketed as new adult, the rhythm of the narrative aligns more closely with that of young adult fiction."

        "conclusion": "This book has an intriguing world and plot, with some unexpected twists, but the pacing feels more like YA fantasy despite its new adult marketing.

The characters are 19-20, so it’s marketed as \"new adult,\" but the pacing aligns more with YA.  \n\n- **Romance and Intimacy:**  \n  I wouldn’t describe this as a \"spicy\" book, but there are a couple of intimate scenes. Unlike many romantasy books I’ve read recently, these scenes felt purposeful and not randomly thrown in. However, I think there could have been more build-up to the relationship. The main characters barely spent any time together before declarations were made, which made the romance feel rushed.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The love interest had no personality and felt like they existed solely to be the love interest. This lack of depth made it harder to connect with their role in the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Memorability:**  \n  While I enjoyed the book and found it to be a good time, it wasn’t super memorable.

However, the middle third felt very chronological and repetitive, with a \"this happened, then that happened\" structure that slowed the pacing.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Cerise's interactions with her family were frustrating. She often noticed their evasiveness but never confronted them about it, which felt like a missed opportunity for deeper character development.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Tension:**  \n  The story was very linear, and even though the characters seemed to be winging their adventure (especially during the ceremony), there was never any real doubt about their success. This lack of tension gave the book a YA feel, which might not appeal to all readers.  \n\n- **Themes and Ideas:**  \n  I appreciated the exploration of questioning religion and its role in society. The idea of finding your own path and sense of guidance, rather than abandoning hope entirely, was particularly compelling.  \n\n- **World-Building and Character Development:**  \n  Overall, I felt the world and characters could have been more developed. Knowing that a sequel is being written, I hope to see more depth and growth in these areas.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an engaging start and finish, the middle section dragged due to its repetitive structure. The characters and world-building showed potential but lacked depth, and the linear plot with predictable outcomes gave the story a YA vibe. Despite these flaws, the thematic exploration of religion and self-discovery was thought-provoking and enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There’s a lot of potential for the story to develop further, and many plot lines are introduced in this first book.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Genre:**  \n  This book is labeled as New Adult, but it feels more suited for an older Young Adult (YA) audience.

While it leaned more toward YA Romantasy than I initially expected, it delivered a compelling narrative with plenty of potential for the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Cerise's naivety and excessive trust rendered some of her decisions hard to support.

I’d love to hear more!  \n  - Hope you enjoy *The Half King* as much as I did. Happy reading 📖.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a hidden gem in the Romantasy genre, offering a compelling story with well-developed characters and meaningful romantic scenes. Despite not being overly graphic, the intimate moments enhance the plot and character dynamics. It’s a highly engaging read that left me wanting more, even though a sequel or prequel seems unlikely. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh and underrated story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The reveal about Nina was both satisfying and unexpected. I was initially concerned about a potential love triangle, so I was relieved that it didn't materialize. While the development of Cerise and Kian's relationship felt somewhat rushed, I prefer this pacing over a drawn-out series.",
            "Cerise is a truly exceptional main female character; I never found myself frustrated with her or her choices. My only critique is that her loss of faith in the Order's teachings felt a bit abrupt.",

I picked it up as a potential replacement for *Throne of Glass*, as I no longer wish to support that author, and it exceeded my expectations—perhaps even better. The epilogue left me intrigued and eager for a sequel if the author decides to write one."

It felt very \"Beauty and the Beast\" coded, which initially drew me in.  \n\n- **Romance Execution:**  \n  The execution of the romance fell flat for me. It leaned heavily into instalove, and the connection between the characters felt off.

There wasn’t enough time spent on character development or crafting a tight, engaging narrative.  \n\n- **Genre Comparison:**  \n  This book reinforced why I tend to prefer epic fantasy or sci-fi over romantasy. Many romantasy books, including this one, seem to focus too much on fluffy romantic elements at the expense of deeper storytelling and world-building.  \n\n- **Personal Appeal:**  \n  While the premise was intriguing, the execution didn’t resonate with me.

The story pulled me in immediately, and I enjoyed the air of mystery surrounding Cerise and her magical talents.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Cerise was a compelling protagonist, and her magical talents added depth to her character. Kian, the handsome and tragic character, was equally intriguing, and his curse heightened the story’s suspense.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The forbidden love affair between Cerise and Kian was divine and added a layer of emotional intensity to the narrative.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The story did slow down for a bit, but that was not really problematic for me. The slower pace allowed for deeper immersion into the world and characters.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The book had the magical vibes that I look for in a fantasy story. It included elements like generational curses, political intrigue, and plot twists, which enriched the narrative. The side characters were also interesting and added to the overall depth of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a captivating romantasy with a perfect blend of mystery, romance, and magical elements. The characters, especially Cerise and Kian, are well-developed, and their forbidden love adds emotional depth. While the pacing slows at times, it enhances the immersive experience. I highly recommend this to fans of romantasy, generational curses, political intrigue, and slower-paced, character-driven stories.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The romantic dynamic wasn't a traditional enemies-to-lovers trope, but the slow-burn element added depth to the relationship.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nSpice: 🌶️🌶️🌶️"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The main character, Cerise, reminded me of my favorite veiled heroine (from the B&A series) but in a unique way. She is the firstborn of the Famy family, which sets her apart.  \n  - I loved the half-king and his careless attitude, especially in his interactions with his friends.  \n  - I found Nero and Mr. Smart intriguing and hope to learn more about them in future installments.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The world of nobles with curses was fascinating and well-crafted.  \n  - The mix of adventurous tasks, the war between good and evil, and the exploration of love, influence, power struggles, and court politics added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The novel is not your usual fare; it blends multiple elements in an adventurous and engaging way.  \n  - The themes of love, power, and morality were woven seamlessly into the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a fantastic read that combined rich world-building, compelling characters, and a unique blend of adventure, politics, and moral conflict. Cerise stood out as a strong protagonist, and the supporting characters added depth and intrigue. The story left me eager for more, especially to explore the mysteries surrounding Nero and Mr. Smart.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The idea of a naive religious nun discovering her magic is unlocked and powered by sex was particularly jarring.  \n\n- **Concept and Creativity:**  \n  Outside of the unsettling themes, I found the overall concept of the story to be interesting and engaging.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The pacing felt uneven, especially around the 75% mark, where the story seemed to drag. I believe the novel could have been shorter without losing its impact.  \n\n- **Sequel Potential and Standalone Quality:**  \n  While I might consider reading the sequel, the ending didn’t leave me with a strong sense of urgency or cliffhanger. The story stands well on its own as a complete narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents an intriguing concept but is marred by unsettling themes and pacing issues. Despite these flaws, it manages to hold its own as a standalone story, though its sequel potential feels limited.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

This suggests the book didn't leave a strong impression on me.  \n  - Writing reviews later helps me gauge my true feelings, but in this case, it highlights that the book was middling for me.  \n\n- **Genre and Tropes:**  \n  - The book is a romantasy, which is a genre I typically enjoy, but this one felt pretty typical and bland.  \n  - It made me question if I'm currently over romantasy as a genre, as none have been capturing my interest lately.  \n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**  \n  - The romance featured an insta-connection, which isn't inherently bad, but it made the chemistry between the characters feel lacking later in the book.  \n  - The combination of sex and magic was one of my least favorite aspects, further diminishing my enjoyment of the romance.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  - The overall story was interesting, and there were twists that added some intrigue.  \n  - However, the romance and certain elements overshadowed the plot for me.  \n\n- **Likelihood of Continuing the Series:**  \n  - I don't think I will read the next book unless the reviews are decent and pique my interest.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an interesting plot and some twists, the bland romantasy elements, lack of strong chemistry between the characters, and my dislike for the sex-and-magic combination made it a middling read for me. It didn't leave a lasting impression, and I'm unlikely to continue with the series unless future reviews convince me otherwise.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I especially loved Blue, who was so ugly he was cute (I imagined him as a shar pei hyena hybrid).  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  My only issue was that the romance between Cerise and Kian felt like it developed out of nowhere, which was a bit jarring.  \n\n- **Ending and Anticipation for the Sequel:**  \n  The ending left me really looking forward to book two, and I’m especially eager to see more of Nero.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable read with a unique world, well-developed characters, and surprising twists.
