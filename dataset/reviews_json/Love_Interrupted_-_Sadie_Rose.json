            "The novel covers two decades (2004-2024) and is marred by repetitive miscommunications and tedious life details. Its painfully slow pacing makes it hard to stay engaged, resulting in a story that feels like a rollercoaster ride—exhausting and drawn out rather than thrilling.",
            "Nikki's character is frustrating; she obsessively fixates on Brad yet never communicates her feelings clearly. Brad appears selfish and inconsiderate, moving on quickly after their breakup and marrying soon after. Neither character demonstrates significant growth or maturity throughout the story. Their relationship is marred by miscommunication and poor timing, making their eventual reunion feel underwhelming and emotionally flat. The line, *I am Brad Matthews’ girlfriend. And he knows that means something to me,* comes across as sad and hollow after so much buildup.",
            "The book is burdened by excessive details that make it tedious to read. Additionally, the overuse of the miscommunication trope feels repetitive and diminishes the story’s potential.",
            "The book's description set high expectations, but ultimately, I was left disappointed. The happily-ever-after ending felt rushed and failed to deliver the emotional payoff I had anticipated."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Love, Interrupted* by the author was a slow and frustrating read. The characters were unlikable, the pacing was tedious, and the miscommunication trope was overused to the point of annoyance. While I pushed through to the end for the HEA, it didn’t deliver the emotional impact I was hoping for. The story felt doomed from the start, and the characters’ lack of growth made it hard to root for them. This wasn’t the book I expected, and I was left disappointed.",

            "After graduation, Nikki and Brad reconnect and attempt to navigate a romantic relationship. However, Nikki struggles with Brad’s prioritization of his goals and career. While I understand that timing can be tricky, much of their conflict could have been mitigated with better communication. The epilogue provided insight into Brad’s perspective, which I appreciated, but the ending felt rushed. After years of their on-again, off-again dynamic, I believe the story warranted a deeper exploration to deliver the happily-ever-after they deserved.",

As a senior in college, Brad was focused on his studies and not looking for anything serious, while Nikki yearned for a deeper connection. Although Nikki displayed some immaturity in handling their situation, her feelings were understandable. Eventually, Brad enters a new relationship that leads to marriage, prompting Nikki to sever all ties and move on.",
            "I couldn't put the book down, even though it frustrated me at times! The slow start tested my patience, but as the characters became friends, I found myself deeply invested in their story. Still, there were moments when I just wanted to throw something at them!"

I would have appreciated more groveling from the female main character, but considering their long history together, the relatively smooth resolution felt appropriate.",

Both characters start off as young and somewhat naïve, which initially made the female main character a bit frustrating.

The organic development of the relationship over time was truly amazing. While fast burn and insta-love are great, watching two characters really get to know each other and form strong foundations before actually getting together is also amazing in its own way.\n\n- **Character Growth:**  \n  Both characters start young and stupid, and honestly, the FMC grated on my nerves a bit at first. However, watching them grow up only works if you also see the young and stupid parts, so overall, it adds to the story. I loved that the FMC wasn't infallible—she messed up too and had to come to terms with it.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The story dragged a smidge in the middle, but I was anxious to see the resolution, so that's likely why I felt it carried on too long.\n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  Miscommunication plays a big part here, but it goes with the whole \"young and stupid\" theme. As annoying as it is, it totally tracks with the way the characters are at the time it happens. I would have loved to see more groveling on the FMC's part, but given how long they've known each other, it made sense for it to resolve without too much fuss.\n\n- **Theme and Message:**  \n  The author painted a great picture of how sometimes it really is just right people, wrong time. This is a beautiful story of two halves finding each other again and again until they figure out how to fit together.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a heartwarming second-chance romance with well-developed characters and a realistic portrayal of growth and miscommunication. While the pacing slowed in the middle, the emotional payoff and the theme of \"right people, wrong time\" make it a beautiful and satisfying read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
