Unfortunately, the execution of these settings didn’t fully capitalize on their possibilities. The storm and subsequent shenanigans felt underutilized and didn’t contribute significantly to the plot’s progression.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the book was okay, it didn’t leave a lasting impression.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance in this book is subtle and exists more as a subplot rather than the main focus. While there were some good moments between Ness and Hayes, the opportunities to dial up the steamy romance or sexual tension were largely missed. This book is better suited for readers who enjoy a sweet, closed-door romance with minimal spice.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each character is complex and well-developed, with intricate backstories that are gradually revealed. The author did an excellent job of weaving together the interconnected lives of the characters, especially considering the large cast. The characters, all in their 40s, have lengthy pasts that are explored alongside the ongoing plot on the island.  \n\n- **Plot and Suspense:**  \n  The moments of danger are creative and thrilling but remain fairly PG, making it accessible for readers who enjoy suspense without being overwhelmed by intense or traumatic scenes. The last 35% of the book is particularly gripping, featuring narrowly escaped danger, shocking revelations, and looming disaster. Readers with ophidiophobia or claustrophobia may find some scenes challenging.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book blends romance, mystery, and thriller elements, making it a unique read. The tone is sweet and suspenseful, with a focus on character-driven storytelling rather than high-stakes drama. The comparison to \"The OC meets The Unhoneymooners\" is accurate, though this book is significantly less spicy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a well-crafted blend of romance, mystery, and suspense, with a focus on character development and interconnected storylines. While the romance is subtle and the spice level is low, the thrilling plot and complex characters make it an engaging read. It’s perfect for readers who enjoy sweet, closed-door romances with a side of mystery and danger.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall: 3.75/5 (rounded up to 4)  \n- Spice Level: 1/5 (kissing only, one closed-door moment with no detail)"

            "This book was unpredictable and kept me on my toes with its randomness. While it was engaging in a \"what is happening?\" way, I occasionally found it dull. The abandoned mansion scenario lacked urgency, despite the logical stakes.",
            "I appreciated that the characters were primarily in their 40s, offering a refreshing perspective. However, I found the portrayal of gender double standards frustrating; while men were described as \"aging like silver foxes,\" women faced pressure to maintain their appearance and were often compared to younger counterparts. This inconsistency detracted from the overall narrative.",
            "The story exudes cozy mystery vibes with a hint of closed-door romance, though I would categorize it more accurately as general fiction. While the romance felt fresh, it remained surface-level, largely influenced by the characters' pasts. The premise was enjoyable, but the execution fell short of fully captivating me. Some plot elements, such as the characters' access to certain items while stranded, are explained later, yet the overall lack of survival skills among them felt unrealistic."

While it was engaging in a \"what is going on right now?!\" kind of way, I found myself bored at times. The stranded-in-an-abandoned-mansion scenario didn’t feel urgent, even though it logically should have.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  It gave off cozy mystery vibes mixed with closed-door romance, but I’d classify it more as general fiction. The romance felt new and surface-level, based on the characters’ pasts.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters were mostly in their 40s, which I loved and found refreshing. However, there were double standards in how men and women were portrayed—men were described as “aging like silver foxes,” while women were pressured to maintain their appearances and were compared to younger women. This was more annoying than anything else.  \n\n- **Premise and Execution:**  \n  The idea of the book was fun, but the execution didn’t fully captivate me. Some elements, like the characters’ access to certain items while stranded, made sense later, but the lack of survival skills among the characters was a bit over-the-top.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While I didn’t dislike the book, it wasn’t a favorite. I zoned out at times while reading, but I can see it being someone else’s cup of tea.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an unpredictable and quirky read with a fun premise, but it didn’t fully hold my attention.

The rushed ending failed to address key elements, making it feel incomplete. While the book's description piqued my interest and I anticipated a fun, lighthearted summer read, I found myself disappointed and struggling to engage with the narrative. The premise of former TV stars stranded on a deserted island after a shipwreck held promise, but the execution fell short. Although the suggestion that the shipwreck might not have been accidental added an intriguing twist, the overall story felt underdeveloped, with many loose ends left untied.",

The supporting cast was equally frustrating, and their failure to recognize the situation as a setup made them seem unrealistic. Additionally, the rocky relationships among the characters were poorly developed, leaving me feeling disconnected from their dynamics.",

The rocky relationships among the cast members were poorly explained, leaving me disconnected from their dynamics.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The humor, which I assume was intended to be lighthearted, often fell flat. The helplessness and entitlement of the TV stars made me roll my eyes rather than laugh. The tone felt inconsistent, and the attempts at humor clashed with the more serious undertones of the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  The pacing was uneven, and the story dragged in places. The unresolved loose ends, such as Ness's past public behavior and the lack of clarity around the group's relationships, left me unsatisfied. The ending felt rushed and incomplete, failing to tie up key plot points.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting premise, the execution left much to be desired. The characters were unlikable and underdeveloped, the humor missed the mark, and the story suffered from unresolved plotlines and poor pacing. Overall, it was a disappointing read that failed to live up to its potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n  I’m glad I read other reviews beforehand, which prepared me for the fact that this is more of an adventure mystery with a romance-lite subplot rather than a full-on romance novel. This helped set my expectations correctly, and I enjoyed the story for what it was.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The chaos that ensues on the island among the cast gets increasingly bizarre as the book progresses, but it’s all entertaining. The events are described as “stranger than fiction,” and I found that to be a highly accurate statement. The story requires you to suspend reality, but it’s a fun and engaging ride.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ness Larkin, the protagonist, experiences significant personal growth during her time on the island. She owns up to her past choices and mistakes, which isn’t always easy, especially when admitting faults to the people she’s hurt. I admired her for facing these challenges head-on while also trying to keep things together for the group. I liked her a lot as a character.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance between Ness and Hayes, her ex-love, is more of a subplot than the main focus. While there aren’t deep discussions about their past or much history provided about the intensity of their former relationship, I still felt their connection was clear. The island setting provided an interesting and unique setup for a second chance at love.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The deserted island setting added an intriguing layer to the story, making it an escapist desert island mystery. The atmosphere was well-crafted, and the dynamics among the cast of characters kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and entertaining read. It combines adventure, mystery, and a touch of romance, with a unique setting and a protagonist who undergoes meaningful growth. While it’s not a deep dive into romance, the story offers plenty of excitement and character development to keep readers hooked.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The climax feels somewhat contrived, especially in how Ness's unlikability is depicted. With only one character expressing a significant issue with her, the tension is undermined. Additionally, Hayes's motivations for joining the project remain unclear and would benefit from more explicit clarification.",

While some characters, like Coco, could use more development, others, such as Tyler, can feel cartoonish at times. However, the relationships among most characters are enjoyable and well depicted.",
