            "The book resonated with me deeply, particularly in its portrayal of infertility and the societal shame directed at women who cannot conceive through \"acceptable\" means. The narrative is both poignant and emotional, making for a challenging yet worthwhile read. It addresses several potentially triggering topics, so readers may want to familiarize themselves with the content beforehand.",
            "This gripping dark science fiction dystopian novel incorporates strong horror elements. It vividly depicts a disturbing future that captivated me. While it shares a similar tone, themes, and sense of dread as *The Handmaid’s Tale*, it stands on its own without feeling derivative."

While it may not be for everyone due to its intense content, it’s a must-read for those who appreciate powerful, dystopian science fiction with a strong emotional core.",

Though Nelah is intentionally portrayed as a flawed character, her journey underscores significant societal injustices. The narrative takes a dark turn following a drug-fueled night and a hit-and-run, propelling Nelah into a desperate fight for her own survival and that of her unborn child.",

            "This story skillfully examines misogyny, classism, colorism, and power dynamics within a dystopian society. It embraces an intersectional feminist perspective, addressing race, gender identity, and sexuality, while inclusively representing non-binary and trans individuals. The novel thoughtfully navigates themes of guilt, presumed criminality, and the manipulation of systems by those in power to serve their interests."

            "The novel suffers from excessive complexity due to the simultaneous introduction of multiple ideas, which makes it difficult to follow. The initial explanation of the body-hopping scheme is clear but becomes bogged down in unnecessary detail, ultimately diluting its purpose. After the first 30%, the story undergoes a jarring shift from sci-fi to horror thriller, resulting in uneven pacing and awkward pauses for exposition. While the opening chapters are slow and tedious, the latter parts gain momentum but are still hindered by inconsistent pacing and excessive explanations. Additionally, the dialogue often comes across as patronizing, with characters directly spelling out the plot for the reader.",
            "The protagonist, Nelah, initially appears sympathetic but quickly becomes irritating due to her contradictory desire for traditional values while engaging in an affair, revealing a lack of agency. Her constant complaints about societal and marital misogyny, accompanied by inaction, further diminish her appeal. In contrast, Moremi's backstory and motivations are far more compelling and relatable, making her the more interesting character.",
            "The portrayal of misogyny was heavy-handed and lacked subtlety, making it difficult to empathize with the female main character or her circumstances. Additionally, the societal critique seemed underdeveloped, as Nelah's privileged status rendered her inaction more frustrating than tragic.",
            "The story starts strong within the sci-fi horror genre but ultimately diverges into fantasy with Moremi's revenge narrative, which feels both misplaced and illogical. These shifts in genre and the inconsistent tone disrupt the overall immersion and coherence of the tale.",
            "The story is a highly inventive fusion of influences, drawing from works like *Minority Report*, *The Handmaid's Tale*, *The Final Cut*, and classic horror tropes. The early sci-fi elements, particularly the depiction of a patriarchal government and police state, captivate and establish an intriguing tone."

Lengthy, encyclopedia-style paragraphs interrupted the flow, making the story feel convoluted. Additionally, inconsistencies—such as the years the parents spent together and the name of the unborn child—were evident and could have been addressed by a more thorough edit. Some plot points seemed overly coincidental and convenient, which diminished believability and ultimately gave the story a soap opera-like quality.",
            "The writing is laden with purple prose, which, though not my preference, initially sets an impactful tone. The vivid and violent language powerfully conveys the protagonist’s desperation and lack of agency, as seen in phrases like “probing, UV-forensic sunrays” and “knives its way.” However, the heavy-handed exposition detracts from the reader’s ability to uncover details organically, ultimately making the prose feel overbearing.",
            "The connection to Botswana's folklore was intriguing but felt rushed, especially in relation to the ending. As someone not well-versed in this folklore, I perceived the integration as somewhat superficial and underdeveloped.",
            "The book delves into themes of bodily autonomy, motherhood, and folklore within a dystopian, cyberpunk Botswana. However, these themes often feel overwhelming and lack cohesive integration, as if too many ideas were hastily combined. While the exploration of oppression, particularly from the perspective of a Black nonbinary individual in a female body, is ambitious, it ultimately lacks depth and cohesion. The narrative strives to illustrate the plight of women in a patriarchal society but becomes overly personal and disjointed due to the numerous challenges faced by the protagonist."

Ultimately, the book fails to deliver a satisfying or coherent narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF @ 65% (Did Not Finish at 65%)."

Additionally, the ending was overloaded with descriptions and analysis, ultimately falling short of delivering the emotional impact I anticipated.",

I struggled to engage with her relationships, especially her marriage, which felt underdeveloped and unconvincing.

In fact, I found myself sympathizing more with Moremi than Nelah, and I wished the book had centered on her instead.",

While I don’t think the comparison is entirely accurate, I can see what they were aiming for.\n\n- **World-Building and Societal Structure:**\n   - The societal structure, laws, and rules in the book are incredibly dense and detailed, often feeling overwhelming. This, I assume, is intentional to reflect the suffocating, controlling, and manipulative nature of the society and technology depicted. It’s very effective in conveying that feeling.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Plot Complexity:**\n   - The book is densely plotted and excellently executed. A lot happens, and I never knew where it was going. The uncertainty about what was real or trustworthy was expertly crafted, mirroring the characters' experiences.\n\n- **Setting and Cultural Integration:**\n   - The story is set in a future Botswana, blending cultural, religious, and ancestral beliefs with advanced technology, implants, and bio-engineering. The mix of technological terminology and local words/terms was initially challenging but added depth. Using both the audiobook and ebook helped me fully grasp the world.\n\n- **Character Perspective and Nuance:**\n   - The protagonist, Nelah, is both trustworthy and untrustworthy, which added a fascinating layer of nuance. Seeing the story through her eyes was perfect, as neither she nor the reader ever knew what was real.\n\n- **Themes and Content Warnings:**\n   - The central themes revolve around horrific misogyny, abuse, and control, making the book brutal, violent, and gory. It’s not for the faint of heart, and I feel it should come with extensive trigger warnings. Despite this, I believe it’s an important read for everyone.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**\n   - The ending was a mixed bag for me. On one hand, it was apt and appropriate for the story. On the other, it felt a bit rushed and leaned toward wish-fulfillment. I would have preferred a more realistic, humanist conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis was an excellent, thought-provoking read, though it’s not for everyone due to its intense and violent themes. The world-building, plot complexity, and character nuance are masterfully done, even if the ending left me wanting a bit more. I highly recommend it, but with strong caveats about its content.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story's pacing felt uneven, as the horror elements didn’t emerge until after the halfway point. The writing oscillated between over-explaining certain aspects and lacking detail in others, resulting in info-dumping. Consequently, I found myself often confused about the world-building, the significance of Botswana, and even essential details regarding the main character's life.",
            "The protagonist’s actions and motivations felt inconsistent and often lacked clarity. For instance, her choice to cheat on her husband, despite being aware of his potential violent reaction, was puzzling. Furthermore, her obsession with having a baby and the need for money clashed with her decision to spend time with her lover rather than working. As a result, I found her unsympathetic. However, the novel's exploration of systemic prejudice and societal inequality remains deeply impactful.",
            "I enjoy exploring literature by authors from diverse cultures, often finding rewarding stories as a result. However, *Womb City* fell short for me, despite its captivating premise and stunning cover. The worldbuilding blends sci-fi elements, some grounded in reality and others steeped in the fantastical, which led to my skepticism about the more realistic aspects. While the novel presents a wealth of creative ideas, they feel underdeveloped and overcrowded, competing for attention instead of being fully realized.",

However, *Womb City* didn’t resonate with me despite its intriguing premise and stunning cover.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**\n   - The worldbuilding is a mix of sci-fi concepts, some rooted in realism and others fantastical.

For example, her decision to cheat on her husband, despite knowing it could provoke his violent reaction, was confusing. Additionally, her obsession with having a baby and needing money for it contradicted her actions, as she spent her time with her side-piece instead of working. I found her unsympathetic, though the novel’s exploration of systemic prejudice and societal inequality was poignant.\n\n- **Pacing and Writing:**\n   - The pacing was uneven, with the horror elements only beginning after the midway point.

However, the execution falls short, failing to deliver on the potential of the concept.  \n\n- **Character Decisions and Development:**  \n   - The main character’s actions are often confusing and poorly justified.

            "The book occasionally reads like a textbook, overloaded with elements and information that can be overwhelming. Concepts such as the \"fifth lifespan\" and \"second body-hop\" can be confusing and require multiple readings for clarity. The author's tendency to digress while conveying vital information disrupts the narrative flow. Although the story introduces numerous plots, many ideas feel underdeveloped and unexplored. The premise of body-hopping, for instance, builds anticipation yet ultimately leaves readers perplexed. Additionally, the story often shifts abruptly in tone—transitioning to a horror-like atmosphere that doesn't seamlessly integrate into the overall narrative.",
            "I struggled to connect with the characters, particularly Elifasi, who appears narcissistic and irredeemable. Nelah's refusal to take accountability and her tendency to blame others, including Jan, made her unlikable as well. The depiction of Nelah’s marriage and Elifasi’s manipulative behavior was disheartening, especially as it drove her toward self-hatred.",
            "The characters often provide excessive exposition during tense moments, disrupting both the tension and pacing. For example, Moremi’s lengthy monologue before a crucial scene pulled me out of the narrative. Additionally, some dialogues come across as preachy, making it feel less like storytelling and more like a lecture.",

Although the story aims to portray Moremi as an independent character, Nelah’s actions ultimately overshadow this portrayal.",

The story ventures into increasingly unbelievable territory, particularly with the concept of body hopping. Initially, I struggled to understand its purpose, especially since the characters lose their memories in the process. Additionally, the logistics of body availability for reincarnation seemed inconsistent. However, the cultural significance of reincarnation is later explored, offering a more symbolic interpretation that somewhat justifies the concept.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a mix of science fiction and supernatural horror, with a stronger second half and a focus on flawed, morally complex characters.

            "The story opens with Nela, an infertile African woman who makes drastic choices in her quest for motherhood, including remaining in a loveless marriage, infidelity, and even murder. About 70% into the book, a significant twist introduces a conspiracy that redirects the narrative into a fresh, captivating direction. While this twist is both unique and creative, much of the story revolves around Nela's troubling decisions and struggles, which can become tedious over time.",
            "Nela's character is profoundly flawed, exhibiting traits such as selfishness, recreational drug use, and troubling rationalizations for her trauma. Her persistent victim mentality and constant complaints can render her unrelatable, often leaving me feeling numb and disconnected.",
            "The book presents several intriguing ideas, though they sometimes come across as overly complex or lead to inconclusive paths, resulting in confusion. The pacing is uneven, with the first 70% dragging until a twist revitalizes the narrative. The writing has a debut novel feel—raw and promising, yet in need of refinement.",
            "The book delves into themes of desperation, morality, and the lengths individuals will go to fulfill their desires. While it introduces the intriguing concept of body resleeving, this element feels underutilized, complicating the narrative without enhancing the plot or Nela’s character development."

The intriguing concepts introduced are often overcomplicated or underdeveloped, leading to confusion. Despite its flaws, the author shows potential and is one to watch for future works.",

The narrative compellingly explores themes of race, gender, and identity in a world where bodies are exchanged like clothing. It raises profound questions about what it means to be human in an increasingly technologically advanced landscape.",

This novel is distinguished by its African setting and themes, setting it apart from conventional American science fiction. While it has some flaws, the author's talent and unique viewpoint make this debut noteworthy.",

However, the final act became challenging to follow, hindered by both reader fatigue and the narrative's growing complexity. Despite this confusion, the novel's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, showcasing the author's remarkable potential.",

The narrative is filled with haunting and thought-provoking moments that resonate deeply."

It’s very easy to miss when writing purple (ish?) prose, but even when it felt wobbly, I just couldn’t get mad at it. It made sense, and it was feverish at points, which was one of the reasons that kept me going.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Tsamaase built an intriguing world where consciousnesses are transferred from body to body, and Botswana’s crime rate is decimated through overpolicing, extreme surveillance, and microchipping predominantly women’s bodies. The misogyny depicted is suffocating.\n\n- **Pacing and Exposition:**  \n  The book failed to find the sweet spot between breakneck action and repetitive exposition. I don’t usually mind exposition, but here it sometimes felt like I was reading a paragraph I’d already read, with a new detail that maybe tracked and maybe didn’t. I couldn’t tell. Action was also interrupted to deliver long explainers.\n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  Dialogue-wise, anything deeper than a simple exchange made all the characters sound the same, with similar (flowery) styles, cadence, metaphors, and so on.\n\n- **Potential and Future Work:**  \n  There is, however, so much amazing potential here, and I’m so excited to see what comes out of Tsamaase’s pen next.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book to be a mixed experience. While the writing style and world-building were compelling, the pacing and dialogue could have been more refined. Despite its flaws, the novel shows immense potential, and I look forward to the author’s future works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The lack of context for why the society functioned the way it did left many questions unanswered. Additionally, the concept of Matsieng and its role in the story was unclear.  \n- **Character Development:** The characters were unrelatable and poorly developed. The so-called \"love story\" felt more like a cautionary tale due to the toxic dynamics between the characters.  \n- **Tone and Content:** The story was unnecessarily gruesome, which detracted from the overall experience.

The use of timestamps to build tension is rendered meaningless as deadlines are constantly changed or ignored.  \n   - The body-swap system and its rules are unclear, leaving major plot points unexplained.  \n   - The simulation-to-reality transitions lack logical consistency, and key plot elements, like Nelah’s husband missing her affair, feel contrived.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Exposition**  \n   - The dialogue is wooden and lacks authenticity.  \n   - The exposition is excessive yet fails to clarify the story’s complexities, leaving the reader confused.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had immense potential with its ambitious themes of Afrofuturism, sci-fi, and feminism, but it ultimately fell short in execution. The political messages were contradictory and poorly developed, the characters lacked depth, and the plot was a confusing mess. While the premise was intriguing, the story failed to deliver a coherent or satisfying narrative. Readers seeking strong Afrofuturism, sci-fi, or feminist literature should look elsewhere.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot: 2/10  \n- Themes: 3/10  \n- Character Development: 3/10  \n- Dialogue: 2/10  \n- Overall: 2.5/10"

            "The story begins at a slow pace, delving into the struggles of the main character, Nelah Bogosi-Ntsu, and her husband, Elifasi. Initially, I was engaged and eager to immerse myself in the narrative. However, the introduction of Janith Koshal (Jan) and a subsequent accident felt jarring, and by the 68% mark, I was on the verge of giving up due to the frustrating pacing and direction. A significant turning point occurs with a later perspective shift, which transformed my experience entirely. This shift provided clarity and depth, allowing me to view earlier events in a new light. It was masterfully executed and ultimately saved the book for me.",
            "The characters are well-developed, though not particularly likable. Nelah and Elifasi's flaws drive the narrative, and their choices frequently provoked strong dislike. While the diverse cast adds depth, their actions often made it challenging to empathize with them throughout much of the book.",
            "The themes of losing control over one's life and the insidious nature of corporate and societal domination are compelling. The concept of Womb City and its infrastructure gained clarity through the shift in perspective, enriching the story. The world-building evokes comparisons to *Neuromancer* by William Gibson and *The Ghost in the Machine*, where individuals become pawns of those in power.",

It masterfully combines cyberpunk sci-fi with supernatural horrors, creating a rich and captivating environment.

While it resists easy categorization, the story strongly emphasizes its cyberpunk roots. Narrated by Nelah, a Motswana Black woman who identifies as nonbinary/agender, it refreshingly subverts the traditional norms of cyberpunk, which are often dominated by white male protagonists. The narrative is intricate and dark, featuring extensive world-building that vividly portrays a dystopian, high-tech, low-life society."

Tlotlo's writing is compelling, and while the story could have benefited from more focus, it remains a thought-provoking and impactful read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the ending feels somewhat abrupt and relies on a deus ex machina, which could have been better integrated.",
            "In this gripping story, the protagonist, Nelah, is a talented architect ensnared in a controlling marriage and burdened by the legacy of her body's previous host. The character relationships are complex and authentically developed, enriching the narrative. Nelah's affair with Jan serves as a catalyst for much of the conflict and tension, highlighting the intricacies of their choices and their repercussions.",
            "This story boasts detailed, immersive writing that richly explores culture and futuristic elements. Although the first half unfolds slowly, the second half is both enjoyable and engaging. I recommend this book to fans of Afro-futurist sci-fi and readers comfortable with its darker themes.",
            "Set in a futuristic Botswana, this novel explores a world where lifespans exceed two hundred years and body-hopping after death is a reality. The intricate worldbuilding is rich with detailed explanations of both the body-hopping system and the surrounding cultural elements. While the first half of the book focuses heavily on establishing this universe, it can be challenging to follow at first; however, a second reading reveals greater clarity and depth.",
            "The novel delves into themes of control, fertility, and the consequences of one's actions. It contains content warnings for body horror and discussions of rape, making it potentially unsuitable for some readers."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Womb City* is a richly detailed and thought-provoking afro-futurist sci-fi novel with a slow start but a gripping second half. While the dense worldbuilding and abrupt ending may be drawbacks for some, the intricate relationships, cultural depth, and thrilling twists make it a worthwhile read for fans of the genre.",

However, the book was not what I expected in both good and bad ways.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n   - I LOVED the middle plot about the murder trials and the way the ghosts return to hunt people down. The blend of folk tale energy with government conspiracy was a fun and exciting twist. The twists were well-executed, and the plot remained engaging throughout. I was genuinely surprised by the reveal of who was behind everything.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n   - The beginning was excessively long (20% of the book) and focused heavily on world-building. While some world-building is necessary, every element felt like an extended metaphor for societal oppression of women, which was too on-the-nose and overwhelming. It could have been significantly pared down.  \n\n- **Title and Relevance:**  \n   - The title was somewhat misleading. The baby, which I expected to be central, was pretty irrelevant to the novel. This made the plot feel different from what I anticipated, though this isn’t inherently negative—just odd.  \n\n- **Character (Nelah):**  \n   - I couldn’t connect with Nelah’s storyline. The idea of a baby in a tank and her sudden discovery of having a daughter felt unrealistic and frustrating. It seemed like the fetus should have been \"yeeted\" long ago.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending was unsatisfying and confusing.

This lack of subtlety was a recurring issue.  \n\n- **Cultural Context and Accessibility:**  \n   - For readers unfamiliar with Botswana/South African slang, it might be helpful to reference a guide to better understand the cultural context.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Womb City* had potential with its unique blend of sci-fi and cultural elements, it fell short in execution. The lack of commitment to its ideas, over-explanation of themes, and inconsistent character development made it a frustrating read. The pacing dragged, especially toward the end, and the narrative style often broke immersion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story falters in pacing and coherence, especially in the latter half. Moremi, an essential character, is reduced to a mere plot device, wielding knowledge without adequate development. Additionally, the depiction of cheating as a solution that “works out in the end” undermines the narrative’s emotional depth, leaving the story unsatisfying.",
            "In the story, Nelah, the protagonist, asserts that she faces oppression in her society, yet her actions—such as excelling in her job, challenging men, and utilizing advanced technology—contradict this claim. Her perspective seems unsubstantiated, as we don't encounter other women who share her experiences. Additionally, her relationship with her husband is marked by inconsistency and confusion; she alternates between affection and hostility, leaving her true feelings ambiguous.",
            "The writing is clunky, featuring overly poetic descriptions that feel unnatural. Characters often deliver monologues that come across as rehearsed and unrealistic. The narrative relies too heavily on telling rather than showing, resulting in a heavy-handed and unengaging experience. The author fails to trust readers to interpret the themes and messages for themselves, instead explicitly stating them.",

The heavy-handed messaging seems more about meeting a quota than fostering thoughtful discussion. Additionally, the narrative occasionally feels disconnected from its Botswana setting, as the themes and perspectives align more closely with an American or “chronically online” viewpoint. For example, Nelah’s emphasis on “cis white males” as the epitome of privilege appears out of place in her cultural context."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n   - The writing is clunky, with overly poetic descriptions that don’t feel natural. Characters often monologue in a way that sounds rehearsed and unrealistic.  \n   - There’s an excessive amount of telling rather than showing, which makes the narrative feel heavy-handed and unengaging. The author doesn’t trust readers to draw their own conclusions, instead explicitly stating the book’s themes and messages.  \n\n- **Character Development and Consistency:**  \n   - Nelah, the protagonist, claims to be oppressed in her society, but her actions and circumstances (e.g., succeeding at her job, standing up to men, accessing advanced technology) contradict this. Her perspective feels unverified and hard to believe, as we don’t hear from other women who share her experiences.  \n   - Her relationship with her husband is inconsistent and confusing. She oscillates between affection and hostility, making it hard to understand her true feelings.  \n\n- **World-Building and Logic:**  \n   - The societal oppression of women is repeatedly stated but lacks supporting details. For example, we’re told women are arrested more often than men, but there’s no evidence or context provided to substantiate this claim.  \n   - The body-hopping and lifespan concepts are overly convoluted and poorly explained, leaving the reader confused even after finishing the book.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n   - The book often feels preachy, with Nelah’s monologues about sexism and oppression becoming repetitive and exhausting. The messaging is delivered in a heavy-handed manner, as if the author is trying to meet a quota rather than inspire thoughtful discussion.  \n   - The narrative sometimes feels disconnected from its setting (Botswana), with themes and perspectives that seem more aligned with an American or “chronically online” viewpoint. For instance, Nelah’s focus on “cis white males” as the pinnacle of privilege feels out of place in her cultural context.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story struggles with pacing and coherence, particularly in the latter half. Moremi, a key character, is reduced to a convenient plot device who knows everything without proper development.  \n   - The portrayal of cheating as something that “works out in the end” is unsatisfying and undermines the narrative’s emotional depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“Womb City” attempts to tackle complex themes of oppression, identity, and societal control but falls short in execution. The writing is clunky, the characters lack consistency, and the world-building feels underdeveloped. While the book has moments of poetic description, its heavy-handed messaging and convoluted plot make it a frustrating read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars (hovers between 2 and 3 stars)."

            "The story centers on Nelah, a microchipped individual whose criminal act haunts her, revealing chilling truths about the government's Murder Trials. The plot is rich with twists, enhancing its appeal as a horror/thriller. However, the middle third of the book drags, becoming slow and repetitive due to extensive explanations about body hopping and microchips. Nevertheless, the satisfying ending masterfully ties all the threads together, impressively navigating the complexity of the storyline.",

The concept of a dystopian Botswana, featuring body-hopping—transferring consciousness across different bodies and lifespans—demonstrates remarkable creativity. The inclusion of microchipped individuals monitored for criminal tendencies, along with the secret Murder Trial sector, adds considerable depth to the world-building."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Style:**  \n   - \"Womb City\" is a stunning portrayal of Afro-futurist sci-fi, with touches of Octavia Butler and George Orwell.  \n   - The novel blends excellent world-building, reliable sci-fi thematic elements, ghosts, and body horror to drive the plot forward.  \n   - The narrative style, while repetitive at times, could be attributed to cultural storytelling differences, and I appreciated the author’s unique approach.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n   - The book explores the horrors of surveillance, misogyny, and power, wrapped in a sinister and duplicitous plot.  \n   - It includes a content notice on the copyright page, which I recommend readers check before diving in, as the story can be gruesome and intense.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The characters are not necessarily likable or dependable, but they evoke strong emotions. I found myself becoming resentful toward the protagonists for a significant portion of the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot is mercurial and unpredictable, which made it a challenging but engaging read.  \n   - The story builds toward an earth-shattering ending, though the repetitive nature of the narrative occasionally hindered the pacing.  \n\n- **Author’s Skill and Potential:**  \n   - Tlotlo Tsamaase’s debut full-length novel showcases xer attention to detail and ability to craft a complex, layered story.  \n   - With \"Womb City,\" Tsamaase has positioned xerself light years ahead of xer sci-fi peers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Womb City\" is a bold and ambitious Afro-futurist sci-fi novel that tackles heavy themes with a unique narrative style. While the repetitive nature of the storytelling and the unlikable characters posed challenges, the intricate world-building, gripping plot, and Tsamaase’s undeniable talent make this a standout debut. It’s a hard but rewarding read, and I’m excited to see where Tsamaase goes from here.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

However, the execution falls short due to a morally ambiguous protagonist, inconsistent supporting characters, and a writing style that can be overly verbose and repetitive. While the novel has its moments, it could have benefited from a more streamlined narrative and deeper exploration of its intriguing concepts and themes.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Premise and Setting: 8/10\n- Protagonist: 5/10\n- Supporting Characters: 7/10\n- Themes and Social Commentary: 7/10\n- Plot and Pacing: 6/10\n- Writing Style: 5/10\n- Overall: 6/10"

Additionally, the narrative includes elements such as a ghost, a murder, and strong feminist themes. While some twists may be predictable, many are genuinely surprising. The author (xe/xim) adeptly critiques sexist attitudes, portraying women as marginalized and disposable, while also exploring issues of privilege, class, race, and nationality.

It also includes a ghost, a murder, and heavy feminist themes. The story is packed with twists and turns, some predictable but mostly surprising. The author (xe/xim) effectively critiques sexist thinking, portraying women as lesser, easily discarded, and purposeless, while also addressing privilege, class, race, and nationality. The commentary reflects our own reality, though the plot can feel far-fetched and borderline convoluted.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Imagery:**  \n  The writing is fairly good, with standout imagery that I found top-notch. However, some parts of the book read like a rough draft, with sections that stretch longer than necessary and moments where I had to reorient myself to understand what was happening.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  I was invested in the characters and their outcomes, though I wasn’t completely blown away. The protagonist’s struggles and the world-building kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Editing and Pacing:**  \n  The book could benefit from another round or two of editing.

A mix of perspectives (POVs) might have helped, though it would have significantly altered the narrative style.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is stunning and poetic, showcasing the author's talent. Tsamaase's writing is so beautiful that it feels like reading poetry. This aspect alone makes the novel stand out.\n\n- **Adaptation Potential:**  \n  The story has a cinematic quality, and I could easily see it being adapted into a TV series. It has a vibe reminiscent of *Black Mirror* and *Altered Carbon*, which would translate well to the screen.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has some complexities that made it hard to follow at times, its thought-provoking themes, stunning prose, and cinematic potential make it a memorable read.

The society is heavily surveilled by an AI that tests citizens for \"criminality,\" with female bodies disproportionately microchipped and policed. This creates a dystopian world where the commodification of bodies and the illusion of security come at a horrific cost, particularly for women. The setting is richly detailed, blending cultural folklore and spirituality with a chilling exploration of bodily autonomy and systemic oppression.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The protagonist, Nelah, is a microchipped woman struggling with infertility and the trauma of her body's history. Her husband, Elifasi, is a volatile and controlling figure, embodying the worst traits of a patriarchal system. The characters are intentionally morally gray, with no clear heroes, which serves to highlight the thematic questions of the narrative. While their actions can be frustrating, they are effective in driving the story and provoking thought about the world they inhabit.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot evolves from a slow-paced exploration of Nelah's life and the dystopian world into a fast-paced sci-fi thriller with elements of fantasy and body horror. The story begins with Nelah hitting a girl while driving intoxicated, which sets off a chain of events uncovering corruption and dark secrets. The pacing is deliberate in the first half, building tension and worldbuilding, before escalating into a chaotic and intense climax. The narrative style shifts effectively, though the rapid reveals in the latter half may overwhelm some readers.\n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The novel delves deeply into themes of bodily autonomy, sacrifice, and the cost of security. It challenges readers to question who benefits from systems of control and who bears the brunt of their consequences. The feminist lens through which the story is told adds a powerful layer of critique, particularly regarding the policing and commodification of female bodies.\n\n- **Personal Thoughts:**  \n  The book is intentionally uncomfortable, forcing readers to confront difficult questions about security, autonomy, and morality. While the morally gray characters and their decisions were sometimes frustrating, they effectively underscored the narrative's themes. The pacing and reveal-heavy climax, though engaging, felt overwhelming at times. Overall, it was an emotionally intense and thought-provoking read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Womb City* is a well-crafted, multi-layered novel that blends dystopian sci-fi, thriller, and fantasy elements with a strong feminist critique.

Occasionally, there are powerful and poetic sentences, but they are rendered meaningless by their context.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**\n   - The worldbuilding is overexplained yet makes no sense. The book spends a significant amount of time on exposition, particularly about the body-swapping process, which feels inorganic and reads like a worldbuilding document rather than a novel.\n   - The underlying foundation of the world lacks sociological plausibility. The advanced technology described would radically alter society, but the author fails to explore these implications creatively.\n   - There are massive plot holes that undermine the worldbuilding.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - The characters are flimsy props for the plot, often contradicting themselves to serve the narrative.\n   - The main character is despicable and poorly developed. Her motivations and actions are inconsistent, and she frequently contradicts herself, making her unrelatable and frustrating.\n\n- **Dialogue:**\n   - The dialogue is unrealistic and unnatural. Characters speak in paragraphs, primarily to infodump worldbuilding, plot details, or feminist outrage, rather than engaging in authentic conversations.\n\n- **Tone and Themes:**\n   - The book tries too hard to be transgressive, edgy, and violent, but this effort backfires, making the story feel forced and unintentionally comical.\n   - The feminist themes are presented in a bland and unsubtle manner, lacking nuance.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**\n   - The narrative lacks momentum in the first half, then abruptly shifts into overdrive, becoming chaotic and hard to follow.\n   - The plot is overly convoluted, with clunky twists that feel predictable and repetitive, resembling a poorly executed supernatural soap opera.\n\n- **Gore and Violence:**\n   - The author includes excessive gore without a clear purpose, demonstrating a lack of understanding of how human bodies work.\n\n- **Author’s Perspective and Acknowledgments:**\n   - In the acknowledgments, the author claims the manuscript was rejected over 400 times due to “gatekeeping” and racial bias, implying that the book’s “nuances” were unappreciated. However, I believe the rejections were justified, as the book is fundamentally flawed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Womb City* by Tlotlo Tsamaase is a deeply disappointing read.

            "In the book's first third, the pacing is slow and confusing, which hampers the plot’s clarity. The timeline is fluid, making it challenging to determine the passage of time between scenes, even though each chapter includes time codes. While the main action helps improve the pacing, the narrative often appears to invent the logic behind Moremi’s haunting on the fly. However, the final revelation regarding Nehla’s world, her identity, Moremi’s role, and her lover’s loyalty offers a rewarding payoff. The ending skillfully weaves together many of the book's themes and ideas.",
            "Nehla, the protagonist, suffers from an underdeveloped personality, defined mainly by her longing for motherhood and her anger toward patriarchy. Her behavior, including her outbursts toward her brother and lover, often feels at odds with her depiction as a successful architect. Additionally, the narrator's internal and spoken monologues, frequently laden with rhetorical questions, interrupt the momentum of intense action scenes.",

The plot is often confusing, the world-building lacks clarity, and the protagonist’s character development feels inconsistent.

The plot is often confusing, the world-building lacks clarity, and the protagonist’s character development feels inconsistent. The writing style, though ambitious, can be overly verbose and distracting. Despite these issues, the book offers a rewarding payoff in the end, making it a worthwhile read for those interested in its unique blend of ideas.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Premise and Concept: 8/10  \n- Plot and Pacing: 5/10  \n- Character Development: 6/10  \n- World-Building: 5/10  \n- Writing Style: 4/10  \n- Resolution and Payoff: 7/10  \n**Overall Rating:** 6/10"

            "In this story, Nelah's marriage suffers from a toxic power imbalance, with her husband manipulating her memories for his own purposes. Her relationship with her lover, Jan, is further complicated by societal pressures and the stigma surrounding her body. At its core, the narrative explores Nelah's internal conflict and her struggles with identity.",
            "The novel's first part faces criticism for its repetitiveness, particularly in the unnecessary reiteration of concepts like body microchipping. Some dialogues, especially between Nelah and Jan, are overly lengthy and would benefit from tighter editing. Additionally, Nelah's sudden shift in language during a drug-fueled rampage feels inconsistent with her established character. The stream-of-consciousness style can detract from the narrative by presenting every thought Nelah has, rather than communicating her emotions through her actions. Finally, the feminist messaging sometimes feels heavy-handed, with explicit statements that could be more effectively conveyed through the story's events.",
            "Set in a feminist dystopia in future Botswana, the novel explores a world where advanced technology enables the transfer of consciousness between bodies—a privilege not equally accessible due to racism, classism, and sexism. With a scarcity of available bodies and lengthy waiting lists, body-hopping becomes a popular escape for asylum seekers fleeing trauma. The use of artificial womb pods to grow babies introduces a troubling dynamic, as financial instability can result in fetuses being raised to adulthood and assigned new consciousnesses without the biological parent's consent.\n\nThe narrative intertwines traditional Motswanan beliefs about reincarnation with a science fiction backdrop, enhancing its originality. Crime is managed through extensive state surveillance, leading to involuntary microchipping of bodies deemed criminogenic, a practice that disproportionately affects women. In a stark contrast, wealthy men are permitted to remember their past lives, while young Motswanan women, like Nelah, are systematically denied this privilege.",
            "The novel powerfully examines gendered power imbalances, exploitation, and systemic oppression, particularly against women. It critiques the surveillance state and the erosion of personal freedoms under the guise of security. By exploring the intersection of technology, culture, and feminism, the story highlights the exploitation of women's bodies and autonomy."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Womb City* presents a fascinating and unique feminist dystopia with rich world-building and thought-provoking themes. However, the novel's pacing and repetitive elements detract from its impact, and the heavy-handed delivery of its feminist message could have been more nuanced. Despite these flaws, it remains an engaging and socially relevant read.",

Her tumultuous relationships are challenging to endure until a late explanation offers some context.",

While the world-building is ambitious, it often becomes dense and repetitive, reiterating key concepts like body hopping and lifespans multiple times. Some technologies and events feel underdeveloped, creating gaps in the narrative. This heavy-handed, encyclopedic style hinders immersion and contributes to a sense of lengthiness in the book.",
            "The novel addresses an array of social justice issues, such as patriarchy, surveillance, and autonomy. While its ambition is commendable, these themes frequently come across as underdeveloped, often overshadowed by pacing and world-building challenges.

            "This dystopian horror novel is set in a future Botswana and follows Nelah, a successful architect, as she grapples with a repressive society, a loveless marriage, and a lover who encourages her ambitions. The story delves into themes of societal control, personal suppression, and the yearning for motherhood. In the first part, the narrative focuses on world-building, introducing a microchip that infiltrates Nelah’s life and exploring a society that thrives on the oppression and extermination of its marginalized members. As Nelah confronts the harsh realities of her environment, the story darkens, revealing the corrupt and brutal nature of her world.",
            "Nelah is a multi-dimensional protagonist grappling with societal expectations, personal desires, and the harsh realities of her environment. Although the vengeful spirit is somewhat under-developed, it serves as a compelling element that enriches the story. However, some characters, especially the antagonists, are portrayed as overly simplistic and cartoonish, which undermines the narrative's subtlety.",
            "The writing is both powerful and visceral, drawing readers deep into the protagonist's descent into depravity and despair. The prose has a captivating, sharp beauty that enchants, even amidst disturbing content. Exceptional world-building adds layers of oppression, revealing the city's dark underbelly with each page. However, the dialogue can be overly expository and clunky, with characters delivering unnatural, lengthy explanations. Additionally, the narrative sometimes becomes heavy-handed, reducing characters to caricatures of villains and undermining the story's complexity.",

            "Nelah is a standout character—intelligent, resilient, and richly complex. Her longing for motherhood, shaped by societal expectations, adds depth to her persona. However, I found her limited interactions with women beyond her mother, Moremi, and Jan's wife to be somewhat frustrating. Despite the ending offering some context for her isolation, I wished for more meaningful connections with other female characters.",

It raised thought-provoking questions about identity, such as: Is a person defined by their body or their consciousness? What does it mean to be \"just a person\" if body and consciousness can be separated or traded?  \n   - The concept of the Ship of Theseus was intriguingly applied to the idea of multiple consciousnesses inhabiting the same body.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Nelah was a standout character—smart, strong, and complex. Her desire to be a mother, influenced by societal expectations, added depth to her character.  \n   - However, I wished Nelah had more meaningful interactions with women outside of her mother, Moremi, and Jan's wife. Her isolation from other women felt frustrating, even if the ending provided some explanation.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story was unpredictable, and I couldn’t guess where it was going next, which was refreshing.  \n   - However, the pacing felt uneven, with the book reading like three great short stories mashed together. The transitions between genres (3-4 in total) were jarring.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Repetition:**  \n   - There was a lot of repetition, particularly about body hopping for emigration, which was mentioned at least three times. One instance felt especially clunky during a conversation between the main characters.  \n\n- **Logical Consistency:**  \n   - The emphasis on surveillance of women made it strange that Nelah could easily switch her chip recording on and off without her husband noticing, given that he checked it daily. While the ending provided some reasoning, it still felt inconsistent.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a thought-provoking and immersive sci-fi novel with strong world-building and a fresh, unpredictable plot. However, the pacing felt uneven, the transitions between genres were jarring, and some elements, like the repetition and logical inconsistencies, detracted from the experience.

It examines oppressive frameworks and the commodification of female bodies with gripping language and a dense, layered narrative. While it may not appeal to all readers due to its niche themes and challenging content, it is a magnificent and impactful story that leaves a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5 Stars"

            "The writing occasionally suffers from inconsistencies that diminish the overall experience. Certain sections become difficult to follow due to dreamlike sentences mingling with already challenging passages, while others flow more smoothly.

It seamlessly weaves high-concept technologies such as body hopping, soul transference, thought monitoring, and preemptive crime prevention into its narrative. The inclusion of Botswanan culture and mythology surrounding reincarnation adds a unique and enriching dimension. The world-building is intricately detailed and immersive, demanding a slow, thoughtful engagement that it masterfully supports.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Premise and Concept:**\n   - The premise of the book was intriguing and something I really wanted to love. The dystopian futuristic cyberpunk setting, with micro-chipped citizens and the ability to store consciousness and body-hop, was impressive and interesting. The inclusion of Matsieng mythology and the Murder Trials added another layer of complexity.\n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**\n   - The prose was evocative and almost poetic. I enjoyed many of the passages, as they were beautifully written.\n\n- **Characters and Dialogue:**\n   - The characters, particularly the main character Nelah, were hard to connect with. While I felt for Nelah and her predicament, I found her and the other characters to be unlikable. The dialogue often felt too self-aware and served as an info dump, making it difficult to enjoy.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**\n   - The plot felt like two separate stories intertwined: the dystopian cyberpunk state and the mythology tied to Matsieng. The book tackled a lot of social issues simultaneously, which made it feel like it was trying to do too much at once. The first 40% of the book was slow, while the ending felt rushed. The twists and turns were well-thought-out, but the resolution tied up too neatly.\n\n- **Character Development and Perspective:**\n   - Moremi's story felt like it deserved its own book or at least a different perspective. Structuring the narrative differently, perhaps by including her point of view, might have added depth to the story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Impact:**\n   - While the book was thought-provoking and I’m glad to have read it, it wasn’t what I expected. I wasn’t fully on board with the execution, but I’m still interested in checking out the author’s future works.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel had a fascinating premise and impressive concepts, but the execution fell short for me. The characters were hard to connect with, the plot felt overstuffed, and the pacing was uneven. Despite these issues, the book was thought-provoking, and I remain interested in the author’s future projects.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Her behaviors and traits are contradictory; while her emotions can be exaggerated, she sometimes displays unexpected composure, only to revert to immature actions without clear motivation. Additionally, the supporting characters lack depth and come across as shallow stereotypes, filtered through the main character's unreliable perspective, which further diminishes their trustworthiness.",

            "Nelah is a compelling protagonist—an accomplished architect with a loving husband and a daughter born in a wombcubator. Despite her success, she faces humiliation and dismissal linked to her gender and reproductive history. This awareness of societal indignities is juxtaposed with her own perpetuation of such treatment towards other women, adding complexity to her character. Her husband is neglectful, and the media cruelly labels her as \"Black Womb\" due to her miscarriages, further highlighting her struggles.",

However, it occasionally leans too heavily on exposition, featuring repetitive passages that overly emphasize key points. The narrative tends to meander, and the characters occasionally lack distinct voices.",

Through a cyberpunk and Afrofuturistic lens, it critiques societal issues, particularly misogyny. Key themes include body horror, religion, and the grotesque secrets lurking beneath a seemingly utopian facade. The protagonist, Nelah, grapples with systemic discrimination tied to her gender and her microchipped body, formerly owned by a criminal. The narrative highlights the relentless nature of gender inequality, even in a society where crime is nearly eradicated and immortality is attainable."

The overbearing government and \"big brother\" surveillance system were particularly intriguing, especially in how they impacted the main character, Nelah.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nelah’s struggles with her microchipped body and her desire for motherhood were deeply engaging. I found myself rooting for her in the first third of the novel, as her journey felt relatable and well-developed.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The novel started strong, but around the 35% mark, it took an unexpected turn into a horror blend that didn’t fully resonate with me. This shift introduced plot holes and conveniences that, while explained, disrupted my engagement. The ending also fell flat and didn’t deliver the emotional or narrative impact I had hoped for.  \n\n- **Themes and Ideas:**  \n  Despite the issues with the plot, Tsamaase’s exploration of thought-provoking themes and ideas was impressive. The novel’s commentary on societal issues and its sci-fi elements show great potential.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  I’m very interested to see what Tsamaase writes next. While this novel had its flaws, xer ideas and themes are strong, and I believe xey has the ability to craft truly engaging sci-fi stories in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had a strong start with its immersive world-building and compelling character development, but it faltered in its execution, particularly after a tonal shift into horror.

            "The novel is fast-paced yet repetitive, making it challenging to fully engage with the story. Its complexity, marked by an overload of elements such as a fake language, a futuristic society, ancient ghosts, horror creatures, themes of female empowerment, past lives, immortality, crime, rebirth, simulations, and tests, creates confusion and messiness. The shifting focus and evolving world rules contribute to a lack of coherence. \n\nAt the center of the plot are Nelah and Moremi, who find themselves in conflict, with the twist that Moremi is Nelah’s daughter from a past life whom she killed. This revelation, however, lacks emotional impact due to Moremi's insufficient character development. The story draws on influences from *Mr. and Mrs. Smith* (minus the humor) and dystopian works like *The Hunger Games*, *The Maze Runner*, and *The Scorch Trials*, but struggles to weave these elements together cohesively. \n\nWhile the concept of murder trials and the zombie-like behavior of characters is intriguing, it remains underdeveloped and difficult to comprehend, ultimately hindering the story's potential.",
            "Moremi's character lacked depth, making it difficult to invest in her relationship with Nelah. The repeated deaths of Nelah and the notion of bodies as empty vessels felt excessive and muddled. However, Jan emerged as a standout character and my personal favorite.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book was deeply upsetting and jarring, causing me to step away at times due to the intense emotions it evoked. The horror and panic I felt for the female main character (FMC) were overwhelming, yet I appreciated the depth of these emotions. The story is not meant to be comfortable but rather to immerse the reader in the FMC's fear and struggles.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel explores a futuristic world where women, particularly BIPOC women, are oppressed and devalued. It highlights the constant judgment and scrutiny they face, portraying them as scapegoats for societal issues. The story also reflects on how even in a technologically advanced society, systemic oppression persists, drawing parallels to real-world struggles.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The futuristic, dystopian setting is vividly crafted, immersing the reader in a world that feels both alien and eerily familiar. The author effectively uses this backdrop to amplify the themes of oppression and inequality.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The FMC is a compelling and deeply relatable character. Her experiences and emotions are portrayed with such authenticity that they resonate strongly, making her struggles feel personal and urgent.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The author’s writing is powerful and evocative, capturing the horror and fear shared by women and marginalized communities. The tone is unflinching, forcing readers to confront uncomfortable truths.  \n\n- **Personal Reflection:**  \n  Reading this book made me reflect on how dystopian and futuristic novels often mirror real-world issues, particularly the oppression of women and marginalized groups. It left a lasting impression, and I consider it one of the best futuristic horror novels I’ve read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Womb City* is a haunting and thought-provoking novel that delves into themes of oppression, fear, and societal inequality. While emotionally challenging, it is a necessary and impactful read that offers a stark reflection of real-world issues. I look forward to revisiting it when I am emotionally prepared to engage with its intensity again.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It’s not a book to approach when feeling at odds with oneself.  \n\n- **Body Horror and Themes of Bodily Autonomy:**  \n   - The book excels in portraying body horror, and Tsamaase demonstrates a deep understanding of the visceral experience of having bodily autonomy stripped away.  \n\n- **Cinematic Quality and World-Building:**  \n   - The novel is highly cinematic, with beautiful and immersive world-building.

It is set in a Botswana where body hopping, predictive crime detection, and a mysterious ancient power-source aim to create a utopian society. The ethical considerations of state surveillance, law enforcement, fertility treatments, and immortality are all explored in *Womb City*.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The protagonist, Nelah, is a body-hopper and ambitious architect living a confined existence. Her difficult and abusive marriage with her copper husband Elifasi, her contentious relationship with her family (who seem to be hiding truths from her), and her affair with her rich lover Jan add layers to her character. Tsamaase does a great job at peeling back the layers of human nature, raising the overarching question: Can an idyllic society be created by human beings, who are prone to corruption and folly?  \n\n- **Narrative Complexity and Pacing:**  \n  While the story is conceptually strong, it runs into a snag for me due to its narrative complexity. I found myself getting confused by the rules governing body hopping and crime detection. There are a few unexpected twists that I was pleasantly surprised by, but I wish the story had been more condensed to improve clarity and pacing.  \n\n- **Cultural and Geographic Representation:**  \n  I’m really happy to read a science-fiction novel set in Botswana. The unique setting and cultural elements added a fresh perspective to the genre.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  I believe Tsamaase will grow as a writer, and I’m looking forward to reading what she writes next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Womb City* is a conceptually rich and ambitious debut novel that explores profound ethical questions and human nature. While the narrative complexity and pacing could have been more streamlined, the story’s unique setting, unexpected twists, and cultural representation make it a worthwhile read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I was really excited when I got this ARC. The cover art is horrifyingly perfect, and I’ve been impressed with other recent work by African authors. The publisher’s description promised a genre-bending Africanfuturist horror novel blending *The Handmaid’s Tale* with *Get Out*, exploring motherhood, memory, and a woman’s right to her own body. Unfortunately, the book fell far short of these expectations.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is a mishmash of an overly complicated backstory and world-building that wasted massive amounts of time and space, pulling the reader out of the action. The pacing was disrupted by long, Bond villain-esque monologues that tried to make the convoluted story make sense but only added to the confusion.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  The book includes preaching passages that attempt to ensure the reader grasps the deeper message, but these efforts actually cheapen the message rather than enhance it. The themes, such as anti-colonialism, were not effectively tied together, leaving the story feeling incoherent and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Characterization and Dialogue:**  \n  The characters are threadbare and lack depth. The dialogue is simplistic and often feels out of place, making it hard to connect with the characters or their struggles.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Imagery:**  \n  The voice of the narrative is strange and inconsistent. There’s an overuse of womb-related imagery, which comes across as excessive and, at times, gross. The writing style detracts from the story rather than enhancing it.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was neither satisfying nor original. Despite holding on to finish the book in hopes of a cohesive and challenging resolution, the conclusion fell flat and failed to deliver on the earlier promises.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a disappointment. While the premise and cover art were promising, the execution fell short in nearly every aspect—plot, pacing, characterization, dialogue, and themes. The overly complicated narrative and unsatisfying ending made it a difficult and unrewarding read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "In the second half of the book, the narrative shifts dramatically into horror, characterized by gruesome deaths and intense scenes. While the dialogue strives to explore deeper themes, it often reads as an afterthought, lacking meaningful integration into the story.",

            "Nelah, a Black woman from Botswana, emerges as a compelling protagonist whose humanity radiates in her poetic reflections. As a successful architect and primary breadwinner, she contrasts sharply with the oppressive dynamics of her marriage, revealing the lack of independence she endures.",

Around the 40+ percent mark, there was a lot happening, and the explanations didn't help me. The book felt like too much was happening, as if it had missed the stage of editing called \"kill your darlings.\" Because of this, the second half of the book felt unfocused. What I think was meant to be an unfolding of wild events that were probably foreshadowed seemed like crushing chaos.\n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  At a higher level, the meta themes that were explicitly stated in the book (about gender, sexuality, race, etc.) ended up feeling shoehorned in.

Her actions and poor choices in terrible situations felt aligned with her circumstances, especially given her lack of support. This made her struggles relatable and her frustration palpable.  \n\n- **Genre and Reader Experience:**  \n  While the book isn’t hard sci-fi throughout, there are moments where it requires the same level of perseverance as hard sci-fi. Despite this, I think it’s a worthwhile read for any sci-fi fan.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel has a lot of strengths, particularly in its premise, lore, and world-building. However, its execution and pacing could have been tighter. Nelah’s character is well-developed and relatable, though some readers might find her choices frustrating. Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to sci-fi fans, with the caveat that it requires some patience at times.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The later half of the story was much more engaging and fun, with great twists and revelations that stood out as my favorite part.  \n\n- **World-Building and Creativity:**  \n  The world and technology were very creative, and I appreciated how technology added an extra layer to the patriarchy. However, the world-building was largely done through frequent info dumps and odd interjections (e.g., flying car), which made it harder to get into the story and invest in the protagonist, Nelah.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  I didn’t care for the ending and found it a little confusing, though it does make sense within the overall story arc.  \n\n- **Themes and Genre Elements:**  \n  The novel excelled in its sci-fi horror elements, showcasing how technology can amplify societal oppression. However, the story could have benefited from more editing to let these aspects shine.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some truly great moments, particularly in its creative world-building and thought-provoking themes, the pacing and structure issues, along with the less satisfying ending, held it back from being a fully immersive experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - I was initially drawn to this book because of its sci-fi and dystopian description, though I don’t typically read horror. The horror elements were not overly disturbing but kept me on edge, making me eager to uncover what would happen next.  \n  - The author provides sharp commentary on the social and legal state of womanhood within the dystopian society, which also mirrors issues in our current world. Quotes like, \"Besides, women are so used to sacrificing and losing parts of themselves from bodies, like blood and babies,\" highlight this theme effectively.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing alternates between being heavy-handed, where the author seems to guide the reader, and more open-ended, allowing readers to piece things together themselves. I appreciated this balance as it kept the mystery engaging and maintained a sense of anticipation.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Nelah, the female main character (FMC), was both relatable and frustrating. At times, she acted logically when I expected her to be emotional, and other times, she took charge in ways that surprised me. This complexity made her feel real and kept me invested in her journey.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  - The story’s development was unpredictable and far exceeded my expectations. I was suspicious of many characters, but the plot twists were so well-executed that I couldn’t guess their magnitude. The quote, \"The worst evil is the slave that drags its counterparts into the same prison and thinks it is free,\" encapsulates the depth of the story’s twists and themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a gripping and thought-provoking read that combined sci-fi, dystopian, and horror elements seamlessly. The social commentary, unpredictable plot, and well-developed characters made it a standout experience. I highly recommend it to others, especially those who enjoy layered storytelling with a mix of genres.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5🌟"

People’s thoughts and actions are tracked to assess their risk of criminal behavior, and even inhabiting a criminal’s body can label someone as a risk.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story revolves around a main character trapped in a loveless marriage, who is having an affair. A terrible accident occurs one night with her affair partner, and the narrative takes a dramatic turn. While the plot is engaging, the pacing felt slow at times, and the novel seemed overly long, with a heavy focus on world-building.  \n\n- **Themes and Message:**  \n  The story carries a strong anti-patriarchal message, critiquing systems of control and oppression, particularly those targeting women. The microchipping of women and criminals serves as a metaphor for societal surveillance and the restriction of freedom.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is an ambitious and thought-provoking blend of speculative fiction and social commentary, set in a richly imagined futuristic Botswana. While the extensive world-building and thematic depth are impressive, the pacing occasionally drags, making the story feel longer than necessary.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

For example, the multiple explanations of how bodies are automatically eligible to be switched if one becomes sick or gets in an accident felt redundant, as if we were getting this information for the first time when it had already been explained previously. Despite this, I didn’t entirely grasp these concepts by the end of the book.\n\n- **Engagement and Entertainment:**  \n  I ended up loving this book because it felt so much like watching a film. The suspense, the excitement, and the anxiety kept me thoroughly entertained throughout. If a book can hold my attention from start to finish, which doesn’t always happen, I am sold.\n\n- **Potential for Adaptation:**  \n  I’m blown away by this story and genuinely wonder when it will be made into a movie. Not kidding—it has that cinematic quality that would translate beautifully to the screen.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some initial struggles with the worldbuilding and a few repetitive explanations, the book’s gripping narrative and cinematic feel made it an unforgettable read. It kept me engaged and entertained from beginning to end, leaving me eager to see it adapted into a film.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While its complexity occasionally made it challenging to follow, the story's creativity and mind-bending elements left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story felt disjointed, with too much back-and-forth between different storylines, making it hard to follow or invest in.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was slow and dry, which made the reading experience less enjoyable. The story dragged, and there wasn’t enough momentum to keep me fully engaged.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing itself was well-crafted and technically sound. Despite the issues with the plot and pacing, the author demonstrated skill in their prose.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  While I typically enjoy science fiction, this book didn’t resonate with me. However, I recognize that others in the community might find it more appealing, and I plan to share it in our Little Free Library for others to enjoy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had a promising premise but fell short in execution due to a lack of plot development and slow pacing. While the writing was strong, the story didn’t hold my interest. I hope others might find it more enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Following a tragic accident that claims the life of a young social media star, Nelah is compelled to confront the repercussions of her actions while fighting for her own survival and that of her child. The plot is intense and emotionally charged, marked by high stakes and a pervasive sense of impending doom.",

Nelah finds a fleeting escape in her affair with Janish Koshal, a wealthy businessman, but this decision ultimately spirals into devastating consequences.",

The immersive language, enriched with Setswana words and phrases, creates a vivid and culturally resonant backdrop.",

Despite this, the exploration of social issues like gender, race, and class privilege was commendable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I think this was intentional, but it didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, I was so bored that I had to DNF (Did Not Finish) the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the writing style was beautiful, the excessive focus on world-building and the slow plot progression made the book unengaging for me. The suffocating character dynamics and the unappealing world further contributed to my decision to stop reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (The review does not provide a specific rating score.)"

The second half was fast-paced and engaging.\n  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was inconsistent throughout the book. At times, it felt bad, and at other times, it was confusing, which made it hard to fully immerse myself in the story.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was confusing, particularly in how misogyny was portrayed. It was never clearly established how the misogyny in this world differed from that in our own, which left me with unanswered questions.\n\n- **Themes and Ideas:**  \n  Despite the issues, I enjoyed some of the ideas presented, especially in the second half. The body-mind theme was intriguing, but I felt the novel could have explored it more deeply.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a rocky start with inconsistent writing and confusing world-building, it improved in the second half with a faster pace and interesting ideas. The body-mind theme showed potential but could have been developed further. Overall, it was a mixed experience with moments of enjoyment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5/5"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel is set in a futuristic dystopian Africa where consciousness can be uploaded and transferred into other bodies. This creates a stark hierarchy: the wealthy enjoy immortality and eternal youth, while the less fortunate lead short, miserable lives. Society is deeply patriarchal, with women heavily monitored to ensure a domestic supply of infants for future body transfers.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story follows Nelah, a middle-class woman who gained wealth through her architecture business. After her consciousness is transferred into a former criminal’s body, she must undergo regular mental reviews by her husband and the government to prove she’s not displaying criminal tendencies. Her goal is to have the microchip implanted in her removed to regain her freedom. However, her life takes a dramatic turn after a failed rendezvous with her wealthy lover, leading to a struggle for survival against both the government and the spiritual world.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nelah is a compelling protagonist, navigating her precarious position in society while grappling with her identity and freedom. Her husband and the wealthy man she’s involved with add layers of complexity to her relationships and the societal pressures she faces.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  The novel is thought-provoking and explores intriguing themes, but it suffers from a lack of cohesion. The introduction of a supernatural element feels sudden and jarring, shifting the story in an unexpected direction. More editing could have streamlined the narrative and improved its overall flow.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is an interesting and ambitious sci-fi novel that raises thought-provoking questions about societal hierarchies, identity, and freedom. However, its execution could have been stronger with more cohesive editing, particularly in integrating the supernatural elements. Despite its flaws, it has the potential to be a compelling and impactful story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "The story centers on the protagonist's tumultuous relationship with her controlling husband and her emotional and sexual affair with another man. Struggling to break free from the affair, she finds herself drawn back to her lover time and again. This entanglement unfolds in a surreal, almost cybernetic atmosphere, punctuated by bizarre imagery—such as peeling off skin—that underscores her inner turmoil.",

Important elements such as the landscape, climate, and notable changes over the thousand-year timeline are missing. Additionally, technological advancements appear inconsistent; for instance, while body-hopping and artificial wombs are present, characters still drive SUVs.",

This stark gender inequality deeply resonates with the protagonist, who embodies the narrative's emotional drive. Additionally, themes of class disparity emerge, illustrating how the wealthy may extend their lives to 2,000 years, while the rest are confined to just 200."

            "The book felt clumsy and unfocused, attempting to blend too many elements without creating a cohesive narrative. It resembled a collection of three to five short stories stitched together, lacking a clear direction. Around the halfway mark, I contemplated abandoning it. The pacing was frustrating, burdened by unnecessary explanations and info-dumps that continued into the later chapters (notably around page 350). The climactic confrontation with the villain was undermined by awkward exposition, disrupting both tension and flow. Additionally, the acknowledgments revealed that part of the narrative stemmed from a short story, further contributing to its disjointed quality. The author’s effort to weave multiple concepts and genres ultimately fell short, leaving the story feeling incomplete and unsatisfying.",

The body-hopping technology was both over-explained—burdened by irrelevant cultural details—and under-explained, lacking a clear rationale for its existence. Crucial elements, such as the purpose of murder trials and the recycling of criminal bodies, remained unclear even towards the end.",
            "The book strives to merge various genres—cyberpunk thriller, paranormal thriller, and transcendental post-sci-fi—but ultimately falls short in fully realizing any of these concepts. It reads more like a collection of promising ideas that lack proper development and integration."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  Tlotlo Tsamaase has created an incredible dystopia. The novel presents a fresh and imaginative take on a misogynist society, where criminal behavior is controlled with microchips, babies are grown in artificial wombs, and consciousness can be transferred through bodyhopping as a means to achieve immortality.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book offers a thoughtful and incisive exploration of the future, particularly examining what it means to be a woman when motherhood is no longer tied to one's physical body. It also delves into the intersections of race, class, and gender, highlighting how these lines are drawn to preserve the status quo for a select few.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The story takes a little while to get going, but once it does, it becomes hard to put down.  \n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n  Tsamaase is a new voice in sci-fi, and their work is both insightful and imaginative. I suspect they will continue to produce compelling fiction as their career progresses.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a fantastic read, offering a fresh and thought-provoking take on dystopian fiction. It combines imaginative world-building with sharp social commentary, making it a standout work. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to reading more from Tlotlo Tsamaase.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Switching to the hardcover version helped me engage better. The narrator was great, and I think the second half of the book might work better as an audiobook than the first half.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nelah was a fascinating character, and I found their world intriguing. The ways Nelah is different—such as the check-ins, family dinners, and struggles with family—were thought-provoking.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was interesting, and I enjoyed imagining how this world could or couldn’t work in a setting I’m familiar with.  \n\n- **Pacing and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  However, somewhere along the way, the story bogged down and lost me. I wanted to feel the anger and the rush of change, but I couldn’t stay engaged or feel pulled into the narrative.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  While the story was interesting, it ultimately wasn’t my cup of tea.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had intriguing characters and world-building, but the pacing and emotional engagement didn’t fully resonate with me.

The story combined elements of a Minority Report-esque dark future set in Botswana, a critique of patriarchal society, the inclusion of trans identities, ghosts, murder trials, and even a non-binary god. While I love genre-crossing, I’m not sure if all these elements came together cohesively.  \n\n- **Themes and Politics:**  \n  The book’s politics left me feeling conflicted. At first, it seemed like a character study of a deeply flawed individual navigating a misogynistic society, but then the narrative shifted to portray her as innocent of wrongdoing. This abrupt change was jarring. Additionally, there was a lot of pro-life language, which added another layer of complexity to my feelings about the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, described as being in a \"female body,\" was initially presented as a flawed figure in a patriarchal world.
