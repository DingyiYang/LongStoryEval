The twins, Andy and Anthony, along with Julie, her brother Jonathan, and their parents, form a warm and inviting family circle that made me wish I could be part of it. The main characters—Andy, Anthony, Julie, and Jonathan—are genuinely lovable, and I found myself wanting them as friends and family. The chemistry between Andy and Julie is particularly captivating, and I thoroughly enjoyed their connection. Additionally, Cindy, Julie's best friend, adds depth to the story with her significant and well-crafted role.",

However, around the 40% mark, the story became captivating. I became emotionally invested, swooning over the characters and shedding tears on multiple occasions. Andy has definitely earned a place on my book boyfriend list, and their story resonated with me deeply."

            "The characters were well-developed and had distinct personalities. The male main character (MMC) played a pivotal role in helping the female main character (FMC) embrace a healthier lifestyle, including improved eating habits and gym routines. His caring and loving nature shone through, as he often spoke about the FMC to his friends before they eventually confessed their feelings.

I really loved how it was incorporated into the writing, and I thought that it really added another layer to the characters.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - I also love the development of the characters' relationship, although I do think it got a little tedious at one point because it felt obvious that Andy was in love with Julie.  \n   - Later in the book, it was revealed that everyone around the two of them knew how Andy felt while Julie remained clueless. Once I got to that point, the fact that it felt obvious to the reader felt a little more intentional, as if we were just like their family and friends.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n   - The banter is top-notch, the spice is perfection, and the couple is adorable. It has all the right ingredients for a fun, kicking-your-feet-in-the-air romance novel debut!  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - All in all, I would totally recommend this book.  \n   - Thank you to Cee Yang and her team for providing me with an advanced review copy, and congratulations on your debut novel! I cannot wait to see what else you have in store for us readers!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a delightful romance novel with strong cultural representation, well-developed characters, and engaging romantic elements. While the pacing felt a bit slow initially, the story quickly became captivating, making it a highly recommended read for fans of heartwarming and fun romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5 stars)"

            "I don't particularly like Andy. He seems fine, but his issues, which may be more apparent to me due to my personal experiences, detract from my enjoyment. The running scene at the beginning of the book is especially off-putting; both Andy and Anthony display a troubling level of misogyny, fixating excessively on a woman running alone and engaging in unnecessary competitiveness. Additionally, Andy's possessive and childish reaction when Julie mentions dating someone else further diminished my appreciation for his character.",

He's fine, but he has some issues that are maybe only apparent to me, after going through my own personal life experiences.  \n   - I really don't love the running scene in the beginning of the book. Both Andy and Anthony are being pretty misogynistic the entire time, from being OVERLY concerned about a woman alone (this happens several times throughout the book) and the competitiveness.  \n   - The other part that turned me a little off on Andy was how he acted when Julie even started to mention going on a date with someone. He acts very possessive and childish, and I just didn't like it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book for its engaging writing style, relatable character journey, and the beautifully written steamy scenes.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story revolves around Julie Lo and Andy Hughes, childhood best friends turned roommates, as Julie realizes her childhood crush on Andy never faded. The book explores whether Andy reciprocates her feelings. The premise is engaging and centers on themes of family and romance.  \n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**  \n  The romance is a slow burn, which isn’t usually my preference, but it worked well in this context. Julie and Andy’s relationship is incredibly cute, with adorable flirting and banter. The childhood friends-to-lovers trope is executed beautifully, though Julie’s obliviousness to Andy’s feelings was a bit frustrating.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Julie and Andy’s dynamic is heartwarming and well-developed. However, I found Julie’s obliviousness to Andy’s obvious flirting and his childhood declaration of love (captured on old family videotapes) a bit unrealistic.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The book emphasizes family, which I appreciated. It includes popular tropes like childhood friends to lovers, roommates to lovers, and boy next door, all of which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  This is the first book in the series, with the second book focusing on Andy’s brother, Anthony, and Julie’s cousin, Shoua. I’m excited to read the next installment when it’s released.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a super cute and fluffy read with a strong focus on family and a slow-burn romance. While Julie’s obliviousness was a minor drawback, the chemistry between the characters and the well-executed tropes made it an enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️.5/5"

            "The story contained repetitive elements, particularly regarding its focus on nostalgia. While this theme was central to the narrative, a single reference would have sufficed. Additionally, Julie's gradual realization of her feelings caused the pacing to feel somewhat sluggish.",
            "The chemistry between the two main characters, Julie and Andy, was vividly portrayed, capturing both their love and the tension between them. However, Julie's prolonged obliviousness to Andy's feelings—lasting over half the book—felt excessive, even if it aligned with her character. This sentiment was echoed by her family members in the story.",
            "The book exudes a charming, slice-of-life, Hallmark-style love story vibe. While it was enjoyable and uplifting, it ultimately lacked a distinctive quality that would make it truly memorable."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This friends-to-lovers romance was cute and heartwarming, but it had its frustrating moments, particularly with Julie's prolonged obliviousness and some repetitive themes. While it didn’t leave a lasting impression, it’s a pleasant read for those who enjoy straightforward, slice-of-life love stories.",

However, Julie's obliviousness to Andy's feelings for more than half of the book felt excessive, even though it was part of her character. Even her family members in the story seemed to agree with this sentiment.  \n\n- **Plot Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story had some repetitive elements, particularly the emphasis on nostalgia. While it was a central theme, mentioning it once would have sufficed to convey the point. The slow realization of Julie's feelings also contributed to the pacing feeling a bit dragged out.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre Alignment:**  \n  The book had a very slice-of-life, Hallmark-style love story vibe. While it was cute and made me happy, it didn’t stand out as particularly special or unique.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the romance was enjoyable, especially since the obliviousness was the only major miscommunication. It’s a nice read for fans of the romance genre, though it felt a bit underwhelming overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis friends-to-lovers romance was cute and heartwarming, but it had its frustrating moments, particularly with Julie's prolonged obliviousness and some repetitive themes.

            "This novel is a charming best friends-to-lovers romance that incorporates elements of forced proximity, though it feels more like voluntary closeness since the characters are already best friends. The lack of a dual POV—aside from the epilogue—doesn't detract from the narrative; Andy's love for Julie shines through his actions and expressions. The romance is heartwarming, and I appreciated the absence of a third-act breakup, which adds a refreshing touch to the story. Both main characters, Andy and Julie, are well-developed, and their transition from friends to lovers feels natural and believable. The supporting characters, including their families and Julie’s work friend Cindy, enrich the story, with their interactions adding depth and warmth to the overall narrative.",
