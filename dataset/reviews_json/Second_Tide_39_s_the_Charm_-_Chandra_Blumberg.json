While depth isn’t always required in a romance, I felt it was missing here.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Chemistry:**  \n   - The slow burn lacked sexual tension. Although closed-door romance is fine, I didn’t feel the spark between the MCs. Their friendship overshadowed their romance, making it less compelling.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The book was light and easy to read, but it didn’t fully engage me. It was an okay read overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Second Tides the Charm* by Chandra Blumberg had some enjoyable elements, such as its light and easy reading style, the lack of character depth and romantic tension made it difficult for me to fully connect with the story. The tropes were present, but the execution fell short in creating a memorable romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThanks to @netgalley and @htp for providing a digital ARC in exchange for an honest review.

            "The story's extended separation, driven by fear and longing, leaves little room for the couple to connect without anxiety. The emotional payoff arrives only at the end, feeling rushed and incomplete. Centered on two remarkable individuals who have loved each other from afar, the narrative follows their reunion three years later as they collaborate on shark research for the summer. Their enduring affection is evident, and the engaging shark science and playful banter add enjoyable layers to the tale.",
            "The fear and hesitancy that initially strained their relationship linger throughout much of the book, causing the romance to feel prolonged. The female protagonist frequently withdraws due to career ambitions and a fear of commitment, while the male protagonist eventually mirrors her hesitance. This pattern of distance and emotional withdrawal ultimately renders their relationship unsatisfying."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the book has enjoyable elements like the shark science and banter, the execution of the second-chance romance fell short due to prolonged fear-driven hesitancy, unsatisfying pacing, and an ambiguous ending. The abiding love and faithfulness were endearing, but the constant pulling away and lack of emotional payoff kept it from being a 5-star read.",

They reunite three years later to work on shark research for the summer, and it’s clear they’ve been in love the whole time.  \n   - The nerdy shark science and fun banter are enjoyable elements of the story.  \n\n- **Second Chance Romance Execution:**  \n   - The breakup reason was unsatisfying; it stemmed from fear and hesitancy rather than a substantial issue.  \n   - The growth leading them back together took too long, which dragged the story.  \n   - There was an abiding love and faithfulness, especially on the guy’s side, which was endearing.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationship Development:**  \n   - The fear and hesitancy that initially tanked their relationship persisted throughout most of the book, making the romance feel drawn out.  \n   - The female protagonist pulls away frequently due to career goals and fear of being tied down, while the male protagonist eventually becomes hesitant too.  \n   - The constant pulling away and long-distance dynamic made the relationship unsatisfying to read.  \n\n- **Pacing and Emotional Payoff:**  \n   - The prolonged pining and fear-driven separation stretched the story, leaving little time for the couple to be together without fear.  \n   - The emotional payoff comes only at the very end, which felt rushed and incomplete.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - The audiobook features dual POV with dual narrators. The female narrator does a great job with both voices, but the male narrator struggles with the heroine’s voice.  \n\n- **Safety Details (Content Warnings):**  \n   - No other romantic interests; they only have eyes for each other.  \n   - The male protagonist hasn’t dated anyone since their breakup, while the female protagonist tried dating others but found no one comparable.  \n   - The book is tame, with only kissing and references to past intimacy.  \n   - The epilogue is ambiguous, leaving it unclear if they live together, get married, or are just together for the summer.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has enjoyable elements like the shark science and banter, the execution of the second-chance romance fell short due to prolonged fear-driven hesitancy, unsatisfying pacing, and an ambiguous ending. The abiding love and faithfulness were endearing, but the constant pulling away and lack of emotional payoff kept it from being a 5-star read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

            "*Second Tide’s the Charm* is a low-key second-chance romance that does not disappoint, though it doesn't quite captivate. While the plot isn't dull, it lacks a certain engagement that keeps you fully invested. The third-act breakup, predictable yet fitting, resonates with the overall understated tone of the story.",
            "In this story, I struggled to connect with the characters primarily due to an overemphasis on internal reflections and nostalgia. While I appreciated that Hope and Adrian made mistakes and were open to apologizing, forgiving, and rebuilding trust, their lack of chemistry was a significant drawback. The kisses felt flat, and, despite being the only intimate moments, I didn't feel their impact. However, I did enjoy their initial efforts to fall out of love, which ultimately intensified their feelings for each other.",

After encountering numerous \"very white\" narratives, I was eager for more diversity, and this book certainly delivered. The representation is commendable, particularly in highlighting how crucial Hope’s work is in inspiring young girls to pursue careers in science."

Though the romance lacked chemistry, the story’s low-key vibe and themes of forgiveness and trust were commendable. I’ll definitely explore more works by the author and the narrators.",

They communicate.  \n   - Sadly, there’s little chemistry between them. I didn’t feel the kisses—and yes, it’s kisses only—but I did enjoy their initial attempts to fall out of love, which inevitably made them fall even harder.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - *Second Tide’s the Charm* is an unassuming, low-drama second-chance romance. It’s not bad, and it didn’t bore me, but it failed to fully engage me.  \n   - The third-act breakup, as expected, felt unnecessary, but at least it matched the story’s low-key vibe.  \n\n- **Narration Performance:**  \n   - The narrators added to the experience. Keylor Leigh’s smooth, youthful voice gave the female lead extra warmth and likability.  \n   - Amir Abdullah’s tone, rhythm, and pace took a moment to get used to, but once I did, I found myself relaxing into his style and enjoying his performance.  \n\n- **Strengths and Highlights:**  \n   - What kept me listening were the kind characters, the fascinating and unique shark content, and the well-executed friendship dynamics.  \n   - Ultimately, while this story didn’t fully resonate with me, I appreciated its diverse cast and exploration of what we’re willing to do and risk for love.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Second Tide’s the Charm* didn’t fully engage me emotionally due to its reliance on telling rather than showing, I appreciated its unique premise, diverse representation, and the narrators’ performances.

Their initial split seemed to stem from miscommunication and fear, which felt a bit underwhelming.  \n\n- **Unique Elements and Themes:**  \n  - The shark research aspect was a standout feature. It was refreshing and something I hadn’t encountered before in a romance novel. I appreciated how both characters shared this interest but had their own individual paths and goals within the field.  \n\n- **Spice Level and Tone:**  \n  - The book has minimal spice, making it a sweet and light read. It’s suitable for readers who prefer a more subdued romantic tone.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a pleasant and quick read, though it didn’t fully deliver on the emotional depth I hoped for in the romance. The unique shark research theme added a fresh twist, making it stand out in its genre. While not a standout favorite, it’s still an enjoyable book for those looking for something light and easy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 ⭐️"

Three years later, they are forced to work together, reigniting unresolved feelings and tensions.\n   - The dynamic between them is complex, with both characters struggling to balance their personal dreams and their connection to each other.

            "The romance may lack steam, but it compensates with emotional intimacy and tender gestures. The pacing is enjoyable and refreshingly light on angst, making it perfect for fans of second-chance romances. Centered on Hope and Adrian, marine biologists who reconnect after years apart, the story benefits from a unique backdrop of shark research and scientific exploration, adding depth to the narrative.",
            "In this story, Hope is intelligent and determined, yet reluctant to sacrifice her future for a relationship. Adrian, on the other hand, is charismatic and thoughtful but carries the weight of past traumas. Both characters have matured over time, but their stubbornness and fear of vulnerability create tension between them. Communication issues plagued their previous relationship, and they are committed to avoiding those pitfalls again. The will-they, won't-they dynamic propels the narrative, as both still harbor feelings for one another. Their love is conveyed subtly through actions rather than overt declarations, adding emotional depth to the story. Additionally, the novel effectively showcases diversity in scientific fields, resonating with readers' own experiences in academia.",

In contrast, Hope is career-driven and left Adrian three years ago to focus on her ambitions.

While the romance is sweet, it lacks depth and urgency; I enjoyed both characters but didn’t feel a strong emotional pull for their reunion, which is essential in a romance novel.

While I don’t know much about sharks or marine life, I love how she conveyed her passion for the topic through her characters, ensuring that readers unfamiliar with the subject wouldn’t feel lost.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  Hope and Adrian are both relatable characters. They are shark experts and researchers, but I appreciate how each approaches the field from different angles—Hope as a marine biologist and Adrian as a photographer and YouTuber using his channel to educate people about sharks.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Realism:**  \n  Their romance was easy to root for. There’s a lot of tension and questions about whether they can make it work this time around, but their issues feel realistic. The reasons for their initial breakup weren’t overly dramatic, and while their reunion is a little awkward at first, the book spends time addressing their past issues and figuring out how they can move forward together in a healthy way.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is a bit of a negative, with some repetitive pining and questioning in the relationship development. While this was slightly annoying, it more or less worked. The short chapters were a double-edged sword—they contributed to snappier pacing in some parts but also fed into the repetitiveness, making it feel like the story had progressed a lot while still having much left to cover.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the pacing issues, I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to readers looking for a fun second-chance romance with Black leads and a cool marine biology theme.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Second Tide’s the Charm* is an engaging second-chance romance with relatable characters, a unique marine biology theme, and realistic relationship dynamics.

There wasn’t enough emotional buildup or \"burn\" to make their reunion satisfying. The repeated time jumps may have contributed to this issue, as they prevented the reader from fully experiencing the characters' angst and unresolved feelings.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The FL’s non-confrontational personality was understandable, but the ML’s lack of effort to reconnect felt inconsistent with her character and their relationship dynamics.  \n   - Both characters were portrayed as highly skilled and passionate about their professions, which added depth to their personalities.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n   - The shark research element was compelling and added a unique layer to the story.

Despite both being scientists with demanding careers, the resolution to their long-distance struggles felt superficial, relying more on the idea of \"we love each other, and that's all we need\" rather than practical solutions.\n\n- **Setting and Career Representation:**  \n  The summery, shark-research setting was a highlight. The inclusion of STEM careers, particularly marine biology, added a unique and enjoyable layer to the story. The little scientific tidbits were a delightful touch that appealed to the science nerd in me.\n\n- **Tone and Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, the book was a fun, cutesy read with a lighthearted tone. It delivered on the promise of a second-chance romance and provided an entertaining escape, especially for fans of STEM-themed romances.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a charming, summery second-chance romance with a unique STEM backdrop. While the character development and relationship dynamics could have been more fleshed out, the setting and career representation made it an enjoyable and engaging read. It’s a light, fun story perfect for fans of romances with a scientific twist.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Hope, weighed down by family obligations and uncertainty in her career, unexpectedly finds herself taking a shark research position on Adrian's boat. Now a successful YouTube star dedicated to shark rescues, Adrian embodies the very world Hope has entered. With themes of second-chance romance, forced proximity, and STEM elements, the premise is both engaging and unique. While the book offers a fun and lighthearted read, the pacing is uneven, especially in the latter half. The repetitive interactions between Hope and Adrian hinder the narrative momentum, ultimately making the resolution feel less satisfying.",
            "Adrian's character truly stood out to me; his genuine remorse for his past misunderstanding and lack of support for Hope felt authentic, as did his longing for her. However, I struggled to connect with Hope, who came across as indecisive and aimless, making it difficult to root for her. The lack of chemistry between her and Adrian diminished the emotional depth of their relationship. While there were sweet and flirty moments, the romance lacked a solid foundation of real love. The back-and-forth nature of their relationship, particularly towards the end, became repetitive and frustrating. On a positive note, their communication added a layer of maturity to their interactions.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story revolves around a second-chance romance where the protagonist's ex becomes their surprise coworker for the summer after three years of no communication. The premise is engaging, with a focus on rekindling their relationship while researching sharks on the coast of North Carolina.  \n\n- **Angst Level:**  \n  I found the angst level to be relatively low to medium, as the characters are clearly soulmates, which made their journey of falling back in love (or perhaps realizing they never fell out of love) enjoyable and heartwarming.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  The chemistry between the characters was electric and undeniable. Despite the lack of on-page spice or even fade-to-black scenes, their mutual attraction and connection were so well-written that it felt like a \"high steam, low spice\" experience.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The dual POV added depth to the story, allowing readers to understand both characters' perspectives and emotions. This made their relationship dynamics even more compelling.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  I appreciated the nerdy STEM representation, with the male main character being an influencer focused on science. The story also tackled relatable external pressures, such as career conflicts and the challenges of maintaining a relationship when life pulls people in different directions. It explored themes of sacrifice, communication, and decision-making in relationships.  \n\n- **Supporting Elements:**  \n  The close proximity moments were fun and well-executed, adding to the tension and charm of the story. The found family aspect was also sweet and heartwarming, contributing to the overall feel-good vibe of the novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis second-chance romance is a delightful read with low-to-medium angst, sizzling chemistry, and relatable themes. The dual POV, STEM representation, and exploration of career vs. relationship dynamics make it a well-rounded and engaging story. While it lacks on-page spice, the emotional and romantic tension more than makes up for it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot offered a fresh and intriguing perspective on romance, but it would have been more engaging with a stronger emphasis on rebuilding lost trust and portraying realistic adult interactions. I was also disappointed by the absence of a marriage proposal at the aquarium, which felt like a missed opportunity.",

The characters themselves lacked dimension and growth, contributing to an overall immature tone. In contrast, Gabe and Marissa were more compelling, and I'd be eager to see a spin-off centered on their story.",

            "This charming, humorous, low-spice romance captivated me from start to finish. It centers on Hope and Adrian, who bonded in college over their passion for shark research. After a five-year relationship ended abruptly when Hope returned to her hometown and deleted her social media, she spent three years away from the field. When she decides to re-enter the world of shark research, she unexpectedly lands a summer job alongside Adrian, reigniting their connection. The story is rich with push-and-pull dynamics and romantic tension between the two leads.",
            "I really enjoyed the banter and found the characters relatable, even if they occasionally frustrated me, which kept me engaged. The side characters were well-developed and added depth to the story. I appreciated the romantic tension and the journey of Hope and Adrian reconnecting. However, I wished for more focus on their romance after they got back together, as the story felt abrupt following their reconciliation."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was an enjoyable and engaging read with well-developed characters and a unique premise centered around shark research. While the romantic tension was compelling, I would have liked more closure or exploration of the main characters' relationship after they reunited.",

            "The adults in this story come across as remarkably unserious and indecisive. Rather than addressing their past and resolving lingering feelings, they avoid the conversation until a kiss forces the issue. Their inability to navigate friendship or professionalism is evident, and they seem to ignore the shared responsibility for their breakup three years ago. However, their chemistry and mutual understanding are strong, which adds depth to their interactions. Interestingly, I found myself more captivated by Hope’s best friend and her life back in Michigan.",

Her nervousness seemed unjustified, as the consequences she feared didn’t appear as severe as she portrayed. The lingering feelings between Hope and Adrian could resonate with some readers, but their lack of communication might frustrate others. The absence of flashbacks detailing how they fell in love or drifted apart made it difficult to connect with their romance. I enjoy witnessing couples fall in love, which is a key reason I love romance stories, so this gap was disappointing.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Romance Style and Realism:**  \n   - The book presents a softer, more realistic love story rather than a grand, sweeping romance.  \n   - It focuses on the breakdown of communication between the couple, Hope and Adrian, and how their miscommunication led to their breakup.  \n   - The portrayal of long-distance relationships and the importance of communication felt authentic and relatable.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Emotional Connection:**  \n   - Hope and Adrian are still deeply hung up on each other, which could either resonate with readers or frustrate them due to their lack of communication.  \n   - The absence of flashbacks showing how they fell in love or fell apart made it harder to feel fully connected to their romance.  \n   - I struggled with not seeing the \"fall\" of their relationship, as I enjoy watching couples fall in love, which is a key reason I love romance stories.  \n\n- **Character Development and Backstory:**  \n   - Hope's camera/internet shyness felt underdeveloped, and I wanted more exploration of her fears and the potential backlash she anticipated.  \n   - The reasons for her nervousness didn’t seem fully justified, as the backlash she feared didn’t appear as severe as she made it out to be.  \n\n- **Side Characters and World-Building:**  \n   - The side characters were well-written and engaging, adding depth to the story.  \n   - Hope and Adrian’s shared love of sharks was a unique and endearing detail that made them stand out.  \n   - I’m invested in the side characters and hope to see future books centered around them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a realistic and nuanced portrayal of a relationship strained by miscommunication, set against the backdrop of a long-distance romance. While the lack of flashbacks and underdeveloped aspects of Hope’s backstory left me wanting more, the relatable characters, engaging side characters, and unique details like their shared love of sharks made the story enjoyable overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars, rounded up to 4."

I am leaving my review voluntarily.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an engaging read with a compelling second-chance romance trope. While the characters had moments of frustration, their growth and eventual realization of their connection made the story worthwhile. The marine biology and photography elements added a unique and interesting layer to the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This aspect fell short for me.  \n- **Trope Execution:** As someone whose favorite trope is second-chance romances, I felt this story didn't fully deliver on the potential of the trope.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:** Despite its shortcomings, it was still a cute read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its charming moments, it didn't fully meet my expectations, especially as a second-chance romance. The lack of deeper conflict and weaker plot flow made it an okay read, but not as compelling as I had hoped.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The premise revolves around two shark researchers, Hope and Adrian, who broke up three years ago and haven’t spoken since. Hope must work with Adrian for the summer if she wants to re-enter the shark research world, setting up a compelling tension-filled dynamic.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are well-developed, and I was immediately drawn into their story from the very first page. Hope, in particular, stands out as a strong and relatable protagonist. The inclusion of side characters who also pave the way for women in shark research adds depth and representation to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  I appreciated the positive portrayal of sharks, which are often misunderstood and depicted as scary creatures. The novel also highlights the success of women in a traditionally male-dominated field, showcasing Hope and other female characters as trailblazers. While it’s true that women can excel in any career, seeing this representation in the story was refreshing and empowering.  \n\n- **Engagement and Writing Style:**  \n  The story is engaging, with a writing style that kept me hooked throughout. The positive diction and the way the author handled the romance and professional dynamics made for an enjoyable and immersive read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful summer romance with a unique setting and well-crafted characters. It not only delivers an engaging love story but also celebrates women’s achievements in shark research and challenges stereotypes about sharks. A highly enjoyable and empowering read!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The supporting characters, especially their families, were well-developed and added warmth to the narrative. However, the chemistry between Hope and Adrian felt lacking.
