        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Detail:**  \n  - The novel provides fantastic hiking and camping details, set in a location I’ve never been to and haven’t read much about. This added a unique and immersive element to the story.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  - I really loved the bond between the cousins, even as they were navigating their way back to the closeness they once shared. Their dynamic was a highlight of the story.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  - I appreciated that this YA novel had zero romance, which felt refreshing and different from many other books in the genre.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Flashbacks:**  \n  - The story suffers slightly from frequent flashbacks to a traumatic backstory, which can feel repetitive (e.g., the recurring phrase “rustle of fabric”). However, having two different main characters helps balance this issue.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  - The book includes themes of sexual assault, which may be triggering for some readers. If this is a sensitive topic for you, it’s worth noting before diving in.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  - The novel shares a similar issue with the author’s other book, *Four Found Dead*, in terms of flashbacks. However, the overall excellence of the story outweighs this flaw.  \n  - If you enjoyed this book but prefer more mystery-thriller elements and less focus on sexual assault trauma, I recommend trying *One Was Lost*.  \n\n- **Personal Favorites:**  \n  - This book is tied with *One Was Lost* as my favorite works from this author so far.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some repetitive flashbacks and heavy themes, the novel excels in its detailed setting, strong character relationships, and refreshing lack of romance. It’s a compelling read, though readers should be mindful of its sensitive content.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

The story could have just been about the two gals hiking and the trials and tribulations they faced—low on food and water, getting lost, injured, and stuck in a precarious situation during a sudden rainstorm and flash flood. I was incredibly nervous for them throughout the whole book and loved this portion of the story.  \n\n- **Thriller Elements:**  \n  The mysterious person at mile zero, a potential murderer, and several shady characters they encounter along the trail added a thriller element. While this was entertaining, I could've done without it—the hiking portion was enough to keep me engaged. That said, I did enjoy the bit of mystery, even though the twist was glaringly obvious to me early on.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics:**  \n  The part I struggled with the most was the off-screen sexual assault that happens to one of the characters. I don’t feel it was necessary to the story. While the assault does influence some of the characters' decisions and biases, these could have been written without including the SA. I understand that SA happens and it’s important to acknowledge, but I’m not sure this book handled it for the right reasons.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I have mixed feelings about this book.

As someone who's not an avid outdoorsperson, this added credibility to the story and was presented in an engaging way.  \n\n- **Character Development and POV:**  \n  The dual POV of the main characters, Aster and Katie, was a strong addition to the story. It provided insight into their communication disconnects and how they struggled to navigate their relationship. Each perspective also offered a deeper understanding of the other character, highlighting the bond they once shared and why they're struggling so much now.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot itself was interesting, though some moments were better paced than others. However, the quick wrap-up at the end left me feeling a bit unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  I would caution readers about themes of rape, trauma, graphic injuries/violence, murder, and strong language.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the novel engaging, particularly due to its detailed world-building and strong character development through dual POVs. However, the pacing inconsistencies and abrupt ending slightly diminished my enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars (I liked it)  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to NetGalley & SOURCEBOOKS Fire | Sourcebooks Fire for the free ARC.

The question of whether they can repair their relationship and survive the ordeal drives much of the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The novel explores heavy themes, including trauma, survival, and the complexities of relationships. The mention of rape and its impact on Katie is a recurring element, handled through flashbacks. Additionally, the story includes a significant amount of swearing, which may not appeal to all readers.

I appreciated how their trip served as a means to repair the strain in their relationship from the previous year.

In contrast, Katie is more extroverted but also cautious and discerning, making her a better judge of character. Unfortunately, their skills seem to take a backseat from the very beginning.",
