            "The book primarily follows Pell, an engineer, as she repeatedly travels to the tower to repair machines and grapple with her feelings for another character, Heartwood. This repetitive focus makes the narrative feel uneventful. The plot only gains momentum in the final 20%, when a flashback reveals that the villagers are actually Ancients and that a god constructed the tower to imprison Moseus, another deity. This sudden influx of information feels rushed and disrupts the otherwise slow pacing of the story.",

The village is minimalistic, featuring only a handful of medieval fantasy roles—such as a blacksmith, innkeeper, and herbalist—alongside a tower, a wall, and distant mountains.

The story revolves around an ancient tower and the appearance of two otherworldly men who ask her to fix it. One of the men is described as \"hot\" but initially dislikes her for unexplained reasons.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is reminiscent of Brandon Sanderson's style, which is praised for its depth and intricacy. However, the reviewer notes that this book includes more romantic elements, such as kissing, which adds a unique flavor to the fantasy setting.\n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The story has a mythological feel, which enhances its immersive quality. The dialogue is impactful, with lines like “Waste your strength, you corrupted putrescence. I’m coming for you,” adding to the dramatic and engaging tone.\n\n- **Romantic Content:**  \n  The romance is present but not overly explicit. There are two fade-to-black scenes, indicating that the romantic moments are implied rather than depicted in detail. This approach keeps the focus on the emotional and fantastical elements of the story.\n\n- **Author’s Reputation:**  \n  The reviewer expresses confidence in the author, Charlie N. Holmberg, stating that she \"never disappoints.\" This suggests a consistent quality in her storytelling that readers can rely on.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis romantic fantasy novel combines intricate worldbuilding, a mythological tone, and a touch of romance to create an engaging and unique story.

The world-building is intricate, and the characters, especially Pell, are well-developed. The romance is sweetly portrayed, and the ending leaves room for a potential sequel. Despite the initial challenges with the audiobook format, I enjoyed the story and look forward to more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

It doesn’t provide enough depth or clarity, which makes it hard to fully immerse myself in the story. The lack of thoroughness in the world-building makes the payoff unsatisfying, as if I’m navigating a game without knowing the rules. This issue was also present in the author’s previous work, *The Paper Magician*, where I felt similarly lost and confused about how things functioned.  \n\n- **Plot Engagement:**  \n  The unclear world-building detracted from my ability to focus on and enjoy the plot. Instead of being drawn into the story, I found myself wandering in a fog, trying to piece together how the world worked rather than engaging with the narrative.  \n\n- **Author’s Consistency:**  \n  This is my second time reading this author’s work, and I’ve come to realize that the issues I experienced with *The Paper Magician* weren’t isolated. The same problems with world-building and immersion persist in this novel, which has led me to decide that I’m done with Holmberg’s books.  \n\n- **Value for Money:**  \n  The book was free on Amazon this month, which is a definite bonus. However, even with the cost factor removed, the reading experience didn’t meet my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had the advantage of being free, the lack of thorough world-building and the resulting confusion significantly impacted my enjoyment of the story.

            "The world-building in this story is minimal, primarily featuring a desert landscape, flowers, and machinery. While there is a rationale for this simplicity, I would have appreciated more detail and depth. Set in Emgarden, a small village of just thirty-eight inhabitants, the community is enclosed by an uncrossable wall and an ancient fortified tower. The villagers experience a unique cycle of eight hours of sunlight followed by five hours of mist, creating an intriguing atmosphere. The arrival of a stranger named Moseus during the mist offers Pell scrap metal in exchange for her assistance in repairing the tower's machines. As Pell works, she encounters visions and memories linked to the enigmatic Heartwood, another resident of the tower.",

While the pacing can be slow at times—particularly during the detailed repair descriptions, which can be tedious—the eventual payoff is rewarding as the full scope of the narrative unfolds. The story features one mild physical confrontation, but it remains neither graphic nor intense.",

She is determined and resourceful, though her persistent demands for answers and occasional tantrums can be frustrating.

Their reasons for forgetting this connection are intricately linked to the story's mysteries.",

However, this story turned out to be quite good and exceeded my expectations.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**\n   - The world is fascinating and unique, with a desert community, an impenetrable pink crystal wall, an inaccessible tower, and a sun that remains stationary in the sky. The cycles of tones and mists add to the mysterious atmosphere.\n   - The world is intentionally confusing at first, but everything is eventually explained in a satisfying way.\n\n- **Characterization (Pell):**\n   - Pell, the protagonist, is a short, dark, strong woman with a passion for tinkering with Ancient tech. She is determined and resourceful but can be frustrating at times due to her repeated demands for answers and her tendency to have tantrums when she doesn’t get them.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story starts with a mysterious stranger asking Pell for help repairing broken machines in the tower. As she works on them, she begins to experience visions that feel like hidden memories, hinting at a deeper connection to the machines.\n   - The pacing can feel slow at times, especially with the detailed descriptions of machine repairs, which made my eyes glaze over. However, the payoff is worth it when the full scope of the story is revealed.\n\n- **Reveals and Lore:**\n   - The reveals about the world and its lore are epic and well-executed. The story involves gods fighting a war against Ruin, a plan to halt a planet’s rotation to imprison the enemy, and demigods diminished by tendrils of the void. These elements make the story feel grand and unique.\n\n- **Writing Style and Repetition:**\n   - The writing style is engaging, but there are repetitive phrases, such as the frequent use of \"his/her lip ticked\" to describe smiling. This became noticeable and slightly annoying over time.\n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**\n   - There is a romance subplot, but it is subtle and fade-to-black in terms of steaminess. The falling in love happened before the events of this book, and the reasons for forgetting it are tied to the story’s mysteries.\n\n- **Violence and Conflict:**\n   - The story includes one mild physical confrontation, but it is not overly graphic or intense.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a unique and interesting blend of fantasy and sci-fi, with a richly imagined world and an epic, satisfying payoff. While the pacing and some repetitive elements can be frustrating, the story’s depth and creativity make it a worthwhile read. I now look forward to reading more from this author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "Most of the action unfolds in the final quarter of the book, leaving the story feeling too lengthy for a novella yet too brief for a full novel. It either needed more detail or less. While I appreciate the author's technical skill, the twist doesn't resonate as powerfully as in *Piranesi*. The open ending hints at sequels, which is frustrating. Pelnolphe, or Pell, is a tinkerer in a dying desert world, where her small settlement is confined by an impassable, mysterious amaranthine wall and a broken tower. When two beings who shouldn't exist approach her to help repair the tower's enigmatic machines, events are set in motion that will fundamentally alter her understanding of reality.",
            "In the first three-quarters of the story, the pace is slow yet engaging. Pell grapples with the machines around her, questioning their purpose and her own. While there is a hint of romance, it feels more like a backdrop than a central theme. As an unreliable narrator, Pell's introspection leaves her—and consequently the other characters—enigmatic. This distance made it difficult for me to connect with them.",
            "This is my second book by Charlie N. Holmberg, following *The Paper Magician*, and I approached it with curiosity. Selected as the Fantasy choice for this month's Amazon Prime First Reads, its intriguing description promised an engaging read. I recommend diving in with minimal prior knowledge. The story unfolds like a puzzle, culminating in a surprising twist ending. It’s reminiscent of Susanna Clarke's *Piranesi*, making it challenging to rate."

Holmberg book (the first was *The Paper Magician*), and I wasn't sure what to expect.  \n   - This was the Fantasy choice for this month's Amazon Prime First Reads program, and the description sounded intriguing.  \n   - It's best to go in knowing as little as possible.  \n\n- **Genre and Comparison:**\n   - It's a puzzle book with a twist ending—the best comparison I can make is to Susanna Clarke's *Piranesi*.  \n   - Like *Piranesi*, it's very difficult to rate.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - Most of the action occurs in the last 1/4 of the book.  \n   - The story feels too long for a novella but too short for a full novel. It either needed less detail or more.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**\n   - Pelnolphe, or Pell, is a tinkerer in a dying desert world. Her small settlement is bounded by an unpassable mysterious \"amaranthine\" wall and an equally mysterious broken tower.  \n   - When she's approached by two beings who should not exist to help fix the machines of unknown purpose housed in the tower, events are set in motion that will change everything she knows, quite literally.  \n\n- **Character Development and Narration:**\n   - For the first 3/4, the pace is slow but compelling. Pell spends her days puzzling over the machines, their purpose, her purpose, etc.  \n   - There's sort of, but not really, a romance.  \n   - Pell is an unreliable narrator, and the focus is exclusively on her. I couldn't connect to the characters. She's a mystery to herself, and so a mystery to us as well.  \n\n- **Twist and Ending:**\n   - The twist happens, and while I admire what the author has done technically, the twist does not succeed to the same degree as *Piranesi*.  \n   - Although I had thought this was a standalone, the ending is left open for sequels, which was frustrating.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**\n   - Ultimately, while I'd recommend it to fans of this type of puzzle book, it was just an okay read for me.  \n   - I may try more of Holmberg's work in the future, though—her writing is compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a slow-burning puzzle with a twist ending, reminiscent of *Piranesi*. While the technical execution is admirable, the pacing, character connection, and open-ended conclusion left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied. It’s a decent read for fans of the genre, but not a standout for me personally.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It takes a long time for the story to coalesce into something coherent.  \n\n- **Mystery and Predictability:**  \n   - The mystery elements, including the \"who-dunnit\" and key revelations about the MC, were too predictable. There were too many obvious giveaways, making it clear where the story was headed long before it got there.  \n\n- **Complexity of Technical Details:**  \n   - The machines Pell works on are more confusing than entertaining. The technical descriptions could have been simplified, cutting to the chase instead of taking up over 60% of the hook.  \n\n- **Missed Opportunities for World-Building:**  \n   - There was so much potential to explore the fortress on the hill and its inhabitants, which could have enriched the plot and storylines. This supplementary material was overlooked, leaving the story feeling unbalanced.  \n\n- **Personal Disappointment and Honesty in Reviewing:**  \n   - I feel terrible leaving a negative, low-star review for this author, but honesty is essential in my reviews. If I’m not honest, what’s the point?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I am a devoted fan of Charlie N. Holmberg, this novel fell short of my expectations. The pacing was slow, the mystery was predictable, and the technical details overshadowed the story. Missed opportunities for world-building further detracted from the experience. Despite my admiration for the author, I must be honest about my disappointment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a low rating (e.g., 2 or 3 stars)."

Moseus, the third character in the triangle, is fascinating and unexpected, with subtle hints dropped throughout. However, other side characters are disappointingly one-dimensional, serving more as window dressing than fully realized individuals. The lack of emotional attachment to Pell's village members is a significant drawback.\n\n- **Twists:**\n   - *Viewpoint:* A. Holmberg is adept at taking the story in unexpected directions.

The plot revolves around Pell recovering her memory, but the pacing is uneven. The story inches along with accumulating mysteries, then resolves them in large chunks, which feels abrupt. The repetitive reminders of Pell's missing memories and the reliance on past events for \"action\" are frustrating.\n\n- **Payoff:**\n   - *Viewpoint:* B. The climax features the return of legendary characters and the resolution of the main conflict. However, the Serpent's role is underwhelming. Despite its planet-scale powers, it does little more than a minor act of assistance, which feels like a missed opportunity for a more impactful resolution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, \"Still the Sun\" has many enjoyable elements, particularly in its world-building, romantic relationships, and unexpected twists.

This abrupt conclusion, coupled with unresolved questions, may leave readers feeling unsatisfied. \n\nThe narrative begins with Moseus, a stranger who arrives at Pell’s door during a misty period, seeking her help to repair the tower's machinery. He claims that fixing the machines will bring down the wall and free those trapped on the other side. Pell is captivated by the ancient machinery and the promise of scrap metal for her village. As she works, she experiences strange flashes—either memories or hallucinations—that deepen the mystery. The plot unfolds slowly, raising questions about the machines, the tower, and the true intentions of Moseus and his companion, Heartwood.",
            "Pell is a relatable protagonist, driven by curiosity and a desire to help her village. However, her fellow villagers appear oddly passive, failing to question her frequent absences or the sudden influx of scrap metal. Moseus and Heartwood are intriguing characters, with their true motives gradually unfolding; Heartwood's avoidance of Pell heightens the tension. Pell's choice to rekindle a relationship with someone still in love with an idealized version of her raises moral concerns and feels unsettling. Additionally, the villagers' lack of curiosity or concern about Pell's activities and the distribution of resources, such as spare metal, seems unrealistic for a small, interdependent community.",
            "The novel masterfully crafts a post-apocalyptic atmosphere, characterized by its desolate landscape, enigmatic structures, and cyclical weather patterns. The immersive world-building is compelling, though the villagers' passivity occasionally undermines the setting's believability. The story begins with Pell, a grave digger and artifact seeker, residing in a small village of fewer than 40 inhabitants on a static, barren planet. This world features a vast, pink glass-like wall and an impenetrable metal tower, both steeped in mystery. The planet's lack of rotation creates a stark division between a light side and an unseen dark side, while the days alternate between sun and mist, enhancing the eerie ambiance."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Writing Style and Consistency:**  \n  I have been a fan of this author since page 3 of *The Paper Magician*, and I’m currently rereading *Will and the Wilds*. I have yet to be disappointed by anything she’s written. Her world-building skills are impeccable, and I get so sucked into her stories that it rarely takes more than 2-3 sittings to finish a book.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The universe this story exists in is strange and confusing, but in a way that leaves you desperate to uncover what you don’t yet know. It’s beautifully crafted, with elements like a weird tower, an impenetrable wall, a strange machine, and sudden visions that seem like memories.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Her characters are three-dimensional, deep, and often not what you initially expect. Nearly all the women are strong, independent, and survivors. They are well-developed and add layers to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The book is filled with mystery, intrigue, suspense, and romance. There are cool twists that keep you guessing, and the story doesn’t go where you think it will—something Holmberg is known for.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  While the book doesn’t have explicit sex (though it’s implied), no one writes a kissing scene like Charlie Holmberg. Her scenes are so well-crafted that they rival any romantic moment in *Outlander*. She also consistently emphasizes consent, which I appreciate.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Engagement:**  \n  The story gave me goosebumps—when I got nervous, when I thought I knew where it was going, and when I realized I was wrong. I stayed up until 4:30 AM on a school night to finish it, even though I had to wake up at 6 AM. I was sad when it ended because I didn’t want it to be over.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Releases:**  \n  I can’t wait for the book to be released so I can geek out with my friends who are also fans.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is another masterpiece by Charlie Holmberg, showcasing her exceptional world-building, deep characters, and ability to craft a story full of mystery, suspense, and romance. The emotional engagement and unexpected twists make it a page-turner, and the kissing scenes are unforgettable. I was completely absorbed and didn’t want it to end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story is deliberate and slow, reminiscent of building or repairing a machine. I appreciated this approach, as it allowed me to reflect on how the world and its elements interconnect. This is not a typical fantasy filled with bloodshed, swordplay, or travelogues; rather, it offers a thoughtful, mind-bending experience with imaginative world-building. The narrative evokes a *Howl’s Moving Castle* vibe, where characters possess knowledge beyond Pell's yet depend on her to repair the machines. The plot kept me engaged with unexpected insights and surprises.",
            "In this story, the main character, Pell, is a mechanically inclined tinkerer who works with ancient metal scraps. Her brash demeanor and tendency to yell rather than be warm make her a compelling protagonist. The two men in the tower, Heartwood and Moseus, are equally intriguing; while they may seem similar at first glance, their distinct personalities add depth to the narrative. The dynamic between Pell and the two men kept me thoroughly engaged throughout the story.",
            "The spice level is minimal, and the language features mild, infrequent profanity.",
            "The world-building in this story is both unique and refreshing, setting it apart from other fantasy novels. It evokes memories of Brandon Sanderson’s Cosmere, leading me to wonder if the author, a former student of Sanderson, is paying homage to him. The intricate and thoughtfully constructed setting unfolds at a slow, deliberate pace, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the world.",
            "This book may not appeal to everyone. If you favor fast-paced, action-driven narratives or find intricate world-building tedious, it might not be for you. However, for those who appreciate wonderfully strange, thought-provoking, and unique stories, this is an excellent choice.",
            "While categorized as a YA fantasy, I believe this book is more appropriate for adult readers, much like *Divine Rivals*. It effectively blends elements of fantasy and romance, making it a captivating read for a more mature audience."

It falls under the genres of fantasy and romantasy.\n\n- **Spice Level and Language:**  \n  The spice level is \"fade to black,\" and the language includes mild, infrequent profanity.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is unique and refreshing, standing out from other fantasy books. It reminded me of Brandon Sanderson’s Cosmere, and I wondered if the author, being one of his students, paid homage to him. The setting is intricate and thoughtfully constructed, with a slow, deliberate build that allows readers to immerse themselves in the world.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing is deliberate and slow, akin to building or repairing a machine. I appreciated this approach as it gave me time to sit with and think about how the world and its elements fit together.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main character, Pell, is mechanically minded and tinkers with ancient metal bits. She’s brash and more likely to yell than to be cozy, which makes her interesting. Heartwood and Moseus, the two men in the tower, are fascinating and mysterious, appearing similar on the outside but being quite different. Their dynamic with Pell kept me engaged.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story is not a traditional \"blood and guts, sword and sorcery, or travelogue fantasy.\" Instead, it’s a thoughtful, mind-bending read with wild world-building. It has a *Howl’s Moving Castle* vibe, as the characters seem to know more than Pell but rely on her to fix the machines. The plot kept me guessing, with moments of insight and surprises.\n\n- **Accessibility and Appeal:**  \n  This book isn’t for everyone. If you prefer fast-paced, action-heavy stories or dislike intricate world-building, this might not be for you. However, if you enjoy wonderfully weird, thought-provoking, and unique reads, this is a perfect choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Still the Sun* is a refreshingly unique fantasy novel with intricate world-building, deliberate pacing, and fascinating characters.

The visions she experiences while working on the machines add an intriguing layer to her character, sparking curiosity about their significance—whether they are prophecies or flashbacks.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n   - Charlie N. Holmberg's ability to build a vivid world is exceptional. I felt fully immersed in the setting, which is a hallmark of her fantasy novels.  \n   - The world of *Still the Sun* is described beautifully, with details like the hot, barren village, the scarcity of water, and the mysterious Tower adding depth to the environment.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - The pacing was slow, especially in the first half of the book. It wasn’t until around the halfway mark that the story began to gently ramp up.  \n   - The majority of the plot revolves around Pell fixing ancient machines in the Tower, which, while intriguing, didn’t fully capture my attention like Holmberg’s other works.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Pell (Pelnophe) is a quirky and engaging protagonist. Her passion for tinkering and uncovering the mysteries of ancient artifacts made her a compelling character.  \n   - The visions Pell experiences while working on the machines added an intriguing layer to her character, making me curious about their significance—whether they were prophecies or flashbacks.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - There is very little romance in the story, which aligns with Holmberg’s typical \"closed-door\" approach to romantic subplots. I didn’t mind this, as it kept the focus on the main plot.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - While I enjoyed the world-building and the mystery of the machines, the book didn’t hold my attention as strongly as Holmberg’s other novels.  \n   - The visions and the curiosity about the machines’ importance were the main elements that kept me reading.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n   - Holmberg’s writing is beautifully crafted, and I still love her unique style and quirky characters. Despite not vibing with this book as much, I remain a fan and plan to read more of her work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Still the Sun* is a well-written novel with strong world-building and an intriguing protagonist, but its slow pacing and lack of gripping engagement compared to Holmberg’s other works led me to rate it 3.5 out of 5. While it didn’t fully captivate me, I still appreciate Holmberg’s storytelling and will continue to explore her books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 out of 5."

            "The story concludes with a bittersweet ending that avoids a tidy resolution. While the romantic arc is perfectly resolved, the overall conclusion addresses a major issue only temporarily, leaving room for faith rather than certainty, which adds depth and realism. The narrative kept me engaged with a blend of large and small clues, fueling my curiosity about the resilient community in this arid fantasy world. The big reveal was satisfying; I correctly anticipated some elements while being pleasantly surprised by others. The mystery was resolved thoughtfully, tying up loose ends in a purposeful manner.",

However, once I got into it, I was completely hooked. The pacing picked up, and I found myself unable to put it down.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery surrounding the machinery and Pell’s memories was the most intriguing part of the story. I made several guesses as the plot unfolded, but none were correct, which I loved. The revelations were far more interesting than any theories I had. The book is more about discovery than action, and the ending was exceptionally well done.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were outstanding, as is typical of Charlie N. Holmberg’s work. Pell was a standout—funny, kind, serious, and stubborn in all the best ways. Her cleverness and sharp tongue made her a memorable protagonist. I also enjoyed the slow-burn romance, which was predictable but satisfying.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  Natalie Naudis’s narration was excellent. Her performance added to the experience, making it easier to engage with the story. I’m glad I chose to listen to the audiobook version.  \n\n- **Genre and Style:**  \n  The book is a blend of mystery and fantasy, reminiscent of Holmberg’s *Magic Bitter, Magic Sweet* and *The Fifth Doll*, but with the best elements of both. It’s not an action-packed fantasy but rather a story focused on discovery and unraveling truths.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Still the Sun* by Charlie N.

She is a fantasy writer extraordinaire and brings a new world to life.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world of Tampere consists of a lot of dust, desert, the village of Emgarden, the Tower, and the amaranthine wall. The world doesn’t have day and night; instead, it has cycles of sun and mist. The sun is a constant right overhead, so Pell and her people spend a lot of time watering their food crops.

When a stranger arrives in Emgarden during the mist cycle and asks Pell to help fix the great Machines in the Tower, she can’t resist the opportunity.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book sucked me in and kept me reading. I could barely put it down.  \n\n- **Technical Details and Jargon:**  \n  There was a lot of stuff about pulleys, gears, flywheels, screws, and wrenches—jargon that I didn’t fully understand and could have done without.

This leaves the door open for future installments, and the reviewer speculates that a sequel or duology might be on the horizon by late 2024 or early 2025.  \n\n- **Premise and Storytelling Methodology:**  \n  The book is praised for its \"very interesting premise\" and \"unique storytelling methodology,\" which works \"superbly\" in this context. The reviewer highlights that the story feels more like science fiction (or speculative fiction) compared to the author's other works, though it also incorporates elements of fantasy. This combination makes the book stand out as \"really unique amongst her collection.\"  \n\n- **Recommendation and Reading Strategy:**  \n  The reviewer strongly recommends reading the book, calling it \"awesome.\" However, they advise readers who prefer binge-reading series to wait until late 2024 or early 2025 to see if a sequel is announced. This is due to the reviewer's personal preference for reading series all at once to avoid confusion or memory gaps between installments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book is a highly engaging and unique addition to the author's body of work, blending science fiction and fantasy elements in a way that sets it apart.

Holmberg is one of my all-time favorite authors.  \n  - I'm hoping Holmberg's next book brings back the magic that made me a big fan in the first place.  \n\n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  - The idea of an ancient machine with secrets sounded super cool.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters felt kinda flat and didn't have the depth I usually love in Holmberg's books.  \n  - Pell's engineering skills and love for ancient tech should have made her an awesome lead, but her interactions felt awkward, and her character didn't really grow.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  - The story had a lot of potential but was slowed down by pacing issues. It often felt sluggish.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  - The romantic angle between Pell and Heartwood just didn't have the spark that could've made their relationship interesting.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - Holmberg's world-building is still top-notch. The sunbaked planet of Tampere and the mysterious tower are described so vividly, creating an awesome setting for the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - But even that couldn't make up for the other flaws.  \n  - Overall, it was a letdown for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and excellent world-building, it fell short in character development, pacing, and the romantic subplot.

The first half relies heavily on flashbacks to establish the foundation and important plot points, which didn’t translate as clearly in the audio version as I would have liked.  \n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book has a unique vibe reminiscent of *Aeon Flux* and *Raised by Wolves*. It explores themes like a forgotten past, ancient technology, desert survival, and, of course, a love story. Let’s be honest—we’re all here for the love stories!  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The first half is a bit slow to get into, but it pays off when the second half takes off on a wild ride. My husband even got pulled into the story around the halfway mark and insisted we finish it together last night.  \n\n- **Descriptions and World-Building:**  \n  My husband had some issues with the mechanical descriptions and machinery in the story, but overall, the world-building was immersive and intriguing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Still the Sun* is a solid 4-star read for me. The slow start is worth it for the thrilling second half, and I’m hopeful there will be a book two in the future!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4⭐️"

While the setting is bizarre, it is mostly intelligible and internally consistent, which works well for a fantasy narrative.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The story is fairly interesting up until about 80% through. However, as the climactic conclusion begins, the plot becomes increasingly difficult to follow. Events, locations, and timelines start to feel nonsensical and confusing.  \n\n- **Character Consistency:**  \n  Different characters exhibit a bewildering array of capabilities and limitations that were not previously established, making their actions and roles in the story hard to understand.  \n\n- **Engagement and Resolution:**  \n  I finished the book mostly out of sheer stubbornness, as the ending left me unsatisfied and confused. If there is a sequel, I would not be interested in reading it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel starts with an intriguing premise and maintains a mostly coherent and engaging narrative for the majority of the story.

However, I would have liked a deeper understanding of the machines central to the story. While we know Pell is repairing them, we don’t learn their purpose until the end. Perhaps that’s intentional, but it raises questions: doesn’t Pell wonder what these machines are? How can she repair them without knowing their function?",

Her books are unlike anything else I’ve read, and other than the series, they are unlike each other. This one was probably my favorite of what I’ve read so far.  \n\n- **World-Building and Storytelling:**  \n  The worlds she invents are all fully formed and developed, and her stories unfold so seamlessly it’s as if someone is just telling you a story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I would have liked Pell, the narrator, to have been a little more fully developed.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery Elements:**  \n  I would have liked to better understand the machines that are at the center of the story. We know Pell is repairing them, but we never—until the end—know what they are supposed to do. Maybe that’s the whole point, but doesn’t Pell wonder what the heck these things are that she’s working so hard on? And how does she repair them if she doesn’t know what they are supposed to do?  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  At some point, I put my questions aside and just sat back to enjoy the story. I revised my rating up from four to five stars because I really don’t have any serious criticism of it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout in Charlie N. Holmberg’s work, with exceptional world-building and seamless storytelling. While I had some minor wishes for deeper character development and clarity about the machines, these did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars (revised up from 4 stars)."

            "I greatly enjoy many of Charlie N. Holmberg's works, including *The Whimbrel House* series, *The Paper Magician* series, and *Spellmaker/Spellbreaker*. However, her standalone novels evoke a different, almost unsettling vibe that leans more toward horror than romantic or historical fantasy. Titles like *The Fifth Doll*, *Magic Bitter, Magic Sweet*, and *Still the Sun* exemplify this shift in tone.",

This novel felt broader, almost as if it was attempting to mimic the Cosmere (a megaverse by Brandon Sanderson). The world-building gave me the impression that the characters, the world snake, or the machine might tie into future stories, though I’m not sure if that’s accurate.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I struggled to connect with Pell and Emgarden initially.

However, as the story progressed, I became more invested in both the characters and the machines.\n\n- **Genre Blend:**  \n  This was the first time I encountered a blend of science and magic in Holmberg’s work.
