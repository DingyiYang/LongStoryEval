The angst and tension between them was well-written. Even though I'm not a huge fan of miscommunication, this one was relatable.

The author's note made me really emotional, and I liked that she showed us how one can open up to a relationship after such a traumatic experience.

It features a stylized drawing of Riomaggiore, part of Cinque Terre in Italy, and this beautiful artwork immediately captivated me and made me buy the book.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The Italian setting of the story is one of its strongest points. There's something about Italy's charm that really sets the mood and brings an extra layer of romance and history to the narrative.  \n\n- **Narrative Technique (Flashbacks):**  \n  I really loved how the author used flashbacks in the story. These flashbacks smoothly take you back in time, adding depth to the characters and their past relationships, which helps you understand their motives and emotions in the present. It's like peeling back layers of an onion, revealing the core of the characters bit by bit.  \n\n- **Theme:**  \n  The theme of a second chance at romance really touched my heart. It's a reminder that sometimes life gives us a redo, a chance to fix what went wrong, and to maybe find happiness in a place we didn't expect.

The flashbacks to younger Emerson and Theo added a nostalgic touch, enhancing the story's depth. Surprisingly, the miscommunication trope, which I typically dislike, worked well here, reflecting Emerson’s tendency to tackle her problems independently.

The gradual revelation of Emerson and Theo's past and present kept me eagerly turning the pages, though I occasionally wished they would stop friend-zoning each other sooner. The plot centers on Emerson and Theo, who made a pact at eighteen to marry if they were still single by their 28th birthday. A decade later, Emerson recalls the pact and decides to make one last attempt to reconcile with Theo. The combination of a second chance at love and the friends-to-lovers trope is executed exceptionally well. The flashbacks effectively showcase their journey—from meeting and building a strong friendship to falling in love—adding emotional resonance to the narrative.",

Emerson's determination to confront the reasons behind her past departure from Theo adds depth to her character. Although Theo's family, especially his brother, plays a minor role, they leave a lasting impression. Additionally, Emerson's small but supportive circle of friends is well-developed, showcasing high-quality character work.",

            "In this story, we follow childhood best friends Theo and Emerson, who reunite after a decade because of a marriage pact made in high school. The novel features several familiar tropes, including second chance romance, mutual pining, and slow burn, yet it manages to transcend the typical pitfalls of these themes. Despite my general aversion to such tropes in other works, their execution here is masterful, resulting in a truly captivating story.",
            "**Theo** is portrayed as precious, cute, and sweet, with an almost unreal level of understanding. His deep insecurities and self-deprecating nature make him both endearing and heartbreaking. **Emerson** starts off as unlikable due to her ghosting Theo, but she gradually wins over the reader. While her intentions are good, her execution often falls short. Although I recognize her trauma, her actions can be frustrating. The romance excels in delivering angst and pining, making it a standout second chance story. The slow burn is appreciated, but Emerson's choice to bring her ex to provoke jealousy is a notable misstep. Additionally, the persistent miscommunication between the characters, spanning a decade, is a significant drawback."

I didn’t feel as connected to the main characters as I hoped, but I’m still optimistic about the author’s future work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "The story follows Emerson and Theo, who reunite after a decade due to a reminder of their marriage pact. Set against the romantic backdrop of Cinque Terre, Italy, Emerson has just four days to rekindle their relationship. The tension builds as she wonders if Theo shares her feelings or if this will be their final farewell.",
            "I was thoroughly engaged in the characters' journeys from childhood to adulthood. Theo emerged as a caring and devoted figure, while Emerson, though intriguing, could be frustrating at times. Her high-profile celebrity status often made her appear entitled and disingenuous, which was off-putting. While her mistrust of Theo and tendency to jump to conclusions added depth to her character, it also made her somewhat unlikable.",

However, in this case, it felt fitting and was executed well, adding to the emotional depth of the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Tone:**  \n   - The novel is rich in angst and tension, particularly in the past chapters, which I found captivating.  \n   - The present chapters maintain some of this tension, though it’s more subdued as the characters navigate their evolving relationship.  \n\n- **Spice Level and Romantic Elements:**  \n   - The spice level is low (🌶️), with the focus being more on emotional angst than physical intimacy. However, the spice delivers effectively toward the end of the story.  \n\n- **Representation of Sensitive Topics:**  \n   - Emerson’s profession as a high-fashion model could have led to body shaming, but the topic is handled thoughtfully, portraying it in a negative light rather than normalizing it.  \n   - The novel also addresses Emerson’s past trauma (rape) with care, emphasizing self-care and healing without letting it define her entire character.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - *One Last Shot* is a compelling friends-to-lovers and second-chance romance, filled with emotional depth, tension, and a satisfying resolution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*One Last Shot* is a beautifully crafted romance that balances angst, tension, and emotional growth.

            "The ending of the story is satisfying, offering a clear resolution for the characters without unnecessary drama. While it may not be a standout moment, it effectively ties everything together. The narrative begins with Emerson, who has made a pact with her childhood friend Theo to marry by the age of 28. After receiving a reminder of their agreement, she decides to reconnect with him and travels to Italy, where he is working on a photoshoot. The book's introduction is smooth and relaxed, making Emerson feel grounded and relatable.",
            "Emerson is a relatable character, grounded despite her fame. Although her reasons for seeking out Theo are questionable, her genuine enjoyment in reconnecting with him is evident, and he positively influences her. While Theo feels somewhat underdeveloped throughout the story, I still found him likable—supportive, respectful, and dedicated to his work. Their slow reconnection feels authentic, and it’s gratifying to witness their old feelings resurface. However, the pacing lags in the middle, causing the development of their relationship to take longer than expected.",
            "The author's writing style is accessible, and I enjoyed the alternating first-person perspectives of Theo and Emerson in different chapters. While a bit more description of the surroundings would have enhanced the experience, it was a commendable effort for a debut novel.",
            "The author's expertise in the modeling industry shines through, offering captivating insights into photoshoots and the modeling world that are seamlessly woven into the narrative. The charming Italian setting further enhances the story's appeal."

I enjoyed the modeling and photography themes, but the pacing in the middle slowed the story down, and the miscommunication trope was a drawback. Despite these flaws, the romance and character development were enjoyable, and the flashbacks added emotional depth.",

They reunite after 10 years during a photoshoot, and the story revolves around the \"now or never\" tension.  \n   - The entire book is built on the miscommunication trope, which might frustrate readers who dislike this device. However, I personally find it more realistic compared to tropes like fake dating or arranged marriage, as miscommunication is a common issue in real-life relationships.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - A significant portion of the story takes place on the Amalfi Coast in Italy, where a brand's collection is being photographed.

I found their past relationship beautifully portrayed and emotionally engaging.  \n\n- **Author's Note and Spoilers:**  \n   - I recommend skipping the author's note at the beginning, as it spoils a key element of the story. It made me wonder if we’ve become overly sensitive to needing trigger warnings for everything.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite the miscommunication trope, I enjoyed the book immensely. The other elements, such as the setting, industry insights, and character dynamics, worked well for me. I didn’t focus on nitpicking but instead let myself get swept away by the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a heartfelt second-chance romance with a strong focus on the miscommunication trope, set against the glamorous backdrop of the fashion industry and the stunning Amalfi Coast.

The miscommunication trope, often overused, is handled effectively here; it doesn’t linger unnecessarily, and Emerson's confrontation of Theo adds depth to the narrative, which I appreciated.",
            "I appreciated Emerson and Theo, but I didn't feel a strong connection to them or their relationship. The flashback scenes seemed like a missed opportunity to explore Emerson's struggles, such as her experiences with high school bullying and her relationship with her mother. Instead, these moments felt peripheral, offering only brief glimpses of their friendship. The side characters were underdeveloped, primarily serving to advance Theo and Emerson's story. More fleshed-out secondary characters could have enriched the narrative and deepened my connection to the main characters. On a lighter note, Emerson exudes a delightful \"Light Camera Bitch Smile\" energy, which I absolutely love.",
            "The writing is engaging, and the dialogue is both natural and authentic. However, there are missed opportunities to show rather than tell.

I wish there had been even more of this clever use of the setting.\n\n- **Characters (3.5/5):**  \n   - I liked Emerson and Theo but didn’t feel deeply connected to them or invested in their relationship.  \n   - The flashback scenes felt like a missed opportunity to delve deeper into Emerson’s struggles, such as her high school bullying or her relationship with her mom. These moments felt peripheral, and we only see small snippets of their friendship.  \n   - The side characters were underdeveloped and primarily served to further Theo and Emerson’s relationship. More developed secondary characters could have enriched the story and helped me connect more with the main characters.  \n   - Random note: Emerson gives off big \"Light Camera Bitch Smile\" energy, and I love it.\n\n- **Writing (4/5):**  \n   - The writing is engaging, and the dialogue feels natural and authentic.  \n   - There were missed opportunities to show rather than tell. For example, the repeated use of characters vomiting to convey distress felt overdone. Describing their emotions more deeply would have maintained the emotional connection with the reader.\n\n- **Plot (4/5):**  \n   - The childhood friends-to-lovers storyline is classic and well-executed.  \n   - Miscommunication, a common trope in this genre, is handled well here. It doesn’t drag on excessively, and Emerson calls Theo out on it, which I appreciated.\n\n- **Intrigue (3.5/5):**  \n   - Due to my lack of connection with the characters, the book didn’t feel unputdownable. It was enjoyable but didn’t leave a strong impression.\n\n- **Logic (5/5):**  \n   - Nothing noteworthy to critique here. The story flows logically.\n\n- **Enjoyment (4/5):**  \n   - While it could have been just another friends-to-lovers rom-com, the Italian setting and the celeb/normal person pairing set it apart.

Audio is definitely the way to go for this book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a sweet, well-written story with a fabulous setting and engaging dialogue.

            "The story follows Emerson and Theo, who were inseparable as teenagers until Emerson abruptly moved to L.A. and severed all contact. A decade later, Emerson, now a successful model, and Theo, a fashion photographer, are reunited by a reminder of a marriage pact they made in their youth. Eager to reconnect, Emerson books a photoshoot with Theo in the picturesque Cinque Terre, Italy. However, Theo's reaction to her return is less enthusiastic than she anticipated. The plot is lighthearted and amusing, with moments of depth, culminating in a sweet and satisfying ending.",
            "**Emerson:** A young woman shaped by a challenging upbringing, with a financially struggling, hoarding mother. Ashamed of her past, she keeps others at arm's length, except for Theo. As a successful model, she grapples with societal beauty standards and yearns for a deeper purpose. Her character development is commendable. \n\n**Theo:** A moderately successful photographer assigned to shoot Emerson for a major campaign, he navigates a mix of emotions throughout the process. Sweet, self-aware, and considerate of Emerson's feelings while guarding his own, I found him endearing.",
            "The book is narrated in the first person, alternating between Emerson and Theo. The writing is light and accessible, with vivid descriptions of settings, especially Italy, that inspire a desire to travel there.",
            "This book is a delightful summer read, ideal for escaping the routine of daily life. I was genuinely invested in Emerson and Theo's potential reunion, and I appreciated the enjoyable writing style. However, it ultimately fell short of the spark needed for a 5-star rating."

        "conclusion": "One Last Shot - Macht es am Ende doch noch Klick? is a charming and lighthearted summer romance with well-developed characters and a vivid setting. While it didn’t quite reach 5 stars for the reader, it is highly recommended for anyone looking for an easy, enjoyable read.",

            "The story is engaging, though it has a few minor issues. A late subplot involving Emerson’s agent adds drama but remains unresolved. While the ending leans more toward angst than I usually prefer, it feels justified within the story's context.",
            "Theo and Emerson are well-developed, relatable characters—Theo, a soccer-playing lifestyle photographer, and Emerson, a world-renowned supermodel. Their dual perspectives and timelines effectively convey both their adolescent yearnings and adult romance. While some secondary characters, like Emerson’s best friend Harry, have their flaws, they contribute depth to the narrative.",

Theo and Emerson transition from a close high school friendship to a rekindled adult romance, complicated by a unique 10-year pact to marry if they remain single. The author skillfully employs dual POVs and timelines, immersing readers in the characters' journeys through both youth and adulthood, which deepens emotional investment and evokes nostalgia. The writing effectively conveys the nuances of adolescent uncertainty alongside the complexities of adult love.",

The vivid setting adds to the charm and escapism of the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The story blends elements of second-chance romance and friends-to-lovers.

            "I appreciated the slow-burn romance, though I felt the pacing could have been quicker. More physical contact between Emerson and Theo early on would have heightened the tension in their push/pull dynamic. The story follows Emerson, a famous model, as she reconnects with her high school best friend, Theo, after a decade apart. Set against the backdrop of a photoshoot in Italy, the premise creates tension and uncertainty, as neither character is aware of the other's true feelings. The alternating timelines and dual POV effectively illuminate their past and present, making their journey more engaging.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the dynamic between Emerson and Theo. Their chemistry shone through, particularly in the flashback chapters set during their high school years. The dual POV and alternating timelines deepened my connection to their friendship and made me root for their healing from the unresolved pain of their separation.",

I wanted to push them together and say, \"Just kiss already!\"  \n   - Her closed-off nature was understandable, given her reasons, and his misunderstandings and self-protective behavior added depth to his character.  \n\n- **Pacing and Payoff:**  \n   - The story is a slow burn, but the emotional payoff is satisfying and worth the wait.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartwarming and engaging read, blending beloved tropes with well-developed characters and a satisfying slow-burn romance. While the main character's hesitations were occasionally frustrating, they added authenticity to the story. The themes of true love and second chances shine through, making it a memorable and enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The ups and downs kept me hooked, and the pacing made it hard to put down.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  At first, Emerson was a difficult main character to get used to, but the more I got to know her, the more I understood her, which was great. Theo is a sweetie pie, but his lack of communication drove me nuts. It was frustrating but also very relatable to the men I've dated so far.  \n\n- **Realism and Relatability:**  \n  I think this is one of those romances that you read and appreciate the realness of it (maybe not the kinda stalking-like start to the book). The urge to get back what was once lost and the realization that you need to grow and build something new felt authentic and meaningful.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I really enjoyed this book and I'm glad I got to read it. It was a satisfying and engaging experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a captivating read with well-developed characters and a relatable, realistic portrayal of relationships.

            "I was immediately captivated by the story, largely due to how likable Emerson (Em) is from the start, a sentiment that persisted throughout the book. I felt I got to know Em deeply; while I occasionally wanted to give her a little nudge, I often understood her motivations. The dual perspectives of Emerson and Theo, along with the alternating timelines of past and present, enhanced the narrative's engagement. I particularly enjoy this storytelling style, and it worked exceptionally well for this Second Chance/Friends to Lovers tale. Em is a compelling protagonist who has faced significant challenges, and she truly deserves her happy ending. Theo is a standout character—a genuine Good Guy who consistently prioritizes Em, both in the past and present. It's hard not to like him. The chemistry between Em and Theo is sweet and heartwarming. Although I found myself wanting to scold them for taking so long to figure things out near the end, they ultimately resolved their issues beautifully on their own.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement with the Story and Characters:**  \n   - I was immediately drawn into the story, likely because I found Emerson (Em) incredibly likable from the start, and that feeling stayed with me throughout the book.  \n   - I got to know Em so well over the course of the story, and even though I sometimes wanted to give her a little slap, I often understood why she acted or spoke the way she did.  \n   - The dual perspectives (Emerson’s and Theo’s) and the dual timelines (past and present) made the story even more engaging. I personally love this narrative style, and it worked exceptionally well here, especially for a Second Chance/Friends to Lovers story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Em is a fantastic protagonist who has been through a lot, and she truly deserves her happy ending.  \n   - Theo is an absolute gem of a character—a true \"Good Guy\" who always puts Em first, whether in the past or present. It’s impossible not to like him.  \n   - The chemistry between Em and Theo is incredibly sweet and heartwarming. While I wanted to scold them both near the end for taking so long to figure things out, they managed to resolve their issues beautifully on their own.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n   - The Friends to Lovers and Second Chance tropes were executed wonderfully, making me appreciate these themes even more.  \n   - The modeling aspect of the story was refreshing and something I hadn’t encountered before in a book.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The Italian setting added a lovely touch to the story, making it perfect for summer reading, though I believe it can be enjoyed at any time of the year.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - A specific, heavy topic is introduced toward the end of the story, so readers should be cautious and check trigger warnings if needed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was exactly the kind of book I had hoped for! It’s a beautiful love story with well-developed characters, engaging dual timelines, and a refreshing take on familiar tropes. While there’s a heavy topic addressed later in the story, the overall experience was heartwarming and enjoyable. I highly recommend it, especially for fans of Friends to Lovers and Second Chance romances.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars! I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with Em and Theo and will definitely keep an eye on this author in the future. ❤️"

            "The novel centers on Emerson, a high-fashion supermodel, and Theo, a photographer, as they reconnect after years of miscommunication and unresolved feelings. Told from both characters' perspectives, the narrative alternates between their past and present. While this dual POV offers valuable insights, it also leads to noticeable repetition that occasionally slows the pacing. The central conflict hinges on their ongoing miscommunication, which culminates in a final misunderstanding that feels unnecessary and undermines the characters' potential for growth. Additionally, some subplots, such as Emerson's career struggles following agent backlash and the fallout from Theo's past actions, remain unresolved. Overall, the book's pacing suffers from repetitive scenes and prolonged misunderstandings, suggesting that the alternating timelines and perspectives could have been streamlined for a more engaging read.",
            "Emerson, a successful supermodel, grapples with moments of self-consciousness that make her relatable and endearing. Theo, an adorable and genuinely kind character, brings charm to the narrative. Both characters face challenges stemming from miscommunication and a lack of communication, which can be frustrating yet effectively heightens the tension in their relationship.",

They fit wonderfully with the book's setting.  \n\n- **Initial Engagement:**  \n   - At first, I found it a bit difficult to get into the story. I’m not sure if it was due to Emerson’s aloofness or the writing style. However, I persisted, and after about a third of the book, I finally felt immersed in Emerson’s world.  \n\n- **Character Development (Emerson):**  \n   - Emerson comes across as quite cool and distant, which made it challenging for me to get to know and understand her. Only Theo manages to make her relax and open up a little. Unfortunately, these moments were too few, and I struggled to connect with her. She remained somewhat unfamiliar to me throughout the story.  \n\n- **Character Development (Theo):**  \n   - Theo was easier to understand and felt more relatable overall. Unlike Emerson, he isn’t as famous and doesn’t have to constantly maintain a perfect image. This lack of pressure is reflected in his behavior—he doesn’t put on a facade, which made it easier for me to like him, flaws and all.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n   - The setting was beautiful and really appealed to me. I also appreciated how Emerson, despite her fame, tried to remain grounded and treated the other models as equals.  \n\n- **Emerson’s Growth:**  \n   - I was impressed by the strength Emerson showed in dealing with her agent. While she might have freed herself from him years earlier, some things take time and courage. Her decision to finally take that step was a significant and important moment for her.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAn interesting story with minor flaws.

            "The first half of the book is engaging and well-paced, skillfully balancing present-day events with flashbacks. However, the latter part feels rushed, particularly after Emerson and Theo decide to pursue a relationship around 80% into the story. The resolution of their conflict comes across as stilted, with Emerson's vague explanations and persistent emotional barriers. While the full-circle nature of the marriage proposal ending is satisfying, it also feels hurried. The characters' unresolved issues and lack of meaningful communication undermine the believability of the conclusion. The narrative centers on a second-chance, friends-to-lovers romance between Emerson Grey, a successful supermodel, and Theo Carson, a mainstream photographer. A marriage pact notification prompts Emerson to reconnect with Theo after a decade-long rift. The premise is compelling, enhanced by dual POV chapters and flashbacks that enrich the characters' history and emotions.",
            "Emerson and Theo's bond is undeniable, and their struggle to conceal their true feelings while reconnecting is captivating. The chemistry between them is particularly well-executed in the first half of the book. However, Emerson's reluctance to fully reveal her past and the reasons for leaving Theo introduces an emotional distance that affects their relationship.",
            "The story acknowledges the challenges of a relationship with an international supermodel, but the execution feels unrealistic and underdeveloped. Theo's discussion with his brother about Emerson's past attack seems misplaced; it would have been more impactful as a direct conversation between Theo and Emerson. Additionally, the emotional resolution lacks depth, leaving several aspects of their relationship unresolved."

            "This impressive debut novel captivates with its compelling narrative. The story centers on 14-year-old Emerson, who forms a close friendship with Theo in high school. As they navigate their teenage years, they eventually go their separate ways at 18—Emerson moves to L.A. to pursue modeling, while Theo heads to New York for photography studies. A decade later, Emerson still holds onto memories of Theo and hatches a thoughtful plan to reconnect.",
            "The book's presentation is truly impressive, with its vibrant colored edges serving as a compelling reason to purchase it. However, I found the lack of realism a drawback; Emerson's diet of donuts and ice cream paired with minimal exercise felt implausible. At 28, both characters could have benefited from more open communication, which would have resolved many conflicts more quickly, though this might have diminished the story's tension. Despite this, I can overlook these issues.",
            "This debut novel is a well-rounded and impressive achievement that I highly recommend. While the major drama didn't completely surprise me, as I anticipated much of it, the story remains enjoyable and engaging. The trip and photoshoot in Italy are particularly captivating, immersing the reader in the action."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite some predictability and minor issues with realism, the novel is engaging, well-written, and beautifully presented. The alternating narrative style and flashbacks add depth to the story, making it a memorable and enjoyable read.",

The colored edges look fantastic and are a standalone reason to buy it.  \n\n- **Content and Storytelling:**  \n   - The content is convincing, and it’s hard to believe it’s the author’s debut work.  \n   - The story follows Emerson, a 14-year-old, who befriends Theo in high school. They spend their school years together before parting ways at 18—Emerson moves to L.A. to pursue modeling, while Theo heads to New York for photography studies. Ten years later, Emerson hasn’t forgotten Theo and devises a delicate plan.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n   - The protagonists alternate narrating chapter by chapter, providing a deep insight into their thoughts and making it easy to empathize with them.  \n   - The novel isn’t strictly chronological; it includes flashback chapters from their high school years, allowing readers to experience how they met and fell in love.  \n\n- **Engagement and Predictability:**  \n   - The major drama didn’t completely blow me away, as I predicted much of it, but it’s still a very enjoyable and interesting read.  \n   - The trip and photoshoot in Italy were particularly captivating—it felt like being right in the middle of the action.  \n\n- **Realism and Character Development:**  \n   - The lack of realism was a downside for me. Emerson’s diet of donuts and ice cream with minimal exercise seemed unrealistic.  \n   - At 28, both characters could have communicated more openly, which would have resolved many issues faster, but this would have reduced the story’s tension. I can overlook this, though.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n   - It’s a well-rounded and successful debut novel that I highly recommend.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some predictability and minor issues with realism, the novel is engaging, well-written, and beautifully presented.

The story was engaging and worth every minute. Overall, I thought it was a cute story and was eagerly rooting for Emerson and Theo’s happily ever after along the way.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  *One Last Shot* is a friends-to-lovers, second-chance romance that follows the love story of Emerson, a famous supermodel, and Theo, a photographer. Through flashbacks and dual POVs, we learn what separated them the summer after high school, everything that happened in between, and how they eventually find their way back to each other during a photoshoot in Italy.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I adored Theo. Emerson, on the other hand, is where my (slight) eye rolls came into play. After 10 years of therapy, I expected her to have better communication tools, which could have avoided the miscommunication trope. However, I understand that Emerson is a human with trauma, and healing is not linear, so I’ll let it slide.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is not quite as sophisticated as that of a veteran author, but that didn’t detract from my enjoyment of the book. Debut novels can be hit or miss, and I think this one will be a hit!  \n\n- **Tropes and Genre Expectations:**  \n  There were a few eye-roll moments, but it wouldn’t be a romance book without them! As far as miscommunication tropes go, this one was not at all a detriment to my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  I’m excited to see where Betty Cayouette goes from here and will certainly be reading any future novels she writes!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *One Last Shot* is a charming and engaging debut novel that delivers a heartfelt friends-to-lovers, second-chance romance. Despite a few minor flaws, the story kept me hooked, and I was fully invested in Emerson and Theo’s journey. I’m looking forward to more from this author!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

A reminder of their pact to marry if they're not hitched by 28 brings them together for a week on a fashion shoot, despite having not spoken in ten years.

It's clear that Betty is a reader, and this is a solid debut. It's rare for me to give 4 stars, especially to debuts, but this one deserves it.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The plot revolves around a miscommunication/lie, but it's executed in a believable way. It captures how people naturally drift apart over time due to life circumstances. The story is reminiscent of *My Best Friend's Wedding*, but without the Cameron Diaz character. Two successful former best friends reconnect after a 10-year \"if we're not married by 28, we get married to each other\" pact reminder goes off. They haven't spoken in a decade and are now forced to spend a week together on a fashion shoot. The story includes confusion, drama, and awful managers—classic elements for a fun read.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The idea that the characters are still \"in love\" after ten years feels a bit unrealistic to me. People change significantly over a decade, and while it's plausible to still be hung up on someone or compare others to them, being *in love* with a completely different person after so long is hard to believe. I wish the storyline had been longer to better explore their reconnection and growth.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  Brittany Pressley's narration is excellent and adds to the enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a fun and engaging book with a solid premise and believable execution of its central conflict.

Although the plot is light and heavy on angst, featuring mainly photo shoots, donut outings, and a few hikes, the emotional tension and the will-they-or-won’t-they dynamic kept me engaged throughout most of the novel. However, the final act loses some momentum as the characters, now together, grapple with their fears and insecurities. The concluding chapters address unresolved issues like their long-distance relationship and differing lifestyles but fall short of providing satisfying resolutions. While third-act breakups are a staple of romance novels, this story could have better harnessed its energy to explore the characters' current compatibility.",

            "The story is compelling, though the resolution of Emerson and Theo's issues unfolds slowly, which can be frustrating at times. However, this gradual progression allows for a richer exploration of their emotions and past. The narrative follows Emerson and Theo, who, after meeting in high school, make a pact to marry if they are both single by twenty-eight. A decade later, Emerson, now a world-renowned model, seeks out Theo, a photographer, for a photo shoot in Italy. As they reconnect, they navigate their feelings and begin to heal from their shared history. The engaging premise is enhanced by a dual POV structure and flashbacks to their high school days, adding depth to their relationship.",

            "This engaging second-chance romance follows Emerson, a successful fashion model, and Theo, a talented photographer. The dual POV structure, one of my favorite formats, alternates between their high school romance a decade ago and their current estrangement. As they rekindle their relationship, there's a hint of spice towards the end as they learn to embrace each other's present selves rather than their pasts. However, I wish the event that drove them apart had been explored in more depth, as it felt somewhat glossed over. Additionally, the slight third-act breakup felt unnecessary; I would have preferred to see them confront their issues rather than retreat. Fortunately, the resolution comes quickly enough to keep the story moving.",
            "I particularly enjoyed Theo's perspective in the story. The women truly supported and uplifted one another, which I found incredibly refreshing.",
            "The career sections truly stood out to me. I appreciate when careers serve as a driving force in the plot, and the author clearly has a deep understanding of the modeling industry."

While I appreciated the career-driven plot and the strong female relationships, I felt the conflict that separated the characters could have been more impactful, and the third-act breakup was unnecessary. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable read.",

The story follows Theo and Emmerson, childhood sweethearts who made a marriage pact at 18 to marry at 28 if they were still single. After being estranged for 10 years due to a traumatic event, they reconnect at a photoshoot just as the marriage pact reminder pops up. The plot has a bit of everything—romance, emotion, a touch of comedy, and moments of frustration (like shouting at the page, \"Please get together already—you both feel the same!\").  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved seeing Theo and Emmerson grow throughout the book. Their journey from estrangement to reconnection felt authentic and engaging. Georgia, one of the supporting characters, was a favorite of mine—sassy, confident, and full of personality.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book evoked a range of emotions, from joy and laughter to frustration and empathy. The emotional depth, especially around the traumatic event and its impact on the characters, was well-handled.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  Reading this book made me want to escape to somewhere warm! The setting added a cozy, inviting vibe to the story.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings:**  \n  The author, Betty, included a trigger warning at the beginning of the book, which I appreciated. The trigger is referenced throughout the story and addressed near the end, though not explicitly named.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*One Last Shot* is a delightful romcom with a perfect blend of romance, emotion, and humor. Theo and Emmerson's journey is heartwarming and relatable, and the supporting characters add depth and charm to the story. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romantic comedy with emotional depth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Nonetheless, I recognize that this perspective is valid."

Emerson and Theo, best friends in high school, made a pact to marry each other if they were still single at 28. They drifted apart at eighteen and haven’t spoken since. Ten years later, Emerson, now a supermodel, and Theo, a fashion photographer, reconnect when the reminder they set in their phones goes off. Emerson arranges a photo shoot with Theo, reigniting their connection.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Emerson and Theo are well-developed characters with a believable history. Their high school friendship and the reasons for their falling out are gradually revealed through a dual timeline, adding depth to their relationship.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  I appreciated the dual timeline narrative, which effectively alternates between their high school years and the present day. This structure slowly unveils the reasons behind their broken friendship and builds emotional tension.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The story is emotionally engaging, with clear chemistry and unresolved feelings between Emerson and Theo. Their journey from estrangement to reconnection is heartfelt and satisfying.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel captures the glamorous world of fashion and modeling, providing a vivid backdrop for Emerson and Theo’s reunion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a charming and well-crafted romance novel that combines a nostalgic friends-to-lovers trope with a second-chance storyline.

It adds depth to the story and keeps the reader engaged.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  - The marriage pact plot is something I’ve seen often, but rarely executed exceptionally. This book, however, manages to stand out despite the cliché.  \n  - The beginning was too slow for me, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics (SA):**  \n  - The book incorporates SA as part of the story without making it triggering. This is a rare and commendable approach.  \n  - Representation in text can be healing for trauma, and as a teacher, I’ve seen the benefits of this firsthand.  \n  - Many stories involving SA grief and healing include triggering details, which can force readers to put the book down. This book avoids that by sparing unnecessary details and focusing on the journey of restoring intimacy and love.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Personal Preference:**  \n  - I secretly enjoyed the marriage pact plot, even though it felt cliché and cost the book some points in my eyes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a riveting romance novel with a unique approach to sensitive topics like SA. The dual narration and focus on healing rather than triggering details make it stand out. However, the slow beginning and cliché marriage pact plot prevent it from being a perfect read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 4/5 (Deducted points for the slow beginning and cliché plot, despite enjoying it overall.)"

The author, Betty Cayouette, does an excellent job of describing the setting, making it feel like an escape to Italy with its beautiful scenery and romantic vibe.\n\n- **Romance and Emotional Depth:**\n   - The romance between Emerson and Theo is cute but tinged with emotionality. It feels more like a borderline women's fiction/recovery book rather than a straightforward romance. The emotional depth, particularly around recovery from trauma, adds a layer of complexity to the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Emerson, the protagonist, didn't quite resonate with me as a twenty-eight-year-old woman. Her internal monologue and how she expressed herself felt a bit off, especially since I'm of a similar age. Theo, on the other hand, has grown into a man who is less enamored with Emerson than he once was, which adds an interesting dynamic to their relationship.\n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics:**\n   - The book deals with recovery from sexual assault, which is handled with sensitivity and is crucial to the plot. The author is upfront about this in a note preceding the story, which I appreciated. The balance between addressing the trauma and maintaining the romance was well-executed.\n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**\n   - The prose could use some refinement. While the setting descriptions were vivid, Emerson's character didn't feel fully realized in terms of her internal monologue and maturity.\n\n- **Heat Index and Pacing:**\n   - The romance is a slow burn with a heat index of 3/10. There's one scene that's somewhat sexy, but it's not explicit. This makes it more of an emotional beach read rather than a steamy romance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book offers a beautiful escape to Italy with a romantic setting and emotional depth, particularly around recovery from trauma.

            "The push-and-pull dynamic between Theo and Emerson, fueled by miscommunication, was expertly crafted and kept me thoroughly engaged. The tension built beautifully, and their eventual reunion felt like a long-held breath finally released—exciting and satisfying. The narrative flowed well, with the exploration of their past and present selves adding depth. However, the disappearance of the pact, which initially brought them back together, left me puzzled. It felt overlooked, especially since it was crucial to Emerson's character growth and caused her significant turmoil.",
            "Theo and Emerson's relationship was beautifully depicted, with their struggles and fears—Emerson worried her life would overwhelm Theo, and Theo feeling inadequate for her—adding depth to their bond. Their journey toward understanding that their love and support for each other's dreams were what truly mattered was both endearing and reflective of the ideal relationship everyone seeks.",
            "I absolutely adore second chance romance and friends-to-lovers tropes, and *One Last Shot* beautifully captures why. The story authentically explores the evolution of young love into adult love, as Theo and Emerson don’t just resume their past relationship; they fall in love with the individuals they’ve become over the years.",
            "This book is emotionally resonant, depicting how Theo and Emerson confront their past demons to find happiness in both their careers and personal lives. While the resolution of their relationship is satisfying, I would have appreciated more closure regarding the pact, as its absence leaves a minor gap in the story."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *One Last Shot* was a beautiful and fun romance novel that explored the complexities of second chances and personal growth. Theo and Emerson’s journey from young lovers to adults rediscovering each other was heartwarming and authentic. While the disappearance of the pact was a slight stumble, the book’s emotional depth and engaging relationship dynamics made it a quick favorite for me.",

Initially, I was hesitant about the childhood friends-to-lovers/second chance romance, as I’m quite selective with this trope. However, the marriage pact between Emerson and Theo, made at 18 to marry at 28 if they were still single, added a fun and engaging twist. It prompted the characters to reflect on their true desires in a partner, which I found compelling.",

They provided just enough insight into the past without dwelling too long, which kept the story focused and engaging.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  There was some miscommunication, which isn’t my favorite element, but the way it was resolved left me satisfied. It felt necessary to the story and was handled in a way that didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Narration and Audio Performance:**  \n  The dual narration was fantastic.

However, the romance felt rushed, with emotions appearing almost instantly from the first meeting.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  I did have fun reading the book, and it provided an enjoyable experience overall.  \n\n- **Memorability:**  \n  While it was entertaining, I don’t think the story will stay with me for a long time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a light, enjoyable vacation read that delivers on the \"friends to lovers\" theme but falls short in terms of gradual emotional development. While it was fun to read, it lacks the depth to be memorable in the long term.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

I loved their dynamic when they were young, and it was heartwarming to see how much she tried to reconnect with him despite his initial hesitation.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  His reluctance to let her back into his life felt realistic and added depth to his character. Her persistence and effort to rebuild their relationship were endearing and made her a compelling protagonist.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The fact that they were in the same industry but at very different levels created an intriguing dynamic that added tension and interest to the story.  \n\n- **Sensitivity and Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes a mention of SA, which is important to note for readers who may be sensitive to such topics.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The romance had a moderate level of spice, which I enjoyed (🌶️🌶️).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a delightful second-chance romance with well-developed characters and an engaging dynamic. The story balanced sweetness, tension, and a touch of spice, making it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story centers on Emerson and Theo, childhood sweethearts bound by a marriage pact to wed by age 28. With the deadline looming just a week away and a decade of separation between them, I initially found it challenging to connect with the characters and grasp the depth of their bond. However, the flashback chapters ultimately enriched their relationship, offering much-needed context. I would have preferred if the book had started with a flashback to enhance understanding from the outset.",
            "Initially, I struggled to connect with the characters, but the flashbacks provided valuable insight into their bond and the reasons they were meant to be together. However, I felt that Theo lacked emotional depth, especially concerning Emerson’s lie, which he only confronted in the final 15% of the book. I would have appreciated more angst and complexity in his character. On a positive note, the side characters were endearing and added a delightful charm to the story.",
            "Set in Italy, one of my favorite places, the story unfortunately doesn't fully capitalize on its rich setting. While the descriptions of the beach and sunsets are pleasant, I craved more vivid imagery of Italy's food, culture, and ambiance. The narrative could have taken place anywhere with a beach, which felt like a missed opportunity to truly immerse me in the Italian experience."

            "The book started and ended with a strong pace, though it did slow down in the middle. Overall, the writing and plot were well-executed.",
            "The character development in the story is impressive, showcasing clear growth through dual timelines—high school and the present. The dual perspectives of the main characters enrich their personalities and relationships. **Theo** is sweet, caring, and insecure, making his kindness and support for Emerson endearing. His feelings of inadequacy resonate with readers. **Emerson**, on the other hand, is a strong yet flawed character; her resilience and complexity make her compelling. Her struggles and growth are portrayed with depth and authenticity.",
            "The setting of Italy, particularly Cinque Terre, could have been more vividly portrayed to enhance immersion. At times, it felt as though the story was taking place in the U.S. rather than in Italy.",
            "**Miscommunication Trope:** The characters' miscommunication, spanning a decade, was both frustrating and realistic. **Second Chance Trope:** The second chance romance was skillfully executed, with the 10-year gap enriching their reunion. **Friends to Lovers:** This trope stood out, beautifully illustrating the natural evolution of their deep bond from friendship to romance.",
            "The reason for the breakup was both shocking and unexpected, adding significant emotional depth to the story. The romantic moments, particularly the promposal and Theo's thoughtful gestures, were heartwarming and unforgettable."

After a breakup and a decade of silence, a reminder of their vow prompts Emerson, now a supermodel, to join Theo’s Italian photo campaign in hopes of rekindling their love. Although the plot relies on more miscommunication than I usually prefer, it ultimately tells a sweet tale of two people rediscovering their connection.",
            "Emerson and Theo's relationship is at the heart of the story. Their journey from high school sweethearts to estranged friends and back to potential lovers is both poignant and relatable.

Phrases like “Bet on yourself” and “You deserve to have everything you’ve ever wanted” resonate deeply, emphasizing the importance of pursuing one’s dreams. The sentiment that “the only life I’ve ever wanted is the one where I’m with you” highlights the profound connection between the characters.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Dual Timelines and Second-Chance Romance:**  \n  I loved the dual timelines—it’s the best way to do a second-chance romance, in my opinion. The author excelled at creating a strong connection between Emerson and Theo, both in the past and present. Their chemistry was palpable, and the writing choice to explore their relationship through dual timelines was a standout feature.  \n\n- **Miscommunication Trope:**  \n  The miscommunication angle brought the story down for me. While I understand its role in the context of the plot, it felt dragged out and occasionally annoying. This trope can be hit or miss for readers, and for me, it didn’t fully land.  \n\n- **Setting and Immersion:**  \n  The Italian setting had its moments, but I never felt fully immersed. The glimpses of the locale were intriguing, but they often disappeared, possibly due to the interruptions caused by the flashbacks. That said, I didn’t mind the flashbacks too much because they were so well-executed.  \n\n- **Character Development (Teenage Years):**  \n  The teenage character builds were fantastic and necessary—practically the best parts of the book. The flashbacks added depth and emotional resonance to the story.  \n\n- **Present-Day Reconnection:**  \n  The reconnection in the present day had its highs and lows. While there were sweet and hopeful moments, some aspects felt a bit too far-fetched and occasionally read like fanfic. However, the inclusion of secondary characters—friends and family—added emotional layers and enriched the plot.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook completely shined. The narrators did a fantastic job, and I highly recommend experiencing the story this way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book and would definitely try this author again. The dual timelines, teenage character development, and audiobook narration were highlights, but the miscommunication trope and occasional lack of immersion in the setting held it back from being a standout for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars  \n\n*I received a free audio copy from the publisher.*"

As someone deeply familiar with pop culture, the inconsistencies stood out. For example:  \n  - The supermodel’s career supposedly tanking over a collaboration with a retailer like Target felt unrealistic, as many celebrities do such collaborations without issue.  \n  - The photographer character, who could have been major, exclusively working on catalogues didn’t align with real-world campaigns I’m aware of.  \n  - The ex-boyfriend’s storyline, resembling Harry Styles with a PR-turned-real-turned-PR relationship, felt contrived.  \n  - The supermodel’s fame being compared to Gisele Bündchen’s level seemed exaggerated.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the issues with the celebrity elements, it was still a good read. Someone less immersed in pop culture might not find these aspects as distracting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the book’s handling of mental health and sexual assault, as well as the engaging characters and their relationship, the unrealistic portrayal of celebrity culture detracted from my overall enjoyment.

            "The story centers on Emerson and Theo, who met at 14 during high school orientation and developed a deep friendship that blossomed into romance. They made a pact to marry if neither was married by 28. Fast forward ten years: Emerson is now a famous supermodel, while Theo works as a photographer for a Target-like store. Their paths cross again when Emerson’s reminder app prompts her about their pact, leading her to join Theo’s latest shoot. Over the next five days, they reconnect amidst confusion, as Emerson attempts to win Theo back, while he grapples with doubts fueled by misinformation from someone close to her.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Engagement and Premise:**  \n   - The book started very promising with an intriguing \"unrequited love/friends to lovers\" premise.  \n   - The interactions between Emerson and Theo from the beginning were captivating and pulled me in.  \n\n- **Use of the Miscommunication Trope:**  \n   - A large part of the plot revolves around the miscommunication trope, which I typically dislike.  \n   - However, the author's execution of this trope was justifiable and realistic, making it work within the story.  \n   - The miscommunication between Emerson and Theo felt logical and not like the typical, frustrating version of this trope.  \n\n- **Pacing and Relationship Development:**  \n   - Emerson and Theo's relationship is a slow burn, but the tension and longing between them kept me engaged and invested.  \n   - The pacing was well-done, and I didn’t feel like I was suffering through the slow build-up.  \n\n- **Character Development and Consistency:**  \n   - I loved Emerson and Theo's characters for the majority of the story.  \n   - However, once they got together, their personalities drastically changed, which was disappointing.  \n   - Emerson became unlikable, resembling a Kardashian, and Theo turned into a whiny, insecure version of himself.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Impact:**  \n   - The first 75% of the book was enjoyable and would have earned a 4-star rating.  \n   - The last 15% of the book, particularly the ending, was a letdown and dropped my overall rating to 3 stars.  \n   - The miscommunication trope, which was handled well earlier, became a nightmare in the end, ruining my interest.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong start, engaging premise, and well-executed slow-burn romance, the ending fell flat due to inconsistent character development and a poorly handled resolution. The promising beginning and middle were overshadowed by a disappointing conclusion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Initial impression: 4 stars  \n- Final rating: 3 stars"

            "I appreciated the use of flashbacks and dual timelines, which added depth to the story. However, I felt the stakes were somewhat low, particularly regarding the conflict surrounding the PR relationship and engagement, which came across as flat. The later conflicts and reconciliations lacked intensity, and I found the beginning of the book more engaging before it became repetitive. Streamlining the day-to-day details would have improved the flow. Overall, the storytelling and characterization felt lackluster, with some inconsistencies, such as Harry wanting Theo to shoot his film poster but later referencing his album. Additionally, certain plot threads were left unresolved, like Emerson never asking Theo why the alert didn’t appear on his phone.",
            "I appreciated how the characters had to put in effort to rekindle their friendship, even within a limited timeframe.",

The later conflicts and reconciliation could have used more intensity.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Longing:**  \n  I felt bits of that longing feeling I love, especially in a second-chance romance. The tension throughout the story was well-done, though the romantic scenes were mostly fade-to-black with one brief open-door scene.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I appreciated that the characters had to work to rekindle their friendship, even within a short timeline.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a good debut with a cool concept, but it could have benefited from tighter pacing, more consistent details, and higher stakes in the conflicts.

This aspect of the setting and the unique careers of both lead characters are strong 4-star elements for me!\n\n- **Character Connection and Development:**\n   - I struggled a bit more with trying to connect to both Emerson and Theo. Honestly, I'm not big on past-and-present dual timelines - and while it mostly worked here, I think it created a disconnect between teenage Emerson & Theo and 28-year-old Emerson & Theo. We're seeing the budding beginnings of their relationship alongside their urgent reconnection 10 years later. Why was there nothing in the middle? (obviously, I know why - my point is more: why did you let that long pass?!) How well do you really know someone after 10 years of not talking? Well enough to actually want to marry them? I wasn't sold.\n\n- **Romance and Relationship Dynamics:**\n   - Probably as a direct result of that disconnect, the romance itself stands at a 3-star. (And I really enjoy second chance romance!) There was soooo much miscommunication - from past events, yes, but also in the present?! Emerson and Theo also seem to want very different things out of their lives, which is a big consideration. Not to mention, there was something that felt off about their relationship? Maybe they both just felt a bit immature? 😬\n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics:**\n   - I appreciated the author's note at the beginning explaining why she wanted to include a triggering topic/how she wanted to speak about it. However, we don't even learn that that's a part of Emerson's story until the very end of the book. I felt this would have been more compelling to reveal to the readers (if not the other characters) earlier in the story - if only to make Emerson and the strange decisions she made more understandable before the last couple chapters.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author Potential:**\n   - Romances are SO hit-or-miss for me, so don't take this review as a negative! I enjoyed the story, felt compelled to pick up the book, and liked how it felt so different from other romances I've read. I would read more from Betty Cayouette! All-in-all, a fun summer read!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA solid debut with a unique setting and interesting careers for the lead characters. While I struggled with the character connection and the romance dynamics, I appreciated the author's handling of sensitive topics and found the story enjoyable overall. It's a fun summer read, and I would definitely read more from Betty Cayouette.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Setting and Unique Careers: 4 stars\n- Romance and Relationship Dynamics: 3 stars\n\n**Content Notes:**\n- Neglectful parent, bullying, mention of rape (off-screen), mention of racism, mentions of diets & eating for appearance, language.\n- Romance notes: innuendo, one open door scene, implied intimacy, kisses. It is mentioned that one character is exploring their sexuality.\n\nThank you to Macmillan Audio for the gifted audiobook copy. All opinions and thoughts are fully and genuinely my own."

The central conflict lies in Emerson's struggle to balance her career with her love for Theo, ultimately leading her to prioritize their relationship. The narrative critiques the modeling industry, emphasizing its competitiveness and the personal sacrifices it demands. Additionally, a subtheme of sexual violence is addressed with sensitivity, providing insight into Emerson's emotions without delving into graphic detail.",
            "The characters in the story are unique, authentic, and well-developed. Emerson and Theo's backstory is both believable and engaging, while Georgia, a supporting character, brings humor and vibrancy to the narrative. However, I would have appreciated more insight into the subplot involving David and Harry's fake relationship agreement. Each character's backstory adds depth, making them even more intriguing.",
            "The author's light and accessible writing style makes the book enjoyable, though the pacing occasionally drags. A more condensed narrative could have led to a quicker resolution.",
            "The stunning cover design immediately drew me in with its strong summer vibe. However, while the book promises a summer atmosphere, it only delivers in a few scenes, like Emerson booking an entire ice cream parlor. Unfortunately, the emphasis on the modeling industry overshadows the summer setting I had anticipated."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*One Last Shot* is a heartfelt love story with well-crafted characters and a thoughtful critique of the modeling industry. While the summer atmosphere is underdelivered, the book’s themes, writing style, and character development make it an enjoyable read. It’s particularly suited for fans of romantic dramas with a touch of realism.",

            "The story is filled with frustrating misunderstandings. Emerson's reaction to the marriage pact—simply deciding to \"fix her life\"—felt unrealistic and lacked depth. While Theo genuinely considered Emerson's needs and feelings, she seemed primarily focused on her own desires. It was fortunate for her that Theo shared her goals; otherwise, the situation could have become quite complicated.",
            "Theo was the standout character for me—he truly embodied the golden retriever MMC archetype, and I believed in his love and devotion. In contrast, Emerson felt too superficial. Her identity as a supermodel with an unhealthy lifestyle made her less relatable and, at times, unlikable. Even when she stood up for herself, it came across in a way that was too tied to her supermodel persona, making it difficult to fully support her.",
            "The story relies heavily on exposition to establish the main characters' credibility in their fields, which often makes them feel cold and distant. Just as I would become immersed in the narrative, an awkward or unnecessary detail would jolt me out of the experience, causing moments of cringe. While this made the reading somewhat challenging, I see it as a common flaw in debut novels rather than a reflection of the author's overall talent.",
            "As this is the author's debut novel, I can see her potential as a storyteller, and I believe she will produce some remarkable works in the future. While this book may not be her best, I find myself a bit let down by the story. However, I am excited to read more from her and hope she ventures outside her comfort zone with new tropes in her next project—I think she might surprise herself. This book is charming and perfect for those seeking the warmth and comfort of young love triumphing in the end.",

If you’re looking for the warmth and comfort of young love working out in the end, this book is definitely the one for you.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Theo was the highlight of the story for me. He was definitely a golden retriever MMC. I believed his love and devotion.\n   - Emerson was too surface level for me. I kept being reminded that she’s a supermodel with an unhealthy lifestyle, and it just made her overall unlikeable. Even when she was standing up for herself (which I absolutely supported), it was in such a supermodel way that made it hard to root for her.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**\n   - The entire story was rife with misunderstandings, which is so annoying in general.\n   - The way the marriage pact goes off and Emerson is just like “oh yeah, gotta go do this thing and fix my life now” was just unbelievable. I needed more thought and care from Emerson to go into this.\n   - Theo seemed to care about Emerson’s needs and feelings while Emerson was just trying to get what she always wanted. It was just lucky for her that Theo wanted the same thing, otherwise this could have gotten messy.\n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**\n   - There was a lot of “telling” done to make the main characters believable in their fields. It made the characters seem very cold and kept pulling me out of being swept away in the story.\n   - Like it would get good and I would find myself being immersed in the story, and then some weird unnecessary detail would pull me out and make me cringe. It made it a bit difficult to get through, but again, this feels like a debut novel flaw. Not a permanent author flaw.\n\n- **Author’s Potential and Future Expectations:**\n   - I think a lot of it has to do with this being the author’s debut novel. I can see her potential as a storyteller, and I just know she’s going to write some amazing books one day. This definitely will not be remembered as her best work.\n   - In the end, I’m a bit let down by this story, but I see the potential of the author. This will definitely not be the last book of hers I read. I’m already excited for what she writes next. I’m hoping she goes completely out of her comfort zone and does whole new tropes from this book. I think she might surprise herself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book delivers on the warmth and comfort of young love, it falls short in character depth and plot execution, particularly with the protagonist Emerson. The story is marred by frequent misunderstandings and a lack of believability in certain character actions. However, the author shows significant potential, and despite the flaws, I remain excited for her future works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

Without prior knowledge of the place, it would have been hard to visualize.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The author did a good job connecting the characters’ high school backstory to their present lives.  \n  - I enjoyed seeing how Emerson and Theo evolved over the years.  \n  - Some dialogue and character reactions felt unnatural and unrealistic, making the characters seem younger (20-23) than their actual age.  \n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**  \n  - The pacing felt rushed in the first 20% of the book but improved afterward.  \n  - The writing was easy to read, though some parts of the dialogue and character interactions could have been more polished.  \n\n- **Depth and Detail:**  \n  - I would have liked more background on the modeling industry and Emerson’s feelings about her career.  \n  - Additional descriptions of the setting and deeper exploration of the characters’ professions would have enriched the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *One Last Shot* was a fun and cute summer romance with enjoyable tropes and a charming premise. While the pacing and dialogue had some flaws, and the setting and character depth could have been more developed, it was still an entertaining read. I’m grateful to have started my ARC reviewing journey with this book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars! ⭐️"

The story centers on Theo and Emerson, high school best friends who shared everything. They made a pact that if neither was married by the time Theo turned 28, they would marry each other within a week of his birthday. On prom night, Theo kisses Emerson, but she leaves, and they lose touch for a decade. Fast forward ten years, Emerson is now a successful model, and Theo works as a photographer. When Emerson receives a notification about their pact, she decides to book a gig with Theo's company, hoping to rekindle their connection.",

The novel centers on a marriage pact that reunites supermodel Emerson with her high school best friend and first love, Theo, after a decade apart.

            "*One Last Shot* is a lighthearted romance that offers a refreshing break from heavier reads. The story revolves around Emerson and Theo, high school sweethearts who make a pact to marry if they are both single by 28. While the book is an easy and quick read, the narrative occasionally feels disjointed, with some transitions between past and present lacking smoothness. At times, I found myself thrust into scenes without sufficient context, which led to confusion. The alternating timelines—between their high school friendship and their reconnection ten years later during a photoshoot, where Theo is the photographer and Emerson is the model—add an interesting dynamic to the story. Overall, it’s an enjoyable read with a charming premise.",

The story alternates between their high school friendship and their reconnection ten years later during a photoshoot, where Theo is the photographer and Emerson is the model.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While the premise is charming, I didn’t find myself deeply connecting with the main characters, Emerson and Theo. Their personalities felt underdeveloped, and I didn’t feel invested in their relationship. However, Owen, a secondary character, stood out and was more memorable.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book is an easy and quick read, but the narrative felt disjointed at times. There were moments where I felt thrust into parts of the story without enough context, which made it confusing. The transitions between past and present could have been smoother.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance between Emerson and Theo is cute and nostalgic, capturing the essence of rekindling an old flame. However, the emotional depth of their relationship felt lacking, and their chemistry didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The inclusion of Italy and the modeling/photography backdrop added a refreshing and visually appealing layer to the story. It provided a nice contrast to the high school setting and helped keep the narrative engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *One Last Shot* is a cute and quick read with a charming premise, but it falls short in character development and emotional depth. While the nostalgic romance and unique setting are enjoyable, the disjointed pacing and lack of connection to the main characters made it a pleasant but not unforgettable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice: 🌶️ (Mild)  \n- Overall Enjoyment: 3/5"

            "The central conflict centers on a pivotal event from Emerson and Theo's teenage years, which led Emerson to push Theo away in an attempt to protect him. This plot device is my least favorite, as it’s hard to comprehend how someone could abandon their loved one in a time of need and then expect trust to be rebuilt years later. The resolution felt rushed, especially since the revelation about the event comes only at the end of the book, suggesting the author didn’t fully engage with the emotional weight of the situation. While I appreciated the alternating perspectives of Emerson and Theo, the pacing was uneven, particularly due to the late reveal of the crucial event. This left little room for a satisfying or believable emotional resolution.",
            "Emerson and Theo's professions did not endear me to their characters or their story. While Emerson's role as a successful model is more intriguing than the typical florist or baker often found in romance novels, her discussions about size, skincare, and body image—central to her profession—felt unrelatable and uninteresting. These topics did not contribute to her character growth or evolve throughout the narrative.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The synopsis intrigued me with the line, \"Theo might not be as happy to see her as she'd hoped,\" which led me to expect some tension and fiery interactions between the characters. However, the story felt tamer than anticipated, with Theo thawing out quite early on.\n\n- **Setting and Flirting:**  \n  The story had a nice setting, and I enjoyed the flirting between the characters. It added a pleasant dynamic to the narrative.\n\n- **Miscommunication Trope:**  \n  The miscommunication between the characters was excessive and became a bit frustrating. While I understand that people change over time, it felt slightly unbelievable how much they acted like strangers and struggled to communicate, especially when some traits and opinions should have remained consistent.\n\n- **Plot Development and Reveal:**  \n  The reveal of their fallout felt overly delayed, despite being somewhat predictable. The buildup was significant, but the payoff didn’t quite match the anticipation. It would have been more effective if the reveal had happened earlier in the story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author Potential:**  \n  Despite the issues, the story was cute and enjoyable. I can see myself trying more of the author's books in the future. If this was a debut novel, I’m confident the author will only improve from here.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story didn’t fully meet my expectations in terms of tension and pacing, it had its charming moments, particularly in the setting and character interactions. The excessive miscommunication and delayed reveal were drawbacks, but the overall experience was pleasant enough to make me curious about the author’s future works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The foreshadowing for the major plot twist is skillfully executed, but the twist itself falls flat, lacking the emotional weight needed for character development. The book feels overly long, especially given that the events unfold over just a week.

Theo’s softer personality was a highlight, though his physical portrayal felt overdone, and Emerson’s past characterization leaned into clichés. Overall, it’s an enjoyable read with room for improvement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️"

The beauty of Italy as the primary location had so much potential to enhance the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptiveness:**  \n   - The book is overly dialogue-heavy, which left many descriptive elements out.

            "The pacing of the story didn't fully captivate me, as it had its moments but failed to maintain my attention consistently. Centered on Emerson, a supermodel, and her high school boyfriend Theo, the narrative delves into themes of celebrity romance, friends-to-lovers dynamics, second chances, and miscommunication. While the dual POV and timeline structure added depth, the miscommunication trope didn't resonate with me, as I prefer characters who engage in open dialogue.",
            "While there are some pacing issues, the author's writing is beautiful and engaging, leaving me eager to explore her future works.",

It perfectly captures the essence of the story, especially with its connection to Cinque Terre, a location I’ve personally visited and loved. The title is clever and meaningful, which adds to the overall appeal.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings and Author’s Note:**  \n  While I appreciate the inclusion of trigger warnings and the author’s note, I found the latter to be a major spoiler. It detracted from the reading experience by revealing too much too soon.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n  The story revolves around Emerson, a supermodel, and Theo, her high school boyfriend and first love. It explores themes of celebrity romance, friends-to-lovers, second chances, and miscommunication. The dual POV and dual timeline structure added depth, but the miscommunication trope isn’t my favorite—I prefer characters who communicate openly.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  I wasn’t fully riveted by the pacing. While the story had its moments, it didn’t consistently hold my attention.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Despite some pacing issues, the author’s writing is lovely and engaging. It left me interested in reading her future works.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narrators, Brittany Pressley and Sean Patrick Hopkins, were excellent. Hopkins, in particular, stood out, as he did in Lynn Painter’s *Happily Never After*. Their performances enhanced the audiobook experience.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The locations—Cinque Terre, Italy, Los Angeles, and Boston—were vividly described and added a rich backdrop to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*One Last Shot* is a visually and narratively appealing book with a clever title and beautiful cover. While the pacing and miscommunication trope didn’t fully resonate with me, the writing and narration were strong enough to keep me engaged. I’d recommend it to fans of celebrity romance and second-chance love stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars  \nAudiobook Length: 10 hours 46 minutes at 1x speed"

However, the resolution feels rushed, particularly in the characters' reunion. Their immediate conflict—poor communication about their desire to be together—is resolved too quickly, in just one page, which is frustrating.

It added fun elements and atmospheric writing that I really enjoyed! It made me want to book another flight to Italy!  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Themes:**  \n  This was such a cute summery read with surprising emotional topics! A sensitive subject is alluded to throughout the book (please check trigger warnings). I do wish that it was addressed a bit differently, with it not being kept a secret for so long, but I loved how the MMC supported the FMC throughout it at the end.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  There is a bit of miscommunication in this that wasn't my favorite, but it didn't deter me from enjoying the read!  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was really sweet and wrapped up their story nicely!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a charming and emotional summery read with a beautiful setting and a heartfelt resolution. While there were some aspects I wished were handled differently, the story was enjoyable and left me with a warm feeling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3⭐️"

Their reunion moments felt rushed and lacked real bonding. After 10 years of not speaking, neither character engaged in enough dialogue or flirting to convincingly restart their relationship.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dialogue:**  \n  The interactions between Emerson and Theo were superficial, with just a few quick questions exchanged here and there.

Their interactions were engaging and had potential to carry the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  However, I found myself getting bored with them over the course of 200+ pages. The prolonged tension of both characters wanting to be together but neither expressing it became tedious.  \n\n- **Communication Issues:**  \n  The lack of communication between Theo and Emerson was frustrating. It wasn’t even a case of miscommunication—it was a complete absence of communication, which felt unrealistic and annoying.  \n\n- **Depth and Exploration of Themes:**  \n  There were two topics that could have been explored more deeply to add richness to the characters and the story. Instead, these were kept at a surface level, serving only as shallow explanations for their poor communication and inability to be together. This was a missed opportunity, as delving into these aspects could have elevated the novel from good to great.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this was a good romance with engaging character dynamics, it fell short of its potential due to pacing issues, a lack of meaningful communication, and underdeveloped themes.

While this is a common trope, it was executed in a way that felt refreshing and chill, especially since I hadn’t read a romance book in a while.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The miscommunication between the characters was sometimes irritating, as many issues could have been resolved earlier. There were moments when they were close to overcoming their problems but would drop the ball at the last minute, delaying resolution.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I enjoyed the ending, where things were finally cleared up, and the story wrapped up nicely. It was satisfying to see the characters resolve their conflicts.  \n\n- **Overall Tone:**  \n  The book had a cute and fun vibe, making it an enjoyable read despite some frustrations with the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a cute and refreshing romance novel with a typical miscommunication-driven plot. While some aspects of the story were frustrating, the overall tone was fun, and the ending provided a satisfying resolution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The book could have benefited from being about 100 pages shorter, as the miscommunication plotline made certain parts feel unnecessarily prolonged.",

The pacing was uneven, and the story dragged on, largely due to an overreliance on the miscommunication trope.

Cayouette balances these themes well within a genre typically focused on light-hearted emotions and romance. The author walks this fine line with grace, creating a story that feels both meaningful and emotionally resonant.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Emerson’s healing journey is written with care and depth, making her character arc one of the strongest aspects of the book. Theo’s character is also well-composed, and their relationship feels authentic and enduring. I believe Emerson and Theo are a couple who will grow old and grey together, which speaks to the strength of their connection.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The overall plotline felt disjointed at times, which detracted from the reading experience.

While these tropes have potential, the execution of the miscommunication trope was particularly frustrating. It was so poorly handled that it nearly led me to stop reading multiple times.  \n\n- **Audience Appeal:**  \n  Despite its flaws, this is a romance that will resonate with a specific audience.

However, the novel fell short of these expectations. While I acknowledge that my high expectations were partly my fault, the synopsis did give off similar vibes to those authors' books.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The writing style felt clunky, especially for a debut novel. There were instances where characters talked directly to each other rather than past each other, and flashbacks lacked smooth transitions. The narrative often told rather than showed, leaving me wishing for more emotional depth and refinement to better immerse me in the characters' perspectives.\n\n- **Setting:**\n   - The majority of the novel is set in Cinque Terre, Italy, a location I was excited to explore through the story. Unfortunately, the setting didn’t come alive as I had hoped. It failed to feel like its own character, and I often struggled to visualize it. Given the magical potential of the setting, its underutilization was disappointing.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**\n   - I questioned whether this novel should have been categorized as Young Adult. The flashback chapters to Emerson and Theo’s teenage years were stronger and more authentic to the friends-to-lovers trope than the adult chapters. The adult portion felt rushed, leaning more into \"I need to be in love with Theo RIGHT NOW\" rather than a gradual reconnection and rekindling of love.\n\n- **Strengths (Modeling Industry Representation):**\n   - The novel excelled in its portrayal of the modeling industry. The details about agents, model talents, and photographers were clear and well-executed, reflecting the author’s experience in this field. This was a refreshing and unique addition to the romance genre, as it provided a glimpse into an industry rarely explored in such books.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**\n   - While this was a fine debut novel, it didn’t leave a lasting impression on me. I don’t see myself revisiting it for a re-read, though I appreciate having a visually appealing copy to add to my bookshelf.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis debut novel had potential but ultimately fell short of my expectations, particularly in terms of writing style, setting immersion, and the execution of the friends-to-lovers trope.

            "The love story between Theo and Emerson centers on miscommunication, which underpins nearly all their struggles, both past and present. This overused plot device can be frustrating, particularly when it seems to exist solely to extend the narrative. The resolution—a sudden, clichéd proposal—feels unearned and does not adequately resolve the ongoing miscommunication that plagues their relationship.",

The abrupt and unearned resolution further undermines the story’s potential. Overall, it’s a decent read for those who don’t mind the trope, but for others, it’s a tedious experience.",

It starts abruptly with the female main character receiving a phone reminder about the marriage pact.  \n   - The fallout between the two characters after making the pact is mentioned, but it feels underexplored, leaving a gap in understanding their emotional journey.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Forced Proximity:**  \n   - The female main character, a model, takes on a job with the male main character, a photographer, creating forced proximity between them.  \n   - While it’s clear both characters still care for each other, their interactions feel surface-level, lacking depth and emotional resonance.  \n\n- **Depth and Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - The story feels like it never delves too deep, leaving me with the sense that something is missing to make their reconnection believable.  \n   - The miscommunication trope is heavily relied upon, and it persists throughout the book, even leading to a third-act breakup.  \n\n- **Tropes and Execution:**  \n   - The book heavily relies on the miscommunication trope, which doesn’t improve as the story progresses.  \n   - The constant miscommunication from start to finish, including the third-act breakup, feels repetitive and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the novel is engaging and the concept of a marriage pact is appealing, the execution falls short.

The friends-to-lovers trope felt unearned, the setting was underutilized, and the writing style was often jarring. While there were a few engaging moments, the story steadily became more frustrating and underwhelming as it progressed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story felt tedious, burdened by excessive pain and insufficient comfort. While it introduced a tragic backstory, it ultimately left the narrative feeling unresolved. The pacing was uneven, with fleeting moments of charm, such as the flashbacks, overshadowed by repetitive angst and a lack of meaningful progress in the main timeline.",
            "The standout elements of the book were two brief side characters and a single text exchange with a minor character.

Their lives revolved entirely around each other and their tragic past, rendering them dull and unrelatable. The teenage versions of Emmerson and Theo were more engaging, with their puppy love romance being charming. However, as adults, they felt underdeveloped and unappealing.

The miscommunication trope may appeal to some readers, but overall, the book leaves much to be desired.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The stunning special edition was a highlight, but the book ultimately didn’t resonate with me as much as I had hoped.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars (rounded down to 2 for Goodreads)."

While it's a solid debut novel, I found some issues introduced in the story to be unresolved, and the reliance on miscommunication detracted from my overall enjoyment.",

            "The plot and premise were ultimately unsatisfying. The central conflict felt contrived and could have been easily resolved with an honest conversation early on. A weak premise led to a flawed plot, and the lack of clarity regarding why the main characters, Emerson and Theo, failed to communicate for years was frustrating. The revelation of their past conflict came too late in the book (at 85%) and felt rushed. Additionally, the late introduction of Emerson’s traumatic backstory (her rape) seemed random and poorly integrated, treated more as a throwaway explanation than explored with the depth and sensitivity it deserved.",
            "Emerson is an unlikable protagonist, marked by her indecisiveness, dishonesty, and reliance on her agent, making her journey frustrating to follow. Her immature actions, such as flirting with her ex and kissing another man to provoke Theo, come across as contradictory. Theo, on the other hand, is bland and lacks depth, resembling a \"wet paper napkin,\" which makes it difficult to invest in his character. Supporting characters like Georgia feel underdeveloped, existing primarily to further Emerson’s storyline. Georgia’s forgiveness of Emerson’s ignorance seems hollow and unrealistic. The relationship between Emerson and Theo is exhausting; their constant miscommunication and avoidance of real issues render their romance forced and unearned. Emerson’s professed loyalty to Georgia is undermined by her consistent prioritization of her career over friendships. Ultimately, the dynamic between Emerson and Theo is toxic, as they date other people instead of confronting their feelings, making their eventual reconciliation feel unfulfilling.",

Instead of addressing this inconsistency, he dwells on it without asking her directly.  \n   - Emerson pretends to be in a relationship with another man for no clear reason, further complicating the situation unnecessarily.  \n\n- **Reader Frustration and Emotional Response:**  \n   - The constant miscommunication and lack of resolution made the book irritating to read.  \n   - The repetitive nature of the miscommunication felt forced and unrealistic, leading to a strong dislike for the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book's over-reliance on miscommunication as a plot device made it frustrating and unrealistic, especially given the characters' ages and maturity.

Emerson and Theo made a pact to marry at 28, but after ghosting him for a decade, Emerson suddenly seeks him out without clarifying her intentions. Meanwhile, Theo has been fixated on Emerson all these years yet remains unwilling to express his feelings or fears.",

Their only meaningful exchanges occur through trivial nightly questions, such as “Do you still like donuts?” The friends-to-lovers and second-chance romance tropes are poorly executed, resulting in a lack of genuine connection. Theo's insecurities and self-doubt make him an unappealing lead; he pines for Emerson for a decade yet almost ignores her upon her return, creating an inconsistent and frustrating dynamic. Emerson, a down-to-earth supermodel, is portrayed as “not like other girls” and overly self-pitying. Her traumatic past, meant to be a subtle backdrop, instead drives the plot, leading to ghosting, miscommunication, and a near-breakup.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n   - The novel alternates between Emerson and Theo's high school friendship and their present-day photoshoot.  \n   - The story is driven by constant miscommunication, which becomes frustrating and hard to read.  \n   - Emerson and Theo had a pact to marry at 28, but after ghosting him for ten years, Emerson seeks him out without explaining her intentions.  \n   - Theo has been hung up on Emerson for ten years but refuses to communicate his feelings or fears.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n   - The romance lacks depth and action; the characters think about their feelings but fail to show them.  \n   - The only meaningful communication between them is through nightly questions, which are often trivial (e.g., “Do you still like donuts?”).  \n   - The friends-to-lovers and second-chance romance tropes are poorly executed, with almost no genuine romantic connection.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Theo’s insecurities, self-doubt, and second-guessing make him an unappealing male lead.  \n   - His behavior—pining for Emerson for ten years, then almost ignoring her when she reappears—feels inconsistent and frustrating.  \n   - Emerson is portrayed as a down-to-earth supermodel but comes across as “not like other girls” and overly self-pitying.  \n   - Her traumatic past, intended to be a subtle element, becomes the central driver of the plot, including the ghosting, miscommunication, and near-breakup.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n   - The novel attempts to address trauma and miscommunication but fails to integrate these themes effectively.  \n   - The lack of communication between the characters undermines the story’s emotional impact.  \n   - The author’s note suggests the trauma was meant to be a background element, but it ends up dominating the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The book was difficult to engage with due to its frustrating plot and lack of romantic development.  \n   - The only reason for continuing to read was the beautiful edition from a book box.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*One Last Shot* is a second-chance romance that struggles with poor execution of its tropes, frustrating miscommunication, and underdeveloped characters. While the premise had potential, the lack of genuine romance and emotional depth made it a challenging read. The beautiful physical edition of the book was the sole redeeming factor.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
