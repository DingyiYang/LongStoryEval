            "This story features fully realized and multifaceted characters, with friendships at its core—particularly the dynamic between Bette and Ash, as well as their larger friend group. The developing friendship with Ruth was especially poignant, often overshadowing the romantic crush that dominated 80% of the book. The representation of diverse orientations and ethnicities felt both effortless and thoughtful, avoiding tokenism. It's evident that the author invested significant care into this aspect, setting a standard for other contemporary writers. While the novel didn't completely break my contemporary romance slump, it certainly pushed me out of my comfort zone. It’s rich with tropes, all skillfully navigated and often subverted without feeling clichéd or implausible.",

            "This book is a tender, steamy, and messy exploration of queer relationships, infused with British charm and thoughtfulness. It skillfully balances the joys and challenges of love, making it a standout in the romcom genre.",

While the ending felt slightly rushed—possibly because I was reading so eagerly—it still kept me thoroughly engaged.  \n\n- **Romance and Tropes:**  \n  The novel didn’t entirely break my contemporary romance slump, but it certainly jostled it out of its comfort zone. It’s filled with tropes galore, all navigated skillfully and often subverted without feeling twee, tiresome, or implausible.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Every character felt fully realized and faceted. Friendships are central to the story, which I loved—especially Bette and Ash, as well as the larger friend group. The burgeoning friendship with Ruth was particularly meaningful, even more so than the crush for 80% of the book.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The representation of various orientations and ethnicities felt effortless and thoughtful, not obnoxious or tokenistic. It’s clear the author put a lot of care into this aspect, and it’s something other contemporary authors could learn from.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The book is very tender, very steamy, very messy, very British, very queer, and very thoughtful. It balances the joys and pitfalls of queer relationships with aplomb, making it a standout in the romcom genre.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is immersive, with enough alcohol and socializing on page that I started to feel exhausted by proxy. It’s a testament to how well the author captures the energy of the characters’ lives.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful, thoughtful, and steamy romcom that skillfully navigates queer relationships and friendships.

I didn’t think I’d necessarily relate to a story about a woman going on a \"hot girl summer gay sex binge,\" but it sounded fun, so I gave it a try.  \n\n- **Unique Representation of Queer Stories:**  \n  This book exceeded my expectations. Many queer stories focus on coming out, which is important, but this one explores what happens afterward—lives that often get neglected in storytelling. It delves into the tension between two people in a relationship who have been out for different amounts of time, a dynamic I haven’t seen written about before.  \n\n- **Protagonist's Relatability and Depth:**  \n  I loved the protagonist’s internal conflict between her intense \"big gay Uhaul feelings\" and her awareness of her limited experience in queer relationships and lack of queer community. This struggle was executed flawlessly and felt incredibly relatable.  \n\n- **Character Development and Realism:**  \n  The characters were interesting, quirky, and still felt real and believable. The protagonist’s awkwardness and anxiety, paired with her inner crises, made her super relatable.  \n\n- **Balanced Tone and Themes:**  \n  The book had the perfect mix of humor, smutty scenes, Catholic guilt, gay panic, and even a heartwarming Christmas ending. It truly had everything I could want in a story.  \n\n- **Genre Appeal Beyond Expectations:**  \n  I don’t typically enjoy romance books, but I couldn’t put this one down. It was so engaging and well-written that it completely won me over.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Future Hopes:**  \n  I plan to spend the rest of the year convincing everyone I know to read this book. I also hope Kate Young continues to write forever—her storytelling is exceptional.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful surprise, offering a fresh perspective on queer relationships and personal growth. It combined humor, depth, and relatability in a way that kept me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I thought, \"ALRIGHT NOW!\" and was excited to dive in.\n\n- **Diversity and Representation:**  \n  The novel features diverse perspectives and characters, which I found refreshing and enjoyable. It explores the feeling of being \"othered\" within the Queer community, a topic that isn’t discussed enough. The author did a great job highlighting the experience of having to prove oneself even after coming out, which was both interesting and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Universal Themes:**  \n  Beyond its focus on LGBTQ+ experiences, the book touches on universal themes that resonate with a wide audience. The main character, Bette, struggles with dating and the longing to find the right person, a relatable experience for many readers.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I loved this book a lot! It was a fun and enjoyable read that left a lasting impression. The combination of unique perspectives and relatable themes made it a standout novel for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a highly enjoyable and thought-provoking read that skillfully blends unique LGBTQ+ experiences with universal themes. The diverse characters and relatable struggles, particularly around dating and identity, made it a memorable and impactful story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was a fun, easy read.  \n   - The story was pretty well executed and genuinely pretty funny.  \n   - Very much worth your time if you’re into the genre!  \n\n- **Avoidance of Modern Romance Pitfalls:**  \n   - It avoided a lot of what I consider to be modern romance novel pitfalls, such as insane therapy speak, constant overemphasis of emotional trauma that is told not shown, and sex scenes on the wrong side of the cringe line for my personal tastes.  \n\n- **Sex Scenes:**  \n   - I actually thought the sex scenes were quite well done.  \n   - However, in the final sex scene between the endgame couple, I realized that the author described neither the presence nor absence of pubic hair. This genuinely took me out of it—I just feel like Bette would’ve noticed while she was down there. It felt weird to not include this detail with all of the other descriptions in the scene.  \n\n- **Accuracy of Cultural References:**  \n   - It is said that a Taylor Swift song called “Stay” is played as a first dance song at a wedding. There is no Taylor Swift song of this title, and none of her songs with this word in the title would make sense as a first dance song. I genuinely scrolled through reviews waiting for someone to point this out, but no one did, which makes me feel crazy. Why mention Taylor Swift at all? What is the meaning of this? I feel like I’m being pranked.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Bette had a good friend group, which is so important.  \n   - You knew where this was going before Bette did, and then I feel like when she had her realization, it somehow happened both too quickly and too slow.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n   - The twist/reveal actually did get me—I GASPED and had to take a break to process it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun, well-executed, and funny story that avoided many modern romance pitfalls. While I had a couple of nitpicks—like the omission of a specific detail in a sex scene and an inaccurate Taylor Swift reference—the book was engaging and worth the read, especially if you’re into the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Bette’s character development and the supportive friendships make it a worthwhile read, even if the pacing and realism could be improved.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her best friend and flatmate, Ash, is a supportive and endearing presence, offering valuable advice throughout. Mei’s character adds complexity; her suggestion for a break propels the plot while introducing tension into the relationship. The book offers a refreshing and authentic depiction of a Sapphic relationship and the LGBTQ+ experience, featuring relatable and intimate scenes that enhance the authenticity of the characters' connection.",

I enjoyed the writing and most of the characters, including the dynamics between the different friend groups. The storyline was interesting, yet realistically imperfect. It felt like I had read through an entire season of a show by the time it ended!\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The chemistry between Ruth and Bette was great, but the transition from friends to lovers felt underdeveloped. Bette’s sudden realization of her feelings for Ruth seemed abrupt and could have been handled better. Additionally, Bette’s awkwardness, while understandable as a personality trait, was overdone to the point of making pivotal conversations cringey and hard to take seriously.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Execution:**  \n  The ending was disappointing. I expected a big romantic gesture, but the awkwardness overshadowed what could have been a heartfelt moment. The reunion felt rushed and anti-climactic, lacking the emotional depth and resolution I was hoping for. I would have preferred a more detailed exploration of how Bette convinced Ruth to reconcile and a deeper discussion of their feelings and Ruth’s insecurities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some flaws, particularly in the development of the romance and the ending, I enjoyed the book overall. It was fun, engaging, and I would recommend it to fans of sapphic romance.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️"

However, its introspective and mopey tone detracts from the expected rom-com vibe. The reviewer is intrigued by the author’s potential and wonders if future works will embrace emotional depth more fully or maintain a cautious distance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

It’s a grown-up sapphic rom-com that I recommend to anyone looking for a cozy, well-written story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  I love the Bristol setting and the late 20s/early 30s age group, which adds a relatable and grounded feel to the story. The book feels really cozy and immersive.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  All the characters feel like people I know in real life. I was really rooting for Bette to find her happiness, and I loved her best friend/housemate Ash. However, Mei doesn’t show up much despite being key to the framing of everything. I couldn’t really get a sense of how their relationship actually was beyond Bette’s initial infatuation. That said, I’m glad Mei was more in the background so the story could focus on the present moment.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The premise is a bit silly, but it didn’t get in the way of my enjoyment. The story is well-written and engaging.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  I found a lot of similarities with *The Pairing* by Casey McQuiston, so I’m happy to recommend this book to people who enjoyed that and vice versa.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a delightful and cozy sapphic rom-com with relatable characters and a charming setting.

Although her reluctance toward casual encounters makes the ending somewhat predictable, the story remains an enjoyable read. Bette's best friend, Ash, is supportive and likable, but I wished for more depth; we don't gain much insight into her struggles, leaving her feeling somewhat two-dimensional. In contrast, Ruth, Bette's new friend, is vibrant, open, and caring, offering Bette a vital connection to a broader supportive queer community.",
