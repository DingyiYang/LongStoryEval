This frequent shifting creates a vignette-like structure, providing snapshots of each character's experience over the weekend.

The family dynamics felt universal, making the narrative relatable despite cultural differences.",

Joy's emotional journey, compounded by her aunt Nancy's unexpected announcement that Mary will rise again at midnight on Easter morning, adds tension and complexity to the family dynamics. The older generation, rooted in Nigerian traditions, struggles to balance these customs with the demands of Western society, while the younger generation, raised in Canada or the US, navigates their dual cultural identities. Joy's relatable and multi-dimensional feelings make her a compelling protagonist.",

Central to the story is the Okafor family's struggle to reconcile their Nigerian traditions, cuisine, and cultural beliefs with their daily lives in Western society. The generational divide between the older members, who were born in Nigeria, and the younger ones, who are fully Canadian or American, adds significant depth to the narrative."

This was a disappointment, as I expected a lighter tone based on the description.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters were flawed, but I didn‚Äôt find most of them relatable or compelling enough to \"leap off the page.\" They felt underdeveloped and hard to connect with.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The central premise of the \"resurrection\" was so ridiculous that it became distracting rather than engaging. It was supposed to be the focus of the book, but it didn‚Äôt work for me.\n   - The family dynamics were interesting but overly convoluted and hard to follow, which made the story less enjoyable.\n\n- **Cultural and Linguistic Elements:**\n   - I struggled with the Nigerian way of speaking English and the frequent use of Nigerian dialect. Without context or translation for the non-English sentences, I found myself guessing or skipping over those parts, which disrupted my reading experience.\n\n- **Accuracy of Description:**\n   - The book‚Äôs description claimed that all family members, except Joy, believed in Nancy‚Äôs premonition. However, I found it to be more evenly split between believers and skeptics, which made the description feel misleading.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this book fell short of my expectations. The lack of humor, underdeveloped characters, and convoluted plot made it difficult to stay engaged. While the family dynamics had potential, they were overshadowed by the distracting premise and linguistic challenges. The book‚Äôs description did not align with my reading experience, which added to my disappointment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The premise intrigued me, as did the fact it was written by a Canadian author, so I added it to my list of new releases for 2024.\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**\n   - The plot follows three generations of a Nigerian Canadian family as they navigate the untimely and unexplainable death of their matriarch. Through multiple POVs, the story allows for fully fleshed-out characters, an intimate understanding of the family, and a deeper exploration of their dynamics.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The various perspectives provide a rich understanding of the characters and their unique reactions to grief, which manifest differently depending on their roles and relationships within the family. I appreciated the variety in how each character processed the loss.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**\n   - While the bones of the story and the characters are solid, the narrative inconsistently held my attention. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly what was missing. The writing sometimes felt juvenile, which didn‚Äôt surprise me since Louisa Onom√© primarily writes books geared toward teens. The story is filled with a lot of drama, though it does include a touch of humor.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**\n   - *Pride and Joy* explores familial roles and bonds, traditional and contemporary societal and cultural expectations, and the profound impact of losing someone. It‚Äôs a journey of forgiveness, healing, and learning to accept the things we cannot control.\n\n- **Cultural and Social Commentary:**\n   - The novel delves into the complexities of Nigerian Canadian culture, addressing themes like grief, familial duty, and societal pressures. It also touches on issues such as toxic relationships, religious bigotry, and homophobia.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - Despite its flaws, I found the story engaging and will definitely keep an eye on Louisa Onom√©‚Äôs writing career moving forward. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy stories about imperfect families and cultural exploration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Pride and Joy* is a heartfelt exploration of grief, family dynamics, and cultural identity. While the narrative occasionally falters in holding attention and leans toward a more juvenile tone, it offers a meaningful journey through loss, forgiveness, and healing.

            "The characters in this story are richly drawn and complex, making them feel remarkably real. Joy, the counselor with poor boundaries, resonates with many familiar figures in my life. While she risked coming across as overly rigid or controlling, the author skillfully crafted her narrative, allowing us to empathize with her struggles. Aunty Nancy begins as an insufferable religious zealot, but by the end, her profound grief evokes sympathy, giving depth to her character. The cast is filled with similar complexities, and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of the chaotic weekend they shared together.",
