            "The plot featured some wild twists, particularly with the introduction of the secret underground society, Double C. While this element added excitement, it also felt somewhat far-fetched. The pacing was uneven: certain scenes dragged on, while key emotional moments rushed by, leaving me wanting more depth.",
            "Finn, the tortured bad boy with hidden depths, and Scottie, the innocent cheerleader, share an electrifying chemistry that drives the story. Their captivating push-and-pull dynamic showcases significant character growth—Finn's past struggles resonate deeply, while Scottie's journey through her toxic relationship with her mother and life's challenges adds meaningful depth. Both characters are well-developed and easy to root for. The side characters also shine, bringing charm and richness to the narrative. The heartwarming found family theme enhances the overall experience, and I eagerly anticipate the author's next steps for these characters.",

            "The plot was weak and nearly non-existent, relying on occasional reminders to keep it afloat. The pacing was inconsistent, feeling both slow and rushed, with some scenes stretching across multiple chapters. At 91 chapters plus an epilogue, the book felt overly long and dragged out.",
            "Scottie and Finn come across as two-dimensional characters, primarily defined by their relationship. Scottie is portrayed mostly as a cheerleader and klutz, lacking any significant hobbies or deeper traits. Similarly, Finn's \"bad boy\" persona feels underdeveloped, with his fighting skills and backstory insufficiently explored. Both characters seem more like vessels for the plot rather than active participants in it. Their romance unfolds in an awkward mix of slow and fast pacing, lacking a genuine connection. The relationship dynamics feel reminiscent of high school, marked by unnecessary push-pull. While there are some endearing moments, their love story overall feels more convenient than deeply connected.",

            "The New York City campus setting was engaging and immersive, but at times it veered into the realm of the unrealistic, particularly with the extravagant secret club, Double C. The storyline often felt more like high school than college, featuring melodramatic reactions and implausible scenarios. Additionally, the portrayal of Scottie’s mother’s scandal and the ensuing gossip seemed exaggerated for a college environment."

Despite these flaws, I enjoyed the story and plan to read more from the author.

However, I’ve noticed a positive shift in the genre over the years, with stories now featuring more age-appropriate behavior without unnecessary exaggeration. *Learning Curve* is an excellent example of this growth.\n\n- **Emotional Depth and Tone:**\n   - The story is more emotional than dramatic, which is a slight departure from Max Monroe’s usual lighthearted style. However, it avoids being overly heavy or angsty. The balance between the typical \"shenanigans\" of the age group and real-life challenges is well-executed.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The relationship growth between Finn and Scottie is portrayed realistically, and their individual growth adds depth to the story. This layer of development was unexpected and made the narrative more engaging.\n\n- **Story Length and Subject Matter:**\n   - The novel is substantial, both in length and in the scope of its subject matter. It tackles significant themes while maintaining a compelling narrative.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation:**\n   - I loved this story so much that I’m eagerly awaiting the audio version. It’s one of Max Monroe’s best works, and I’m excited to see where they take the Dickson University series next. I feel it’s going to be an epic ride, and I’m fully invested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Learning Curve* is a standout novel in the New Adult genre, showcasing the evolution of age-appropriate storytelling.

            "The conflict between the main character (MC) and Finn felt manipulative, with the MC portraying herself as the victim while she was the one in need of forgiveness. The melodrama surrounding the MC's mother came across as excessive and unrealistic, such as isolating herself for two months due to her mother's actions. Although Finn's support for the MC—like sharing class notes, bringing her food, and confronting her ex—was commendable, her refusal to communicate with him seemed unwarranted. \n\nThe story would have benefited from concluding after the MC and Finn reconciled and met his family. The decision to leave the MC paralyzed in the final 15% of the book felt unnecessary, unrealistic, and disconnected from the overall narrative. This twist altered the tone and character dynamics, making it feel like an entirely different story. The ending did not provide a true happily ever after (HEA) but rather presented a compromise in a challenging situation.\n\nWhile the book started strong, it could have been more concise; approximately 200 pages could have been trimmed to create a tighter 400-page novel. The narrative began to lose momentum around the 50% mark, particularly after the first intimate scene and its aftermath.",

            "The book is divided into two parts, each centered on a distinct character. While the first part flowed well, the pacing of the second part (Scottie's story) felt uneven, with a mix of intense moments followed by slower sections. The narrative might have benefited from being split into two separate books for greater depth. The surprising ending adds an intriguing layer of diversity to the story, though I would have liked to see that aspect explored further. I'm eager to start the Winslow brother series next!",
            "Finn’s character growth was beautifully portrayed, showcasing his journey of friendship, love, and self-discovery. The bromance between Ace and Finn was heartwarming, with Ace’s supportive friendship standing out as a highlight. Scottie’s emotional arc was deeply explored, though it felt more intense compared to the others. The theme of found family was the strongest aspect of the story and promises to play a significant role in the future. The introduction of Blake and Ace to Finn’s siblings was a delightful moment, and Ace’s parents welcomed Finn with open arms, making him feel like part of their family. The romance was well-developed, allowing space for the characters to grow individually, and the balance of spice enhanced the story without overwhelming it.",
            "This book was an absolute delight! Despite being in a reading slump, it offered a refreshing and enjoyable experience. The short chapters and captivating writing style kept me fully engaged. I can hardly wait for the next installment—Lexy and Blake's story has me buzzing with excitement, along with Ace and Julia's involvement. I'm counting down the days!"

        "conclusion": "This was a refreshing and engaging read, despite some pacing issues and a desire for more depth in certain areas. The found family dynamic, character growth, and well-developed romance were standout elements. While the dramatic moments occasionally felt overdone, the story left me excited for what comes next.",

His challenging upbringing and dedication to caring for his siblings make him a compelling character. Witnessing his growth as he learns to love Scottie and confront his struggles with his newfound family was profoundly satisfying. \n\nScottie’s flaws and her journey toward redemption bring a refreshing dynamic to the story, as it’s a welcome shift to see the female lead making mistakes and striving to correct them, rather than the usual trope of a flawed male lead. \n\nThe side characters, including Ace, Julia, Blake, Lex, and Kayla, are exceptionally well-developed, with their backstories intricately woven into the narrative. This depth makes me care about them and crave their own stories, especially those of Ace and Julia.",

            "I thoroughly enjoyed Finn's journey into becoming a wonderful man. His relationships with his siblings added depth to the story, and I loved how they interacted. Adult Lexi is just as fabulous as her younger self, and I can't wait for her book. Scottie's maturation and discovery of her inner strength by the end were truly inspiring. I found Ace charming, despite Finn's initial attempts to dislike him. The billionaire kids, now all grown up, were delightful, and Thatch and Cassie's humor had me laughing—I'm eager to see more of their pranks. Finn and Scottie's connection was palpable, even as they each resisted it for their own reasons.",

            "The introduction of second-generation characters, especially Ace (Thatcher Kelly 2.0), was a highlight of the story. While Ace didn’t quite surpass his father, Thatcher, he emerged as a compelling character in his own right. Cassie Kelly remained true to her original persona, and her first encounter with Finn was particularly memorable. Ty Winslow continued to charm, playing a significant role throughout.\n\nFinn Hayes and Scottie Bardeaux took center stage, with Finn embodying a brooding, troubled character burdened by family secrets. Scottie, on the other hand, maintained a cheerful façade while grappling with her own past traumas. Their contrasting personalities and struggles made them relatable and engaging. The undeniable chemistry between Finn and Scottie ignited from their very first meeting, with their push-and-pull dynamic—filled with emotional highs and lows—keeping me thoroughly captivated.\n\nTheir romance unfolded as a slow burn, teeming with tension and emotional conflict. The journey from initial attraction to a deeper connection was both heartwarming and heartbreaking. Finn’s internal battle with feelings of unworthiness and Scottie’s determination to persevere through his resistance added layers of complexity to their relationship. The eventual resolution, though hard-earned, was satisfying, leaving me rooting for their happily-ever-after.\n\nFamiliar characters from previous books, like Thatcher and Ty, enriched the story and contributed to its sense of cohesion. Additionally, new characters such as Julia and Kayla played essential roles in supporting Scottie during her lowest moments, illustrating the vital importance of friendship and community.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Engagement:**\n   - The novel was described as a roller coaster ride, with unexpected twists and turns that kept me emotionally invested. The dark and terrifying moments, as well as the emotional crash at the end, made the journey intense and unforgettable.\n   - The story was worth it, leaving me eager for more from this series and its characters.\n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**\n   - The introduction of second-generation characters, particularly Ace (Thatcher Kelly 2.0), was a highlight. While Ace couldn’t outdo his dad, Thatcher, he still held his own as a compelling character.\n   - Cassie Kelly remained true to her character, and her first meeting with Finn was a standout moment.\n   - Ty Winslow was a significant part of the story and as loveable as ever.\n   - Finn Hayes and Scottie Bardeaux were the central focus. Finn was brooding, dark, and troubled, carrying a heavy family secret. Scottie, despite her cheerful exterior, had her own traumatic past. Their contrasting personalities and struggles made them relatable and engaging.\n   - The chemistry between Finn and Scottie was undeniable, with sparks flying from their first meeting. Their push-and-pull dynamic, filled with emotional highs and lows, kept me hooked.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story was filled with unexpected twists and turns, making it impossible to predict what would happen next. Just when I thought things were settling, the authors threw in more challenges for the characters.\n   - The pacing was well-balanced, with moments of tension and emotional depth that kept me invested throughout.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**\n   - The novel explored themes of trauma, family secrets, and personal growth. Finn’s struggle with his past and Scottie’s resilience in the face of her own challenges added layers of emotional depth.\n   - The idea of finding light in the dark was a recurring theme, particularly in Finn’s journey toward redemption and love.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and World-Building:**\n   - The inclusion of familiar characters from previous books, like Thatcher and Ty, added depth to the story and made the world feel cohesive.\n   - New characters, such as Julia and Kayla, played crucial roles in supporting Scottie during her lowest moments, highlighting the importance of friendship and community.\n\n- **Romantic Development:**\n   - The romance between Finn and Scottie was a slow burn, filled with tension and emotional conflict. Their journey from initial attraction to a deeper connection was both heartwarming and heartbreaking.\n   - Finn’s internal struggle with feeling unworthy of Scottie and her determination to hold on despite his pushbacks added complexity to their relationship.\n   - The eventual resolution, though hard-earned, was satisfying and left me rooting for their happily-ever-after.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel was an emotional roller coaster, blending intense moments of darkness with heartwarming connections and unexpected twists. The characters, both old and new, were richly developed, and the romance between Finn and Scottie was both compelling and deeply moving. Max Monroe delivered a story that kept me engaged from start to finish, and I can’t wait to see where this series goes next.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Emotional Impact: 10/10  \n- Character Development: 9/10  \n- Plot and Pacing: 9/10  \n- Themes and Depth: 9/10  \n- Romantic Development: 10/10  \n- Overall: 9.5/10"

Elements such as stalking, harassment, physical confrontations, and a secret college society enhance the drama and tension. Although the pacing can occasionally feel overwhelming due to the numerous challenges the characters encounter, it ultimately adds to the authenticity of their journey.",

Throughout the story, both characters experience significant individual and joint growth, despite their immaturity and poor choices. Secondary characters, such as the MC's roommate Ace and the FC's friends, add depth, humor, and support to the narrative. The romance is intense and magnetic from the outset, eschewing the trope of insta-love for a nuanced push-and-pull dynamic rooted in their traumas and insecurities. The MC's habit of kissing and then ghosting the FC causes her emotional pain, but their bond strengthens as they confront their struggles together.

The male protagonist (MC) is a brooding loner from an abusive household, filled with rage and resentment toward his wealthy half-siblings. The female protagonist (FC) is a kind, people-pleasing cheerleader dealing with her own family issues, including an alcoholic mother and a toxic ex-boyfriend.\n   - Both characters undergo significant growth over the course of the story, individually and together, despite their immaturity and poor decision-making.\n   - Secondary characters, like the MC's roommate Ace and the FC's friends, add depth, humor, and support to the narrative.\n\n- **Romantic Relationship:**\n   - The romance is intense and magnetic from the start, but it’s far from insta-love. The relationship is marked by a push-and-pull dynamic due to the characters' trauma and insecurities.\n   - The MC’s tendency to \"kiss and ghost\" causes emotional pain for the FC, but their connection deepens as they navigate their struggles together.\n   - The eventual happy ending (HEA) feels earned after a year of challenges, mistakes, and growth.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**\n   - The story explores heavy themes like family trauma, abuse, addiction, and the struggle for self-worth.\n   - It portrays the realistic struggles of young adults dealing with unresolved family issues while trying to build their own lives.\n   - The narrative emphasizes resilience and the idea of \"through the fire we become iron,\" showing how the characters grow stronger through adversity.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot is complex and spans a year, with numerous subplots and unexpected twists.\n   - The story includes elements like stalking, harassment, physical fights, and a secret college society, which add layers of drama and tension.\n   - While the pacing can feel overwhelming at times due to the sheer volume of challenges the characters face, it ultimately contributes to the realism of their journey.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**\n   - The writing is emotionally charged and immersive, drawing the reader into the characters' struggles and triumphs.\n   - The tone balances the heavy themes with moments of humor and warmth, particularly through the secondary characters and the \"found family\" dynamic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a deeply moving and realistic college romance that delves into the complexities of trauma, growth, and love. The characters are flawed and relatable, and their journey is both heartbreaking and inspiring. While the story is filled with challenges and emotional turmoil, it ultimately delivers a satisfying and romantic ending. The secondary characters and subplots add richness to the narrative, making it a compelling read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.5 stars"

            "I devoured this book in just one day and I'm thoroughly hooked on the series. The last 15% caught me off guard; while it felt somewhat unnecessary given everything that had already transpired, it did steer the plot in a direction I enjoyed. Ultimately, I found it quite satisfying.",
            "Scottie is a good girl stuck in a two-year relationship with her undesirable boyfriend until she unexpectedly tumbles into Finn's life, sparking an interesting turn of events. I appreciated how she stood up for herself and recognized her worth. Finn, the quintessential bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks, struggles with their connection, believing he isn't good enough for Scottie. Their romance is a slow burn filled with ups and downs that sometimes left me wanting to shake both characters. Despite this, the pacing felt quick for the length, and I thoroughly enjoyed their dynamic and the camaraderie of their friend group. However, Blake—who shines as a secondary character—completely stole the show for me. I am absolutely FERAL for his upcoming story and can't wait to read it!",
            "This story diverges from the author's typical lighthearted romances, offering a grittier, more angst-filled narrative. The bad boy meets good girl trope is compelling, and I was fully engaged throughout.",
            "I’m completely immersed in Finn Hayes—it's hard to imagine ever coming back to the surface. I formed a strong connection with both Scottie and Finn, and although I had a few minor frustrations, they didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment of their story."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this novel was a deeply engaging and entertaining read, filled with drama, emotional depth, and well-developed characters. While the last portion of the book felt slightly unnecessary, it still contributed to the plot in a meaningful way. The slow-burn romance between Scottie and Finn, along with the dynamic secondary characters, made for a compelling story that left me eagerly anticipating more.",

The romantic tension between Finn and Scottie, who is also grappling with her own challenges, becomes a central theme. Ace, the extroverted billionaire’s son, adds another layer of complexity to the narrative. The book concludes with a tragedy that leaves the future of Finn and Scottie’s relationship uncertain, building anticipation for the next installments.

Meanwhile, Scottie's character arc lacks consistency. Initially, she is depicted as a doormat for her abusive boyfriend but suddenly has an epiphany. However, she later struggles to identify the sender of personal messages. Scottie's inclination to play the victim and her guilt over family dynamics make her actions seem more befitting an older sibling than a younger one."

            "The book's drama often felt excessive, and eliminating a plot point or two could have tightened the narrative. Its length was unwarranted, and the twist involving Scottie at the end seemed unnecessary, adding undue hardship to her character. Ultimately, the conclusion didn’t provide a genuine Happily Ever After (HEA) for Finn and Scottie; their relationship felt unresolved, leaving it more like a Happily Ever After For Now. This lack of resolution affected my overall enjoyment of the story.",
            "I found myself more engaged with the side characters, like Ace, Thatch, and an older Lexie, than with the main characters, Finn and Scottie. Ace was particularly hilarious, and I appreciated the presence of familiar faces. However, I was frustrated by Finn and Scottie's decision-making. While their upbringing and college environment might shed light on some of their choices, I struggled to understand why Scottie kept her texts and situation a secret when she had friends who could have offered support."

However, his plans take an unexpected turn when he falls for Scottie Bardeaux, a cheerleader dealing with her own challenges. Scottie is at Dickson on a cheerleading scholarship, but she’s accompanied by her possessive high school boyfriend, who quickly reveals his true nature.

Their story unfolds with a blend of emotion, heartbreak, wit, and drama, featuring significant highs and profound lows. As they navigate a tumultuous freshman year, their strong friendships provide the support they need to face life's challenges.",

            "If you’re a fan of new adult standalone romances featuring dual perspectives and intense first-love dynamics, this story is perfect for you. It tells the tale of a cheerleader virgin who meets a tortured bad boy, embodying the classic grumpy/sunshine opposites attract trope. The protagonist fights for their love—literally. \n\nThe narrative is packed with college drama, humor, and witty banter, all wrapped in a layer of angst and tension. With plenty of secrets and unexpected twists, this story will keep you on the edge of your seat. Prepare for a captivating journey that you won’t see coming!",
            "The author is spot on when they describe this book as filled with drama and angst. The emotional intensity is impressive, and I was completely engaged. Scottie and Finn endure significant hardships, and we experience their trauma alongside them. The story's most pivotal moment occurs at the end when Scottie suffers a cheerleading accident that leaves her paralyzed from the waist down. This shocking twist was both sad and tragic to read. Initially, I hoped the authors would tie it all up with a miraculous healing, as much as I love a feel-good romance. However, I appreciated that they chose not to go that route. Instead, Scottie demonstrates resilience and embarks on a new path in life, embracing her circumstances rather than succumbing to despair. This unique portrayal is refreshing, as many books don’t address such situations authentically. I also admired that the narrative steers clear of framing her injury as an endpoint, which would be a disservice to real-life experiences of those who have faced similar challenges."

        "conclusion": "This book was a rollercoaster of emotions, blending humor, drama, and heartfelt moments seamlessly. The characters, both main and side, were incredibly well-developed, and the found family dynamic was a highlight. The ending was unexpected and handled with care, making it a standout read.",

I seriously want to go back and read about all the cameo characters from this one!  \n\n- **Drama and Emotional Depth:**  \n  When the author says this book has a lot of drama and angst, they are not lying. The drama is top-notch, and I am here for it. Scottie and Finn are put through the ringer—life has not been kind to them in many ways, and we journey through all that trauma with them.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I love a book where not only the main characters draw me in but the side characters as well. Yes, I loved Scottie and Finn's relationship, but we also get Ace, Finn, Blake, Julia, Kayla, and Scottie. Not to mention them as a group. The dynamic between them had some of my favorite found family vibes. They love each other, look out for each other, and it was such a joy to read!  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book is a thick one, but it’s worth the read.  \n\n- **Ending and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The heaviest moment comes at the end when Scottie has a cheerleading accident and is paralyzed from the waist down. This was a shocker for me and honestly so sad and tragic to read. I had a moment where I felt like the authors might wrap it up in a neat little bow and have her magically heal and walk again. As much as I love a romance where everything just magically works out, I love that they didn't go this route. Instead, Scottie perseveres and finds her new path in life without being able to walk. It was unique to me, as I don’t feel books usually handle this kind of situation. I also loved how they didn’t make it into a negative \"my life is over\" thing, which I think would be a disservice to those who have gone through something like this.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  You'll love this if you enjoy:  \n  💗 New adult standalone romance  \n  ✌🏼 Dual POV  \n  💌 Intense first love vibes  \n  📣 Cheerleader virgin meets the tortured bad boy  \n  ☀️ Grumpy/Sunshine, opposites attract  \n  🥊 He FIGHTS for her. Literally.  \n  🏫 College DRAMAAAA  \n  😂 FUNNY  \n  👅 BANTER  \n  🔥 ANGST & loads of tension  \n  🔑 Secrets  \n  🌪️ Twists & turns (you will NOT see coming)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a rollercoaster of emotions, blending humor, drama, and heartfelt moments seamlessly. The characters, both main and side, were incredibly well-developed, and the found family dynamic was a highlight. The ending was unexpected and handled with care, making it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I admire Finn's protective nature and his genuine desire for Scottie's well-being. Meanwhile, Scottie struggles to guard her heart as her feelings for him grow harder to conceal. Their flirtation is charming, though they often hesitate to express their emotions, yet the chemistry between them is undeniable. They come to understand that they deserve a fair chance at love.

It transcends mere romance, focusing on personal growth and the challenges of life. While the length of the story is generally a strength, everything after Chapter 78 felt excessive and dragged on. Some elements, like the pranks involving Ace’s family, were exaggerated and hard to believe. The unexpected ending showcased the authors' skill in crafting a plot twist, but I felt both readers and characters deserved a more satisfying resolution after such an emotional journey.

Scottie, a cheerleader from an elite private school, breaks stereotypes and reveals surprising depth. The secondary characters, including their friends, add a delightful mix of humor and warmth, creating a vibrant chosen family dynamic.

I found the less dramatic version of the secret society refreshing, fun, and exciting. The drama and angst are very college-age appropriate, not overdone, and cover important topics.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Scottie and Finn are very likable protagonists. I love how Finn’s goals change and how he evolves from his no-attachment/relationship attitude. Scottie defies stereotypes—she’s a cheerleader from an exclusive private school, but there’s much more depth to her character. The secondary characters, including Scottie and Finn’s friends, are fantastic. They bring laughter, chosen family vibes, and big personalities that are easy to love. The older, secondary characters are also hilarious and zany, even if you’re not familiar with them from prior books.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is engaging and full. Scottie and Finn are immediately attracted to each other, but obstacles and drama keep getting in their way. The drama involves some very unlikable characters who bring tension and pain, but I love how these situations are handled. Towards the end, there’s a plot surprise that had me tearing up and feeling very emotional.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Originality:**  \n  The story is so different from this author duo’s other books that I’ve read, and I loved it just as much. The ending was perfect, and I can’t wait for more stories from these characters and their world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis New Adult college romance is a refreshing and engaging read with well-developed characters, appropriate drama, and a surprising emotional depth.

            "I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of Finley Hayes. He may not be a typical bad boy, but rather a young man facing significant challenges due to his family background. The author has crafted exceptional characters in Finnley and Scottie Bardeaux. Scottie is a standout, and I appreciated the slow-burn attraction between her and Finn. Ace and Blake provide comic relief, with Ace serving as Finn’s humorous foil and voice of reason. Julia and Kayla are also endearing, and I sense a budding connection between Julia and Ace. The romance between Finn and Scottie unfolds at a perfect pace, balancing just the right amount of angst to keep it engaging without becoming frustrating. The family dynamics are relatable, highlighting the contrast between a family lacking love and support and one that is deeply connected. This contrast enriches Finn and Scottie’s understanding of each other.

However, there were moments when I wished I could impart some wisdom to them, though their friends and family often stepped in to provide support.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The inclusion of characters from past books, like Ace (Cassie and Thatch's child) and Julia (Georgia and Kline's child), added depth and familiarity. Lexi Winslow was another fun addition, and I also enjoyed meeting the new characters.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book felt a bit too long, and I thought it could have wrapped up sooner. The last 30% of the story was particularly shocking, and I’m not sure if all of it was necessary for the characters' arcs.  \n\n- **Setting and Authenticity:**  \n  While the college setting was enjoyable, there were moments when it felt more like high school, which slightly detracted from the authenticity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this start to the series. Despite some pacing issues and occasional lapses in setting authenticity, the engaging drama, strong character development, and Max Monroe's signature humor made it a fun and emotional read. I’m excited to see where the series goes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I appreciated the gradual development of the romance between Finn and Stevie; their connection deepens over time rather than blossoming instantly. The steamy scenes are well-crafted, adding depth to their relationship. Although the book presents a steep learning curve at first, it imparts valuable lessons about perseverance and hard work. The pacing is well-balanced, allowing both the romance and character dynamics to unfold naturally.",

Stevie is a relatable and likable heroine, and I enjoyed watching her relationship with Finn evolve. Ace, Finn’s roommate and Thatcher Kelly’s son, stood out with his humor and depth, enhancing the story. The inclusion of second-generation characters from previous works was a delightful nod for fans of the author. The romance features a captivating mix of grump x sunshine dynamics, a protective hero, and engaging open-door scenes. Finn’s determination to fight for Stevie and shield her from her ex added emotional weight to their relationship. The dual POVs offered a well-rounded view of both characters’ thoughts and feelings."

His presence added humor and depth to the story.  \n  - The inclusion of second-generation characters from previous books was a delightful touch, especially for fans of the series.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  - The romance is a mix of grump x sunshine, protective hero, and open-door scenes, which I found engaging.  \n  - Finn’s determination to fight for Stevie and protect her from her ex added emotional weight to their relationship.  \n  - The dual POVs provided a well-rounded perspective on both characters’ thoughts and feelings.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  - The book has a steep learning curve initially, but it teaches an important lesson about perseverance and the value of hard work.  \n  - The pacing was well-balanced, allowing the romance and character dynamics to develop naturally.  \n\n- **Recommendations and Context:**  \n  - While the book can be read as a standalone, I recommend reading *The Redo* and *Banking the Billionaire* to better understand the characters and their backgrounds.  \n  - This book is perfect for fans of college romance, new adult romance, and stories with hilarious side characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed this book! The gradual development of Finn and Stevie’s relationship, the steamy scenes, and the inclusion of beloved second-generation characters made it a memorable read. Ace’s humor and Finn’s protective nature were highlights, and the dual POVs added depth to the story. While it can stand alone, reading the previous books in the series enhances the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance in this story had some truly memorable moments. While I generally enjoy back-and-forth dynamics, this book pushed my limits a bit. A standout line for me was: *I love you, Scottie. Confidently and completely and with the knowledge that my love is worth something.* \n\n**Finn (MMC):** He’s broody, a bit emo, and a loner—qualities I typically love. However, there were some plot holes regarding his character, such as his inexplicable fighting skills despite lacking training. Still, I could overlook these issues given his character type. \n\n**FMC:** She was sweet but largely forgettable, defined mainly by being a virgin, having a jerk of an ex-boyfriend, and being a cheerleader. \n\n**Side Characters:** The numerous connections to other stories were a bit confusing, especially since I’ve only read one other book by the authors. A particularly uncomfortable moment occurred when Ace’s mom (Finn’s roommate and presumably a future MMC) flirted with Finn early on. This felt odd, especially after discovering she was the FMC in a previous book.",
            "The book is filled with drama, though some elements come across as unrealistic. One reviewer aptly likened its tone to the lightheartedness of 2000s teen shows and movies, which captures the essence perfectly.",

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book delivered the new adult/college vibe I was looking for, with plenty of drama and a romance that had its highs and lows. While some aspects, like the FMC’s lack of depth and certain plot holes, were drawbacks, the broody MMC and the promise of an interesting story kept me engaged. I’ll likely return for more, despite the occasional discomfort with the interconnectedness.",

The story is fantastic and totally worth checking out.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really enjoyed Finn and Scottie and how they acted their age. They complemented each other well and were there for one another.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics:**  \n  The heavy and sensitive subjects were handled well, though readers should be mindful of trigger warnings for issues like domestic violence.  \n\n- **Cameos and Connections:**  \n  The cameos of other characters, especially the Winslow brothers, were lovely and added a fun element to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is that I didn’t think Scottie deserved the third-act pain, even though it was handled well. Both she and Finn had already been through a lot by that point.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was one of my highly anticipated reads of August, and it did not disappoint! Despite a minor issue with the third-act conflict, the story is engaging, well-written, and features strong character dynamics. The cameos and handling of sensitive topics added depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5 stars"

            "This book captures the lively antics of college freshmen, blending a fantastical world with the harsh realities of life. Amidst the chaos, themes of true love emerge, and justice prevails as the villains receive their comeuppance.",

One of the main characters attempts to shock his half-brother, who is unaware that their father has another family. The wealthy kids enjoy a privileged life, while the less fortunate seem eager to benefit from their abundance.",

The trope of \"we're drawn to each other, but I'm a bad guy, so I must push her away\" was particularly off-putting. While the storyline of Finn choosing a college to confront his half-brother, a professor, had potential, it was marred by illogical character actions. The female protagonist's decision to snoop and steal Finn’s note felt contrived and frustrating, ultimately breaking my immersion in the story.",

The stark contrast between Finn's impoverished upbringing and his half-brother's privileged life feels forced and unconvincing.",

Finn Hayes, the brooding bad boy, and Scottie, the determined cheerleader, are both well-developed and multi-dimensional. Their chemistry sizzles from the start, and their push-and-pull dynamic keeps readers invested. The side characters also shine, enhancing the narrative and embodying the found family trope beautifully.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  While the story is compelling, the pacing occasionally falters. Some scenes drag on, while pivotal moments feel abruptly cut short, leaving a desire for more depth in the storytelling. The underground society plotline adds a thrilling element but leans into melodrama at times, which can pull readers out of the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The vibrant halls of Dickson University serve as a fitting backdrop for this college romance. The setting feels alive and contributes to the overall atmosphere of the story. The inclusion of familiar faces from Monroe's previous series adds an extra layer of excitement for returning readers.  \n\n- **Tone and Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is rich and humorous, balancing the heavier themes with moments of levity. The tone is consistent, blending angst, humor, and chaos effectively to create a compelling narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Learning Curves* is a compelling read for fans of college romance, offering emotional depth, well-developed characters, and a character-driven plot. Despite some pacing issues and occasional melodrama, the novel’s strengths outweigh its flaws, leaving readers eager for the next installment in the series. If you enjoy slow-burn romances filled with angst, humor, and a touch of chaos, this book is worth picking up!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 Stars  \n\n**Trigger Warnings:**  \nAlcoholic family members, revenge porn, and physical abuse."

            "The story introduces Finn, the younger half-brother of the Winslows, who becomes Ace Kelly’s roommate during freshman year. Finn’s captivating personality, loyalty, and mischievousness reflect those of his father, Thatcher, which quickly forges a strong friendship between him and Ace. We also meet Julia, Ace’s best friend and the daughter of Kline and Georgia Brooks, who appears poised to become the future female lead in a friends-to-lovers narrative. Additionally, we encounter Lexi, the autistic daughter of Winnie Winslow and Wes Lancaster, who shows little interest in Blake Boden, the star quarterback of Dickson U, hinting that their story may be the next in the series.",
            "The book explores serious themes such as physical abuse, alcoholism, sexual harassment, and the impact of the Winslow family's deadbeat father abandoning them in childhood. While these topics add depth to the narrative, they represent a shift from the lighter tone of the author's earlier works.",
            "I anticipated this first book to be as funny, irreverent, and sexy as the original. However, I was taken aback by its emotional depth. This isn't a criticism, but rather a heads-up that the writing duo has shifted from their lighthearted style, a change that began with their previous book, *What I Should’ve Said*."

        "conclusion": "Despite a few curveballs, I found this book highly enjoyable and appreciated the emotional depth and character development. The shift to more serious themes was unexpected but well-executed, and the intergenerational dynamics added a rich layer to the story. Highly recommended.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Tone and Emotional Depth:**  \n  I expected this first book in the Billionaire Bad Boys next generation series to be as funny, irreverent, and sexy as the original. However, I was surprised by how emotionally heavy it became. This isn’t a criticism but more of a heads-up that the writing duo Max Monroe seems to have shifted away from their lighthearted fare, which started with their last book, *What I Should’ve Said*.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The story introduces Finn, the much younger half-brother to the Winslows, who becomes Ace Kelly’s freshman year roommate. Finn’s captivating personality, loyalty, and mischievousness mirror his dad Thatcher’s, making it easy to see why he and Ace become fast friends. We also get to know Julia, Ace’s best friend and the daughter of Kline and Georgia Brooks, who seems set up as the future female lead in a friends-to-lovers story. Additionally, we see Lexi, Winnie Winslow and Wes Lancaster’s autistic daughter, who doesn’t give the Dickson U star quarterback, Blake Boden, the time of day (their story is hinted to be the next in the series).  \n\n- **Themes and Serious Topics:**  \n  The book delves into some serious topics, including physical abuse, alcoholism, sexual harassment, and the fallout from the Winslow’s deadbeat dad abandoning them as kids. These themes add depth to the story, though they mark a departure from the lighter tone of earlier works.  \n\n- **Intergenerational Dynamics:**  \n  I really enjoyed seeing the older generation as parents. Despite being only 18 when the story begins, both Scottie and Finn had troubled childhoods that forced them to mature quickly. This hard-fought maturity made their journey toward a happily ever after believable and satisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a few curveballs, I found this book highly enjoyable and appreciated the emotional depth and character development. The shift to more serious themes was unexpected but well-executed, and the intergenerational dynamics added a rich layer to the story. Highly recommended.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was primarily a push-pull dynamic without much emotional development or connection between the characters.  \n\n- **Pop Culture References:**  \n  I appreciated the mention of *One Tree Hill*, as it added a relatable and nostalgic touch to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The ending felt poorly placed.
