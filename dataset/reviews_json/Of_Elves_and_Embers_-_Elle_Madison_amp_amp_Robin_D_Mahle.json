There were several places in the story that I’d love to visit myself.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book was full of twists and turns, keeping me engaged from start to finish.

I’m leaving this review voluntarily, and my opinion on this book is entirely my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a fantastic blend of dark fantasy and romance, with well-developed characters, an engaging magic system, and immersive world-building.

            "The pacing in the first half of the book felt slow, and the reincarnation element sometimes made developments feel automatic, hindering natural progression and character depth. However, the story remains compelling and is part of a larger, well-crafted narrative.",
            "ElBin's talent for storytelling and character creation is truly remarkable. In *Of Elves and Embers*, the characters are distinct and endearing, with Celani, Kallius, and Leander quickly becoming favorites. The animal companions also shine, particularly the dynamic duo of Ember and Hadeon, who add depth to the narrative.",
            "The book is marketed as darker and spicier than the author's previous works, yet it feels similar in tone and is milder than many popular fantasy novels. The spice level is manageable, allowing readers who prefer less intensity to easily skim those scenes without losing track of the storyline.",
            "This book is part of a multi-author collaboration and can be enjoyed on its own; however, reading the entire series, ideally in publication order, would enrich the worldbuilding and depth. The shared history, intriguing prophecy, and overarching themes feel somewhat underexplored in this standalone format, leaving me eager for more. While the prologue, flashbacks, and references to previous events offer some insight, they don't completely satisfy my curiosity about the larger world."

While the pacing and reincarnation aspect could have been better executed, the story remains enjoyable and leaves me eager to explore the larger universe. It’s a great choice for fans of portal fantasy, though readers should be aware that the darkness and spice levels are milder than advertised.",

Although it stands alone, I recommend reading books 1-4 first to fully appreciate the cameos and context. The plot kicks off with Ember's kidnapping from a Vegas casino, which, while less traumatic than in previous installments, quickly escalates as she enters Moon Court territory.",
            "The characters, particularly Ember and King Hadeon, are richly developed, with side characters also receiving thoughtful attention. Their roles in Ember's life are explored both before and after pivotal events. Hadeon's anger serves as a central theme, yet his love for Ember shines through, making his emotions relatable and well-articulated, which adds depth to his character. Ember undergoes significant growth, learning from her past mistakes, ultimately leading to a satisfying resolution in her relationship with Hadeon.",
            "The fantasy world is vividly crafted, featuring unique elements such as rival elven courts and enchanting magical creatures. The addition of two delightful animal sidekicks—a flaming cat/griffon/bird hybrid and a moonlight-portaling Cerberus—infuses the story with charm and whimsy.",

            "The story unfolds at a brisk pace, though the extensive worldbuilding occasionally slows the momentum. Action abounds, keeping the narrative engaging throughout. The ending is satisfying yet leaves the door open for further adventures with Ember and Hadeon, and I would eagerly welcome a sequel, especially if the main characters return.\n\nThe tale begins with Ember winning an all-expenses-paid trip to Vegas with her friends. While at the Fairy Bar, she is unexpectedly transported to a new world, where she is recognized as the reincarnation of Phaedra, a woman who made a pact with the Shadow King, Hadeon. Ember must step into Phaedra’s shoes, collaborating with Hadeon to fulfill a prophecy and confront a looming evil. The plot features battles against wraiths and various challenges, as Ember gradually uncovers Phaedra’s memories and adopts her traits. Additionally, the story delves into Ember’s life in Vegas and her evolving relationships in this unfamiliar realm.",
            "The character development in this book is a standout feature. Both the main characters, Ember and Hadeon, as well as side characters like Nyx (the Cerberus) and Celani, are well-crafted and engaging. Ember’s journey to reclaim Phaedra’s memories is particularly compelling.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story begins with Ember winning a fully paid holiday to Vegas with her friends. While at the Fairy Bar, she is suddenly transported to a new world where she is seen as the reincarnation of Phaedra, a woman who struck a bargain with the Shadow King, Hadeon. Ember is forced to step into Phaedra’s role and work with Hadeon to fulfill a prophecy and defeat a great evil. The plot involves battling wraiths and overcoming various obstacles, with Ember gradually retrieving Phaedra’s memories and adopting her traits. The story also explores Ember’s life in Vegas and her relationships in this new world.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is quite heavy, which made the book feel longer than it actually was. While this slowed the pacing at times, it didn’t detract from the overall enjoyment. The detailed setting and lore added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character development was a standout aspect of the book. Both the main characters, Ember and Hadeon, and the side characters, such as Nyx (the Cerberus) and Celani, were well-developed and engaging. Ember’s transformation as she retrieves Phaedra’s memories was particularly compelling.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers trope between Ember and Hadeon was executed well, with their relationship evolving naturally over time. The development of their bond was a highlight of the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Action:**  \n  The story was fast-paced in terms of the plotline, though the extensive worldbuilding made it feel slower at times. There was plenty of action, keeping the narrative engaging.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance included some spice but was not overwhelming, which I appreciated. The balance between action, worldbuilding, and romance was well-maintained.  \n\n- **Ending and Potential for Sequel:**  \n  The ending felt satisfying but left room for more stories involving Ember and Hadeon. I would gladly read a sequel, especially if Nyx and Celani remain part of the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an engaging and well-crafted novel with strong character development, a compelling enemies-to-lovers romance, and intricate worldbuilding. While the pacing felt slower due to the detailed setting, the action and plot kept me hooked. The ending left me hopeful for a sequel, and I would love to see more of Ember, Hadeon, Nyx, and Celani in future books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The novel is a fast-paced fantasy with an enemies-to-lovers and fated mates trope. The story begins with Ember going on a holiday to Vegas with her friends, where they end up in a Fairy Bar. She is then transported to a different world through a moongate, setting the stage for the main plot. The narrative involves Ember and Hadeon, the Shadow King, who initially can’t stand each other but must work together to defeat evil and fulfill a prophecy.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is immersive and well-crafted. The shared world from the Forgotten Kingdoms is vividly described, and the introduction of elements like the moongate and the Fairy Bar adds depth to the setting. The concept of elves believing Ember is a reincarnated princess and her receiving dreams from another life further enriches the world.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are compelling and well-developed. Ember and Hadeon’s dynamic evolves from animosity to cooperation, which is engaging to follow. Supporting characters like Elle, Robin, Cerebus Nyx, and Celani add layers to the story and are memorable in their own right.  \n\n- **Writing and Authorship:**  \n  Elle and Robin are new authors, and their storytelling shows promise. The narrative is engaging, and the blend of fantasy, romance, and adventure is well-executed. I look forward to reading more of their work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis standalone fantasy novel offers a captivating blend of fast-paced action, intricate world-building, and well-developed characters. The enemies-to-lovers trope, combined with the fated mates theme, adds emotional depth to the story. The authors, Elle and Robin, have crafted an engaging tale that leaves readers eager for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Ember's carefree girls' weekend in Vegas takes a dark turn when she is drugged and transported through a portal to an Elven realm. There, she becomes a captive of a Moon Elf and discovers that she is the reincarnation of Phaedra, a Sun Elf who sacrificed herself for the greater good. The threat that Phaedra once faced still looms, and Ember, alongside Hadeon, must unite to protect everything they cherish.",
            "I absolutely adore everything I've read by Robin D. Mahle, and this story is no exception. In \"Shadow Daddy,\" Hadeon, the Elf King, wields shadows to delightfully torment Ember. The dynamic of \"One Bed and One Baztet\" adds a playful twist, filled with snark and humor. The tender moments between the male and female leads are truly heartwarming.",
            "**Review: Fairy Tale Retelling**  \nThis story offers a fresh twist on the Hades and Persephone myth, cleverly hinted at by the character name Hadeon and directly referenced by Ember herself. The animal companions are a highlight; I absolutely adore the giant shadow Cerberus, Nyx, and I'm captivated by the fire-cat-griffin, Ahvi. If anyone creates fan art of him, I would love to see it!"

Mahle that I’ve read, and this is no exception.  \n\n- **Romantic and Physical Elements:**  \n  This book is more physical than the other books I’ve read by the authors. Not gratuitously so, but the sex is there for those who might be interested (in reading it or avoiding it, I don’t judge).  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  Ember was just out for a free girls’ weekend in Vegas when she was drugged and led through a portal into another world. In the Elven land, she finds herself captive to a Moon Elf and learns that she is the reincarnation of Phaedra, a Sun Elf who sacrificed herself to save others. What Phaedra died for is still present, and Hadeon and Ember will need each other if they’re going to save everything they hold dear.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  This book has all my favorites:  \n  - Fairy Tale Retelling ✔️ This is a pseudo-twist on Hades and Persephone (if the character name Hadeon didn’t give that away, Ember herself comes up with the comparison within the story).  \n  - Animal Companion(s) ✔️ I adore the giant shadow Cerberus, Nyx, and am so intrigued by the fire-cat-griffin feraline Ahvi. If someone does fan art of him, I want to see it.  \n  - Shadow Daddy ✔️ Hadeon is literally an Elf King who controls shadows… and who uses them to torment Ember oh-so-delightfully.  \n  - One Bed and One Baztet (Flying Mount) ✔️ Need I say more?  \n  - Snark! ✔️ And such sweet, tender moments between the MMC and the FMC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is another fantastic addition to Elle Madison and Robin D. Mahle’s works. It combines a captivating plot, beloved tropes, and a touch of physical romance, making it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "This book offers a delightful and quick read, beginning with Ember in Las Vegas before she is whisked away to the enchanting land of Aelvaria. The narrative centers on Ember's journey of self-discovery as she learns she is the reincarnated Fire-Elf princess Phaedra, and her evolving relationship with Hadeon, the king of the Court of Moon and Stars. While the antagonist lacks depth, making the reveal somewhat anticlimactic, the romance remains the heart of the story.",
            "Ember begins as a typical \"not like other girls\" character, which can be off-putting at first, but this phase quickly fades after about 30 pages. Hadeon's initial coldness is revealed to be a coping mechanism for his fears, adding depth to his character. The relationship between Ember and Hadeon is well-developed, resembling a second-chance romance as they confront past issues and grow together. The side characters are also endearing and lovable.",
            "The book showcases the author's signature wit and humor, delivering engaging banter throughout. The spice level is mild, employing vague language and metaphors to depict intimate scenes.",
            "This book is not a dark romance or particularly spicy, which may differ from its marketing. However, it will resonate with fans of *A Fate of Wrath and Flame*, *King of Battle and Blood*, and *A Kingdom of Stars and Shadows*. As a standalone fantasy romance, it effectively explores the reincarnation trope. The protagonist, Ember, navigates her current identity while grappling with memories of her past life, making for a compelling narrative."

        "conclusion": "This standalone fantasy romance is a fast-paced, enjoyable read with a well-executed reincarnation trope. While the antagonist feels underdeveloped, the focus on the evolving relationship between Ember and Hadeon, along with the humor and banter, makes the book engaging. The mild spice level and character growth add to its charm, though it may not meet the expectations of readers seeking a darker or spicier romance.",

            "Ember is a stubborn and fiery character whose personality intensifies as the story unfolds. Her endearing connection with animals, collecting them like Pokémon, sparked a bit of jealousy in me as she brings them home. Flashbacks to her childhood reveal her spirited nature, which has beautifully evolved over time. Her deep bonds with family and friends add emotional depth beyond her romantic relationships. Celani and Leander shine as standout side characters, nearly stealing the spotlight, but Nyxx truly steals the show. This lovable pup, reminiscent of my late dog, often brought me to tears, deserving all the head pats and treats.",
            "This story is rich in angst, features captivating world-building, and introduces engaging characters. It beautifully weaves together the themes of soulmates and portal fantasy—two of my favorite tropes. It evokes memories of *The Rose Bride* by Tati B. Alvarez, *Spindle of Sin* by Candace Robison, and *A Court of Mist and Fury* by Sarah J. Maas. I particularly appreciate that it functions as a standalone series with an overarching plot, which I find delightful."

Their previous works set high expectations, and this book did not disappoint.  \n\n- **Spice Level and Content:**  \n  This book is spicier than their previous ones, but it’s not overdone or overly explicit.

Additionally, the world of Terrea feels disjointed, as the various kingdoms appear oblivious to the common threats they face, especially from the wraiths.",

Ember’s family’s resentment toward her pairing with Hadeon seems trivial in the face of an existential threat.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Consistency and Logic:**  \n  - The repeated pattern of women reluctantly accepting free trips to Vegas and being abducted from the same bar feels repetitive.  \n  - It’s puzzling how the same portal manages to send the women to different realms without any supernatural collisions.  \n  - The world of Terrea lacks cohesion, as the various kingdoms seem unaware of the shared dangers they face, particularly from the wraiths.  \n\n- **World-Building and Terminology:**  \n  - The use of the term \"isos\" for magic feels unnecessary and confusing.  \n  - The world-building could be stronger, as the lack of awareness and unity among the kingdoms undermines the stakes of the story.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n  - The interaction between Ivy and Ember is limited and appears to be reluctantly allowed, which feels underdeveloped.  \n  - Ember’s family’s resentment toward her pairing with Hadeon seems trivial compared to the existential threat of annihilation.  \n  - Hadeon’s character is more nuanced in this installment, as he doesn’t hate Ember but resents her earlier death and fears losing her again.  \n  - Ember regains her memory faster than previous female characters, which adds a slight variation to the recurring amnesia trope.  \n\n- **Series Repetition and Enjoyment:**  \n  - While the stories are enjoyable, the similarities between the books reduce the overall excitement. A greater variety in plot and character arcs would enhance the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis fifth installment in the series follows a familiar pattern, with repetitive elements like the abductions and amnesia tropes. While the character dynamics, particularly Hadeon’s emotional conflict, add depth, the world-building and plot logic could be more cohesive. The series would benefit from fewer similarities and more innovation to keep readers engaged.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Ember, a human princess who learns she is the reincarnation of Princess Phaedra, a pivotal figure in the elven realm of Aelvaria. Against her will, Ember is taken to Aelvaria, where she must confront her true identity and the magic (isos) she wields. This fourth installment in the Forgotten Kingdom series weaves together elements of fantasy, mythology, and romance, centering on a conflict with dark creatures known as wraiths. The narrative connects seamlessly with previous books, featuring familiar characters like Ivy, Aria, and Kage. The plot is engaging and well-paced, balancing action, emotional depth, and character interactions. Tension and intrigue are skillfully maintained, ensuring a captivating reading experience as the authors create a cohesive and immersive world.",
            "Ember's character undergoes significant growth as she grapples with controlling her isos, understanding her past-life memories, and navigating her complex feelings for Hadeon. Hadeon, the Shadow King, is a conflicted figure, caught between his lingering feelings for Ember (as Phaedra) and his current resentment. Supporting characters like Celani and Kallius enrich the narrative, each contributing their unique personalities to Ember's journey. The emotional depth and relationships among the characters are well-crafted, showcasing a gradual yet satisfying evolution of feelings and memories.",
            "Aelvaria is a vividly crafted world, featuring enchanting winter landscapes, fantastical creatures, and the ever-present menace of wraiths. The integration of Greek mythology enriches the narrative, introducing unique elements that enhance the fantasy setting. The Never Court, once a flourishing realm now rendered uninhabitable, provides a compelling backdrop for the characters' quest to restore magic and vanquish the wraiths.",
            "I became deeply invested in the characters' lives, experiencing both heartbreak and joy. Ember's struggles with her identity, magic, and feelings for Hadeon evoke empathy and emotional connection. Hadeon's stubbornness and reluctance to acknowledge his feelings create frustration and anticipation, making his eventual emotional breakthrough all the more satisfying."

        "conclusion": "This book is a captivating addition to the Forgotten Kingdom series, blending fantasy, mythology, and romance into a richly woven tale. The characters are well-developed, the world-building is immersive, and the emotional depth keeps me engaged from start to finish. While Hadeon’s stubbornness may feel overdone at times, the story’s strengths far outweigh this minor flaw. Fans will appreciate the seamless integration with previous works, and newcomers will find themselves eager to explore more.",

            "The story opens with Ember winning a mysterious weekend trip to Las Vegas, which leads her to the Fairy Bar in a casino. After indulging in strong wine and mingling with strangers, she is unexpectedly transported to an Elven world. There, Ember learns she is the reincarnation of an Elven Princess, capable of wielding magic, and accompanied by an adorable Cerberus named Nyx. The plot follows her as she grapples with emerging memories, reconnects with grieving friends and family, confronts deadly enemies, and navigates a relationship with a grumpy soulmate.

After consuming strong wine and meeting strangers, she is transported to an Elven world.  \n   - Ember discovers she is the reincarnation of an Elven Princess, can wield magic, and has an adorable Cerberus named Nyx.  \n   - The plot involves her grappling with emerging memories, reconnecting with friends and family who grieved her, facing deadly enemies, and navigating a relationship with a grumpy soulmate.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n   - The Elven world is described as far beyond what Tolkien could imagine, showcasing the authors' incredible talent for creating immersive and detailed settings.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Ember and Hadeon are portrayed as deeply complex and tortured characters, constantly battling their vulnerabilities.  \n   - Supporting characters like Celani, Kallius, and Leander provide light relief and balance to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n   - The slow-burn relationship between Ember and Hadeon is described as perfection, with elements of fated mates and enemies-to-lovers tropes.  \n   - The book is noted to be spicier than the authors' usual \"fade to grey\" material, though it is compared favorably to ACOTAR in terms of steaminess.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The reader found the book easier to put down compared to other works by the authors, possibly due to the piecemeal memories and incomplete jigsaw-like narrative.  \n   - Despite this, the story was still enjoyable, with a strong focus on the overarching plot outside of the romantic scenes.  \n\n- **Collaboration and Series Context:**  \n   - The book is a standalone novel within the Forgotten Kingdoms series, a collaboration with multiple authors, each focusing on a different heroine.  \n   - The reader notes that while the collaboration adds depth, it also leaves some backstory and life-changing events only glimpsed, which may have impacted their connection to the story.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n   - The book features the authors' signature style of witty, sarcastic quips and a menagerie of amazing animal companions, which adds charm and humor to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Elves & Embers* is a captivating fantasy novel with rich worldbuilding, complex characters, and a slow-burn romance. While it didn’t grip the reader as intensely as previous works by the authors, it remains an enjoyable read, especially for fans of magic, fated mates, and enemies-to-lovers tropes. The collaboration aspect adds depth but also leaves some narrative threads feeling incomplete.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review."

            "The cameo by Adira from *Of Mischief and Mages* and the side quest to assist her were standout moments for me. Additionally, the revelation of Ember’s tattoos as unconscious symbols of her past life added an intriguing and creative layer to the story.",
            "In this story, the female main character, Ember, stands out for her introspective nature, grappling with the complexities of her past and present. This internal conflict adds significant depth to her character. I appreciated her intelligence and strong sense of self. In contrast, the male main character, Hadeon, is less appealing, particularly in the first half of the book, where he exhibits emotionally and verbally abusive behavior. Unfortunately, I found his character less relatable than the male leads in *Of Mischief and Mages* and *Of Dragons and Desire*.",
            "The writing is above average, a welcome change after my experience with *Of Shadows and Fae*. However, the pacing is uneven, featuring lengthy training and cooking scenes that I found tedious and skimmed through. Most of the action is concentrated in the final quarter of the book.",
            "This installment offers intriguing background on the war and prophecy that influence the current events. However, the magic system feels underdeveloped and inconsistent, with characters exhibiting random superpowers instead of a structured, race-specific system like those in *Of Dragons and Desire* and *Of Mischief and Mages*."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *Of Elves and Ember* is an okay addition to the Forgotten Kingdoms series. While it has some strong points, such as Ember’s introspective nature and the expanded background on the war and prophecy, it falls short in areas like character likability, magic system consistency, and pacing. The writing quality is above average, but the book doesn’t quite reach the level of its predecessors. I may still check out other books by the author, keeping in mind that this might be a side project rather than their best work.",

            "Ember is a strong female protagonist who learns she is the reincarnation of the fae warrior princess, Phaedra. King Hadeon, the enigmatic male lead, grapples with his attraction to Ember while trying to keep his distance. The reincarnation theme is skillfully executed, as Ember gradually uncovers memories from her past life, merging her identities. The Hades and Persephone dynamic between Hadeon and Phaedra adds depth and tension to their relationship. The supporting characters and animals enrich the narrative, making it more enjoyable. The romance unfolds as a slow burn, filled with longing and near-kisses, which I found captivating. However, the pacing in the final 25% of the book felt rushed, and the development of Ember and Hadeon's relationship could have been deeper to make their love and acceptance feel more authentic.",

The modern-day protagonist, Ember, is transported to the Court of Moon and Stars via a magical picture. While it exists within a shared universe alongside works by other authors, the story stands alone, centering on Ember and Hadeon as they navigate a smaller conflict within the elven kingdoms.",
            "The story skillfully weaves together popular tropes, including the chosen one fantasy, found family, and a “touch her and die” male main character. A standout feature is the Hades and Persephone retelling, which enriches the narrative with mythology and emotional depth."

Nyx, the adorable sidekick, was a highlight, and the plot kept me thoroughly engaged. I give this book a 5/5 and can’t wait to explore more from the Forgotten Kingdoms series!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5"

            "I absolutely loved Ember, the fierce and witty protagonist. Her snarky attitude and willingness to speak her mind to Hadeon, the brooding Elven king, made her incredibly compelling. Hadeon is the perfect blend of grumpy and attractive; his intense yet restrained demeanor, coupled with his gradual softening around Ember, creates an irresistible \"Shadow Daddy\" vibe. The tension between them is palpable, heightened by the forbidden nature of their relationship—Ember as the hostage princess and Hadeon as her captor. Their push-and-pull dynamic, slow burn, and tantalizing moments of intimacy (shadowy caresses, heated gazes, whispered confessions) kept me completely engaged. When they finally connected, it was pure fireworks! \n\nThe supporting characters are equally charming and humorous, and I particularly loved the idea of a Cerberus as a house pet. As an interconnected standalone, the book weaves together the stories of eight women seamlessly.

            "This book closely mirrors the first one I read, featuring a familiar premise of portal fantasies with female protagonists who are sacrificed women believing they are human. Their return to their realms after 50 years feels repetitive and risks becoming tedious over the course of eight books. The romance follows a predictable formula: the imposing antagonist turns out to be her mate, he forgives her, she nearly dies, and they end up sharing a bed at an inn during a storm.",
            "The characters in the story appear immature, and their development is insufficient. Ember's backstory as a street-savvy orphan is introduced but not thoroughly explored. Although she expresses feelings of being an unwanted street urchin, her past is neither convincingly portrayed nor effectively integrated into her character arc.",
            "The book was a quick read, making it easy to finish.",
            "The blending of human and fantasy worlds was handled well, though not outstanding. I appreciated Ember's natural dialogue, which steered clear of cringe-worthy modern pop culture references—a refreshing change from another recent portal fantasy I encountered."

        "conclusion": "While this book had some enjoyable elements, such as its fast pacing and natural dialogue, it suffered from repetitive tropes, underdeveloped characters, and a predictable romance. The lack of depth in Ember’s backstory and the overuse of familiar fantasy tropes held it back from being a standout read. However, it was still a decent, quick read with a touch of romance.",

While she claims to feel like an unwanted street urchin, her past wasn’t convincingly portrayed or integrated into her character arc.  \n\n- **Use of Tropes:**  \n   - The book heavily relied on familiar tropes, which, while enjoyable, felt overused in this story.  \n   - Some tropes, like the “one bed” scenario, were predictable and unnecessary in such abundance.  \n\n- **World-Building and Integration of Human and Fantasy Worlds:**  \n   - The merging of human and fantasy worlds was done adequately but not exceptionally.  \n   - I appreciated that Ember’s dialogue felt natural and avoided cringey modern pop culture references, which was a relief compared to another recent portal fantasy I read.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n   - The book was a super fast read, making it easy to get through.  \n\n- **Romantic Spice Level:**  \n   - The romance had some semi-spice, but it was tamer than expected. The open-door scenes were sparse in detail, even milder than *ACOTAR*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book had some enjoyable elements, such as its fast pacing and natural dialogue, it suffered from repetitive series tropes, underdeveloped characters, and a predictable romance.

            "This story features beloved tropes like enemies to lovers, mates, one bed, battles, magic, banter, and a happily ever after. However, the beginning was somewhat slow, and I occasionally felt confused. At times, it seemed the author had a clear vision for a scene but struggled to convey it, resulting in a jumbled narrative.",

The male main character, a brooding shadow king, also experiences significant growth throughout the narrative.

This book came with more warnings than their usual writing, and I was excited to see them branch out a bit.  \n  - Up to this point, they’ve always written fade-to-black scenes, but this story gives more on-page details, focusing more on the emotional aspect rather than the physical.  \n  - This was a great step into a new-for-them area with the magic and spice.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  - The story features a sassy FMC, and I enjoyed watching her come into her power and grow throughout the story.  \n  - The MMC is a sexy, broody shadow king, and I enjoyed his growth from beginning to end as well.  \n  - There was some decent character development for the mains, but I did find myself confused about some of the creatures and couldn’t quite picture them.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story includes tropes I love, such as enemies to lovers, mates, one bed, battles, magic, banter, and a HEA.  \n  - However, it was a bit of a slow start, and I found myself a bit confused here and there.  \n  - There were a few times where it felt like the author knew where they wanted to go with a scene but weren’t super clear on how to get there, so things felt a bit jumbled.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - There was some decent world-building, but I struggled to fully visualize some of the creatures and elements.  \n\n- **Spice Level and Romantic Elements:**  \n  - The spice level is maybe one 🌶️, focusing more on emotional intimacy than physical explicitness.  \n  - Personally, I thought it was very tastefully done and added a nice layer to the relationship. It didn’t make me uncomfortable at all.  \n  - Some readers seem to not be thrilled about the spice because they don’t usually read it, but I found it well-balanced.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  - I didn’t devour this story like I have all of their others, and it wasn’t a can’t-put-it-down situation for me this time.  \n  - This was not my favorite Elbin story, but I will continue to love them and read everything they put out!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Of Elves and Embers* wasn’t my favorite Elbin novel, I appreciated the author’s experimentation with new elements like magic and spice.

            "The book stands well on its own, but I found myself wishing for more context to enhance the world-building. While the story is cohesive, the stakes felt insufficiently engaging, focusing more on \"Ember remembers\" than on \"Ember fights a war and saves Hadeon.\" \n\nBalancing memory reconciliation with the urgency of war in over 400 pages may not have been the best approach. Some scenes, like the taco-making moment, felt extraneous and failed to connect meaningfully to the narrative or Ember's ties to Earth. The pacing struggled to harmonize the memory-driven elements with action, leaving certain plot points feeling rushed or unresolved.",
            "The integration of Ember's memories into the storyline was well-executed, but some character details felt underdeveloped. Hadeon's character, in particular, lacked depth, especially concerning his failure to save himself during the wraiths' attack. While Nyx, Ember's Cerberus, and the other fire creature were standout elements, the latter's abrupt disappearance toward the end was confusing.",
            "The world-building felt incomplete. I struggled to grasp the concept of isos, how Ember learned to stabilize them, and the source of her power. Some scenes, such as Ember's encounter with her friend (Isa or Ivy?) and the taco-making moment, seemed irrelevant or poorly integrated into the narrative. Additionally, the motivations of the wraiths and their threat to the kingdoms were unclear."

        "conclusion": "While the book had its strengths, such as the well-integrated memory sequences and the charm of Nyx and the fire creature, it fell short in fully developing its world, characters, and stakes.

Overall, it was a 3-star read for me, though I acknowledge it was an ARC and may see improvements in the final version.",

            "The story presents a battle against evil, a reincarnation arc, and a mission to save a kingdom. However, the overarching prophecy and its ties to the conflict remain muddled and unclear. While the pacing begins as a slow burn, it accelerates dramatically toward the end, resulting in a rushed conclusion.",

The side characters, particularly Nyx the Cerberus and Avhi the fire gryphon, shine with their distinct personalities and engaging interactions, enriching the narrative. The themes of found family and playful banter among the characters are well-executed and enjoyable. Ember and Hadeon's romance evolves from reluctant soulmates to lovers, but the pacing in the final 25% of the book feels rushed, undermining the slow-burn tension built earlier.

However, the overarching prophecy and its connection to the battle feel somewhat muddled and unclear.  \n  - The pacing starts as a slow burn but accelerates dramatically toward the end, making the conclusion feel rushed.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Themes:**  \n  - The worldbuilding is solid, with interesting elements like the taco-making chapter adding a unique touch.  \n  - Themes of grief, memory recovery, and found family are explored, though the execution of these themes could have been more cohesive.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  - Described as a spicy dark romance, the actual spice level is quite mild, which may not meet expectations for readers seeking a more intense experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Elves and Embers* is a standalone novel with many components I typically enjoy, such as strong characters, intriguing sidekicks, and a reincarnation arc. However, the rushed pacing in the final act, the muddled connection to the overarching prophecy, and the milder-than-expected spice level left me feeling like something was missing. While it’s a solid read, it didn’t fully come together for me compared to other works by these authors.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "Over the past year, the Ellbin authors have become my favorites. Out of the nine books I've read by them, each has received a 4 or 5-star rating. However, the ending felt somewhat anti-climactic and rushed. Certain plot points were unclear, such as how Hadeon's shadows defeated the antagonists, the reasons behind his poisoning, and Abba's role in his revival. I found myself wanting more and believe the story could have been effectively expanded into a duology.",
            "I appreciate the strong and independent heroine, which is a highlight of the story. Hadeon, the MMC, is brooding and sexy, but I found myself wishing for more witty banter and quips, reminiscent of Ellbin's other works like the Lochlann Feuds. Both Ember and Hadeon could have benefited from a bit more levity to truly win me over and leave me with a goofy grin.",
            "This story is both heart-wrenching and emotionally engaging. The authors skillfully craft a sense of found family, evoking warm, fuzzy feelings in fewer pages than many other writers."

I had high expectations, and they were absolutely met.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The story takes us to a new world, one that the main female character (FMC), Ember, was apparently part of in a previous life—though she doesn’t remember anything about it. This world is intricately tied to a prophecy where Ember and several other women sacrificed themselves to save it, leaving behind everything and everyone they loved.  \n\n- **Character Development (Main Characters):**  \n  Ember is a tough, relatable character who has always felt different and out of place. Her journey of self-discovery is compelling. Then there’s Hadeon, the “Shadow Daddy,” who is a grump with a mysterious past. His character is intriguing, and while his reasons for being gruff aren’t immediately clear, they add depth to his personality.  \n\n- **Character Development (Secondary Characters):**  \n  As usual, Elbin excels at creating memorable secondary characters.

It strikes a perfect balance, staying true to the author’s style while adding a bit more heat.  \n\n- **Creature Companions:**  \n  The inclusion of magical creatures like an adorable gryphon and a precious cerberus added so much charm to the story. I absolutely fell in love with them and wish they were real!  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I highly recommend this book and can’t wait to reread it. It’s a fantastic blend of fantasy, emotion, and romance, with all the elements I’ve come to love from Elbin’s writing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating journey filled with rich world-building, complex characters, and emotional depth.

Despite this, the reviewer appreciates the authors’ work and would still recommend the book to others, acknowledging that personal preferences may vary.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

After researching the authors, I learned they are known for closed-door romance, which explains the absence of explicit content. This book is part of a series of interconnected standalone novels. While I enjoyed the narrative, I occasionally felt there was missing backstory, though it didn't impede my understanding. I believe this book would appeal to adults who appreciate high fantasy with subtle romantic elements. The plot was well-crafted and engaging, but I would recommend it only to a specific audience."

I was anticipating spicier scenes, especially since it was flagged as mature and had a trigger warning about such content. However, the spice scenes felt lukewarm and didn’t add much to the overall story. In fact, I felt they could have been left out entirely.  \n\n- **Genre and Authorship:**  \n  After researching the authors, I discovered they are known for writing closed-door romance, which explains the lack of explicit content. This book is part of an ongoing series of interconnected standalone novels. While I enjoyed the story, I sometimes felt there was a lot of backstory missing, though it didn’t hinder my ability to follow along.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Themes:**  \n  The book leaned heavily into the \"Shadow Daddy\" vibe, but the lackluster spice scenes prevented it from fully delivering on that promise. Additionally, I wouldn’t classify this as a dark romance. While the male main character is a jerk and hurts the female main character’s feelings, he treats her well overall and is actively trying to save their kingdom.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Recommendation:**  \n  I think this would be a great book for adults who enjoy high fantasy with closed-door or vague romantic scenes. The plot was well-written and engaging, but I would only recommend it to a very specific group of readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a good, well-written book with a strong plot, but it didn’t fully meet my expectations due to the lack of spicy scenes and the mismatch between its themes and genre classification. It’s best suited for readers who prefer high fantasy with subtle romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the characters in this novel, particularly Ember and Hadeon. Their relationship was both angsty and beautiful from their first encounter, and the dynamic of one character remembering everything added a compelling layer to their connection. The side characters, such as Celani, Kallius, and Leander, were equally captivating and could easily carry their own stories. I was especially curious about the tension between Celani and Leander. Nyx also stood out as an adorable character—I definitely want to see more of her! While the romance between Ember and Hadeon was beautifully crafted, I felt the novel fell short of the spice I anticipated. It was marketed as a spicy romance, but it didn’t fully deliver in that regard. However, the spice that was present was beautifully written.",
            "The world-building in this novel is exceptional. The authors crafted a rich and immersive universe that I thoroughly enjoyed exploring. *Of Elves and Embers* is just one installment in this captivating world, and I eagerly anticipate more stories set within it.",
            "This was my first ElBin novel, and it served as an excellent introduction to their work. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, characters, and world-building. While I was slightly disappointed with the spice level, I'm eager to read more from these authors and delve deeper into this universe."

Their story was angsty and beautiful from the moment they met. The dynamic where only one of them remembers everything added a unique and compelling layer to their relationship. The side characters, like Celani, Kallius, and Leander, were equally amazing. In fact, they could easily have their own books!

Nyx was also a standout character—she’s absolutely adorable, and I need more of her!  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building in this novel was fantastic.

The writing is strong, and the dialogue is engaging.  \n\n- **Standalone Nature and Universe Connection:**  \n  This is a standalone novel in a connected universe and can be read in any order. However, the redundancy of the interconnected universe is a drawback. It feels odd that all the characters are taken from the same bar, are essentially orphans, and have no one who remembers them specifically. This repetition makes the interconnected universe feel less unique.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  Ember, the protagonist, is essentially kidnapped from the human realm and brought to a magical kingdom under attack, where magic is threatened. She has no memories of a \"past life\" or the people surrounding it. The characters, particularly the female leads across the interconnected universe, often have a chip on their shoulders and are angry with the world. Haedon's anger with Ember leads them into the \"miscommunication\" trope, which feels overused.  \n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n  The story has a strong premise, with Ember navigating a magical kingdom under threat. However, the plot falls a little short when viewed as part of the combined universe, as the recurring themes and character archetypes make it feel less fresh.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel showcases great writing and dialogue, but it struggles with redundancy and overused tropes when considered within the broader interconnected universe.

The vivid portrayal of their world added depth and immersion to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Ember’s confusion and emotional journey as she was dragged into a foreign world and told she was the soul of a past Elf, Phaedra, were compelling. The development of her relationship with Hadeon felt natural and well-paced, especially as she gained more memories. Their dynamic grew organically from both sides, making their connection believable and engaging.  \n\n- **Plot Predictability and Pacing:**  \n  While the book was fairly predictable for me, I still greatly enjoyed it. The fast-paced narrative made it difficult to put down, keeping me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was an enjoyable read with strong world-building, well-developed characters, and a gripping pace. Despite its predictability, the story was engaging and hard to put down.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The camaraderie among the characters is a major draw for me, making me return to these writers time and again. The romance stood out, striking a perfect balance between emotional depth and steamy moments.
