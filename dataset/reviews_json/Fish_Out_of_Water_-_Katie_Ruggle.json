            "The story avoids the typical third-act breakup and unnecessary drama, steering clear of clichés like the other woman or man. However, the absence of an epilogue and a lingering unresolved mystery at the end diminished the overall experience.",
            "The hero is a grumpy yet secretly soft cinnamon roll who blushes easily and is a virgin, while the heroine is quirky, lovely, and girly, often prone to rambling. She is understanding, a good sister, and perfectly complements the hero. Both characters are well-developed and likable, making the book a delight to read. Their relationship is soft, domestic, and sweet, characterized by excellent communication. The hero's endearing gestures—like making heart-shaped pancakes, watching her apply makeup, and cooking for her—add warmth to their bond. The heroine's quirkiness enhances their interactions, and the smut scenes are cute and seamlessly integrated into the story. Overall, this book is highly enjoyable.",

            "*Fish Out of Water* is a Contemporary Romance infused with a hint of mystery. The story centers on Dahlia's search for her missing sister, Rose, which brings her together with Winston. The initial setup is charming, particularly when Dahlia breaks into Winston's compound. However, the plot soon loses momentum, especially during the two-day hike, which drags on. The romance picks up around the midway point, and the final 20% of the book is enjoyable. Overall, while the beginning and end have their merits, the middle section feels tedious.",

Her plots tend to lean more toward romance, which wasn’t quite what I was looking for.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  *Fish Out of Water* is styled as a Contemporary Romance with a touch of mystery. The story revolves around Dahlia’s missing sister, Rose, which is the reason Dahlia and Winston end up together. The setup was cute, with Dahlia breaking into Winston’s compound, but the plot quickly lost its appeal for me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The book started off well, but it became boring during the two-day hike portion. Things picked up around the midway point when the romance heated up, and the last 20% of the book was fine. However, the middle section felt like a slog.  \n\n- **Characterization and POV:**  \n  This is a single POV quirky romance, which worked well enough, but I didn’t feel particularly connected to the characters.  \n\n- **Title and Cover Design:**  \n  The cover and title felt misleading. There’s no lake, no fish, and the couple is dressed for summer, even though the story takes place during a cold blizzard in Colorado. The title also teases a situation (two sleeping bags) that doesn’t play out as expected.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I can’t say I enjoyed the book overall. While the ending was decent, the middle portion dragged, and the story didn’t hold my interest consistently.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Fish Out of Water* had a promising start and a decent ending, the middle section felt slow and unengaging.

The plot takes a strange turn when she breaks into the home of a reclusive man instead of seeking help in a more reasonable manner.",

She exhibits minimal concern for her sister, scarcely mentioning her throughout the story, and remains unnervingly calm in the face of a dire situation. Her fixation on her makeup kit and the decision to give the mountain man a makeover during a snowstorm only heighten the absurdity.",

She shows little concern for her sister, barely mentioning her throughout the story, and remains remarkably calm despite the dire situation. Her obsession with her makeup kit and giving the mountain man a makeover during a snowstorm adds to the absurdity.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romantic subplot feels forced and unrealistic. The meet-cute between the protagonist and the mountain man is over-the-top, and their interactions, including him making her pancakes and worrying about her comfort, stretch believability.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing includes lengthy, unnecessary details, such as a four-page makeup tutorial in the middle of a wilderness survival scenario.

Winston, in particular, stood out as a character I couldn’t help but fall a little in love with.  \n\n- **Pacing and Relationship Development:**  \n  My main criticism is that the romance felt slightly instant-lovey, which isn’t my personal preference. I prefer relationships that have more time to develop naturally.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the pacing issue, this was a fun and enjoyable read that left me entertained.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book delivered on humor, charm, and a well-executed trope, though the romance felt a bit rushed for my taste. Overall, it was a delightful and entertaining experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The narrative kicks off with Dahlia receiving an SOS text from her sister, prompting her to venture into the mountains. She reluctantly teams up with Winston, a local hermit, through blackmail, and their adventure unfolds.

Dahlia admired his traits, and her self-perceived flaws, like being high-maintenance, were qualities he appreciated. Their dynamic was enjoyable, marked by witty banter and mutual growth. However, the romance felt forced due to the short timeframe of about five days and the lack of concern for her missing sister during their intimate moments. Despite this rushed timeline, I found their chemistry strong and their communication genuine, making the romance enjoyable. A standout moment was when Dahlia gave Winston a makeover, adding a fun, lighthearted touch to their relationship."

The pacing was uneven, the characters lacked depth, and the suspenseful elements fell flat.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

After an entire book dedicated to this quest, the discovery comes suddenly, leaving many questions unanswered. While the fast pacing keeps the story engaging, it also requires readers to suspend disbelief due to the unrealistic plot and character actions. For example, Dahliah effortlessly picks a lock, undertakes a multi-mile hike without prior experience, and experiences a magical romantic encounter despite her emotional turmoil over her sister's disappearance. Meanwhile, Winston, depicted as the ideal mountain man, inexplicably knows how to meet all of Dahliah's needs after just one meeting.

            "In a gripping tale of sisterly love and suspense, one can't help but question the protagonist's priorities—why spend time on makeup while camping when your sister is missing? With only 16 chapters, the book avoids lengthy sections, keeping the pace brisk. The action in the final 88% is thrilling, and the mystery surrounding the sister's disappearance is captivating.",

The Grumpy/Sunshine dynamic was charming and well-executed. I enjoyed the male main character, Winston, as a virgin, which added depth to his vulnerability during their exploration. However, his tendency to give four-word answers for the first 45% of the book made it difficult to believe in the authenticity of their love. I'm not a fan of instalove. The book featured one spicy scene, with the rest being closed-door flashbacks. Additionally, I found the descriptions of the townspeople—such as referring to a \"white couple\" or \"black man\"—to be unflattering and unnecessary.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Genre:**  \n  - I thought this was a really cool concept! A rom-com with action and a mystery sounded like it could be a movie.  \n  - This book had a light-hearted camping mystery with a heavy emphasis on makeup.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I loved how body and mind positive Dahlia was. It was really cool to see her owning her talents and helping everyone in the small town with their confidence.  \n  - The Grumpy/Sunshine dynamic was super adorable and done really well.  \n  - The male main character (mmc) was a virgin, and I loved being able to see his vulnerability while exploring.  \n  - However, Winston (the mmc) gave 4-word answers for the first 45% of the book, making it hard to believe their connection when they fell in love.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - If your sister is missing, why are you constantly wasting time putting makeup on when you are camping?  \n  - There were only 16 chapters in this book, and no one likes long chapters.  \n  - The action in the last 88% of the book was really cool, and I loved the mystery of looking for her sister.  \n\n- **Representation and Descriptions:**  \n  - I didn't like the description of the town people. Saying \"this white couple walking towards us\" or \"this black man\" felt really unflattering and unnecessary.  \n\n- **Romance and Spice:**  \n  - I'm not a fan of instalove.  \n  - This book had one spice scene, and the rest were closed-door look-backs.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  - This book would have benefitted from a dual point of view.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept of a rom-com with action and mystery was intriguing, the execution didn’t fully resonate with me. I appreciated Dahlia’s confidence and the Grumpy/Sunshine dynamic, but the pacing, instalove, and lack of depth in Winston’s character made it hard to fully connect.

The dynamic between the grumpy mountain man and the sunny Dahlia evoked memories of Lorelai Gilmore and Luke Danes on a camping trip.

Her high-maintenance nature was endearing and added to her charm.",

I’ve been reading a lot of books set in Minnesota lately, so I thought this one would be set there too, but it’s actually set in Colorado.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  Dahlia receives a secret SOS text from her sister, Rose, and drops everything in LA to head into the wilderness to find and potentially save her. Instead of finding her sister right away, she encounters a rugged, hot mountain man.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Chemistry:**  \n  The sexual tension in the wilderness was something I didn’t know I needed, but it definitely fueled my campfire. The dynamic between the grumpy mountain man and the sunshine-like Dahlia reminded me of Lorelai Gilmore and Luke Danes going camping.  \n\n- **Main Character (MC) Personality:**  \n  The MC gave me Finlay Donovan vibes with her silliness, but unlike Finlay, she cared about how she looked in public. While she was high-maintenance, it was in a likable way.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  The book was perfectly enjoyable! I think it deserves more attention. It’s a great read to take camping with you this summer.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  Read if you enjoy:  \n  - Fishing-themed romance (🎣The Catch).  \n  - Hiking/camping romance (🌲).  \n  - A chatty female main character paired with a silent male main character (😘).  \n  - The “he’s a virgin” trope (💜).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful mix of wilderness adventure, romantic tension, and quirky characters. The grumpy-sunshine dynamic and the high-maintenance yet likable MC made it a fun and enjoyable read. Perfect for a summer camping trip!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️💫 (3.5 stars)"

            "The story follows Dahlia as she searches for her sister in the Colorado Rockies after receiving a distressing 911 text, with Winston by her side. While the pacing is slow at first, the action accelerates dramatically toward the end. Despite the slower buildup, the narrative remains engaging and never loses my interest.",
            "Dahlia is a bubbly, sunshine character, but her preoccupation with clothes and makeup in the wilderness occasionally feels out of place and can be a bit annoying. Winston, on the other hand, is swoon-worthy and helpful, though his near-perfection makes him somewhat hard to believe, even for a romance novel. The dynamic between Dahlia and Winston is enjoyable, especially with Winston's quirky hermit persona. Their romance is sweet and low-angst, serving as a refreshing palette cleanser. Notably, Winston is a virgin while Dahlia is experienced, and there is no drama involving other romantic interests."

That said, I can see how other readers might enjoy it more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an engaging setup and some interesting characters, the choppy pacing, lack of Winston’s POV, and the unrealistic dynamics between Dahlia and Winston made it less enjoyable for me. Despite this, I recognize that it could appeal to other readers who might appreciate its adventurous tone and fast-paced narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Once I immersed myself in the story, particularly during the adventure to find Miss Sunshine's sister, it flew by. The hike to locate her sister serves as the central adventure, giving the narrative a light, almost romantic comedy feel for much of the time. However, the tone shifts to a more serious note as the story progresses. The tension between the protagonists and antagonists adds suspense, keeping me on edge about who would ultimately prevail.",

The rescue sequence is overly dramatic and implausible, with the protagonists defeating far more adversaries than seems realistic. \n\nThe romance between Dahlia and Winston feels misplaced given the story's stakes.

The male main character was a typical \"hermit\" mountain man—physically imposing, handsome, and mostly communicating in grunts.

While there was a bit of adventure and one slightly suspenseful scene at the end, it didn’t meet my expectations for a thriller or suspenseful read.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book was silly, lighthearted, and easy to read. It’s perfect for someone who enjoys soft, no-angst romcoms. However, for me, it felt empty and lacked depth. It wasn’t memorable in a good way, and I found myself wishing I had DNF’d (Did Not Finish) it early on.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters were cliché and lacked uniqueness. The MMC (Male Main Character) was a stereotypical “hermit” mountain man—physically large, handsome, and communicating mostly in grunts. The FMC (Female Main Character) was a flibbertigibbet—frivolous, excessively talkative, and overly concerned with outward appearances. Her behavior, like putting on a full face of makeup while hiking in a blizzard to save her sister, felt shallow and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was easy to follow but lacked substance. The pacing was fine for a light read, but the story didn’t leave a lasting impression. The adventure elements and the single suspenseful scene at the end weren’t enough to make up for the overall lack of tension or depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was cute and easy to read, it didn’t resonate with me. The cliché characters, lack of suspense, and shallow moments made it feel empty and forgettable. It might appeal to readers who enjoy lighthearted, no-angst romcoms, but it wasn’t what I was expecting or hoping for.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars"

The cold-weather setting and the need for shared body heat are also recurring elements. While the exact locations and antagonists differ, the overall structure and tone feel nearly identical.\n\n- **Character Parallels:**  \n  The protagonists, Dahlia and Winston, closely resemble Ellie and George from \"Gone Too Deep.\" Dahlia and Ellie are both girly girls with similar professions (clothing sales and makeup, respectively), while Winston and George share a broody, survivalist demeanor. Winston's backstory differs slightly, but the characters are largely interchangeable. If you enjoyed George, you might find Winston equally likable.\n\n- **Genre Blend:**  \n  The book attempts to blend Ruggle's signature romantic suspense with a rom-com vibe, but this effort falls short. While there are moments of humor, such as a makeover scene that stands out as particularly endearing, the overall tone feels inconsistent and doesn't fully succeed in merging the two genres.\n\n- **Originality:**  \n  The lack of originality is a notable drawback. The story feels like a rehash of \"Gone Too Deep,\" with only minor variations.

            "The pacing of the story was uneven, with excessive focus on irrelevant details and insufficient development of suspense or emotional depth. The abrupt and unsatisfying ending underscored the structural flaws. Despite the intriguing premise of a missing sister, the plot felt flat and uneventful. The journey to find her was prolonged by unnecessary encounters that contributed little to the narrative. The resolution was rushed and disappointing, culminating in an implausible twist involving a meth lab and a ransom scheme that lacked realism and logical consistency. The sister's choice to follow a stranger into the woods and investigate a suspicious building alone defied basic survival instincts. Additionally, the climax, which involved burning down a meth lab to save her, was absurd and poorly conceived.",

Her indifference towards her missing sister is jarring, making it hard to connect with her character. Additionally, her impulsive decision to do Winston’s makeup during a crisis underscores her lack of focus and maturity.",

This lack of meaningful romantic development ultimately leaves the relationship feeling hollow."

Her random decision to do Winston’s makeup in the middle of a crisis further highlighted her immaturity and lack of focus on the situation at hand.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance felt shallow and unconvincing, leaning more toward lust than genuine emotional connection. The intimate scene in the tent felt out of place, especially given the dire circumstances of a missing sister and freezing conditions. The lack of meaningful romantic development left the relationship feeling hollow.\n\n- **Realism and Logic:**  \n  The story suffered from a lack of realism and logical consistency. The sister’s decision to follow a stranger into the woods and investigate a suspicious building alone defied basic survival instincts. The climax, involving burning down a meth lab to save the sister, was absurd and poorly thought out.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was uneven, with too much time spent on irrelevant details and not enough on building suspense or emotional depth. The abrupt and unsatisfying ending further highlighted the structural issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of *Fish Out of Water* had potential, the execution fell short in almost every aspect. The lack of suspense, underdeveloped characters, shallow romance, and unrealistic plot twists made for a disappointing read. Despite my initial interest, I found the book boring and ultimately unsatisfying.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5 ⭐️"

The mystery is poorly developed and difficult to follow, culminating in an abrupt and far-fetched resolution involving a kidnapping at a meth lab near a hiking spot.",

The setup for their relationship, particularly how Dalhalia persuaded Winston to assist her, came across as forced. Additionally, the scene where the female main character takes the male main character's virginity during a makeover felt out of place, especially given the urgency of searching for her lost sister. Overall, the characters lacked depth, and their actions often seemed contrived to fit the plot rather than arising organically.",

When Dahlia's sister vanishes during what should have been a simple hike, a text containing their emergency phrase prompts Dahlia to spring into action. Realizing she can't face the wilderness alone, she enlists the help of local hermit Winston Dane as her guide. The story is a delightful blend of absurdity, adventure, and romance.",
            "I really enjoyed Dahlia's character; her mind was a chaotic yet relatable place to explore. The choice to present the story solely from her perspective, rather than the usual dual POV, worked exceptionally well. Winston, with his grumpy demeanor, would have lost some of his charm if we had been inside his head. Dahlia's deep concern for her sister and her palpable relief when Winston agreed to help her added emotional depth. Neither character anticipated a romance, but their relationship turned out to be sweet and endearing. The grumpy-sunshine dynamic was skillfully executed, and the added tent trope enhanced the overall charm of the story."

She flies to Colorado to track her sister down.  \n  - The plot thickens when Dahlia struggles to get help from the police due to their coded phrase, \"Tell Mom I said hi,\" which doesn’t convey urgency.  \n  - Dahlia breaks into the compound of Winston Dane, a local recluse and survival expert, and blackmails him into helping her.  \n  - Together, they face obstacles like wild animals, unexpected snow, and *just one tent* while retracing her sister's steps.  \n  - The tension escalates when they finally find her sister, and the situation becomes even more dangerous.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Winston Dane is described as grumpy, reclusive perfection, and his status as a virgin adds a unique layer to his character.  \n  - Dahlia is determined and resourceful, willing to go to extreme lengths to find her sister.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - This book is ideal for readers who don’t typically enjoy romantic suspense but want to dip their toes into the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fish Out of Water* is a delightful mix of humor, romance, and suspense, offering a lighter take on Katie Ruggle's usual style. With its quirky characters, engaging plot, and perfect balance of comedy and tension, it’s a great choice for both fans of Ruggle and newcomers to the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This novel masterfully blends the intrigue of a mystery with the charm of a rom-com. While a compelling mystery propels the plot, it also incorporates beloved rom-com elements, particularly the one-tent trope. The balance between romance and suspense kept me thoroughly engaged. Told from Dahlia’s perspective, the narrative is refreshingly fast-paced, with her rapid-fire thoughts adding a dynamic and relatable quality. The clues surrounding Rose’s disappearance are cleverly woven into the story, though I was so captivated by the romance that I initially overlooked them.",
            "Winston, the local hermit, may appear tough, but beneath his exterior lies a heart of gold. His act-of-service nature is evident as he insists on cooking for Dahlia and offering help in ways that aren't required. In contrast, Dahlia's optimism and joy beautifully draw out Winston's softer side, making their dynamic truly satisfying to witness.",
            "I devoured this book in two sittings, only pausing for sleep. The captivating story kept me glued to the pages, leaving me eager for more titles like this in my personal library and excited to explore the author's previous works."

            "The FMC's portrayal as a fashionista who is both smart and practical in her fashion choices was a refreshing change from the typical trope of the \"dumb blonde.\" I appreciated how she opted for stylish yet functional hiking gear, which boosted her confidence and made her feel beautiful even in the wilderness. This detail added a relatable layer to her character. As someone currently embracing the outdoors, I found this book, along with others like *Done and Dusted*, has deepened my appreciation for the one-tent or one-cabin trope.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Trope and Character Dynamics:**  \n  I’m currently in my \"roughing it in nature\" era, and this book, along with others like *Done and Dusted*, has solidified my love for the one-tent or one-cabin trope. The grumpy male lead being a writer and a hermit made his character feel believable and added depth to the story. Often, grumpy characters aren’t portrayed as recluses, so this was a refreshing take that enhanced the adventure.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The main plot, which starts with the female main character (FMC) trying to find her sister, felt like it got a bit lost halfway through. It seemed to become an afterthought, which was a bit disappointing. However, I would still love to read another book following either the FMC or her sister on another adventure.\n\n- **Character Representation:**  \n  The FMC being a fashionista who was also smart and practical about her fashion choices was refreshing. She wasn’t portrayed as dumb, which is a common trope. I loved how she bought fashionable yet functional hiking gear because it made her feel confident and pretty, even in the wilderness. This added a unique and relatable layer to her character.\n\n- **Romantic Elements and Spice:**  \n  The romantic tension and eventual spice were well-executed. The buildup was gradual, making their eventual giving in feel more believable. While I’m not sure about the logistics of intimacy in a sleeping bag (it sounds uncomfortable to me), the steam was worth the wait and added to the overall enjoyment of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable read with a unique take on the grumpy-sunshine dynamic, a refreshingly smart and fashionable FMC, and well-paced romantic tension. While the main plot could have been more consistent, the characters and their chemistry made up for it. I’d happily read more from this author or about these characters.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the plotline involving the missing sister takes a backseat to the developing romance, which feels unrealistic.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Characters:**  \n  - I absolutely loved Dahlia and Winston! I don’t think I have ever related to a FMC as much as I have with Dahlia. Her mannerisms and the things she blurts out when chatting with Winston or talking to herself are things I would totally do/say.  \n  - Winston is a grumpy hermit who shuts out the world, but Dahlia’s unfiltered comments break down his shell, and they grow closer throughout their journey.  \n  - I adored when Dahlia starts calling Winston “Wins” and he calls her “Dahl” or “Sweetheart” when it slips out.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  - The story revolves around Dahlia trying to find her missing sister, Rose, whom no one believes is actually missing. Dahlia knows her sister well and feels something is wrong.  \n  - The adventure takes them through the Colorado wilderness, adding a sense of mystery and excitement to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamic:**  \n  - The grumpy-sunshine trope is executed perfectly here. Winston is a grumpy, reclusive MMC who lets Dahlia slip under his tough exterior.  \n  - Their growing closeness and the way they support each other during their journey is heartwarming and engaging.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The book has a little bit of everything: adventure, mystery, and romance. The tone is lighthearted and fun, with moments of emotional depth.  \n  - The dialogue, especially Dahlia’s unfiltered comments, adds humor and relatability to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a delightful and engaging read with a perfect blend of adventure, mystery, and romance. The characters are relatable and endearing, and the grumpy-sunshine dynamic between Dahlia and Winston is executed beautifully. If you’re looking for a cute, adventurous book with a touch of mystery and a heartwarming romance, this is definitely one to pick up!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5 stars)  \n🌶️🌶️ (2/5 spice level)"

            "I appreciated the search and rescue element woven into the novel, which elevated it beyond a typical romance. It's a unique twist that I haven't encountered in other books, so that’s a definite plus! *Semi-spoiler alert: stop here if you haven't read the book yet.* However, I found it a bit odd that the characters declared their love after just over a week of knowing each other, especially considering they were planning to live together. Still, I can overlook that.",
            "I enjoyed the characters' internal and external dialogues. The female main character was humorously witty at just the right moments, while the male main character was grumpy and protective, revealing a surprisingly soft side.",

            "This charming grumpy-sunshine tale, one of my favorite tropes, is simply delightful.",

I thought the FMC was funny and comedic at appropriate times, and the MMC was grumpy and protective but a closeted little softie.  \n\n- **Plot and Unique Elements:**  \n  I enjoyed the added element of the search and rescue embedded in the novel.

I’m not sure that I’ve read another novel similar to this, so bonus points for that!  \n\n- **Romantic Elements and Spice Level:**  \n  For folks who might like a sprinkle of spice, but not heavy on the spice, I think this would be perfect!  \n\n- **Pacing and Relationship Development:**  \n  *Semi-spoiler so stop if you haven’t read the book yet* I did think it was a little strange that they said “I love you” after knowing each other for barely over a week, and they are going to be living together, but I’ll let it slide.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was so good!

            "I loved the hero in this book—an author who is stoic and protective. His character made the story a quick and enjoyable read, as I found myself rooting for him to have the best life possible. However, I had more issues with the heroine, which prevented me from giving the book a 5-star rating. Despite her sister being missing, she insists on applying makeup every day before starting her search. Throughout the story, she tries to justify this behavior, even while camping and hiking in remote mountains. Additionally, her daily choice of black coffee seems inconsistent with someone who wouldn't leave the house without makeup, as such individuals typically prefer at least milk in their coffee. I hoped she would come to realize that while looking polished can be empowering, there should be a more realistic sense of priorities when trying to save someone's life.",

            "I enjoy cozy mystery romances but haven't explored much romantic suspense. I was initially apprehensive that this book might be too intense, but it pleasantly surprised me. The story strikes a perfect balance—it's engaging without being overly stressful or dark. Despite the serious theme of a missing sister, there are no graphic scenes or disturbing content."

However, the heroine’s behavior, particularly her focus on makeup during a life-or-death situation, detracted from the story for me.

I was nervous this book would be too intense, but it wasn’t at all. It’s not too stressful or super dark, and there’s no rape or overly graphic content despite the drama of the missing sister.  \n\n- **Characterization (Hero):**  \n  - I loved the hero in this book. He’s an author, stoic, and protective. I wanted him to have the best life ever, which made the book a super quick and enjoyable read.  \n\n- **Characterization (Heroine):**  \n  - I had more problems with the heroine, which is why this didn’t make a 5-star rating for me. Her sister is missing, but she insists on putting on makeup every day before starting her search. There are many moments where she tries to justify why it’s normal to spend time on makeup while camping and hiking in remote mountains to find her sister.  \n  - She also drinks black coffee every day, which, in my experience, doesn’t align with the type of person who won’t leave the house without makeup (who usually prefers at least milk in their coffee).  \n  - I hoped she would realize by the end that while being done-up can make you feel powerful, there should be a realistic sense of priorities when trying to save someone’s life.  \n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n  - Overall, I really enjoyed this book and flew through it! It was engaging and kept me hooked.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  - I’ve read some reviews saying that Ruggle has an eerily similar book called *Gone Too Deep*. I haven’t read it, but it’s worth noting if you have.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a fun and engaging read with a great hero and a mostly enjoyable plot.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book is described as a light-hearted romantic suspense, but I felt the dichotomy between the light-hearted tone and the suspenseful plot didn’t work well for me. I prefer romantic suspense to be grittier, rawer, and more emotional to fully engage me, which this book lacked.  \n\n- **Plot and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The plot revolves around the FMC trying to find her missing sister while hiking, which had potential. However, I didn’t feel emotionally invested in the story or the characters. The book seemed unsure whether it wanted to be a romcom or a romantic suspense, and this indecision impacted my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Character Connection:**  \n  I didn’t feel much of a connection to the characters. They didn’t leave a lasting impression, which made it harder for me to fully engage with the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While I didn’t dislike the book, I also didn’t love it. It was just okay for me, and I didn’t feel strongly about it one way or the other after finishing it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fish Out of Water* is a light-hearted romantic suspense that struggles to balance its tone and genre, resulting in a lack of emotional depth and character connection for me. While the premise had potential, the execution didn’t fully resonate, leaving me feeling indifferent overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 – It was okay.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and Dreamscape Media for an ALC of this audiobook – all opinions are my own."

This was refreshing compared to the insta-love stories that are common lately.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - I felt the story dragged on a bit, and the premise of why they were trekking through the woods wasn’t entirely believable to me.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  - I would have enjoyed getting Winston’s point of view as well, as it might have added more depth to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - All in all, it was an okay read.

The pacing felt slow, and the misleading cover created some disappointment. However, it’s a decent introduction to cute romances, and I’m looking forward to exploring the author’s other works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The storyline held great promise, but I wished it had been told from a dual POV rather than a single perspective. I would have loved to delve into Winston's thoughts, especially since he embodies my favorite type of hero: grumpy and introverted. Experiencing him solely through Dahlia's eyes left me feeling somewhat cheated, as I couldn't connect with him as deeply as I wanted. However, the action-packed ending certainly kept me on my toes. Overall, the story was an adorable small-town romance with elements of mystery and suspense, though it occasionally felt silly, particularly with the sister's misplaced priorities while her sibling was in danger.",

Throughout the story, she spends time admiring her quiet, grumpy guide and even puts makeup on him while they are stuck in their tent during a snowstorm."

However, the overall timeline of the story is very short, which felt a bit rushed.  \n\n- **Subplot Impact:**  \n  The side-story of Dahlia trying to rescue her sister took up a very large chunk of the book, particularly toward the end.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Reputation and Consistency:**  \n  I’m definitely a fan of this author. I’ve read almost all of her books and have liked all of them. Katie is definitely one of my favorite suspense authors.  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  *Fish out of Water* is her least suspenseful book, but it was just as good as her others. I would say this one is more 80% romance and 20% suspenseful. This book was cute.  \n- **Character Development (Hero):**  \n  The H was a green flag. I really liked his character. He was the grumpy and quiet lumberjack type, but he was honestly a big ole teddy bear.  \n- **Character Development (Heroine):**  \n  I liked the h too. She was sweet and very talkative.  \n- **Relationship Dynamics and Tropes:**  \n  SafetySafe. No ow/OM drama. Virgin Hero. Heroine not a virgin. No others after meeting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Fish out of Water* is a delightful read that leans more toward romance than suspense, which is a slight departure from the author’s usual style. However, it maintains the charm and quality I’ve come to expect from Katie’s work. The characters are endearing, and the relationship dynamics are wholesome and drama-free.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The romance was charming, with great banter and well-written spicy scenes, and the hero's personality was endearing.

            "Dahlia is an absolute delight! While she may not be a typical 'sunshine,' her hopefulness, humor, and wit shine through. Her thoughts race in fascinating directions, making her a captivating character. However, Winston truly steals the show. He’s the ultimate cinnamon roll—though, as Dahlia points out, a stealthy one. He can't resist planting gentle kisses on her head, unintentionally blurting out compliments, and doing everything possible to make her smile. With his growly, bossy demeanor, he embodies a natural alpha, yet he remains tenderhearted and attuned to Dahlia’s needs. Honestly, he made me swoon! Their chemistry is electric, and I couldn't get enough of their interactions.",
