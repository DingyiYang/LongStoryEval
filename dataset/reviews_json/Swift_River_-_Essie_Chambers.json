            "In the story, two subplots unfold: Diamond reconnects with her father's family and unexpectedly develops a friendship with Shelley, someone she has known for years. While these subplots enrich the narrative, the resolution involving Shelley ultimately lacks emotional depth and feels anticlimactic.",
            "In this story, questions abound regarding Diamond's circumstances. Why does her mother choose to remain in Swift River despite limited job opportunities, an unwelcoming community, and a lack of support from family or friends? What are the details surrounding Diamond's bike accident and her knee injury? What ultimately happens to Rick? And why would Pop abandon both his daughter and cousin? These unresolved issues compel the reader to delve deeper into the narrative.",
            "The ending, especially concerning Shelley, feels rushed and lacks emotional depth, ultimately failing to make a lasting impression and diminishing the story's overall impact.",
            "The book's premise is captivating—Diamond’s father, Pop, vanished seven years ago, leaving behind only his shoes, ID, and money. However, the narrative loses momentum as the mystery of his disappearance remains unresolved. While Aunt Lena's letters add historical context to the town, they offer no insights into Pop's fate. Consequently, the main plot feels neglected, and the story's progression is poorly defined."

However, the plot loses its momentum as the mystery surrounding Pop’s disappearance is never resolved. The letters from Aunt Lena provide historical context about the town but fail to offer any clues about Pop’s fate. The main plot feels abandoned, and the progress is poorly benchmarked.  \n\n- **Subplots and Character Relationships:**  \n  Two subplots emerge: Diamond reconnects with her father’s family and suddenly forms a friendship with Shelley, someone she has known for years. While the subplots add layers to the story, the ending involving Shelley lacks emotional impact and feels underwhelming.  \n\n- **Legal and Logical Inconsistencies:**  \n  A significant detail—Pop may not have been legally married to Diamond’s mom because he sent the preacher away—has drastic legal implications, especially regarding the life insurance claim. However, this detail is never explored, which is a missed opportunity and a source of disappointment.  \n\n- **Character Motivations and Unanswered Questions:**  \n  Several character motivations and plot points remain unexplained:  \n  - Why does Diamond’s mom want to stay in Swift River despite poor job prospects, a hostile town, and no family or friends in the area?  \n  - What happened to Diamond’s bike accident and knee injury?  \n  - What happened to Rick?  \n  - Why would Pop leave both his daughter and cousin?  \n\n- **Ending and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The ending, particularly regarding Shelley, feels rushed and lacks emotional resonance. It doesn’t leave a lasting impression, which diminishes the overall impact of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Swift River* starts with a strong premise, it falters in its execution. The unresolved mystery, unexplored legal implications, and unanswered questions leave the reader unsatisfied. The subplots add some depth, but the emotional payoff is lacking, especially in the ending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review.  \n\n*Thanks, NetGalley, for a free copy of this book in exchange for my fair and honest opinion.*"

In secret, she saves for driving lessons, where she finds her only friend, Shelly.

It also explores the struggles of a family dealing with addiction and financial instability.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Diamond is a well-crafted character with a good heart and a relatable mix of resilience and vulnerability. Her isolation and difficulties make it easy to root for her. The supporting characters, including her mother and aunt, add depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book is well-written and flows smoothly.

I might have missed details, especially since I listened to the audiobook. The letters from relatives on her father’s side, like Aunt Lena and Great-Aunt Clara, didn’t feel as relevant to me as Diamond’s coming-of-age story and the mystery of her dad.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The audiobook was narrated by three talented female narrators: Shayna Small, Janina Edwards, and Robin Miles. They brought their characters to life effectively. Two narrators handled the letters from Diamond’s father’s side, and certain quotes stood out to me, such as:  \n  - *\"I didn't know there could be such a lonely laugh. I got to wondering, who is this person without their people? How am I Clumsy Clara, silly and stubborn Clara, Clara with her head in the clouds - how am I that girl without anyone who loves me saying it, seeing me. I think, maybe I am a ghost. Maybe I died with the others.\"*  \n  - *\"Being here in Woodville makes me uneasy, like I'm in between places, waiting to start my life again. Your hometown makes you and breaks you and makes you again. Daddy said that to me. I wonder if that's how you'll feel about Swift River if you ever leave it?\"*  \n\n- **Confusion and Clarity:**  \n  I found myself confused through much of the book, possibly due to the audiobook format. Reading the physical book alongside might have helped me pick up on details I missed.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the confusion, I enjoyed the book and would explore this author’s future work. I recommend it to readers who enjoy multi-generational stories set in the Northeast during the late 80s, with a strong coming-of-age theme.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a rich exploration of identity, family, and self-discovery through the eyes of a compelling protagonist. While the mystery element felt unresolved and some parts were confusing, the character development and emotional depth made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

            "The first third of the book is beautifully poignant, setting high expectations that the remainder of the story ultimately fails to meet. The plot meanders and feels underwhelming, especially when compared to the rich and vivid portrayal of Diamond’s family dynamics.",
            "Diamond is a captivating, multi-dimensional character—a fat, biracial girl navigating life as the only person of color in a sundown town due to her father's mysterious departure. Her scenes are vividly engaging. However, the audiobook's portrayal of her mother, Anna, comes across as overly juvenile, diminishing the overall complexity of the characters.",

I appreciated that Diamond wasn’t portrayed negatively due to her weight; however, the narrative took on a simplistic, Hallmark-style view of teenage fatness. It implied that Diamond's overeating stemmed from her father's departure and suggested that her journey toward self-acceptance was linked to weight loss, which felt reductive.",
            "As a teenager in 1987, I felt a deep connection to the setting and Diamond's experiences. The book's portrayal of anti-fat bias struck a chord with me, reminding me of the teasing I faced for not being skinny during that era. Although the fat shaming in the story added realism, it was still difficult to endure."

While I appreciated that Diamond was not depicted as lesser because of her weight, the story veered into a simplistic \"Hallmark TV special\" view of teenage fatness. It implied that Diamond overate because her father left and suggested that her self-acceptance coincided with weight loss, which felt reductive.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  Shayna Small did a wonderful job narrating most of the audiobook, bringing Diamond’s story to life. However, her portrayal of Diamond’s mother, Anna, was overly juvenile and didn’t align with the character’s complexity. Janina Edwards and Robin Miles excelled in narrating the chapters written as letters from Diamond’s family members.\n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  As someone who was a teenager in 1987, I felt a strong connection to the setting and Diamond’s experiences. The book’s depiction of anti-fat bias resonated with me, as I was also teased for not being skinny during that time. While the fat shaming in the story served a realistic purpose, it was still grating to encounter.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis coming-of-age novel has moments of beauty and poignancy, particularly in its vivid portrayal of Diamond and her family. However, the meandering plot and simplistic handling of body image themes detracted from its overall impact. The audiobook narration was mostly strong, though the portrayal of Diamond’s mother fell short. Despite its flaws, the story offers a compelling exploration of identity and family dynamics.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

However, I was disappointed by the lack of a strong sense of place. You barely get a feel for the town or its history as a mill town.  \n\n- **Character Development and Storyline:**  \n  The story is primarily told through the perspective of Diamond, a teenage girl who turns 16 during the narrative. I found her story repetitive and uninteresting. Diamond is dealing with the disappearance of her father, a struggling mother, and her own severe overweight condition. I questioned the necessity of adding so many hardships to her character, which made her story feel overly tragic rather than compelling.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Authenticity:**  \n  The book includes a backstory about African Americans being driven out of the town, which the author claims is part of her \"lived experience.\" However, I found this aspect unconvincing and not well-grounded in historical fact. While there were \"sunset towns\" in New England, this story feels fabricated and shouldn’t be considered historical fiction. It contrasts sharply with works like *This Other Eden*, which are deeply rooted in historical accuracy.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Experience):**  \n  I listened to the audiobook, which significantly impacted my experience. I did not enjoy the narration, and speeding it up to 5x normal speed still didn’t make it engaging or tolerable.  \n\n- **Author’s Background and Transparency:**  \n  The author is vague about her personal details, such as her age or where she grew up. This lack of transparency made me skeptical about her claims of \"lived experience\" and her position as a \"new\" novelist.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I was very disappointed with this book. While I gave it a lenient rating of 3 stars, I cannot recommend it. The repetitive storyline, lack of a strong sense of place, and unconvincing historical context, combined with the poor audiobook narration, made for an unsatisfactory reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars (generously given, primarily due to the audiobook narration affecting the experience)."

            "In this poignant story, our protagonist, Diamond, a biracial girl, is the last Black resident of Swift River following the disappearance and presumed death of her father. Her mother, Ma, clings to the hope of an insurance payout that would allow them to live like their affluent white neighbors, prioritizing this dream over Diamond's well-being, which is heartbreaking.\n\nDesperate for freedom from a town that ostracizes her, Diamond secretly takes driving lessons with Mr. Jimmy, accompanied by her only friend, Shelly, who also feels like an outsider. As they navigate their lessons, Diamond tries to overlook the increasingly inappropriate interactions between Shelly and the driving instructor.\n\nThe backdrop of the story is marked by \"The Leaving,\" a tragic event that saw the entire Black community depart, leaving only Diamond's Aunt Clara, who remained to care for her father. This history adds depth to Diamond's struggle for identity and belonging in a town that has turned its back on her.",
            "\"The Leaving\" recounts the night when all the Black residents departed Swift River. Through flashbacks, the protagonist, Diamond, reflects on her family's history and the circumstances surrounding her father's disappearance. She receives letters from a relative she has never met, prompting her to envision a life beyond Swift River, where she would be surrounded by more people who look like her—an experience she feels has been denied to her, as \"her Ma had met more Black people than she had, and that’s not fair.\" \n\nMeanwhile, Ma is banking on the insurance payout that will come once her father's death is confirmed after seven long years, dreaming of a life of luxury without the stress of bills or empty cupboards. The story beautifully illustrates Diamond's yearning for belonging and the hope of a brighter future.",
            "I was late for an appointment this morning because I simply had to finish the last 20 pages. Diamond is a character that will burrow into your heart and linger there for a long time."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Swift River by Essie Chambers is a deeply engaging and emotionally resonant novel that explores themes of identity, family, and belonging through the eyes of Diamond, a biracial teenager navigating life in a town that has ostracized her. The story’s rich character development, compelling pacing, and poignant exploration of racial and familial dynamics make it a memorable read that stays with you long after the final page.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The novel follows Diamond Newberry’s journey in the summer of 1987, as she learns to drive, navigates her friendship with Shelley, and works with her mother to uncover the truth about her father’s death. The story incorporates flashbacks and letters that reveal more about her aunt and great aunt’s lives. However, I found the multiple timelines confusing, and several key plot points and character motivations remained unresolved.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The book explores themes of identity, belonging, racism, and family bonds. These themes are thoughtfully woven into the narrative, adding depth to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is often lyrical and evocative, creating moments that are heartrending and emotionally impactful.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Diamond’s character is well-developed, and her coming-of-age journey is compelling. However, some secondary characters and their motivations could have been explored more thoroughly.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The novel leaves several questions unanswered, which may not appeal to readers who prefer clear resolutions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel is a poignant exploration of identity, family, and belonging, with lyrical writing and a heartfelt narrative. While the multiple timelines and unresolved plot points can be confusing, it’s a recommended read for fans of coming-of-age stories that embrace open-ended conclusions.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThank you to Netgalley and Dialogue Books for providing me with a digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

            "The story struggled to maintain my interest, particularly with its three timelines. The letters from the early 1900s felt underwhelming; while they connected to Diamond’s ancestors, I anticipated a more significant impact on her present life or a clearer parallel to her experiences. The 1980s segments showcasing Diamond’s childhood highlighted her father's growing unrest but failed to establish meaningful ties to the present. I believe the narrative would have benefited from focusing on just two timelines, as my favorite moments centered on 16-year-old Diamond.",

While they provided a connection to Diamond’s ancestors, I expected them to have a bigger impact on Diamond’s present life or parallel her experiences more directly.  \n  - The moments from Diamond’s younger years in the 1980s highlighted her father’s growing unrest and instability but lacked meaningful connections to the present.  \n  - I think the story would have been stronger with only two timelines, as my favorite parts were focused on 16-year-old Diamond.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I finished the book and enjoyed parts of it, though other aspects didn’t resonate as much.  \n  - Despite its flaws, I believe the novel will have a large audience and would recommend it to friends.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSwift River is a beautifully written novel with a compelling main character and powerful themes. While the multiple timelines and underutilized historical letters detracted from my overall enjoyment, Diamond’s journey of self-discovery and breaking generational trauma was deeply impactful. I would still recommend this book to others.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story opens powerfully, showcasing Diamond's struggles and her yearning to escape Swift River. However, the letters and packages from Aunt Lena and Clara feel like unnecessary exposition, detracting from Diamond's journey. While the flashbacks to 1980 provide depth by highlighting Annabelle's failure to protect her family, they also evoke frustration. Additionally, the abrupt shift in the final chapter from first-person present to first-person past disrupts the narrative flow.",
            "Diamond is a compelling and complex character grappling with loneliness, a strained relationship with her mother, and the mystery of her father's disappearance. Her mother, Annabelle, prioritizes her own comfort over her family's safety, revealing a cowardice that is further emphasized by her privilege. In contrast, Shelly, Diamond's friend, underscores Diamond's determination to step outside her comfort zone to preserve their rare friendship.",

The tense switch in the final chapter is jarring, and some plot points remain unresolved. Diamond's story is powerful on its own, and Clara's story could have been a separate book. Despite its flaws, the novel effectively explores themes of racial isolation and family dynamics, leaving a lasting emotional impact.",

While the first three-quarters are captivating, the plot rushes toward a swift conclusion.

            "Diamond stands out as a compelling protagonist, navigating the challenges of being Black, overweight, and poor in a predominantly white, affluent town.

            "The book shifts between multiple timelines: 1980, when Diamond's father disappears; 1987, just before he is legally declared dead; and letters from both contemporary family members and her ancestors. At times, particularly in the second half, the narrative feels meandering. I would have preferred a more focused exploration of Diamond's journey to understand her father's fate: Did he leave, disappear, or meet with misfortune? The resolution of the mystery surrounding his disappearance could have been more impactful.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed Diamond's voice in the story. The writing truly shines when she takes charge, sharing her feelings and observations about the world around her. The author effectively captures the moods and uncertainties of adolescence, particularly in the context of familial and demographic upheaval. A flashback scene set in an amusement park was especially profound, offering a poignant glimpse into a child's uncertainty amid tense family dynamics—an image that will linger with me. However, I felt that the two side characters, Shelly and Mr. Jimmy, detracted from the narrative. Their presence diverted attention from Diamond's compelling voice, which was the strongest aspect of the story.",

I really got to know her character and felt the writing was strongest when she was in charge of her own story, telling me about her feelings and what she sees happening all around her.  \n  - Chambers captured her moods, the uncertainty of that liminal space not only as a teenager but in the midst of familial and demographic upheaval, quite well.  \n  - A flashback scene involving an amusement park was profound and poignant, a glimpse into the uncertainty of a young child amid tense family dynamics. That will stay with me for a long while.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  - The book alternates between several narrative windows: 1980 (right when Diamond's father disappears), 1987 (present-day, right before her father will be legally declared dead), and letters written from both present-day family members and her ancestors.  \n  - I felt the story meandered in parts, especially in the second half. I would have loved to have more centralized focus being about Diamond and her coming to terms with what happened with her father: Did he leave? Did he disappear? Did something happen to him?  \n  - The resolution for the mystery of her father’s disappearance could have been stronger.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  - I didn’t feel two side characters, Shelly and Mr. Jimmy, added much to the story. They seemed to divert attention from Diamond’s visceral voice, which was the strongest part of the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The story felt raw and compelling, exploring Diamond’s identity, especially on the cusp of the uncertainties of adulthood.  \n  - Chambers did a great job delving into themes of identity, belonging, and heritage, particularly through Diamond’s perspective as the only Black resident of her town.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, \"Swift River\" is a poignant and compelling coming-of-age story that delves deeply into themes of identity, belonging, and family.

However, the first-person narrative often feels emotionally distant, as if she is merely sleepwalking through her traumatic experiences rather than fully engaging with them. While she recounts events, her struggle to express her feelings limits the reader's connection to her character.",

It examines how Diamond’s sense of estrangement is inherited, tracing her ancestors' migration from North Carolina alongside the town's history of expelling its Black residents. However, this dual focus detracts from the depth of Diamond’s personal story, leaving it feeling underdeveloped and less emotionally impactful."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre Preference:**  \n  I'm not a huge fan of \"coming of age\" stories, so that may have affected my interest in *Swift River*.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I appreciated the main character, Diamond Newberry. She is a teenager struggling with being the only black child in school, as well as her bi-racial background, living with her white mother, and dealing with issues of being overweight, poor, and smart. Diamond's struggles at school—racism, body size, and lack of close friends—are well-portrayed and painful.  \n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  I liked that the locale was Massachusetts, allowing the novel to explore the history of sundown towns even in the North. The letters from great-aunt Lena and Aunt Clara Newberry provide historical context. Lena's letters explain the lack of an ongoing relationship with Diamond's family, while Clara's letters offer fascinating details about the town of Swift River and life for black people between 1915 and 1954.  \n\n- **Structure and Narrative Style:**  \n  The structure of the book mostly worked for me. It alternates between the summer of 1987, with its specific plot points, and the backstory of 1980 when Diamond's father was present. The inclusion of letters adds depth but required some effort to understand the relationships of the aunts. There is a lot of jumping around, but I appreciated the diversion from Diamond's life.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  I didn't think the writing was special, but it was perfectly adequate.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  Parts of the book were funny. Diamond and her mother are mostly sad characters, but both are plucky in their own ways.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I went back and forth between reading and listening to *Swift River*. I thought the audio was terrible—the reader had an annoying voice for several characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Swift River* is not my preferred genre, I found Diamond's character compelling and appreciated the historical context provided by the letters. The structure, though occasionally confusing, added depth to the story. The writing was adequate, and the humor provided some levity. However, the audiobook experience was disappointing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It left me with a bittersweet array of emotions, feeling slightly discontented but not disheartened. The ending evoked a pang of sadness for Diamond and her mother, though it felt realistic given their communicative dysfunctions and fundamental differences.  \n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n  Diamond, a 16-year-old biracial protagonist, embarks on a journey of self-discovery by connecting with her black history and lineage. I loved her growth and the hopeful future she finds by uncovering her family history. The representation of biracial identity, coming-of-age, and the search for belonging was compelling.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The novel weaves three timelines: Diamond’s present day, her experiences seven years earlier leading up to her father’s disappearance, and the 1910s through letters from her great Aunt Clara. While the pacing is slower, Essie Chambers’ beautiful prose kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  The mother-daughter relationship between Diamond and her mother was complex and realistic, though it left me feeling sad about how things were resolved. I also felt mild confusion regarding Diamond’s father and his story, which may have been intentional but left me uncertain.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Essie Chambers writes with a beautiful voice and prose that kept me turning the pages. The storytelling was immersive and emotionally resonant.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book for its themes of self-discovery, family history, and biracial representation. While it didn’t completely knock it out of the park for me, it was a thought-provoking and emotionally rich read.

While we discover what happened to Diamond’s father partway through, Diamond chooses to pretend she doesn’t know and pushes her mother away instead.

A story about a missing father can resonate deeply or miss the mark entirely, and unfortunately, this one fell into the latter category. I was closer in age to Diamond when my dad was found than she was when hers went missing, and my father was located a year before her dad was declared dead in the narrative. I found the emotional depth lacking for both Diamond and her mother, which ultimately left me feeling disconnected as a reader."

Diamond's storyline felt like the novel's main thread, and by the end, I was left wanting more of her journey.",

As a teenager, her humor shines through, and the dialogue between her and her mom is exceptionally well-crafted. In many situations, Diamond takes on an adult role, while her mom often seems younger and more childlike. The lessons Diamond learns from older generations significantly shape her identity, and by the end of the novel, we witness her growth and transformation as a result of these connections.",

However, the novel includes perhaps a few too many characters, which can feel overwhelming at times.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  While the story is well-told overall, the pacing is somewhat uneven, which may affect the reader’s engagement at certain points.\n\n- **Personal Connection and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its minor flaws, the novel is compelling and effectively addresses significant themes. I received a free copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review, and I found it to be a worthwhile read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis evocative novel, set in 1987, skillfully explores themes of loss, identity, and societal prejudices through the eyes of a relatable protagonist. While the pacing is uneven and the cast of characters slightly overcrowded, Diamond’s story is engaging and thought-provoking, making it a worthwhile read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  Swift River is depicted as a tiny town, mostly devoid of people of color, which creates a challenging environment for Diamond, a mixed-race protagonist. The town’s insular nature and lack of diversity contribute to her sense of isolation and longing for something beyond her current circumstances.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Diamond is a compelling character shaped by her difficult circumstances. Her father disappeared years ago and is presumed dead or living with another woman, while her mother struggles with addiction and an inability to move on from her husband’s loss. These dynamics add depth to Diamond’s character and her search for identity and belonging.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The story unfolds across four different time periods, which I found occasionally muddled, especially in the beginning. However, the narrative gradually comes together by the end, resulting in a cohesive and satisfying conclusion.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the initial confusion with the timeline, the novel was an enjoyable read. The emotional depth of the characters and the resolution of the story made it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSwift River is a poignant exploration of identity, family, and belonging, set against the backdrop of a small, racially homogenous town. While the multiple time periods initially created some confusion, the story ultimately came together in a meaningful way, making it a rewarding read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The inclusion of so many other characters detracted from her development and made the narrative feel less cohesive.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Essie Chambers’ writing is lovely and engaging. Despite my issues with the plot and character focus, I appreciate her talent and would not hesitate to read anything she writes in the future.  \n\n- **Overall Reception:**  \n  While I personally didn’t love the book, I believe it has the potential to do well, especially since it is rumored to be Jenna’s pick for June.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAlthough *Swift River* was one of my most anticipated summer reads, I was disappointed by its overly complex plot structure and lack of focus on the main character, Diamond. However, the beautiful writing and the book’s potential for broader appeal leave me hopeful for the author’s future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It started out great.  \n\n- **Plot and Story Development:**  \n  It’s the story of Diamond, an obese 16-year-old mixed-race girl living with her mother in a white town. They are trying to get her father declared dead after being missing for the required 7 years. They are barely scraping by, and Diamond even has to work and has no friends. She begins to learn more about her family’s history through letters with a great-aunt, so the letters are also a part of the book. She starts driver’s ed, makes a friend, and the story goes on but gets weirder and has some “eeuw” moments that lowered my rating in my mind.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The story started strong but went downhill from there. The inclusion of strange and uncomfortable moments detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I’m not sure if I would be able to recommend this one!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a promising start and an intriguing premise, the story’s progression into strange and uncomfortable moments ultimately diminished my enjoyment.

The threads of generational trauma were woven intricately into the story, adding layers of depth.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Diamond felt mostly like a fully realized character, which made her journey resonate strongly with me.  \n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  While the back-and-forth narrative between 1980 and 1987 was likely necessary, the additional layer of letters from an estranged relative, along with forwarded letters from an ancestor, made the plot challenging to follow at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel impressed me with its beautiful writing, rich themes, and well-developed protagonist. However, the complex structure occasionally hindered my ability to fully engage with the plot.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

Themes of racism, identity, self-acceptance, and family are central to the narrative. Diamond navigates her life as the only Black person in an all-white town, grappling with her identity as an overweight Black girl. The story explores her journey to find friendship, uncover the truth about her father’s disappearance, and ultimately escape her toxic environment. The timeline shifts between the present day and Diamond’s childhood, with additional insights provided through letters from Clara, a Black midwife who lived in the town before Black people were driven out.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Diamond is a compelling protagonist whose growth is central to the story. She learns to love and accept herself despite the challenges she faces. Her mother, Annabelle, is portrayed as a depressed, barely-functioning woman who enables Diamond’s struggles rather than supporting her. Diamond’s father, Rob, is a mysterious figure whose disappearance haunts the family. Diamond’s friendship with a girl who makes questionable choices adds complexity to her journey, as this friend encourages her to investigate whether her father abandoned them.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is beautiful on a line level, with vivid descriptions and emotional depth. However, the pacing of the plot falters after a strong start, which detracts from the overall impact of the story.  \n\n- **Historical and Social Context:**  \n  The novel effectively weaves in the town’s racist history, including the enforcement of Jim Crow laws that led to the expulsion of Black residents decades earlier. This backdrop adds depth to Diamond’s experiences and the challenges she faces as a mixed-race girl in a predominantly white community.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a poignant exploration of identity, racism, and self-discovery through the eyes of a resilient young protagonist. While the writing is beautiful and the themes are compelling, the pacing issues prevent the story from reaching its full potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, if you're interested in exploring how his disappearance and the events leading up to it shaped Diamond's childhood and her development into adulthood, you'll find this book rewarding. While some reviews express frustration over this perceived oversight, I believe that seeking to solve the mystery misses the story's true essence.",

As a girl who has been forced to grow up too quickly, she embodies a world-weariness while still sharing the dreams of many small-town teenagers: the desire to escape. I particularly enjoyed her journey of self-discovery, especially her connection with her Black relatives, which allows her to explore a past that her mother chooses to ignore.",

This lack of clarity left me unsatisfied.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had engaging elements, such as the letters from Diamond’s ancestors, the unresolved storyline about her father and the gaps in his character development left me feeling disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

While these letters were meant to provide insight into the characters, especially Pop, they didn’t fully round out the characters or the time period for me. Some letters even felt like complete non sequiturs.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The storytelling itself was beautiful, especially when viewed as a bildungsroman, focusing on Diamond’s growth. However, the inclusion of the letters disrupted the flow and didn’t provide the necessary depth or clarity I expected. I typically enjoy non-linear prose, but in this case, it didn’t work as well as I had hoped.\n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  If you approach the book as a coming-of-age story, it’s a beautiful read. But if, like me, you pick it up expecting answers to the central mystery, you might be left disappointed. Despite this, I still think the book is worth reading, even though I was left a bit puzzled by the end.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a mixed bag. While the protagonist’s journey and the storytelling are compelling, the unresolved mystery and the interruptive narrative style of the letters left me wanting more. It’s a worthwhile read, but it may not fully satisfy those seeking a clear resolution to the central plot.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."
