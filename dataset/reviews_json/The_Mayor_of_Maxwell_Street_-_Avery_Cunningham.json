They only meet a few times in the first half, and Jay only promises to help Nelly with her investigation halfway through.  \n   - The side characters, like Sequoia (with her encyclopedic social knowledge and hidden secrets) and Tomás (the Spanish-Mexican polo player who shares similarities with Jay), were intriguing and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - I appreciated the historical setting and the way it was brought to life, contributing to the novel’s overall atmosphere.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Rating:**  \n   - While I liked the setting and the themes, the love story fell flat for me, which made me question my rating.  \n   - Ultimately, I decided to rate the novel 3.5 stars, rounding it down.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a solid debut with a compelling historical setting and thought-provoking themes like racism and identity. While the pacing was slow and the love story didn’t fully deliver, the characters and their struggles kept me invested. It’s a worthwhile read, though not without its flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded down)."

            "This action-packed historical novel set in 1920s Chicago offers an intriguing exploration of societal issues of the time. It follows Nelly, the daughter of a prominent Black horse breeder, as she navigates the transition from rural life to the upper echelons of Chicago society after her brother's death. The plot centers on Nelly's covert mission to expose the corrupt Mayor of Maxwell Street, a figure deeply entwined with the city's underworld. The mystery surrounding the Mayor is skillfully crafted, keeping me engaged and constantly theorizing. The pacing is strong, with the unfolding mystery driving the narrative. However, the final chapter and epilogue felt somewhat muddled; I would have preferred to see Nelly's article about the Mayor included, as it would have offered a more satisfying conclusion to her journey.",

Jay Shorey is a charismatic yet enigmatic character who forges an intriguing alliance with Nelly while concealing his own secrets.

The characters are vividly real, and their complex relationships make for an engaging read.",

Jay's character was untrustworthy and dubious, as he repeatedly lied and endangered Nelly. It was perplexing why she continued to associate with him after his treatment of her family. Similarly, Tomas, Nelly's polo-playing suitor, exuded toxic energy with his incessant marriage proposals, which felt more manipulative than romantic.",

It was done exceptionally well, and I have no doubt that a significant amount of research went into creating Nelly’s universe.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot felt too long in some parts, dragging unnecessarily, and too short in others, lacking a clear direction.

I couldn’t understand why she continued to associate with him after what he did to her family.  \n   - Tomas, Nelly’s polo-playing suitor, also gave off toxic vibes with his persistent marriage proposals, which felt manipulative rather than romantic.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n   - The book is billed as a love story, but it doesn’t deliver on that promise. The love triangle felt unnecessary and detracted from the main narrative.  \n   - The relationships, particularly with Jay and Tomas, were toxic and didn’t add value to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Potential:**  \n   - The premise of a rich debutante secretly pursuing a journalism career in 1920s Chicago was compelling. The story could have been stronger if it focused more on Nelly’s investigative journey or her quest to uncover the truth about her brother’s death.  \n   - The journalism aspect of the story was underdeveloped.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Unique Appeal:**  \n   - This book is a blend of romance (featuring a love triangle), mystery, and historical fiction, yet it feels like none of those things at the same time.  \n   - The genre didn’t have an author like Avery Cunningham before this book, which made it a standout experience.  \n\n- **Pacing and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The pacing and scenes are subtle and almost quiet, creating a unique reading experience.  \n   - Despite its length (500+ pages), I flew through the book and was completely glued to the page.  \n\n- **Engagement and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The story felt like a journey, leaving me with a sense of wonder, as if I was asking, “What just happened?”  \n   - I enjoyed it so much that it wasn’t something I expected to love this year.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity and Understanding:**  \n   - As someone who loves mysteries, I found the mob/city corruption plotline challenging to fully grasp.  \n   - The dialogue in the mafia world often felt like “wink wink nudge nudge,” and without prior exposure (e.g., *The Sopranos*), I sometimes missed the deeper implications.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n   - Despite my minor struggles with the plot, I am eagerly anticipating whatever Avery Cunningham writes next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an unexpected delight, blending multiple genres into a unique and subtly paced narrative. While I occasionally struggled with the complexity of the mob-related plotline, the overall experience was captivating and left me eagerly awaiting the author’s next work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I don’t have any complaints about the quality of the prose.  \n\n- **Believability of the Story:**  \n   - Nothing about the story is believable. The protagonist, Nelly, is a whiny, selfish, anachronistic brat.  \n   - The central conflict feels contrived: Nelly, the daughter of one of the richest Black families in 1920s America, wants a byline under her real name as a journalist. Her boss agrees only if she identifies the mythical Mafia Lord known as The Mayor of Maxwell Street.  \n   - Nelly’s motivation for accepting this dangerous mission is weak. She claims she wants to be more than a rich wife, but her parents are loving and supportive, making her actions irrational.  \n\n- **Character Development (Nelly):**  \n   - Nelly is portrayed as a journalist, but we never see her actually working on any writing.  \n   - She compulsively lies to her family and friends, putting herself in dangerous situations, including being kidnapped, beaten, and shot at by gangsters.  \n   - Her relationship with Tomás, a dashing rich Mexican boy, feels forced and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n   - The transitions between chapters are atrocious. Settings and characters change suddenly and drastically, often without warning or explanation.  \n   - The “big reveal” of the Mayor’s true identity is disappointing and lacks any meaningful twist. It’s highly implied early on, and the lack of complexity feels insulting to the reader’s intelligence.  \n   - The final chapter and epilogue are confusing and unsatisfying, leaving me indifferent to the resolution.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The book felt like a chore to read. I wish I had DNFed (Did Not Finish) it.  \n   - Despite the solid prose, the story’s flaws make it a complete and utter waste of time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had potential with its solid writing, but the unbelievable plot, poorly developed protagonist, and lackluster execution made it a frustrating and unsatisfying read.

It is historical fiction, and the marketing may have misled some readers into expecting a romance. There is little to no actual romance in the plot, as Nelly’s feelings for the man she marries seem limited to affection and gratitude, with no indication of love or lust on her part.\n\n- **Character Motivations and Plot Clarity:**  \n  The identity of 'the mayor of Maxwell Street' was predictable early on, but his motivations became less clear as the story progressed. The introduction of characters like God-uncle Dan and Sam added confusion, as their roles and motivations were not well-explained. The climactic scene involving 'the mayor' holding a gun and the abrupt transition to Nelly’s wedding day left many questions unanswered, making the resolution feel incomplete and unsatisfying.\n\n- **Readability and Memorability:**  \n  The book was highly readable, as I finished two-thirds of it in one evening. However, the plot lacked depth and impact, making it unlikely to be memorable. I doubt I’ll recall the details of the story a month from now.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was engaging enough to keep me reading, it fell short in several areas. The misleading genre expectations, unclear character motivations, and unresolved plot points detracted from the overall experience. Despite its readability, the story lacked the depth and coherence needed to leave a lasting impression.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book, while engaging, suffers from a lack of tight editing, particularly in scenes like the extended Spanish conversation, which come across as more frustrating than impactful. The prologue is intriguing but would have worked better integrated into the main narrative or withheld to enhance suspense surrounding Jay Shorey’s backstory. The mystery of the Mayor of Maxwell Street captivates readers, with clues artfully woven throughout the narrative, allowing observant readers to piece together the solution. The plot is well-structured, with nearly every introduced element serving a purpose later on, creating a satisfying sense of cohesion. However, some events and character actions feel implausible or lack logical grounding, which undermines the story's believability.",
            "Nelly Sawyer, the protagonist, is endearing yet occasionally naive, especially in her initial motivations for accepting a perilous assignment. Although her renewed determination later in the story is commendable, the hurried ending renders her character arc incomplete. The romantic interests, including Jay Shorey, are characterized more by intrigue and lust than by genuine affection, ultimately impeding Nelly's growth rather than enhancing it.",
            "The prose is beautiful and sensory, enriching the reading experience despite the book's flaws. However, the writing occasionally lacks conciseness, which can hinder the narrative flow.",
            "The novel masterfully transports readers to 1920s Chicago, crafting a vivid and immersive historical setting. Its sensory and eloquent writing style beautifully enhances the atmosphere, bringing the time period and events to life.",
            "The novel is marketed as an epic love story, but the romantic elements feel underdeveloped and lack emotional depth. Relationships are fueled more by intrigue and lust than by genuine love, and the ending fails to deliver a satisfying resolution, whether happy ever after or happy for now."

The plot follows Penelope Nelly Sawyer, the sole heir to her family's fortune, as she aspires to be an investigative journalist for the *Chicago Defender*. Determined to expose the Mayor of Maxwell Street, whom she suspects leads a crime syndicate, Nelly's journey is fraught with danger. Complicating her mission is Jay Shorey, a bi-racial man with ties to the underworld she seeks to uncover. Their undeniable chemistry adds intriguing depth to the narrative.",

Jay's ability to pass as white opens doors to new social circles, highlighting the intricate dynamics of racial identity and privilege.",

            "The narrative is intricate and features a diverse array of characters, yet I remained engaged and aware throughout my reading. The protagonist, Nelly, is a smart and independent woman with her own aspirations, which adds depth to her character.",
            "The novel is astonishingly well-written, showcasing the author's artistry with words and storytelling. The prose is polished and captivating.",
            "This novel is a stunning debut that has me eagerly anticipating more from the author. I'm grateful to NetGalley and Hyperion Avenue for the advanced reader copy (ARC).",
            "Set in Chicago during the early 1920s, this novel vividly captures the Prohibition Era, a time rife with corruption and gangsters. It explores the opportunities available to Black individuals in the North, juxtaposed with the discrimination and threats they face. The narrative also delves into the segregation and animosity among various ethnic groups, alongside the dynamics of high society and the gangster underworld. Although marketed as an epic love story, this description undermines the novel's depth. While romance does play a role, the book transcends a simple love tale, engaging with broader themes of history, society, and crime."

        "conclusion": "The Mayor of Maxwell Street is a masterfully written debut novel that transcends its label as a love story, offering a rich exploration of historical and social issues in 1920s Chicago. The author’s compelling prose and intricate storytelling make this a standout work, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.",

            "In this story, Penelope “Nelly” Sawyer, the daughter of America’s wealthiest Black man, inherits her family's fortune following her brother’s death. Nelly juggles a dual existence as a wealthy society girl pursued by royalty and a journalist probing the true identity of the Mayor of Maxwell Street. While the first half of the book unfolds at a leisurely pace, the story picks up significantly after the 60% mark, transforming into a more engaging and fast-paced read.",
            "Nelly is a resilient and fearless character, unafraid to explore perilous situations in her quest for answers. Despite her considerable wealth, she encounters racial bias, including being mistaken for someone in a subordinate role, which adds complexity to her character. While the book presents an epic love story, the romance takes a backseat. The relationship between Nelly and Jay Shorey, in particular, feels underdeveloped, leaving me unable to fully invest in their connection.",
            "The writing is captivating, featuring vivid descriptions that effectively bring the setting and characters to life.",
            "The 1920s Chicago setting is vividly rendered, showcasing the opulence of high society and lavish parties. The stark contrast between the glamorous elite and the city's gritty underbelly is effectively portrayed."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I enjoyed the book, particularly Nelly’s character and the vivid portrayal of 1920s Chicago. While the first half was slow, the story picked up momentum in the second half, making it a compelling read. However, the romance fell short of expectations, and I wish it had been more prominent and developed.",

            "The love triangle involving Nelly, Jay, and Tomás feels unnecessary and detracts from the main plot. While Tomás’s unwavering support for Nelly is refreshingly different from the typical jealous suitor trope, it still comes across as unrealistic. The story explores a variety of settings—speakeasies, lavish parties, encounters with gang leaders, and economically challenged neighborhoods—but these elements lack cohesion, resulting in a meandering narrative. This loose structure diminishes the impact of the shocking reveal regarding the Mayor’s identity. Nelly's quest to uncover the Mayor of Maxwell Street, a figure entangled in Chicago's criminal and political underbelly, ultimately feels predictable, as obvious clues abound. It is disappointing that Nelly, despite being depicted as intelligent and observant, does not piece it together sooner.",
            "Nelly is a nuanced protagonist who navigates grief, societal expectations, and her ambition to become a respected writer. Her sheltered upbringing stands in stark contrast to the harsh realities of racism and violence she faces. While Jay Shorey and Tomás Escalante y Roche serve as intriguing love interests, their characters occasionally feel underdeveloped; Jay's ties to the criminal underworld and Tomás's unwavering support can seem unrealistic. In contrast, Sequoia McArthur, an unconventional and secretive figure, enriches the narrative and aids Nelly in maneuvering through the complexities of Chicago's elite society.",

            "The back cover suggested a love story, but the book fell short of that expectation. A genuine romantic element could have enhanced the overall experience. The ending was particularly disappointing; the reveal about the Mayor of Maxwell Street felt predictable and lackluster. Furthermore, Nelly's unfinished exposé left me unsatisfied, reflecting Jay's feelings (if you know, you know). The pacing dragged, and the narrative could have benefited from being about 150 pages shorter. Ultimately, I found myself skimming through the last half just to finish it.",
            "Nelly, the protagonist, often feels anachronistic, making her choices frustrating to follow. As a well-bred girl in the 1920s, her actions clash with societal norms; for instance, she never faces scrutiny from her parents, and her only chaperone is a white male chauffeur, which feels unrealistic. In contrast, Jay is a compelling character, especially with his connection to Jay Gatsby and the intriguing theory that Gatsby may have been a white-passing Black man.

            "Set in Chicago during the summer of 1921, the novel follows Penelope Nelly Sawyer, the daughter of America's wealthiest Black man. The story opens at her brother's funeral and shifts to her reluctant involvement in a high-society Cotillion. Central to the plot is Nelly's passion for journalism and her determination to expose the enigmatic Mayor of Maxwell Street, aiming to secure her byline in The Chicago Defender. This assignment is fraught with danger and challenges, heightening the narrative's tension. While the pacing is generally strong, minor inconsistencies slightly disrupt the flow. Overall, the story is well-structured, effectively transitioning from Nelly's introduction to high society to her perilous journalistic pursuit.",
            "Nelly is a captivating protagonist whose passion for journalism propels the narrative. Her relationships, especially with her late brother and editor Richard Norris, are thoughtfully developed, adding emotional depth to the story. The secondary characters, including the enigmatic Mayor of Maxwell Street, are equally intriguing and enhance the overall richness of the plot.",
            "The prose is precise and engaging, showcasing a strong command of authentic and convincing dialogue. The author skillfully employs similes and metaphors, exemplified by the striking description of a character who \"hummed and swiveled her head, eyes touching everything and everyone like the Angel of Death searching for firstborns to slaughter.\" This vivid imagery, along with memorable phrases, significantly enhances the reader's immersion in the story.",
            "This novel is compelling and expertly written, making it a standout read. Despite a few minor flaws, it is the best book I've encountered in 2024 so far and is likely to remain a strong contender for Book of the Year.",
            "The novel skillfully depicts the historical backdrop of 1921 Chicago, highlighting the racial and social dynamics of the era. Its incorporation of The Chicago Defender and the representation of Black high society lend authenticity and depth to the narrative."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The Mayor of Maxwell Street is a remarkable debut novel by the author, offering a compelling plot, rich character development, and masterful prose. Set against the backdrop of 1921 Chicago, the story of Nelly Sawyer's quest for journalistic recognition is both engaging and emotionally resonant. Despite minor pacing issues, the novel is a standout read and a strong contender for the reader's Top 10 of 2024.",

            "The romance felt superfluous and failed to enhance the story. As the narrative progressed, the main plot became overshadowed by numerous subplots. The high-stakes scenes followed a repetitive pattern: Nelly gets caught, Jay intervenes, they escape, and then they discuss the incident. This predictability rendered some moments unrealistic.",

Despite warnings about the dangers of her investigations, she abruptly abandons her project after someone is hurt, which feels inconsistent. The portrayal of her grief over her brother's death is rushed, skipping essential stages and lacking emotional depth. However, the characters are well-developed, with even minor figures leaving a lasting impression. Nelly's perspective as a journalist adds richness to the narrative, as her attention to detail reveals the complexities of the world and the people around her. The way Elder's death is overlooked by others, except for Nelly, serves as a poignant commentary on how uncomfortable truths are often ignored.",

Unfortunately, the ending disappoints as it shifts focus from the mystery to the debutante storyline. Only about 30% of the book felt genuinely exciting, and its length made it feel drawn out. By the conclusion, I struggled to grasp the overall purpose of the narrative. Additionally, the plot summary provided after finishing the book did not align with my reading experience, leaving the story feeling disjointed.",

In contrast, Nelly herself was insufferable. She often appeared as a virtue-signaling, self-centered individual who dismissed others as shallow while exploiting them for her own benefit. Her lack of self-awareness and unwillingness to consider the consequences of her actions made her unlikable and difficult to support.",

Notable landmarks and cultural elements such as the lake, river, beach, Drake Hotel, Green Mill, Water Tower, Lincoln Park, and Wrigley Field are glaringly absent. The treatment of Jim Crow and racial tensions is superficial; for instance, Nelly and her friends are asked to leave an art museum due to capacity, which trivializes the grave racial violence of the era, including the 1919 race riots. While the affluent, all-white Hyde Park neighborhood is mentioned, the narrative overlooks the realities of segregation and the experiences of the Black community, including figures like Louis Armstrong and life on the South Side. This suggests a lack of thorough research into Chicago's history and racial dynamics.

A stronger mentor or editor could have helped balance these elements and elevate the novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The two central plot elements—the Season and the underworld investigation—felt disjointed and failed to blend cohesively. However, the mystery surrounding the Mayor of Maxwell Street was engaging and kept me intrigued throughout the book. While I eventually deduced the Mayor's identity, the specifics of his rise to power remained unclear.",
            "Tomás is a swoon-worthy character, and his interactions with Nelly are particularly enjoyable as her perceptions of him evolve. Nelly's relationships with other characters, including Jay and her family, add depth to the story. However, her ambition to become a journalist feels unrealistic for a wealthy, sheltered debutante in the 1920s, especially given the harsh realities of the profession at that time. Her ability to withstand mob violence and intimidation seems implausible. Additionally, Nelly often comes across as entitled and heartless, willing to risk others' lives for her own gain despite her privileged background. Her freedom to move unchaperoned and engage with the criminal underworld feels inconsistent with the societal norms of the era.",

The interplay between Nelly's southern charm and Jay's suave demeanor creates a captivating dynamic that highlights their tender connection. While their romance is subtle, it is compelling in its exploration of Nelly's emerging feelings of attraction and devotion. Initially, Nelly engages in reckless and self-destructive behavior, seemingly indifferent to her own well-being. Despite distancing herself from her affluent family, she often acts with the entitlement of a privileged young woman, inserting herself into others' lives for her own reasons. This selfishness made it difficult to empathize with her at first.

Every moment was completely captivating.  \n   - For me, this is definitely one of the best books of the year.  \n   - The novel explores what it means to be human, what it is to love, and the positive and negative implications that come with both facets of life.  \n\n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n   - Historical fiction is not usually the genre I lean towards, but I was completely blown away.  \n   - The Mayor of Maxwell Street is deeper than a historical romance novel.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - The novel follows Nelly, the daughter of “the richest Negro in America,” and her relations with Jay, a rich, biracial man in Chicago.  \n   - Exploring Nelly’s southern charm in tandem with Jay’s suave persona is intriguing and demonstrates their dynamically tender relationship.  \n   - Though Nelly and Jay’s romance wasn’t explicit, it excelled in a different way. The relationships within the novel were delicate, with Nelly exploring her newfound attraction, devotion, and emotions.  \n\n- **Character Development (Nelly):**  \n   - At the beginning, Nelly throws herself into really unsafe and frankly stupid situations with no regard for herself or her wellbeing.  \n   - Despite separating herself from her rich and privileged family, she acts like a rich and privileged young woman, inserting herself into people’s lives because of her personal motives.  \n   - To me, Nelly was selfish at the onset of the novel, and it was kind of hard to like her. However, her character growth throughout the novel was evident, which made the story more enjoyable.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Themes:**  \n   - Cunningham succeeds in describing the Black reality, both in the past and the present.  \n   - The layers within the novel really propelled the story forward. Cunningham’s inclusion of interracial and LGBTQ+ relationships helps diversify and explain the characters, creating a well-fleshed-out and realistic world.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Imagery:**  \n   - Cunningham’s writing throughout the novel was profoundly beautiful.  \n   - The continual usage of imagery made me feel as though I was also in the novel, feeling the feelings, seeing the sights, and living their same lives.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Mayor of Maxwell Street is a beautifully written, deeply layered novel that captivated me from start to finish.

            "The story features a romantic subplot involving Nelly and two other characters, which feels unnecessary. Nelly is a strong, independent character, and the romance detracts from her personal journey. The narrative follows Nelly Sawyer, a twenty-year-old Black debutante and aspiring journalist, as she embarks on an assignment to profile the elusive Mayor of Maxwell Street in 1920s Chicago. This vibrant era serves as a rich backdrop, filled with culture and intriguing stories. The plot includes unexpected twists and moments of violence, alongside depictions of crime that, while true to the period, can initially feel jarring.",
            "Nelly is a remarkable protagonist—intelligent and strong-willed—who defies the constraints of her race and gender in pursuit of her ambitions. Rather than conforming to societal expectations of marriage, she is resolute in her desire to establish herself as a journalist, making her both refreshing and inspiring. The story poignantly illustrates that, despite her family's wealth and notoriety, Nelly still confronts racism and discrimination, shedding light on the struggles faced by people of color during that era.",

The author approaches sensitive topics with authenticity and care, grounding the story in its historical context.",

The author has crafted a sensitive and authentic story that I thoroughly enjoyed, and I look forward to reading more of their work in the future.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story follows Nelly Sawyer, a twenty-year-old Black debutante and aspiring journalist, as she takes on an assignment to write about the elusive Mayor of Maxwell Street in 1920s Chicago.  \n   - The 1920s setting is fascinating, filled with culture, life, and stories of a vibrant era.  \n   - The plot includes unexpected twists, moments of violence, and depictions of crime, which, while authentic to the time period, were initially jarring.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Nelly is an amazing, smart, and strong-willed protagonist who refuses to let her race or gender hinder her ambitions.  \n   - She is determined to make a name for herself as a journalist rather than settling for marriage, which makes her a refreshing and inspiring character.  \n   - The story highlights how Nelly, despite her family's wealth and notoriety, still faces racism and discrimination, emphasizing the struggles of people of color during that era.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n   - The novel sheds light on the challenges faced by successful Black individuals, showing how they must work harder to achieve similar social treatment as their peers.  \n   - It is refreshing and enlightening to read historical fiction featuring a Black protagonist, especially one set in the 1920s.  \n   - The author handles sensitive topics with authenticity and care, making the story feel true to the time period.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n   - There is a romantic subplot involving Nelly and two other characters, but it felt unnecessary.  \n   - Nelly is such a strong and independent character that the inclusion of romance detracted from her individual journey.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n   - The story is highly engaging, drawing the reader into Nelly's world from the very first page.  \n   - The pacing keeps the reader hooked, making it difficult to put the book down.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Mayor of Maxwell Street* is a compelling and important historical fiction novel that offers a fresh perspective on the 1920s through the eyes of a strong Black protagonist. While the romance subplot felt unnecessary, Nelly's journey as an aspiring journalist and her resilience in the face of societal challenges make this a standout read. The author, Avery Cunningham, has crafted a sensitive and authentic story that I thoroughly enjoyed, and I look forward to reading more of their work in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story begins in the South with Jimmy Blue Eyes, a Black man raised by his uncle, who escapes after spurning Miss Cecilia's advances.

The first half resembles a debutante romance, while the second half transitions into a thriller that the main character struggles to navigate. Although the initial sections are rich in detail, the ending feels rushed and abrupt, leaving many questions unanswered. The execution seems clumsy, prompting me to re-read certain passages for clarity. The twist revealing Jay as responsible for Elder’s death was surprising, but the mention of a random white man in Alabama being killed as retribution hinted at Jimmy Blue Eyes seeking revenge. Sam Mason's role, which is crucial for Nelly, was confusing since he was only briefly mentioned earlier, necessitating a revisit to prior chapters. Additionally, the explanation of how Jay became the Mayor lacked clarity and left me unsatisfied.",

            "This story offers a poignant exploration of America's troubled racial history, skillfully conveyed through the unique perspective of Nelly Sawyer, the daughter of Chicago's wealthiest Black man in the 1920s. Jay Shorey, known as \"Jimmy Blue-Eyes,\" presents a compelling portrayal of a mixed-race individual navigating the challenges of the Jim Crow era. The historical backdrop of post-WWI Chicago enriches the narrative, blending education with entertainment. However, the setting sometimes feels overshadowed by implausible events and character choices, giving it a Gotham City-like quality. Nelly's decisions are often perplexing and difficult to support, particularly in light of the harm they cause to others. The central twist is predictable, becoming apparent by page 50, though the subsequent twists near the end maintain engagement. The final pages may be slightly confusing, but this could stem from personal interpretation rather than a flaw in the writing."

            "This novel delves into themes of identity and intersectionality within the Black community of 1920s Chicago. It reveals the fragile nature of Nelly's glamorous socialite life, which is undermined by systemic racism. By showcasing the existence of a Black debutante culture and wealth, the book challenges prevailing biases about the era. It serves as an excellent resource for senior high school students, especially when compared to works like *The Great Gatsby*."

With gorgeously drawn characters, a compelling plot, and powerful social commentary, it challenges readers to reflect on their biases and the constructed nature of societal structures.

            "The pacing of the novel is uneven, with certain sections dragging on too long. Additionally, the major twist at the end is predictable from early on, which lessens its impact. Set in Prohibition-era Chicago, the story follows Nelly Sawyer, the daughter of the wealthiest Black man in America, as she navigates her debut into high society while pursuing her passion for investigative journalism. The narrative delves into Chicago's criminal underbelly, featuring gangsters, bootleggers, and the corrupt Mayor of Maxwell Street. Ultimately, the plot explores Nelly’s internal conflict between her familial obligations and her yearning for adventure and individuality.",
            "Nelly's character is intriguing yet occasionally inconsistent, especially in her emotional responses. Her swift transitions from hatred to love for certain characters can feel unrealistic and jarring. However, the revelation about her brother near the three-quarters mark of the story stands out, adding significant depth and emotional resonance to the narrative.",

            "The novel explores racial inequality in America and gender inequality within marginalized groups, though these themes occasionally feel underdeveloped or rushed. It effectively highlights the tension between societal expectations and personal desires, particularly through Nelly’s relationships with her two suitors: Tomás, who embodies duty and decorum, and Jay, who represents adventure and rebellion."

While the story has moments of brilliance, such as the emotional revelation about Nelly’s brother, it falls short in fully exploring its social commentary and maintaining narrative tension.",

            "This story transcends mere romance, weaving together Nelly's career ambitions, personal relationships, and the enigma surrounding the Mayor of Maxwell Street. However, the plot sometimes feels disjointed, making it challenging to follow certain characters and their roles. Despite this, the exploration of Chicago's underworld and Nelly's relentless drive to succeed as a journalist kept me thoroughly engaged.",

Following her brother's recent death, she must navigate her career ambitions alone, facing discrimination from an editor who doubts her abilities. Meanwhile, Jay Shorey, a biracial man from a poor background in Alabama, runs a speakeasy in Chicago and is drawn to Nelly. In contrast, Tomas, a European nobleman of Mexican descent, offers her the respectability that Jay lacks. Although I found some of Nelly's choices questionable, her character development and the resolution of her story were ultimately satisfying.",

While the historical context of racism is acknowledged, I anticipated a deeper exploration of this theme. For example, the cotillion is held at a venue that traditionally barred Black patrons from entering through the front door, highlighting the racial barriers of the time.",

Nelly's reflections as a woman of color are particularly poignant; she observes, “As a colored girl, you learned early on to see your own body as a threat and an ever-present danger.” Her insights into gender inequality are equally powerful: “That’s actually not the reason most wouldn’t talk to me. More often, it was because I’m a woman.”",

Nelly’s reflections on being a woman of color are poignant, as she notes, “As a colored girl, you learned early on to see your own body as a threat and an ever-present danger.” Her observations about gender inequality are equally striking: “That’s actually not the reason most wouldn’t talk to me. More often, it was because I’m a woman.”  \n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  The historical backdrop of prohibition-era Chicago is vividly portrayed, adding depth and authenticity to the story. The author’s meticulous research and love for the subject matter shine through, making the setting feel alive and immersive.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  While the majority of the novel is well-paced and engaging, the ending felt a bit overwhelming. Without giving away spoilers, I found the conclusion to be slightly overdone, which held me back from giving the book a full 5-star rating.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Author Insight:**  \n  Meeting the author in Chicago and hearing her speak about her inspiration and research process added a special layer of appreciation for the book. It deepened my connection to the story and made the experience of reading it even more meaningful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a richly layered historical fiction novel with a strong protagonist, compelling themes, and a vivid setting. While the ending felt a bit excessive, the overall journey was engaging and thought-provoking. The author’s passion for the story and its historical context shines through, making it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4⭐️ (withheld 1 star due to the overwhelming ending)."

While investigating the elusive Mayor of Maxwell Street, Nelly becomes embroiled in the criminal underworld, aided by Jay Shorey, a biracial man passing as white. Although some plot points, like Nelly's multiple narrow escapes from death, stretch believability, the overall narrative is compelling and kept me engaged throughout.",

Jay Shorey, a biracial man navigating a racially divided society, is a complex and well-developed character. The book's stunning cover caught my eye, and I thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary digital ARC provided by @netgalley and @hyperionavebooks. The cover is so beautiful that I may consider purchasing a physical copy.",

The author masterfully weaves in Art Deco elements, historic buildings, Roaring Twenties fashion, and luxury cars, creating a vivid atmosphere that feels alive. The rich details are so evocative that I could almost hear the music playing as I read. The meticulous research behind the historical elements adds authenticity to the narrative.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The novel is set in Prohibition-era Chicago, with a backdrop of speakeasies, lavish parties, and a multi-cultural night bazaar.  \n   - The author, Avery Cunningham, effectively incorporates Art Deco details, historic Chicago buildings, Roaring Twenties fashion, and expensive cars, creating a vivid and immersive atmosphere.  \n   - The setting feels alive, with details so rich that I could almost hear music playing in the background as I read.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The story follows Penelope “Nelly” Sawyer, an aspiring journalist and daughter of a wealthy horse breeder, as she navigates Black society in 1921 Chicago.  \n   - Nelly becomes entangled in the criminal underworld while investigating the elusive Mayor of Maxwell Street, aided by Jay Shorey, a biracial man passing as white.  \n   - While some plot points, such as Nelly narrowly escaping death multiple times, feel unrealistic, the overall story is intriguing and kept me invested in the outcome.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The novel explores the effects of Jim Crow laws in post-Civil War America, class differences between Chicago’s wealthy and poor Black and white populations, and women’s positions in early 20th-century society.  \n   - These themes are woven seamlessly into the narrative, adding depth and relevance to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Nelly Sawyer is a compelling protagonist, and her journey as an aspiring journalist adds an engaging layer to the story.  \n   - Jay Shorey, a biracial man navigating a racially divided society, is a complex and well-drawn character.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Research:**  \n   - The historical details in the book are meticulously researched and add authenticity to the story.  \n   - After viewing behind-the-scenes stories on Avery Cunningham’s Instagram account (@averywritesbigbooks), I gained an even greater appreciation for the historical depth included in the novel.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n   - The novel includes graphic violence, depictions of racism, racial slurs, and drug and alcohol use, which may be triggering for some readers.  \n\n- **Aesthetic and Presentation:**  \n   - The cover of the book is stunning, and I enjoyed reading a complimentary digital ARC provided by @netgalley and @hyperionavebooks.  \n   - The cover design is so beautiful that I might purchase a physical copy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel is a captivating blend of historical fiction, crime, and social commentary, set against the vibrant backdrop of Prohibition-era Chicago. While some plot elements stretch believability, the rich atmosphere, compelling characters, and thought-provoking themes make it a worthwhile read. The meticulous historical research and stunning presentation further enhance the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story is engaging and well-paced, though a minor plot line suffers from noticeable discontinuity, slightly detracting from the overall experience. Set in 1920s Chicago, the novel follows Penelope “Nelly” Sawyer, who inherits her family’s Kentucky horse breeding fortune after her brother’s death. While her parents prepare her for a debut at the cotillion and aim to marry her off to a man from another elite family, Nelly harbors her own ambitions. She secretly writes for the *Chicago Defender* under a male pen name, striving for a byline. To achieve this, she investigates the enigmatic figure known as The Mayor of Maxwell Street, who controls rival criminal factions, with the help of Jay Shorey, a speakeasy operator she meets at her brother’s funeral.",

She is smart, resourceful, and full of pluck.  \n  - Jay is complicated and slippery, making it hard to decide if he deserves a chance with Nelly. Their banter is well-timed and quick-witted.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The descriptions of the 1920s world are perfectly detailed, making me feel like I was right there alongside Nelly.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The plot is engaging and held me captive, though the setup took longer than necessary in my opinion.  \n  - The reveal of the Mayor of Maxwell Street’s identity wasn’t surprising, but how it all came to a head and the time it took to be revealed was unexpected.  \n  - The ending felt a bit abrupt and left me feeling slightly unsatisfied, even though it fit the characters and story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a masterful blend of 1920s glamour, danger, and grit, with a compelling protagonist and a richly detailed world. While the plot is engaging, the pacing could have been tighter, and the ending, though fitting, left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This novel follows Nelly, an aspiring journalist determined to uncover the secrets of the Mayor of Maxwell Street, a shadowy figure wielding power over Chicago. This central conflict propels the narrative, which spans 500 pages of engaging action and rich storytelling. However, while the book hints at a grand epic, it ultimately fails to deliver on that scale. A love triangle introduces an additional layer to the plot, but it never eclipses the primary storyline.",
            "Nelly, the protagonist, is a multifaceted character wrestling with her identity and privilege as the daughter of America's wealthiest Black man. Her internal struggle between her own joy and the suffering of others enriches her character. Jay, also known as Jimmy Blue Eyes, is a captivating figure—a mysterious criminal whose frequent encounters with Nelly inject tension and intrigue into the narrative.",
            "The writing in this debut novel is impressive, showcasing the author's skill in world-building and character development. While the novel is well-crafted, it falls short of achieving epic status, which may leave some readers wanting more.",
            "Set in Chicago during the Prohibition era, this novel immerses readers in a world of gangs, games, and glitter. The vivid portrayal of the Jim Crow years enhances the historical backdrop, creating a rich atmosphere that seamlessly blends the era's glamour with its inherent dangers."

While it excels as a debut novel, it doesn't fully achieve the epic status it seems to aim for. Nonetheless, it is an engaging read with plenty of action, intrigue, and a touch of romance.",

However, the writing style, pacing, and some unresolved aspects of the plot detracted from the overall experience. While the ending may have been intentional, it left me wanting more closure.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Penelope “Nelly” Sawyer, who returns to Chicago for her brother’s funeral and stands to inherit her family’s wealth if she participates in a coming out. However, Nelly dreams of becoming an investigative journalist and writes under a pen name about the lives of Black people during the Jim Crow era. Her next article aims to expose the Mayor of Maxwell Street, suspected of leading an underground crime syndicate. The narrative introduces a love triangle involving Nelly, Jay, a speakeasy manager, and Tomas, a wealthy man, but it doesn’t fully develop into a traditional romance by the end. While I found the plot engaging, I felt the book could have benefited from a tighter edit, as the pacing was occasionally slow and the numerous characters made it confusing at times.",
            "Nelly is a compelling protagonist driven by her ambitions and a desire to escape societal constraints. While Jay and Tomas are intriguing characters, their relationships with Nelly feel underdeveloped, particularly as the love triangle fails to fully materialize.",

            "Set in 1920s Chicago, this novel offers a vivid portrayal of the city during that era, which I, as a lifelong Chicagoan, truly appreciated. The exploration of Black Chicago during the Jim Crow era is especially compelling, shedding light on a frequently overlooked aspect of history."

While the plot was engaging and the world-building was exceptional, the pacing and character development could have been stronger. Despite some confusion with the characters and a desire for a more concise narrative, I thoroughly enjoyed the historical depth and setting.",

It is an ambitious debut that will resonate with fans of historical fiction, but it falls short in delivering a consistently compelling narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

The gritty portrayal of the city clashes sharply with the realities of Jim Crow, showing how privilege, wealth, and prestige are powerless against the violence of anti-black racism.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The book effectively delves into themes of race, wealth, crime, and inequality. It highlights the struggles of navigating a society where systemic racism overshadows personal achievements and aspirations.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Nelly Sawyer is a spirited and gifted heroine, and her character is well-written. However, I didn’t personally connect with her personality or find her likable. The rivalry between the mysterious Jay and the wealthy Thomas for Nelly’s love adds an interesting dynamic to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  The central point of the book seems to be Nelly’s internal conflict. Despite her dreams, she isn’t willing to sacrifice her family name or forsake her pursuit of truth to achieve them.

The juxtaposition of wealth and refinement against the oppressive rules of the time was compelling and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The story is more of a \"who is it\" rather than a \"who dunnit.\" While I had a strong suspicion about the Mayor's identity early on, I kept hoping for a twist that would point to someone else. The lack of a surprising twist was a bit disappointing.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is excellent. The author's style was so engaging that I felt compelled to read every sentence, even when I tried to skim due to a deadline.  \n\n- **Character Development (Nelly):**  \n  Nelly, a young and determined journalist, was a weak point for me. While her ambition was clear, her reckless behavior and the risks she took to further her career felt excessive. Her actions led to dangerous consequences, including deaths, which made her character less sympathetic.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book was fairly long, but I wouldn’t have minded an additional 50 pages if it meant resolving some of the unanswered questions, especially regarding the ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book engaging and well-written, with a fascinating historical backdrop.

I found myself cheering for her every step of the way.",

However, I noticed the use of \"Ms.\" in a context where \"Miss\" would have been more appropriate, as \"Ms.\" is a more modern term that emerged in the 1980s. I've encountered this issue in several historical novels lately, likely penned by authors born after that shift.",
            "I wholeheartedly recommend this book. It’s a rare gem that allows readers to fully immerse themselves in its world. Kudos to the author! I hope to see more historical novels like this in the future!"

While I noted a minor historical inaccuracy, it did not detract from my overall enjoyment. They highly recommend the book and eagerly anticipate more works from the author.",

I was ultimately invested in Nelly’s story overall, not just her article.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Book:**  \n  The strength of the book is much more in the journey of the story and the world-building than the culmination of the ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this book to be an engaging read, particularly due to its rich historical setting, compelling premise, and strong focus on character development and world-building. While the pacing was slow and the mystery predictable, the journey of the story kept me invested.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

I found the main character, Nelly, decent enough to root for, and the twist at the end was good, even if it wasn’t the most surprising.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  My primary issue with the book was the final two chapters. The author could have let the twist unfold naturally, but instead, they added extra layers of mystery, including a truly bizarre epilogue and a confusing change in writing style, which almost overshadowed the rest of the story.  \n\n- **Potential for Improvement:**  \n  With a better ending, this book would have been a 4-star read for me. I’m sad it didn’t quite reach that level.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was enjoyable and had a solid main character and a decent twist, the overly complicated and confusing ending detracted from the overall experience. A more streamlined conclusion would have significantly improved my impression of the novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned, but the reviewer implies it fell short of a 4-star rating."

She risked her life too easily and gave no consideration to her parents or their safety, which made her decisions hard to believe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this novel, it ultimately fell short for me. The pacing, historical authenticity, and character decisions left me unsatisfied, and I can’t recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n  The novel is set in 1920s Chicago during the Roaring Twenties, a time and place filled with potential for intrigue and excitement, especially with the gangland backdrop. This initially drew me in and made me eager to explore the story.  \n\n- **Length and Pacing:**  \n  The book is 500 pages long, which typically doesn’t bother me as I enjoy longer reads depending on my mood. However, in this case, the length felt unjustified. Despite the extensive page count, the story didn’t engage me as much as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  One of my biggest disappointments was the lack of character growth. After reading 500 pages, I didn’t feel like I knew the characters any better than when I started. This left me feeling disconnected and unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Author Potential:**  \n  I’m always excited to discover a great debut author, and I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, by the end of the book, I was left wanting more—more depth, more connection, and more fulfillment from the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the setting and premise of the novel held great promise, the execution fell short for me. The length of the book didn’t translate into meaningful character development or a compelling narrative, leaving me ultimately disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

At 500 pages, it felt unnecessarily long, and I struggled to finish it.  \n- **Plot Coherence:** There were significant plot gaps that made the storyline choppy and somewhat unbelievable.  \n- **Character Development:** The character development was weak. I never fully understood the histories of the characters, which made it hard to connect with them.  \n- **Historical Authenticity:** The behaviors of the main character, who was supposed to be part of \"high society,\" felt unrealistic for the time period the story is set in.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this book, it fell short of my expectations. The slow pacing, weak character development, and plot inconsistencies made it a challenging read. The historical inaccuracies further detracted from my enjoyment. Overall, it was just an \"OK\" experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the writing style was enjoyable, the plot’s complexity, uneven pacing, and excessive side characters detracted from the experience. With tighter editing, this could have been a more cohesive and satisfying read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story placed too much emphasis on dialogue-heavy scenes, overshadowing the investigative elements, which I found disappointing. I would have preferred a stronger focus on the Mayor and the central mystery instead of the tangential subplots. The romance between Nelly and Jay was poorly executed; Nelly's attraction to Jay felt inconsistent, especially given her disdain for his patronizing attitude. The marketing pitch of a love worth fighting for was misleading and did not reflect the actual content. Additionally, the novel felt excessively long; it could have been significantly improved if it were 200 pages shorter, as the length detracted from the overall enjoyment and made the story drag.",

Cunningham demonstrates excellent writing skills and shows great potential as a writer.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The story dragged significantly, particularly in the first half of the novel. It took too long for the protagonists to team up, which slowed the momentum and made the narrative feel sluggish.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The heroine's characterization was inconsistent and often exhausting, making it difficult to connect with or root for her. Her actions and personality lacked coherence, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Surprises:**  \n  The reveal of the Mayor's identity was predictable and lacked the intended impact, diminishing the suspense and intrigue that could have elevated the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  I struggled to finish the novel and found myself rushing through the second half, as the pacing issues and lack of compelling character development made it a challenging read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing premise and showcased the author's potential, its slow pacing, inconsistent characterization, and predictable twists ultimately made it a disappointing read. I had high expectations but found it difficult to stay engaged throughout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The storyline is compelling and provides a fresh perspective on a well-trodden historical era.  \n\n- **Writing and Editing:**  \n  While the story is engaging, the book could benefit from more rigorous editing. I hope this will be addressed before its final publication in January 2024.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel presents a unique and compelling take on the Gilded Age, with a strong focus on a Black debutante's aspirations in 1920s Chicago. However, the writing could be improved with better editing to enhance the overall reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I have a lot of admiration for her, as she is well-developed and inspiring.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The biggest issue I had with the book was its length. I don’t believe it needed to be over 500 pages long, as it felt unnecessarily drawn out at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a good book with a compelling and admirable protagonist. However, the excessive length detracted from my enjoyment, making it feel longer than necessary.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As someone who loves stories from this era, it was a treat to immerse myself in that world.  \n\n- **Cultural Perspective:**  \n  Reading a story from the African American experience during this time period was refreshing, especially since it focused on a high-class perspective, which isn’t often explored.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Potential Adaptations:**  \n  The book gave me strong *Great Gatsby* vibes, and I could easily envision it being adapted into a movie.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Source:**  \n  I’d like to thank Net Galley for providing me with the ARC (Advanced Reader Copy) of this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel for its captivating setting, unique cultural perspective, and cinematic potential. It was a refreshing and engaging read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n7/10"
