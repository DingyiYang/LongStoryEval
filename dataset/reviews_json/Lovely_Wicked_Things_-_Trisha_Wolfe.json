They were having sexually charged arguments in front of their co-workers while standing in front of a dead body. What an uncomfortable work environment.  \n   - I even felt bad for the rich cultist lady. She threw a nice party for the whole town, and it gets crashed by the feds who 1) bother her with sensitive questions while she’s trying to host and 2) dry hump up on her terrace in front of the whole party after she’s asked them to leave.  \n\n- **Philosophical Overtones:**  \n   - The book made me think that someone had a BIG crush on their philosophy professor. It felt overly philosophical, which detracted from the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the first two books in the trilogy, this installment felt overwritten and overly philosophical, making it less engaging. The awkward dialogue and situations, combined with difficulty recalling characters, further diminished my enjoyment. Despite some humorous moments, the book didn’t live up to my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book features two narrators: Helen and Calum. Calum, a captivating philosophy professor, is intelligent and full of ideas, yet his perspective primarily reveals his deep love for Helen and how her presence has transformed him. While this isn't necessarily a flaw, Calum remains a mysterious figure who often communicates in cryptic ways, even with Helen. \n\nHelen, the main character, shares her thoughts clearly, especially regarding her feelings for Calum and the intimate scenes. However, when it comes to the story's mystery elements, her insights are lacking. She often exclaims phrases like, “Oh my God,” “I can’t believe it,” and “I was right,” which leaves me confused and wondering about the context. This shift in perspective feels like a transition from first-person to a limited third-person viewpoint, as if the narrative suddenly steps back to describe Helen from an outside perspective. This makes it challenging to follow the mystery, as I can only piece together the case through dialogue.",
            "I found the characters engaging, particularly Calum, who is both intriguing and mysterious. Professor Locke stood out as the only character I genuinely appreciated, though I wish the writing had done more to capture his complexity."

        "conclusion": "The book had great potential, but its execution fell short due to issues with the narrative structure and perspective. While the characters, especially Calum and Professor Locke, were intriguing, the way Helen’s thoughts were handled during the mystery elements made it difficult to fully engage with the story. The shift in perspective and lack of clarity in Helen’s reasoning left me frustrated and disconnected from the plot.",

However, it fell short due to some mistakes.  \n   - I kept thinking about what was bothering me in the first book, even though I liked the characters and found the mystery intriguing.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Perspective:**  \n   - The book has two narrators: Helen and Calum.  \n   - Calum is a fascinating philosophy professor who is very intelligent and full of ideas, but his perspective doesn’t reveal much to the reader except how much he loves Helen and how she saved him with her presence. This isn’t necessarily a problem because Calum is a deeply mysterious character who speaks in codes, even with Helen.  \n   - Helen is the main character, and the story is told from her perspective. Her thoughts about Calum and every detail of the sex scenes are clearly expressed. However, when it comes to the mystery elements, Helen doesn’t provide any insight into her thoughts. Instead, she says things like, “Oh my God,” “I can’t believe it,” “I can’t breathe,” or “I was right.” As a reader, this leaves me confused, wondering, “What are you talking about?”  \n   - The first-person perspective feels like it shifts to a limited third-person perspective, as if the narrator suddenly becomes someone else describing Helen from the outside. This makes it hard to follow the mystery because the reader can only track the case through dialogue.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - I really liked the characters, especially Calum, who is intriguing and mysterious.  \n   - Professor Locke is the only character I truly enjoyed in the book.

            "The trilogy suffers from excessive drama and repetition, with characters often going in circles. The reveal of The Harbinger feels anticlimactic and unnecessary, lacking a meaningful impact on the story or its characters. Additionally, the slow pacing and heavy dialogue contribute to a dragging narrative.",
            "The main characters, Kallum (MMC) and Halen (FMC), are mentally unstable and overly dramatic, leading to inconsistent and frustrating actions and decisions. Halen's struggle to pursue the truth while simultaneously evading it—illustrated by her deleting Kallum's email without reading it—remains an awkward and contrived theme. Their obsession with each other overshadows any genuine romance, making their relationship feel unhealthy rather than compelling. The romance revolves more around obsession than authentic connection, which makes it difficult to support their relationship. The smut was present but mediocre and devoid of emotional depth, resulting in a rating of .75/5. Although the unique representation of Halen’s poliosis and Kallum’s heterochromia adds a distinctive touch, it ultimately fails to impact the story significantly.",

            "This trilogy features a fantastic storyline, showcasing the author's skill and thoughtfulness through its intricate plot. However, the last 20% of the book was confusing, particularly the final chapter, which left me questioning whether it presented an alternate beginning or a \"what if\" scenario. Despite the author's efforts to clarify various situations, I found many aspects difficult to understand. While I appreciated the happy ending for Kallum and Halen, I felt uneasy about the suggestion of them possibly having a child, considering their past actions and identities. Overall, the final chapter's implications were unclear, and I struggled to piece together the events and their significance.",

The story effectively employs the invisible string and \"touch her and die\" tropes, which enhance their dynamic.

Devyn is also a highly misunderstood character, and her arc becomes clear and heartbreaking by the end. Wellington, on the other hand, is the worst character, as his actions set off much of Halen's suffering.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Complexity:**  \n  The writing is very well-crafted, with countless insightful and heartbreaking quotes. However, some of Kallum's philosophical dialogue can be challenging to understand without prior knowledge or frequent use of Google. This slightly impacts the ease of reading, which I rated a 7.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing is solid, earning an 8. It keeps the story engaging without feeling rushed or dragged out.  \n\n- **Love Story:**  \n  The love story between Kallum and Halen is bittersweet and obsessive. Kallum orchestrates much of the plot to keep Halen safe and give her a reason to live, making their relationship both tragic and compelling. I rated the love story a 9.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending, particularly Kallum's \"What If\" POV, is poignant and adds depth to the story. It leaves you wishing things could have been simpler for the characters. I gave the ending a 9.  \n\n- **Enjoyability:**  \n  Despite its emotional heaviness and complexity, the book is highly enjoyable, earning an 8.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a deeply emotional and complex novel that blends dark romance with murder and mystery. While it requires some effort to fully grasp the philosophical elements, the well-crafted plot, exceptional character development, and heartbreaking love story make it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Quality of Writing: 9  \n- Plot Development: 9  \n- Pace: 8  \n- Characters: 9  \n- Ease of Reading: 7  \n- Enjoyability: 8  \n- Love Story: 9  \n- Ending: 9"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Personal Preference:**  \n  I know taste is personal, but I am *baffled* at some of the hate this series receives. I’m only dipping into dark romance as it’s not my go-to genre, and I love it. Perhaps that’s why? But it’s fine—I loved this series, and I may dabble more in dark romances thanks to it.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Engagement:**  \n  SCREAMING, CRYING, THROWING UP! This last installation of the series nearly had me ripping the pages—which is impossible because I read on Kindle, but still, if it were a physical book, I may not have been delicate turning the pages. The emotional intensity was off the charts.\n\n- **Plot Twists and Predictability:**  \n  I had my suspicions about Riddick and literally the *whole town*, so while it still had a slight shock factor, I did see it coming. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The reveal of Kallum at the end of the book literally being the killer… I really wanted it to be Wellington, but he did give closure on the parent hit-and-run, so I can’t be mad about it. Even with the confirmation of Kallum, I still felt sorry for him and his mental state.\n\n- **Character Development and Closure:**  \n  Kallum’s character arc was both shocking and heartbreaking. Despite being the killer, his mental state made me empathize with him. Wellington’s role in providing closure on the parent hit-and-run was satisfying, even if I initially wanted him to be the killer.\n\n- **Humor and Self-Awareness:**  \n  Delusion: Table for one? That’s me, lol. That’s all I have to say. 🤣\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis series was a thrilling and emotionally charged journey, especially for someone new to the dark romance genre. The plot twists, character depth, and emotional engagement kept me hooked, even if some reveals were predictable. It’s a series that has left a lasting impression and may have opened the door for me to explore more dark romances.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐️ (rounded to 5)"

I gasped, I blushed, and I even cried.  \n\n- **Character Development and Favorites:**  \n   - I love Halen. She’s an incredible character, but my heart beats so hard for Kallum.

Kallum and Halen could not get enough of each other, and I couldn’t get enough of them.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - I recently listened to *Lovely Bad Things* and *Lovely Violent Things* to refresh my brain for this release. Last time, I read the e-books for both of these, and the audio was a whole new experience.  \n   - Perfection is not a good enough way to describe Joe Arden’s depiction of Kallum. The unhinged obsession was portrayed perfectly. You could feel how much Kallum needed his muse.  \n   - Lucy Rivers did a fantastic job with Halen. Her voice let us experience Halen's distrust, confusion, and lust in a way that words alone can’t.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Target Audience:**  \n   - I highly recommend this trilogy to any dark romance lovers, especially those who enjoy OTT characters, dark academia, and mysteries with shocking plot twists.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis trilogy, culminating in *Lovely Wicked Things*, was a masterpiece that left me emotionally invested and deeply satisfied.

            "The plot was confusing and difficult to follow, leaving me lost 80% of the time. Instead of a clear narrative, the story heavily emphasized philosophical themes from Nietzsche, Plato, and Aristotle. While these elements were manageable in the first two books, they became overwhelming and frustrating in this installment.",

In contrast, Kallum emerged as a standout; his obsession and deranged nature made his chapters the most engaging. The romance, however, fell flat. While there was undeniable chemistry between the characters, it leaned more toward lust and obsession than a genuine connection. The author often transformed potential romantic moments into explicit scenes, which undermined the emotional depth of their relationship. Overall, the tone resembled philosophical erotica more than dark romance, which did not align with my preferences."

Their relationship was electric, and the spice was even better! It took a while for Halen to completely give in to Kallum, but given the circumstances—like the killer planting evidence against him—it made sense why she had doubts. Her biggest fear was her feelings for him, which added depth to her character.  \n\n- **Plot and Genre Blend:**  \n  Trisha did a great job with the plot in this dark romance story. It’s not your typical dark romance series; it has a strong thriller/crime/suspense vibe as well. The combination of these genres made the story engaging and unique.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n  The descriptive gore and violence were vivid, almost like watching a movie. The author did an excellent job of painting scenes so clearly that you could visualize them in your head.  \n\n- **Reader Recommendations and Warnings:**  \n  If you’re a fan of thrillers, crime, or suspense with a good plot and plenty of spice, this is the book for you. However, check the trigger warnings, as there is quite a bit of descriptive gore and violence.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a fantastic conclusion to the series, blending dark romance with thriller and suspense elements.

The mystery could have been resolved more effectively, and the book series should have been condensed into two books instead of three.  \n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The toxic nature of the relationship seemed to be a central theme, but it was executed in a way that left me frustrated rather than engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a disappointing addition to the series. Kallum’s behavior became even more intolerable, and the toxic dynamics between him and the FMC overshadowed any potential for a compelling story. The plot felt stretched, and the series would have been better served as a duology.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This series was my first deep dive into the genre, and I found the eerie vibe of the town to be a character in itself, which I loved. The satanic, occult, and philosophical elements of the murder mystery really hooked me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  While the story was engaging, I felt it didn’t need to be a trilogy. It could have been condensed into just two books without losing its impact.  \n\n- **Complexity and Readability:**  \n  Despite the story’s attempts to be complex, it was still easy enough to read and follow along, which I appreciated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this dark academia series was a compelling introduction to the genre for me. The atmospheric setting and intriguing mystery kept me engaged, though I felt the story could have been more concise. Despite its complexity, it remained accessible and enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The excessive talk and comparisons made it hard to get through.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved Kallum and Halen as characters. Kallum, in particular, stood out to me as a compelling and intriguing \"psycho\" character.\n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The twist at the end was predictable, as I had already guessed it was Kallum from the start. This predictability made the series feel less engaging.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my appreciation for the characters, the series as a whole was annoying and difficult to finish.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the characters, especially Kallum, the series suffered from pacing issues, predictability, and an overly drawn-out narrative. It could have been more impactful if it were shorter and less repetitive.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It didn’t hold my attention as well as the first two books in the series. I suspect this might be because I read the first two books back-to-back and then had to wait months before reading the third one, which affected my connection to the story.\n\n- **Overall Story Quality:**  \n  Despite the slow start, the story as a whole is good. The series, taken together, is solid and enjoyable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the third book didn’t captivate me as much as the first two, the series overall is well-written and worth reading. The initial pacing was a hurdle, but the story ultimately delivers.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5 stars (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️) for the entire series."

            "This dark academia tale is intricately woven and full of unexpected twists. Halen and Kallum uncover not just a serial killer, but also a town shrouded in mystery, where many are missing, dead, or brainwashed. The narrative is rife with dark turns, challenging perceptions at every turn. The moral ambiguity of the characters heightens the intrigue, prompting readers to ponder who is truly good, who is bad, and who is genuinely wicked.",
            "In this gripping narrative, criminologist Halen seeks the insights of Kallum Locke, a philosopher confined due to insanity. Their relationship is fraught with tension, as Halen previously testified against Kallum, resulting in his institutionalization. Kallum's extraordinary and magnetic personality adds depth to their complex connection. As he poignantly states, “For the desensitized, to feel alive, we perpetually balance on the brink of death.”",
            "The story explores the themes of darkness, light, and the duality of human nature through the inevitable connection between Halen and Kallum. Halen muses, “I can’t stop myself from being drawn to Kallum. It’s the light we’re drawn to. The light is so lovely it’s blinding. Some cages, we design for ourselves.” Their relationship embodies a delicate balance of these opposing forces, as Kallum acknowledges, “In the same way Halen needs me to harbor her darkness, I need her to offset the violence that wants to consume. Without her, I’d be utterly lost to it.”"

The story might have been more effective as a duology with expanded earlier installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 ⭐️"

Every time I think Trisha can’t give us a better-matched couple, she does!  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  The atmosphere of the story is almost its own character, along with the town of Hollow’s Row. The amount of secrets that this town holds is mind-blowing.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Secrets:**  \n  Not to mention the secrets that Kallum has kept locked away.  \n\n- **Plot and Writing Style:**  \n  This story had everything you’d expect from the author: a ton of research, twists and turns, unique spice (*eyebrow waggle*), interesting side characters, and a little bit of a headache when your brain can’t handle everything that’s being thrown at it—but in a good way!  \n\n- **Resolution and Future Potential:**  \n  I’m glad everything was wrapped up, from the cult of Hollow’s Row to the Harbinger Killer, but I feel like there’s still a lot of story to be told for this nontraditional couple. I wouldn’t mind seeing them have a run-in with another couple of Trisha’s that I love, just saying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book lived up to my high expectations, delivering a unique and captivating story with well-developed characters, a richly atmospheric setting, and a plot full of twists and secrets. While the main storylines were satisfyingly resolved, there’s still potential for more adventures with Kallum and Halen, and I’d love to see them interact with other beloved characters from the author’s universe.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The excessive use of philosophical jargon, especially during intimate scenes, felt overwhelming and unnecessary. It disrupted the flow and made the reading experience less enjoyable.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book felt overly verbose, with too many words that detracted from the story rather than enhancing it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the first two books in the series were engaging and balanced philosophical elements well, this installment went overboard with its philosophical content, particularly during key scenes. The excessive verbosity and lack of balance made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
