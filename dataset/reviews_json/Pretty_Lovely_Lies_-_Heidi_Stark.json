Additionally, the narrative focused on elements that didn‚Äôt contribute significantly to the main plot, leaving out crucial timeframes that made it hard to grasp the overall story.",

Meanwhile, her 12-year-old daughter, Yara, behaves more like a child of 6 or 7, both in her actions and dialogue.",

At 250 pages, the book seemed underdeveloped; it would have benefited from being around 800 pages to fully explore its themes. The pacing was too quick, leaving me with a sense of missing information. By the halfway point, the narrative began to unravel, and I resorted to skim-reading the final 15% just to finish."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Concept and Execution:**  \n   - The plot idea was excellent and had me excited to read the book.  \n   - However, the execution felt disjointed, with frequent jumps between plot points that left gaps in the narrative.  \n   - Some plot points seemed included for shock value rather than contributing to the story's development.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The Main Female Character (MFC), Alina, was not the badass I expected. She often made poor decisions, putting herself and Yara in danger due to her codependency and quick infatuation with three separate men.  \n   - Alina‚Äôs inner dialogue portrayed her as strong and independent, but her actions contradicted this, making her seem like someone who relied on men to save her.  \n   - Yara, on the other hand, was more proactive and ultimately made the decisive move that saved everyone.  \n   - Morello was a well-written character, but I wished for a deeper, slower-burn love story between him and Alina.  \n\n- **Pacing and Timeline:**  \n   - The timeline felt muddled, making it hard to follow the progression of events.  \n   - I often had to re-read chapters, thinking I missed important context, only to realize it wasn‚Äôt provided.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - The book relied heavily on Alina‚Äôs inner dialogue to convey her strength and emotions, which felt forced. I wanted to feel her growth and emotions through her actions rather than being told how to feel.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Overall Impression:**  \n   - Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the book, particularly the spicy elements.  \n   - I wished the book had been longer to allow for more character and relationship development.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a compelling plot and some enjoyable moments, its disjointed pacing, underdeveloped characters, and reliance on inner dialogue over action left me wanting more. The book had potential but needed more depth and coherence to fully deliver on its promise.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

I think the book could have been better if there had been more details and if the events had been drawn out a little more.  \n\n- **Character Development (Alina):**  \n  I got irritated with Alina's character halfway through the book. She is supposed to be trying to create a better life for Yara, but I didn‚Äôt feel like she was cautious enough in her actions. This lack of depth in her decision-making made it harder for me to connect with her character.  \n\n- **Character Development (Yara):**  \n  Yara‚Äôs portrayal bothered me. She is supposed to be a 12-year-old, but the way she was described made her sound much younger. This inconsistency in her character took away from the believability of the story.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The story is a good mafia/FBI romance, and it has potential. However, it could have been more compelling with richer details and a more developed plot.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I‚Äôve been in a reading slump this month, and this book didn‚Äôt help pull me out of it.
