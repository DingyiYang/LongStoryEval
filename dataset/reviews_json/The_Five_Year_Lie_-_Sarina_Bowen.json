Now, I hope she comes out with more thrillers, and I am okay if it has some romance with it because she did it well in this book.\n\n- **Imagery and Scene Visualization:**  \n  I can still see the scenes from the book in my mind. She was also able to endear me to some of the characters.\n\n- **Plot and Execution:**  \n  The plot twists and reveals were also good. The premise was what made me pick up this book. I was not disappointed because it was executed well. It was thrilling and suspenseful. I was at the edge of my seat, and I kept reading because I was too invested! I wanted the characters to be okay.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The only reason why it took me 10 days to finish this was because of responsibilities. :D This was amazing. Can't wait to get my hands on Dying to Meet You!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a thrilling and suspenseful read that kept me engaged from start to finish. The author's ability to blend thriller elements with a touch of romance was impressive, especially for her first attempt in the genre. The well-executed plot, memorable scenes, and endearing characters made it one of my favorite reads of 2024. I eagerly anticipate more thrillers from this author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The twists and revelations kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat. The dual timelines are skillfully executed, providing clarity and depth without causing confusion. The intriguing premise—a cellular provider glitch that causes a massive dump of texts from five years prior—leads to both awkward and dramatic situations. Centered around Ariel, the daughter of a CEO, and Drew, a programmer with hidden motives, the narrative's complexity is enhanced by the interplay between the present and the past. An unexpected text from the now-deceased Drew triggers a series of events that unravel secrets and compel Ariel to confront her history. The revelation that Drew may not have left voluntarily adds an exciting twist to the story.",

Her emotional journey, particularly after receiving Drew’s late text, is both compelling and relatable.

Zain, another employee, plays a pivotal role in helping Ariel uncover the truth, adding further depth to the narrative.",

This is her first attempt at suspense, and I was curious to see how it would turn out. The synopsis immediately hooked me.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The story follows Ariel, a young single mother who receives a life-changing message one morning: Drew, the only man she ever loved but who left her, wants to meet her under a tree to discuss something important. The problem? Drew died five years ago. Ariel goes to the meeting, but no one shows up. This message shatters everything she believed about Drew’s departure. The more she digs for answers, the darker the revelations become. Two things are clear: everything she thought she knew about what happened five years ago is a lie, and someone is still lying to her today. Ariel is determined to uncover the truth, but for her safety and her son’s, she must find it before someone else does. Along the way, she might also discover what really happened to Drew.\n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**\n   - It was a fantastic read. It’s nearly impossible to put the book down because you’re so eager to find out what happens next. The plot is well-crafted, with thrilling moments and questions that pile up as the mystery deepens. There’s plenty of suspense, action, and emotion, ensuring that I was never bored.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - I really liked the main characters. Ariel is determined and a great mother, but she’s also a bit lost in her life, which is understandable given the events she faces. However, she has a slightly selfish side where she makes everything about herself, which can be a bit annoying at times. Drew, on the other hand, is very intriguing. I can’t say much more about him without spoiling the story, but he’s an extremely interesting character.\n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**\n   - The themes explored are very interesting, particularly those concerning privacy and new technologies. It’s almost a bit scary when you follow the story and realize that some of it might not be entirely fictional.\n\n- **Author's Future Work:**\n   - For a first suspense novel, this is very successful, and I think I’ll read more if Sarina Bowen decides to continue in this genre. In the meantime, I’m looking forward to reading the next installments in her romance series. Her upcoming book, *Golden Touch*, is set to release in July, and I can’t wait to read it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a gripping suspense novel with intriguing and endearing characters. If you enjoy suspenseful stories that keep you on the edge of your seat, this book is for you!\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

It evoked a warm, comforting feeling, especially during poignant moments, like when the main character realized Jay was alive through his whistling or when a stranger on the bus gifted her $100.

And what, was I supposed to not read one of her books?? Definitely not.\n\n- **Engagement and Hook:**  \n  This book was sooooo good. I got about 10% in and was hooked. By 25% I almost felt like in Clue when it could be literally anyone. By 75% I started to actually question even the good characters, no one was to be trusted!\n\n- **Story Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The structure of the story and the way it unfolded was perfect. The pacing was also on point. I think I did get to a point where I could not figure out what more she could be giving us, there was still a lot of book left. It did not feel like it dragged on, though. In fact, we got a little more than I was anticipating on the last leg, which I was really happy about.\n\n- **Author’s Versatility:**  \n  Just further proof—Sarina can do anything. She could probably make me love a horror even (please don’t write a horror though).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an incredible read, even for someone who typically avoids thrillers and suspense.

The narrative alternates between the present, where the FMC Ariel receives a strange text from her dead ex-lover and embarks on a mission to uncover the truth, and the past, which explores how they met and what he was doing before his death. This dual timeline added depth and intrigue to the story.  \n\n- **Genre Blend (Thriller and Romance):**  \n  The novel masterfully combines elements of a thriller and a romance. The present-day mystery surrounding the text and Ariel’s investigation creates a gripping thriller, while the past timeline delves into their romantic relationship, making it a well-rounded and engaging read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel surprised me in the best way possible. The time jumps, which I usually dislike, enhanced the story, and the seamless blend of thriller and romance kept me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the ending felt rushed and the villain’s fate was unsatisfying, the story’s emotional depth and Ariel’s strength as a mother made it a memorable and enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

What initially seemed like a decent premise evolved into something much deeper: imagine losing someone who vanishes without a trace, only to receive a text from them five years later. The catch?

            "The novel opens with a captivating premise: Ariel receives a text from her deceased ex, Drew, who vanished five years ago, prompting her to investigate his disappearance. While I remained engaged throughout, the suspense unfolds at a sluggish pace, leading to an uneven reading experience. The climax, unfortunately, is brief—lasting only about five pages—leaving me wishing for a more developed and impactful resolution.",
            "In this story, Ariel, the protagonist, works at her family's company, Chime Co., where she encounters Drew. To uncover his secrets, she enlists the help of her colleague Zain, a computer coder. While Zain plays a crucial role in the investigation's technical aspects, Ariel's involvement feels passive. Much of the sleuthing is conveyed through Zain's discoveries or Ariel's off-page actions, like her calls to cemeteries, rather than unfolding in real-time. This approach diminishes the immersive quality of the investigative process.",
            "In their debut in this genre, the author has done a commendable job. The story maintains a steady suspense, but the slow buildup and absence of a more explosive or detailed climax left me wanting more. Additionally, the narrative relies heavily on exposition, often telling rather than showing the action and discoveries."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the novel presents an intriguing mystery with a unique premise, but its slow pacing and underdeveloped climax detract from its potential. While the characters and their dynamics are interesting, the investigative process could have been more engaging if it unfolded on-page rather than being summarized. Despite these shortcomings, it’s a solid effort for the author’s first foray into the suspense genre.",

The pacing was really good, with different twists and turns along the way.

I loved seeing Ariel's interactions with her son and how being a mom was so important to her. The backstory of how she met Drew and their relationship up until his death was compelling. Zain, who is quiet and reserved, worked with Ariel to solve the mystery of the text, and their mutual trust and respect were beautifully depicted.  \n\n- **Romance Elements:**  \n  Sarina is known for her romance writing, and it felt natural that she included a touch of her craft in this book. The romantic elements made me swoony and even inspired me to check out her hockey romances (which I may or may not already have on my shelf).  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The audiobook had three narrators: Kathleen Early, Gary Tiedemann, and Jason Clarke. All three did a fantastic job, especially Kathleen, who handled the bulk of the narration as Ariel. Their performances added depth to the respective points of view.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This book is a strong debut for Sarina in a genre outside her norm. It combines thriller elements with a little romance and a messy family dynamic, making it a compelling read for fans of such stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a captivating read with excellent pacing, well-developed relationships, and a touch of romance. The audiobook narration was outstanding, and I’m excited to see more from Sarina in this genre.

The portrayal of Ariel’s relationship with her son stands out as a strong point, but the lack of genuine danger to the protagonist limits its intensity. It’s a solid choice for readers who enjoy lighter romantic suspense with a tech twist.",

It intertwines elements of romantic suspense with tech-driven intrigue, focusing on corporate espionage, cybersecurity threats, and police corruption.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot felt somewhat slow and predictable to me. However, the concept of a tech-centric suspense was innovative and frighteningly realistic. The characters’ actions, especially toward the end, felt a bit over-the-top.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The highlight of the book was the portrayal of Ariel’s relationship with her son. The author effectively captures Ariel’s commitment to being a good mother and her frantic efforts to keep her son safe as the stakes rise.  \n\n- **Thriller Elements:**  \n  The lack of genuine danger to Ariel’s safety kept the book from being a true thriller in my opinion.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  The novel includes brief mentions or descriptions of sensitive topics such as suicide, drug overdose, stalking, bullying, domestic abuse, and emotional and sexual abuse.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  If you're a fan of romantic suspense with a tech twist and prefer violence that isn't too graphic, this novel is a good choice.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book offers an innovative blend of romantic suspense and tech-driven intrigue, its slow pacing and predictable plot detract from its potential as a true thriller. The portrayal of Ariel’s relationship with her son stands out as a strong point, but the lack of genuine danger to the protagonist limits its intensity.

Just be aware of the strong language before diving in.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a compelling and enjoyable read, though the audiobook narration and strong language were minor drawbacks. It’s a book I’d recommend, but with a heads-up about its content.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars."

It alternates between five years ago and the present, providing essential background information. However, the mystery is largely resolved or easily guessed by mid-story, diminishing the element of surprise. While some questions remain unanswered, the resolution lacks a compelling twist. The narrative is laden with detail, some of which feels superfluous and detracts from the overall enjoyment. For instance, the lengthy bus ride with Buzz and the pickpocketing incident do not significantly advance the plot. Additionally, the extensive descriptions of Ariel and Drew’s relationship could have been streamlined without losing their emotional impact.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The novel features a whirlwind romance, a sudden disappearance, family secrets, murder, and a years-long mystery that unravels in a steady, tumultuous revelation.  \n   - The story alternates between five years ago and the present day, providing necessary background information.  \n   - The mystery is solved or easily guessed by mid-story, which reduces the surprise element. While there are unanswered questions, the resolution lacks a strong twist.  \n\n- **Pacing and Detail:**  \n   - The story includes a lot of detail, some of which feels unnecessary and detracts from the overall enjoyment.  \n   - Specific examples include the detailed bus ride with Buzz and the pickpocketing incident, which don’t significantly contribute to the plot.  \n   - The detailed descriptions of Ariel and Drew’s relationship could have been pared down without losing impact.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n   - Ariel Cafferty is a single mother to her four-year-old son, Buzz, and is driven to uncover the truth about Drew’s disappearance.  \n   - Zain, Ariel’s tech-savvy co-worker, is a standout character, and more dialogue with him would have been preferable over interactions with Buzz.  \n   - The story is more mystery-driven than character-driven, with the mystery itself feeling like the main character rather than the individuals.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Despite the pacing issues and excessive detail, the book is an intriguing read with all the elements of a great story.  \n   - The reviewer enjoyed the book overall and would recommend it, though with some reservations about the pacing and lack of surprise in the mystery.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Five Year Lie* is a compelling novel with a mix of romance, mystery, and family secrets. While the detailed storytelling and predictable resolution slightly detract from the experience, the intriguing plot and standout characters like Zain make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded up to 4."

            "The story is gripping, with 80% of the action occurring in the final 20% of the book. It begins slowly, following Ariel as she unravels the mystery, but the suspense builds effectively throughout. The plot is reminiscent of *The Last Thing He Told Me*, enhanced by a romance subplot that I found more enjoyable. While the pacing is uneven, with most action concentrated at the end, the initial slow start made it challenging to stay fully engaged. Nevertheless, the suspense kept my interest throughout.",
            "I struggled to connect with Ariel as a character. As a trust-fund baby living in her mother’s guest house and working a minimal job, she lacked motivation. It wasn’t until the final 20% of the book that she stepped outside her comfort zone, which left me wishing she had taken more initiative earlier. Her stagnation over five years, particularly in dealing with her father’s death, felt unrealistic. Additionally, the story relied on several romance-action/thriller tropes, culminating in an implausible surprise ending. While I appreciate the need to suspend disbelief for a compelling narrative, some resolutions felt overly far-fetched.",

Zarkey, for instance, is introduced briefly and only reappears at the end, leaving his character feeling underdeveloped. Additionally, the confrontation with the Zarkey siblings at the house is underwhelming; it spans just two pages and lacks the intensity one would expect.",

It hooked me initially, then lost momentum before picking up again towards the end.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  I liked how the story alternated between past and present perspectives, which helped gauge how close or far Ariel was from solving the mystery.  \n\n- **Romance and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The romance aspect of the book was a highlight for me. It added an emotional layer that made me empathize more with Ariel. Her son, Buzz, also contributed significantly to the emotional connection, which might not have been as strong without his presence.  \n\n- **Mystery and Suspense:**  \n  One of the suspects seemed pretty obvious, while the other was a detached family member of a character who didn’t seem to have any prior connection to Ariel. The suspenseful moment when Zain left that suspicious voicemail had me on edge—I was practically screaming at the screen for Ariel to listen to him!  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending felt a bit unrealistic to me, but it turned out to be a happily-ever-after (HEA), which I can’t complain about when it comes to love!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book enjoyable with its intriguing premise, emotional depth, and suspenseful moments. While the pacing dragged in the middle and the ending felt a bit unrealistic, the romance and mystery kept me engaged.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

It took me a bit to get into the story, but thankfully I fell into it once the first few chapters passed. This probably has to do with the fact that I'm not a big thriller reader.  \n\n- **Mystery and Intrigue:**  \n  I grew to like the mystery and became thoroughly intrigued. Questions like, \"Why did the MC get that text? What really happened to her boyfriend five years ago? Did her dad really die of an overdose? And who the hell is keeping such a close eye on everything?\" kept me hooked. I wanted answers, and while some of them weren't a surprise, it was the journey there that kept me intrigued. I felt the desperation, curiosity, and grief.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Even though this wasn't solely a romance, Bowen still has the ability to create great characters. The great friends, the surprising ally, and the adorable little boy who stole every scene he was in stood out to me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The dual POVs, set in two different years, threw me off a bit. They felt jarring and interrupted the flow of the story at times, even though I understood their purpose. They eventually grew on me, but there were moments where I wanted one POV to end so I could get back to the other one.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the book itself was definitely up and down for me, I did like the ending—even if it was a bit too convenient. The shady characters and situations kept me engaged, and at one point, I found myself saying, \"I really like this.\" I definitely want to read her next thriller because it sounds very, very interesting!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this thriller was a departure from Sarina Bowen's usual romance genre, but it managed to captivate me with its mystery, intriguing characters, and emotional depth.

I think if it had been a little shorter (it’s 432 pages), I would not have wanted to put it down.  \n\n- **Engagement and Suspense:**  \n  It was the kind of suspense-filled book that I HAD to keep reading to know what happened.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The messages from the day Ariel’s father died and her secret boyfriend disappeared added depth and emotional weight to the story.  \n\n- **Reflection on the Prologue:**  \n  While writing my review, I went back to the book and reread the Prologue. Even though I read this book over only a few days, I had forgotten how it began, and it made SO much sense after finishing it. I bet if it had been a bit shorter, I would have remembered how it began, too.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues in the middle, this was a suspenseful and engaging read that kept me hooked. I still recommend it, especially for fans of emotionally charged and suspenseful stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The romance is still a significant part of the plot, but it plays a supporting role and doesn't overpower the suspense.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story revolves around Ariel, who had a whirlwind affair with Drew five years ago.

She's the antithesis of her family, living life on her terms. Bowen provides chapters from the past, allowing readers to understand Drew through Ariel's eyes. There's one clear-cut 'bad' player, but a few others remain ambiguous, making them intriguing.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The pacing is well-handled, with the action intensifying as the final pages approach.

            "The story opens with Ariel receiving a text from Drew, whom she believed had been dead for five years. This intriguing setup draws readers in, but the extensive focus on Drew and Ariel's past romance in the first half detracts from the central mystery's tension. However, once the mystery unfolds, the narrative takes thrilling twists and turns. As Ariel searches for answers, the situation grows increasingly sinister, revealing that much of what she thought she knew is wrong. With someone still lying to her, she must uncover the truth to protect their son. While the book could benefit from tighter editing—particularly in the first half, which slows the pacing—the latter half becomes much more engaging as the mystery takes center stage.",

            "I enjoyed most of the characters, but the mother felt underdeveloped, appearing more like a doormat who simply followed the men in her life. Ariel was relatable yet naive, making questionable choices, such as impulsively running away with a child without a solid plan and only $2,000. Considering her family's wealth, I expected her to be more strategic, even in her fear.",

Usually, domestic thrillers are hit or miss for me, but this one was awesome.  \n  - I went into this one blind, and I almost feel that the book descriptions I’ve read after finishing the book didn’t quite do it justice.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  - I didn’t give it a 5-star rating because I felt some elements were VERY reaching, but otherwise, I very much enjoyed it.  \n  - Not saying more here for fear of giving anything away, but if you were on the fence about this one, it’s worth swooping up.  \n\n- **Narration and Performance:**  \n  - The narration team did such a great job! Kathleen Early, who has a ton of experience narrating thrillers (think Karin Slaughter novels), stole the show for me.  \n  - Early was great at conveying the wit and evoking the suspense, which contributed to the portrayal of Ariel in this book.  \n  - Gary Tiedemann, familiar to me from *When I’m Dead* by Hannah Morrissey, and Jason Clarke, a new-to-me narrator, also delivered strong performances.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis domestic thriller by Bowen exceeded my expectations, delivering a gripping and enjoyable read despite some plot elements that felt a bit far-fetched.

            "The book opens and closes with a fast-paced, engaging narrative, but the middle section, particularly during the evidence discovery, feels drawn out. The short chapters and clear timeline shifts, enhanced by changes in point of view, make the story easy to follow. However, the ending wraps up too quickly, leaving some elements unexplained. \n\nThe novel weaves together a mysterious text, a lost love, family secrets, and unsettling technology, centering on Ariel, a single mother and artist, as she investigates the disappearance of her child's father and uncovers hidden truths. This blend of cozy thriller elements and a romance subplot creates a unique atmosphere. While the book maintains a level of suspense, many twists are predictable, which diminishes the overall tension. The focus on video technology is both frightening and believable, but the lack of surprising plot developments reduces the thrill factor.",

The transitions between these viewpoints are skillfully handled, effectively distinguishing the timelines. Ariel is a relatable character, and the unexpected romance subplot adds a charming layer to the narrative.",

While the mystery unfolds slowly, given the book's 432 pages, I found myself deeply invested and on the edge of my seat throughout. The alternating timelines and perspectives—present-day Ariel and five years earlier with Drew—enhanced the ominous atmosphere, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Although I anticipated some aspects of the ending, others took me by surprise and left me heartbroken.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre Transition:**  \n  I’m a huge fan of Sarina Bowen’s romance books, so I was super excited to see what she would come up with in the thriller genre. I likely would have picked this up regardless because it's Sarina Bowen, but I was really drawn in by the synopsis.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery itself was very slow burn (no surprise considering this book is about 432 pages), but I found myself super invested and was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time. The story alternated between two different timelines/POV (present day – Ariel & 5 years prior – Drew), which created a very ominous ambience that I really enjoyed. There were a few elements of the ending I saw coming, but others completely caught me by surprise (and broke my heart!).  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Ariel was a very compelling lead character. She was headstrong, a protective mama bear, a good friend, and almost loyal to a fault. The side characters were all very interesting and contrasted really well with the underlying mystery. Buzz, Ariel’s son, was such a sweet little kid! He added a lot of warmth and relief during some of the tenser moments.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  It’s no secret that Sarina Bowen can write a compelling romance, so I loved the interwoven romance subplot (to the point this could almost be considered romantic suspense at times).  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I had a lot of fun with this book! All in all, I had a great time with it, and I really hope Sarina Bowen writes more thrillers in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an engaging and well-crafted thriller with a slow-burn mystery, compelling characters, and a touch of romance. While some elements of the ending were predictable, others were surprising and emotionally impactful.

With the help of programmer Zain, she investigates, uncovering hidden truths and facing life-threatening challenges. The alternating timelines reveal secrets and culminate in a tragic event.",

However, it became more engaging around the halfway point.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story is a whodunnit mystery intertwined with elements of romance, abandonment issues, family dynamics, and the challenges of being a single parent raising a child.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The portrayal of a single parent navigating life and raising a child was compelling and added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Technical Elements:**  \n  The inclusion of computer technical issues in the storyline felt tedious and detracted from my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending felt somewhat phoney and predictable, though it was satisfying in its happiness. However, it seemed rushed and wrapped up too quickly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a good read with a mix of engaging themes and character development, despite some pacing issues and a rushed, predictable ending. The technical aspects of the plot were less enjoyable, but the emotional depth of the story made up for it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Bowen’s newest release, a domestic thriller, wasn’t my favorite but it was definitely something new!  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  I’m glad I went into this totally blind, but it probably wasn’t the best plot for me, personally. The pacing is pretty slow, especially for the first 30-40%, and the writing is very detailed. After a mildly suspenseful, but slow, first half, I really lost interest in the story. However, I was invested enough in the plot to want to find out how it ends, so that’s something.  \n\n- **Thriller Elements:**  \n  I don’t know that I found this to be a solid thriller. It honestly felt like a CoHo-style dramatic romance with some suspenseful elements and a few average twists.  \n\n- **Characterization and Naming:**  \n  All the Disney names felt a little silly.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  I enjoyed the romance subplot, which added a layer of enjoyment to the story.  \n\n- **Author Loyalty:**  \n  I’m a big enough fan of Sarina Bowen that I’ll continue reading whatever she writes!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Sarina Bowen’s venture into the domestic thriller genre was an interesting change, the slow pacing and lack of strong thriller elements made it less engaging for me. However, the romance subplot and my appreciation for Bowen’s writing kept me invested enough to finish the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3⭐️  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThanks to the publisher for allowing me to be an early reader!

The premise is highly original: Ariel receives an ominous text message from her boyfriend, who died five years ago. The story unfolds with Ariel’s search for answers, involving corporate espionage, dirty cops, and cyber crimes.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character development is strong, particularly Ariel’s portrayal as a determined single mother. The author effectively conveys Ariel’s commitment to being a good mom and her desperation to protect her son when the stakes rise.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement and Thrill:**  \n  While I enjoyed the emotional depth of Ariel’s relationship with her son, I found the suspense lacking. At no point did I feel truly worried for Ariel’s safety. The plot felt predictable, possibly because I’ve read many suspense novels. A bit more thrill would have made the story more gripping.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  As always, I love Sarina Bowen’s writing. Her prose is engaging and well-crafted, making the book an enjoyable read despite its predictability.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would definitely be willing to read another mystery by Sarina Bowen. This book is recommended for fans of mysteries, single-parent stories, and even quirky elements like Ring cameras.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Five Year Lie* is a solid debut in the mystery genre for Sarina Bowen, with a unique premise and strong character development.

            "While the story shows promise, its execution is lacking. The novel would greatly benefit from a skilled editor to streamline the narrative and remove unnecessary elements. Certain scenes, particularly those featuring Ariel’s four-year-old son, Buzz, come across as repetitive and tedious. The bus scenes are especially dull and unrealistic given Ariel’s background. Although the plot includes several twists, many are predictable and fail to deliver the surprise typically expected in a mystery thriller. These twists require more creativity and refinement to captivate seasoned readers of the genre. Additionally, specific scenes, such as the grocery store passage, the five-year-old text message, and the diner conversation, could be revised or eliminated for greater impact. The chapters from the mystery character’s perspective lack clear indicators, resulting in confusing and abrupt shifts in viewpoint.",
            "The characters, particularly the protagonist Ariel, are largely one-dimensional and lack depth. Ariel's character is inconsistent, shifting from a witty tech heiress to a bohemian artist, and then to someone embodying midwestern or southern naivete. Similarly, Drew starts as a strong and likable character but ultimately devolves into a caricature of a southern army veteran, suggesting that different authors may have contributed to his portrayal at various points.",
            "The novel features well-researched details about real locations in Maine, like the Candelabra Tree and Holy Donut. However, the writing fluctuates between meticulous detail and moments that feel poorly conceived, such as Ariel dismissing a friend's potential danger to attend a preschool picnic.",

This affected my overall investment in the story.\n   - The final chapters brought excitement and a satisfying conclusion, which helped redeem the slower parts.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - Sarina Bowen’s writing shines through with snappy dialogue, sweet and funny moments, and great character dynamics. These elements kept me engaged despite the pacing issues.\n   - Bowen did a good job pulling together the different elements of the story, blending mystery, suspense, and romance effectively.\n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**\n   - I wasn’t as fully invested in the story as I would have liked, possibly because this isn’t my usual genre. However, the emotional stakes and Ariel’s journey were compelling enough to keep me reading.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, Sarina Bowen’s first mystery/suspense novel is an intriguing and twisty read with a smart premise and well-developed characters. While the pacing dragged at times, the final chapters delivered excitement and a satisfying conclusion. The story’s blend of mystery, suspense, and romance, along with Bowen’s signature writing style, made it an enjoyable read despite not being my usual genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3 stars."

            "The romance fell short of my expectations. While I appreciated Drew's perspective on his feelings for Ariel, I found his focus to be divided. Ariel is a strong heroine and a devoted mother to her son, Buzz, but I would have preferred if she had moved on, found answers, and achieved closure without rekindling the romance. The connection between Drew and Ariel felt weak, and their reunion was underwhelming. Drew's absence and lack of effort to contact Ariel or seek justice for his family made him a disappointing romantic lead.

            "The story gains momentum as Ariel immerses herself in the crime plot, with Drew's involvement and flashback perspectives heightening the tension and intrigue. However, many of Ariel's POV moments, particularly those unrelated to the crime, feel superfluous and could be omitted without impacting the narrative or character development. The pacing notably accelerates in the final act, delivering relentless tension and catharsis, especially during Ariel and Buzz's escape.",
            "Ariel comes across as a lackluster character, with many of her scenes feeling repetitive and lacking depth. In contrast, Drew, despite his limited screen time, emerges as the most compelling character, driven by a poignant need for revenge and a moving sacrifice. Additionally, Buzz, Ariel’s child, brings emotional depth and heartache to the narrative, particularly in the final chapters.",
            "The dialogue in certain scenes, especially between Ariel and her friend Larri in the glass studio, comes off as awkward and forced. In contrast, the best dialogue emerges in the final act, where it is genuine, heartfelt, and emotionally resonant.",
            "The revelation of Chime Co.'s dark secrets is masterfully executed, with the AI police software introducing a chilling and realistic dimension to the narrative. The portrayal of toxicity and predatory behavior within the tech industry and law enforcement evokes a profound sense of helplessness.",
            "The emotional core of the story truly emerges in the final chapters, especially during the heart-wrenching and cathartic reunion scene. The \"us against the world\" dynamic in the climax is both powerful and expertly executed.",

        "conclusion": "While the novel has its flaws, particularly in the characterization of Ariel and some of the dialogue, it succeeds in delivering emotional depth and tension in its final act. The crime plot, Drew’s character, and the themes of technological and societal toxicity are the highlights. Despite its shortcomings, the story manages to evoke strong emotions and adrenaline, especially in its climactic moments.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**\n   - The novel leans more toward romantic suspense rather than a pure thriller, with a strong emphasis on emotional romance beats.\n   - It feels like a debut thriller, with elements reminiscent of Wattpad stories and college/hockey romances, which can come across as contrived and basic.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story picks up when Ariel delves into the crime plot, with Drew’s involvement and flashback POVs adding tension and intrigue.\n   - Many of Ariel’s POV moments, especially those unrelated to the crime plot, feel inconsequential and could have been cut without affecting the story or character development.\n   - The pacing improves significantly in the final act, with nonstop tension and catharsis, particularly during Ariel and Buzz’s escape.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - Ariel is written as a dull character, with many of her scenes feeling repetitive and lacking depth.\n   - Drew, despite having fewer scenes, is the most fully realized and fascinating character, with his need for revenge and eventual sacrifice being moving.\n   - Buzz, Ariel’s child, adds emotional depth and heartache to the story, especially in the final chapters.\n\n- **Dialogue and Scenes:**\n   - The dialogue in some scenes, particularly with Ariel’s friend Larri in the glass studio, feels cringe-inducing and contrived.\n   - The best dialogue occurs in the final act, where it is pure, sincere, and emotionally impactful.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**\n   - The unfolding of Chime Co.’s sinister secrets is well-executed, with the AI police software adding a terrifying and realistic layer to the story.\n   - The themes of toxicity and predatory behavior in the tech world and law enforcement are effectively portrayed, creating a sense of helplessness.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The emotional core of the story shines in the final chapters, particularly during the reunion scene, which is heart-wrenching and cathartic.\n   - The “us against the world” dynamic in the climax is powerful and well-executed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel has its flaws, particularly in the characterization of Ariel and some of the dialogue, it succeeds in delivering emotional depth and tension in its final act. The crime plot, Drew’s character, and the themes of technological and societal toxicity are the highlights. Despite its shortcomings, the story manages to evoke strong emotions and adrenaline, especially in its climactic moments.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5 stars (with an extra 0.5 stars for the final chapters)."

            "The story opens with a chilling premise—a data breach—but fails to escalate the horror, leaving readers wanting more. The conclusion is particularly unsatisfying; no one faces consequences, and the absence of an epilogue leaves the narrative feeling incomplete. Ariel's resolution with Jay feels rushed and unrealistic, given the betrayals she has faced. Additionally, the abrupt ending leaves several loose ends, such as the unresolved wedding plans with her mother and Ray. Ariel's decision to reveal Jay as her son's father during a perilous moment also feels poorly timed and executed.",
            "The kind man on the train was a delightful addition, providing a balance to the mix of good and bad characters. However, some supporting characters, like the PTA lady and the mom watching Buzz, came off as caricatures. It was also strange that the person helping Ariel had a crush on her baby daddy, yet she seemed unfazed by it.",
            "The mystery unfolds at a deliberate pace, maintaining my interest throughout. While the suspense is minimal, I found myself curious about the other characters involved. However, the predictability of the main plot twists slowed the book's momentum. The beginning is well-crafted, and the premise—an important text sent five years late due to a cellphone tower issue—serves as an intriguing hook."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The novel had a great premise and a strong start, but it fell short in execution. The mystery was engaging but predictable, and the characters lacked depth. The ending was unsatisfying and left too many questions unanswered. While it was an okay first attempt at suspense, the storyline could have been tighter.",

The mind just boggles at the leaps that needed to be taken.  \n  - It’s as if this great first thought—what if you got a text from a dead guy???—was followed by all this nonsense.  \n\n- **Character Development and Behavior:**  \n  - Looking at Instagram and not seeing one photo of a son… what the poop.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Frustration:**  \n  - Argh. Argh. Arrrrgh!!  \n  - Ok, maybe it’s even a 1.6-star as now I have indigestion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel started with an intriguing premise but quickly devolved into a frustrating and illogical mess. The plot inconsistencies, unrealistic character behavior, and lack of emotional payoff left me deeply dissatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Original rating: 3 stars  \n- Adjusted rating: 1.6 stars (due to frustration and dissatisfaction)"

            "The novel centers on Ariel Cafferty, a part-time employee at her family's company, Chime Co, and a talented glass-blowing artist. The story takes a dramatic turn when she uncovers corruption involving her uncle Ray and an insider named Brainz. Complicating matters is the disappearance of Ariel's love interest, Drew Miller, who later reappears as Jay Marker. The narrative delves into themes of betrayal, corruption, and redemption as Ariel and Jay strive to reveal the truth. With its fast pace and numerous twists, the story keeps readers engaged. It alternates between Ariel's present-day challenges and flashbacks that unveil Drew/Jay's backstory. The climax, featuring a tense confrontation with drug dealer Bryan Zarkey, is both intense and action-packed.",
            "Ariel is a resilient and determined protagonist, skillfully balancing her roles as a mother, artist, and investigator. Her relationship with Drew/Jay enriches her character, revealing both her vulnerability and strength. Drew/Jay, a complex figure with a troubled past, is driven by a desire to uncover the truth and protect Ariel, making his transformation from fugitive to hero particularly compelling. Supporting characters like Zain, Ray, and Brainz add depth to the narrative, each bringing their own motivations and secrets to the story.",

Their claims, like being \"left speechless\" by a twist, should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**\n   - The story revolves around Ariel Cafferty, a young single mom working for her family's successful doorbell camera security company.

The identity of the antagonist was fairly obvious.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**\n   - The audiobook was narrated by Kathleen Early, Gary Tiedemann, and Jason Clarke. Kathleen Early, in particular, stood out as she is a seasoned narrator known for her work with authors like Karin Slaughter and Peter Swanson. Her delivery of high-intensity scenes was excellent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was an entertaining, albeit predictable, thriller.

The narrative skillfully alternates between past and present, using delayed messages to gradually reveal the truth behind these pivotal events.",

Although the initial setup is gripping—Ariel receives a five-year-old text due to a cell tower malfunction, linking her boyfriend’s disappearance to her father’s death—the story loses momentum as it progresses. Most twists are predictable, and the narrative follows a familiar trajectory after the initial intrigue, making the latter half less compelling.

More effort should have been put into this plotline.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The protagonist’s “I have no need for the 9 to 5 because I make art” vibe reminded me too much of *The Last Thing He Told Me*, though the addition of a part-time job was a slight variation.  \n   - The child character, Buzz, felt unrealistic. He was portrayed as too perfect, and even his mini tantrum on the bus was mild compared to real-life tantrums.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n   - The art style was different, but it didn’t stand out enough to make the story unique.  \n   - The book had a touch of romance and just enough tragedy to justify the happy ending, which might appeal to some readers.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n   - I’m not sure who I would recommend this to. It’s an easy read, but it lacks the depth and excitement I look for in thrillers. If you enjoy light thrillers with romance and a predictable happy ending, this might be for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was decent and had some enjoyable elements, it fell short of being a gripping thriller. The plot lacked direction, the characters felt underdeveloped, and the child scenes were unrealistic. It’s an easy read, but not one I’d strongly recommend unless you prefer light, predictable stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

A concise version of the synopsis is that Ariel Cafferty gets a text from the love of her life and father of her child, but he's been dead for about five years.  \n\n- **Execution and Genre Blend:**  \n  Unfortunately, as great as the premise sounded, I didn't love the execution. I didn't realize until I was about halfway through the book that all of the author's previous work (as far as I can tell) has been romance. This made absolute sense because this book was about 50% thriller and 50% romance. I did not realize that when I started reading, and maybe if I had known that going in, I would have liked it more since I would have known what to expect.  \n\n- **Personal Preferences and Genre Expectations:**  \n  Personally, I wasn't a fan of mixing romance and thriller. I tend to like my romcom books to be cheesy, and my mysteries/thrillers to... not be. However, when the book focused more on the mystery portion, I really enjoyed it.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Recommendation:**  \n  I think there will be a lot of people that like this one, especially if you're a fan of both romance and mysteries, and you don't mind them mixing. If this sounds like it might be up your alley, then give it a go!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the intriguing premise of the novel, the execution didn't fully align with my personal preferences due to its blend of romance and thriller elements.

The alternating chapters between the present and the past from the boyfriend's POV were engaging and created a sense of mystery. However, the plot became overly complex and hard to follow, especially with the heavy use of tech jargon and a long list of characters and stolen identities. The pacing slowed down, making it tedious to keep up with the unfolding events.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Genre Appeal:**  \n  Sarina Bowen's writing effectively captured the vagueness and suspense that thriller readers crave. The initial setup and atmosphere were excellent, but the story took an unexpected turn toward romance near the end, which felt out of place and disrupted the thriller vibe.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ariel and her boyfriend were compelling characters initially, especially with the mystery surrounding him. However, the shift into romance territory felt jarring and disconnected from the thriller elements, making the characters' development feel inconsistent.  \n\n- **Technical and Thematic Complexity:**  \n  The use of tech language to describe the dark crimes in the Chime Company Universe was overwhelming and hard to follow. This complexity might alienate readers, particularly those unfamiliar with such jargon.  \n\n- **Potential and Future Expectations:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book shows potential, and I see promise in Sarina Bowen's ability to write thrillers. I would likely read her next book to see how she evolves in this genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had a strong start but struggled with pacing, complexity, and an unexpected shift into romance.

            "As someone who typically doesn't read romance, I was surprised to discover that this is the genre the author is best known for. However, I appreciated that the love story was not overly emphasized. It struck a balance, providing just enough detail about a whirlwind romance that concluded abruptly.",
            "The Disney character names felt somewhat out of place in an otherwise serious storyline, often distracting me with their silliness. Hearing names like Buzz and Woody made me cringe, despite the characters being well-written. Ultimately, I found it hard to become fully engaged in the story.",
            "The bus ride was the standout moment of the story, capturing the fear, anxiety, and uncertainty perfectly. I truly connected with Ariel during this scene, perhaps due to my own maternal instincts.",
            "While the story had its slow moments, it was an easy listen on Audible during my workday. I often found myself checking the remaining runtime.",
            "Overall, I found the story to be a mixed bag. While I didn't love it, I also didn't hate it. The cyber crimes theme simply didn't resonate with me. However, the premise was intriguing and presented a genuinely frightening concept that feels all too plausible in today's world."

I found myself checking how much run time was left on several occasions.  \n\n- **Narration and Voice Acting:**  \n  The male narrator has a nice voice. I could see how it could be the voice of a soldier, but honestly, the brooding, gravelly tone was almost a bit too much at times and reminded me of a caricature of an action star.  \n\n- **Characterization and Names:**  \n  The Disney character names were a little silly in what was a very serious storyline. It was almost distracting as I cringed every time I heard the names Buzz or Woody. I think the characters were well written, but I just wasn’t pulled in.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  I’m not a romance reader, and I didn’t know that is what the author is mostly known for. That said, I appreciate that the love story wasn’t overly done. It felt like the right amount of info about a whirlwind romance that ended abruptly.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Writing Quality:**  \n  The bus ride was the most well-written part of it all. The fear, the anxiety, the unknown. I really felt that with Ariel, maybe that’s just the mom in me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Genre Suitability:**  \n  Overall, I didn’t love it. I didn’t hate it. Mostly, I think the cyber crimes story just wasn’t for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a compelling premise and some well-written moments, particularly the bus ride scene, it struggled with pacing, narration tone, and the distracting use of Disney character names. The romance subplot was handled well, but the story as a whole didn’t fully engage me, likely due to my personal preferences regarding the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The plot centers on Ariel, a glassmaker and heir to her family's business, who receives a mysterious text from her ex, Drew, presumed dead for five years. This text, sent due to a technical glitch, adds intrigue to his disappearance. The narrative alternates between Ariel's present-day perspective and Drew's viewpoint from five years ago.

It’s more of a suspenseful romance, which might appeal to some readers, but it wasn’t what I expected.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n   - The first 40% of the book was addicting and had a strong start. However, the last 40% felt unnecessarily drawn out, and the book didn’t need to be over 400 pages long.  \n\n- **Concept and Themes:**  \n   - The concept of cameras watching every move and being used against the public was intriguing and gave me *Black Mirror* vibes, which I enjoyed.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n   - The ending was my least favorite part. It felt gimmicky and unsatisfying. Specifically, the MMC (male main character) isn’t dead, and when Ariel reunites with him, it’s as if nothing ever changed. The quick forgiveness after he ghosted her for five years felt unrealistic and frustrating.  \n\n- **Characterization and Dialogue:**  \n   - The use of Disney character names was a bit of an ick for me. Additionally, the “and everyone clapped” scene felt forced and out of place.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal:**  \n   - If you’re looking for a romantic suspense with more emphasis on romance than suspense, this might be a good pick. However, the latter parts of the book didn’t work for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong start with an intriguing concept, the pacing issues, unrealistic resolution, and certain stylistic choices made the latter half of the story disappointing.

She has no explanation for why he left and is heartbroken. Later, Drew’s obituary appears, adding grief to her emotional turmoil. Five years later, Ariel receives a text from someone she believes is Drew, urgently asking her to meet. What follows is an entertaining and gripping narrative. It’s hard to discuss the plot without giving anything away, but I found it thoroughly engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ariel is a compelling protagonist. Her emotional journey—dealing with abandonment, grief, and the mystery surrounding Drew’s disappearance—is well-crafted and relatable. The complexity of her feelings and her determination to uncover the truth make her a character worth rooting for.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would definitely recommend this book.

This comparison might have influenced my feelings about this one, as I found it just okay.  \n\n- **Author’s Previous Work:**  \n  I’ve read Sarina Bowen before, particularly her collaborations with Elle Kennedy, so I was excited to see how she would handle a romantic thriller.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt off to me, and I got bored in the middle. The writing seemed repetitive, and I think about a hundred pages could have been cut without losing much.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The plot itself is interesting—a girl receives an ominous text five years too late from her deceased baby daddy, which drags her into a mess involving her father and uncles’ tech company.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I think a lot of people will enjoy this, especially Sarina Bowen’s romance readers who don’t typically read thrillers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was just okay for me. While the premise was intriguing, the pacing and repetitive writing made it a bit of a slog in parts. However, I can see it appealing to fans of Sarina Bowen’s romance work who are dipping their toes into the thriller genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

While I didn’t love the book, I don’t regret reading it.  \n\n- **Technical Jargon:**  \n  The book is filled with tech jargon, which I think computer nerds would enjoy. Personally, I found it a bit overwhelming at times, but it added a unique flavor to the story.  \n\n- **Romance Element:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed the romance aspect of the book and felt satisfied with how it was developed. Ariel and Jay’s relationship was a highlight, and I was happy they got their happily-ever-after (HEA).  \n\n- **Thriller Element:**  \n  The thriller part of the story felt middle-of-the-road for me. A significant portion of the suspense revolved around Zain sitting on his computer, relaying information to Ariel every other chapter. This made the pacing feel repetitive and less engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I found Zain’s death to be somewhat pointless and wished there had been more backstory on Bryan Zarkey and his sister. Additionally, I would have liked more dialogue and development for Ray, as his character felt underutilized.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the romance element was satisfying and the tech jargon added a unique touch, the thriller aspect fell short due to repetitive pacing and underdeveloped suspense.

That transition was a little too seamless for me to get past.  \n\n- **Ending and Recommendation:**  \n  I'm a sucker for a happy ending, so I will still recommend this book to everyone. 😂  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was engaging and exciting, especially with its thriller elements and familiar setting, the ease with which Ariel reconnected with Drew/Jay felt unrealistic. Despite this, the story's happy ending makes it a recommendable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The author's background in romance is evident, and while the thriller components show promise, they could have been more compelling.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ariel's character is well-developed, especially through her emotional journey of dealing with Drew's disappearance and raising their child alone. Drew's character is explored through flashbacks, revealing his role in the family business and his relationship with Ariel. The co-worker who assists Ariel in the investigation adds some intrigue but could have been more fleshed out.\n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n  The writing is clear and engaging, particularly in the romantic scenes. However, the thriller aspects felt lacking in tension and excitement. The story's structure, with its time jumps, worked well to build emotional depth but sometimes disrupted the pacing. The ending, while action-packed, felt somewhat rushed and disconnected from the rest of the narrative.\n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n  This is the author's first attempt at the thriller genre, and while it shows promise, it also highlights her strengths in romance. With more focus on building suspense and refining the thriller elements, the author could excel in this genre in the future.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers an intriguing blend of mystery, thriller, and romance, with a strong emotional core centered around Ariel and Drew's relationship. While the pacing and thriller elements could have been more compelling, the story has potential, and the author's talent for romance shines through. With some refinement, this could be a solid entry into the thriller genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

The final arc, featuring a dramatic shootout, comes off as over-the-top and absurd.

            "Ariel, the protagonist and tech company heiress, suffers from inconsistent characterization. She comes off as ungrateful and self-centered, embodying a \"not like other girls\" attitude. Despite being portrayed as a snarky, independent woman, she heavily relies on others—living rent-free in her mother's guest house, depending on her for childcare, and borrowing a car. Her financial situation is perplexing; despite her affluent background, she is depicted as a broke single mom with only $2,000 in her checking account, which contradicts her privileged lifestyle.\n\nThe romance between Ariel and the male lead feels shallow and unconvincing. Their relationship, built on just three months of mostly Friday dates, lacks emotional depth. The male lead lies to Ariel throughout their relationship, even using a fake name and hacking her computer. Yet, she forgives him instantly upon their reunion, which feels unrealistic. The resolution, including naming her son after him and quickly rekindling their romance, comes off as forced and emotionally flat.\n\nAriel's son, Buzz, is portrayed as obnoxiously precocious, often more annoying than endearing.

            "The plot is absurd and lacks coherence, with the inclusion of a fictional company, Ring Doorbell, serving more as a critique of privacy systems than a meaningful commentary on police corruption. The protagonist, Ariel, is inconsistently portrayed, fluctuating between being unintelligent and improbably solving complex mysteries, such as tracking a truck to a house and linking a bagel bag to her uncle’s lies. The narrative is bogged down by unnecessary details, particularly the focus on the doorbell system, which detracts from the main storyline. Additionally, the story suffers from logical inconsistencies, exemplified by the unrealistic circumstances surrounding Zane's overdose on narcotics. The supposed resilience of the human spirit is oddly emphasized through the characters' persistent horniness, which feels out of place within the overall context.",

Additionally, the characters' priorities raise concerns, especially the protagonist's persistent fixation on romantic and sexual thoughts, even in life-threatening situations.",

The possibility of Ariel and Ray reuniting was both baffling and frustrating. Furthermore, the presence of two unplanned pregnancies felt excessive and poorly executed.",
