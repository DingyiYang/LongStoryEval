            "A heart-wrenching mystery filled with intriguing layers, this story features characters who can hear the dead, a palpable sense of danger, and an eerily haunted house with a menacing presence lurking beneath the floor. While I struggled to fully grasp the nature of that entity, it undeniably added to the chilling atmosphere.",

Moxie Castin, the lawyer, is also a highlight, and I enjoyed the witty banter between him and Charlie. I hope Charlie finds a more suitable partner soon—his deceased daughter would likely agree that his current relationship isn't right for him.",
            "The author delivers another superb performance. I seldom quote in reviews, but I must highlight a striking line from the opening paragraph about Moxie: \"He was overweight by the equivalent of a small child, didn't use one word in public when five others were loitering nearby with nothing better to do, and had a taste for ties with patterns reminiscent of the markings of poisonous insects or the nightmares of LSD survivors.\" I particularly appreciate the notion of words loitering, just waiting to be spoken.",

Both share a love for darkness.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Novel:**  \n   - Mr. Connolly delivers a great potboiler of a story with all the ingredients that make his books such an addiction.  \n   - Connolly, like King, remains the best advertisement for the state of Maine.  \n\n- **Critiques and Loose Ends:**  \n   - Some threads in this book feel left dangling in the wind. Perhaps the writer will pick these up in the continuing series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis installment of John Connolly’s series is another addictive read, blending a slow-burn buildup with explosive resolutions. While it delivers on the dark, engaging storytelling fans expect, a few loose ends prevent it from being a perfect five-star read. Nonetheless, Connolly’s ability to weave complex plots and memorable characters ensures his place as a master of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly stated, but implied to be slightly below 5 stars due to unresolved threads."

They were reintroduced about two-thirds of the way in, but it felt too late. Their absence made the story feel incomplete to me.  \n\n- **Otherworldly Elements:**  \n   - One of the reasons I’ve always loved John Connolly’s books is the strong presence of otherworldly aspects. In this book, that element was not as pronounced, which was disappointing. It felt like a key ingredient was missing.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n   - As a die-hard fan who owns and has read every John Connolly book, I couldn’t help but feel that something was different this time. While I can’t pinpoint exactly what’s missing, the book didn’t have the same magic as his past works. I hope he returns to the formula that made his earlier books so captivating.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Fan Perspective:**  \n   - I don’t want to trash this book, as I suspect many of his fans will still enjoy it. However, for me, it didn’t live up to the high standards set by his previous novels.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I remain a devoted John Connolly fan, this particular book fell short of my expectations.

The trail ultimately led to a rickety old house in the woods, referred to as Sears & Roebuck Kit #174, which was a strangely random yet intriguing detail.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The story centered on Colleen Clark, a young mother accused of her toddler’s disappearance, which created a strong emotional hook. The tension and stakes were high, especially when even her husband doubted her innocence.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Atmosphere:**  \n  John Connolly’s ability to create creepy characters and a chilling atmosphere was on full display. The blend of supernatural elements with a grounded mystery worked seamlessly, maintaining the series’ signature tone.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Instruments of Darkness* is a standout addition to the Charlie Parker series, offering a tightly woven plot, memorable characters, and a deeply engaging mystery. The cohesive storytelling and emotional stakes made it more satisfying than some of the previous novels. I’m already counting down the days until the next book in May 2025!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, *Instruments of Darkness* shows an author in decline.  \n\n- **Plot Quality and Originality:**  \n  The plotting has been abysmal in the past 2 or 3 books (including *The Land of Lost Things*). The entire Nazi encampment subplot served no purpose whatsoever. The plot feels like a reheated version of *The Wolf in Winter* (one of his weaker novels to begin with), and this is even acknowledged in the book itself.  \n\n- **Character Development (Villains):**  \n  The villains, usually a highlight of any Connolly novel, are wholly uninteresting in this book.  \n\n- **Editorial Influence and Quality Control:**  \n  According to the acknowledgment section, Connolly has been using the same editors since almost the outset of his career. Either they are not challenging him enough, or he's not listening. Regardless, there has been a steep decline in the quality of Connolly's books lately.  \n\n- **Hope for Improvement:**  \n  I hope he can turn it around.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Connolly remains a talented writer, *Instruments of Darkness* reflects a noticeable decline in his recent work.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Story Quality:**  \n  - The story is great and well-written, with a fascinating psychic theme running through it.  \n  - It works well as a standalone novel, even though it’s part of the Charlie Parker series.  \n  - There’s a good balance between the current case and Charlie’s personal life and background, which helped me get to know the character.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Charlie Parker is a compelling protagonist who believes in Colleen Clark’s innocence, even when others, including her husband, think she’s guilty.  \n  - The inclusion of Sabine, a psychic who claims to hear the boy Henry, adds an intriguing dynamic to the story.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  - The narration was bland and almost monotone, which detracted from my enjoyment.  \n  - As someone who listens to 1-2 audiobooks daily, I believe a skilled narrator can make or break a book.  \n  - The narrator simply read the book aloud without bringing the characters to life or differentiating their voices, which made it harder to engage with the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite the strong story and characters, the audiobook narration significantly impacted my experience.  \n  - I would likely enjoy the book more with a different narrator or by reading it in print.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a well-written and engaging story with a fascinating psychic theme and strong character development. However, the audiobook narration fell short, making it a three-star experience for me. With a better narrator or in print, I would expect to enjoy it much more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3 stars)  \n\nThanks to Netgalley, John Connolly, and Hodder and Stoughton for providing an ARC in exchange for an honest review."

            "This thriller/mystery revolves around the disappearance of a child, a group of white nationalists, and a foreboding old house. The case of Henry's disappearance and the accusations against his mother, Colleen, are gripping. However, the subplot involving the white nationalists feels somewhat disconnected from the main narrative, though it is intriguing to see how it develops. The paranormal aspect, while less sinister than anticipated, holds promise for future installments. Although the ending feels a bit rushed, it remains satisfying overall.",

The narrative is complex, with private investigator Charlie Parker delving into a case that raises more questions than answers. The plot thickens with the introduction of a group of fascists in the Maine woods and a woman who claims to hear Henry crying. The story is dark and filled with morally ambiguous characters and settings.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, both human and environmental, are portrayed as deeply flawed and unsettling. Colleen Parker is at the center of the mystery, while her husband, Stephen, adds layers of doubt and suspicion. Charlie Parker, the investigator, navigates a morally challenging landscape, and the supporting cast, including the fascist group, adds to the story's tension.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The author, John Connolly, masterfully weaves together multiple narrative threads, including supernatural elements, without losing the reader’s attention. The pacing is engaging, and the story quickly draws the reader in, despite its complexity.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  This is the 21st novel in the Charlie Parker series, but it works well as a standalone story. Readers new to the series can easily follow the plot, while long-time fans will likely appreciate the continuation of the series.  \n\n- **Supernatural Elements:**  \n  While supernatural elements are present, they are integrated seamlessly into the story, enhancing rather than detracting from the overall narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a gripping and dark novel that combines a complex mystery with morally ambiguous characters and a touch of the supernatural. The story is well-crafted, with a plot that keeps readers engaged and guessing until the end. It works both as a standalone novel and as part of the Charlie Parker series, making it a compelling read for both new and returning fans.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I've always been a fan of this author, but I found the last few novels uninteresting and lacking in engaging plotlines. *The Instruments of Darkness* brought me back to the quality of *The White Road*, especially with the introduction of the character Sabine Drew.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Sabine Drew, a psychic, is one of the best characters John Connolly has written in a long time. I could literally read a whole book about her. On the other hand, I missed the heavier presence of Lewis and Angel, who have become central characters over the years. Their limited role in this book was a disappointment.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The book revolves around the abduction and possible murder of a young child, with the mother being held accountable. It features many shady characters and incorporates supernatural elements, which are a mainstay in John Connolly's novels.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  While the story was engaging overall, I found a few chapters to be overly descriptive and drawn out, which caused me to lose interest temporarily.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the minor flaws, I would recommend this book to fans of the Charlie Parker series. It’s a strong addition to the series, and I hope to see more of Sabine Drew in future novels.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Instruments of Darkness* is a return to form for John Connolly, with a compelling plot, intriguing characters like Sabine Drew, and the signature supernatural elements. While it has some pacing issues and underutilizes beloved characters like Lewis and Angel, it remains a worthwhile read for fans of the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 ⭐ (Deducted one star for overly descriptive chapters and the limited presence of Lewis and Angel.)"

Another passage about the dead, that vast assemblage, was equally compelling and solidified my case for the book's brilliance.  \n- **Character Development and Requests for More:**  \n  I would love to see more of Sabine in future books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis 21st installment in the series delivers exceptional writing, chilling atmosphere, and delightful character dynamics, particularly with Louis and Angel. The vivid descriptions and compelling passages make it a must-read, and I eagerly hope for more focus on Sabine in future books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The concept surrounding Henry Clark is intriguing, yet it ultimately feels unresolved. The mystery unfolds at a slow pace, leaving many questions from previous books, particularly *A Book of Bones*, unanswered. Key unresolved plot points include the status of Ross and the Backers, whether Ross knows the identity of the principal backer, and the identity of the figure waiting behind the glass—could it be Sam? It seems the author may have overlooked or neglected these earlier events and plotlines.",

It seems he's abandoned the story arc that peaked with the classic *The Black Angel*, and I have no idea where he's planning to take the Charlie Parker books.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Engagement:**  \n  This is once again a book that will give you chills even if you're poolside, baking in the sun. The rogue's gallery is still amongst the most original and entertaining in current fiction.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Adaptability:**  \n  The writing is perfect for a quality TV-series. Why this hasn't happened, after the success of *Bosch* et al., is hard to fathom.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel delivers the atmospheric and engaging storytelling Connolly is known for, it suffers from a sense of repetitiveness and a lack of direction in the overarching story arc.
