            "This novel is a unique blend of introspection and deep theology, culminating in a powerful and joyous eucatastrophe. It stands out as one of the author's most impactful works, providing both entertainment and thought-provoking insights.",
            "This novel delves into the complexities of unwavering faith while confronting its lies, half-truths, and past wounds. It uniquely champions judgment and justice as acts of righteousness, a refreshing perspective among Christian literature. The narrative grapples with themes such as loving cruel pagan gods, preaching to spirits in prison, and freeing individuals from obligatory devotions they don’t genuinely feel called to. Ultimately, it underscores the idea that the greatest among us serves all and that true authority stems from love.",
            "At first glance, this book appears to be a typical romantic YA fantasy, complete with a girl on a quest to save her kingdom and an enemies-to-lovers dynamic. However, it goes beyond these conventions, exploring profound themes of religious trauma, deconstruction, and the challenge of reconciling faith with its complexities."
        ],
        "conclusion": "WHAT MONSTROUS GODS is a dark, passionate, and deeply theological fantasy that transcends typical genre expectations. It is a powerful exploration of faith, deconstruction, and the complexities of devotion, resonating strongly with readers who have experienced similar journeys. While it may not appeal to everyone in the same way, it is a thought-provoking and cathartic read, especially for those with a background in theology or religious deconstruction.",

However, it transcends these expectations, delving into deeper themes.  \n  - It is more accurately a story of religious trauma, deconstruction, and the struggle to reconcile faith with its complexities.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  - The novel explores the idea of sticking stubbornly to one’s faith while untangling its lies, half-truths, and old wounds.  \n  - It celebrates judgment and justice as acts of righteousness, a rare perspective in Christian-authored works.  \n  - It addresses loving pagan gods despite their cruelty, preaching to the spirits in prison, and liberating people from acts of devotion they feel no calling for.  \n  - The story emphasizes that the servant of all will be the greatest and that loving something is essential to having authority over it.  \n\n- **Personal Resonance:**  \n  - The book is deeply introspective and theological, resonating powerfully with readers who have experienced religious deconstruction or have a background in theology and mythology.  \n  - It is particularly cathartic for those who grew up in religious environments, regardless of specific denominations (e.g., Protestant or Catholic).  \n\n- **Writing and Impact:**  \n  - The novel is described as weird, introspective, and deeply theological, with a powerful and joyous eucatastrophe.  \n  - It is one of the author’s most impactful works, offering both entertainment and profound thought-provoking insights.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWHAT MONSTROUS GODS is a dark, passionate, and deeply theological fantasy that transcends typical genre expectations.

            "This story is profoundly theological, intensely gripping, and utterly captivating. It follows Lia as she confronts her destiny to break a centuries-old curse by killing the wicked sorcerer Ruven. The plot takes an intriguing turn when Lia discovers that Ruven's ghost still lingers, forcing her to navigate the perilous game of feigning divine magic and blessings.",
            "Lia Kurenava, the 17-year-old heroine, is truly exceptional. Smart, determined, manipulative, selfless, and quick-tempered, she stands out as a captivating antiheroine. Remarkably, she is the only heroine I can recall who assassinates the hero when it’s her mission, adding to her complexity. In contrast, the antagonist, Ruven, feels underdeveloped, which detracts from both the story and the romance. I find myself wishing the book had been a duology to allow for more depth and development in the romantic subplot.",
            "The world-building in this book is exceptional, intricately woven with themes of religion and devotion. It presents a diverse pantheon of gods, each with distinct characteristics, steering clear of the typical Greco-Roman archetypes. The dynamic interactions among gods, saints, devotees, and sinners drive the narrative forward in a captivating manner.",
            "The novel prompts readers to reflect on themes of devotion, worship, and the repercussions of deceit.",
            "This standalone novel captivated me with its rich world and memorable characters, particularly Lia. I truly hope to see more stories set in this enchanting universe."

While the romance and antagonist could have been better developed, the story’s intensity and thought-provoking themes make it a great read.

It is deeply steeped in religion and religious matters, exploring themes like devotion to a god and the nature of worship.\n  - The novel features a sprawling pantheon of gods with unique traits, avoiding stale Greco-Roman-inspired deities.\n  - The interplay of gods, saints, devotees, and sinners propels the story forward in a compelling way.\n\n- **Characters:**\n  - Lia Kurenava, the 17-year-old heroine, is AWESOME. She is smart, determined, manipulative, selfless, and quick-tempered, making her a captivating antiheroine.\n  - Lia is the only heroine I can remember who actually assassinates the hero when it’s her mission to, which adds to her complexity.\n  - Ruven, the antagonist, is woefully ill-fleshed-out, which detracts from the story and the romance.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n  - The story is deeply theological, incredibly intense, and utterly gripping. It explores Lia’s destiny to break a centuries-old curse by killing Ruven, the wicked sorcerer.\n  - The plot takes a twist when Lia discovers Ruven’s ghost still lingers, and she must navigate the dangerous game of pretending to have divine magic and blessing.\n  - The novel raises thought-provoking questions about devotion, worship, and the consequences of deceit.\n\n- **Romance:**\n  - The romance suffers due to Ruven’s underdeveloped character. I almost wish the book had been a duology to give the romance more depth and development.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**\n  - This seems to be a standalone novel, but the world is so fantastic that I sincerely hope there will be more stories set in it.\n  - The book left a lasting impression on me, especially Lia’s character and the intricate world-building.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a deeply theological and gripping novel with incredible world-building and a complex, unforgettable heroine.

The main character’s obsession with religion dominates the story, making it feel overly preachy and detracting from the fantasy and romance elements.\n\n- **Genre Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The book is marketed as a fantasy enemies-to-lovers story with a ghost romance element, which initially seemed promising. However, the romance is largely irrelevant in the first half and then escalates abruptly in the second half, creating a jarring and unsatisfying experience. The fantasy and romance elements feel overshadowed by the religious themes.\n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The pacing is uneven, with the romance feeling rushed and shoehorned into the story. The slow burn expected from an enemies-to-lovers trope is absent, replaced by a sudden and unconvincing escalation of the romantic relationship.\n\n- **Character Development and Focus:**  \n  The main character’s constant preoccupation with religion overshadows her development and the potential for deeper exploration of the enemies-to-lovers dynamic. The ghost romance element, which could have added depth, is underutilized.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the promising setup and alignment with personal preferences (enemies-to-lovers, ghost romance), the book ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying experience. The heavy-handed religious themes and poorly executed romance make it a disappointing read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its fantasy setting and enemies-to-lovers premise, it was overshadowed by the author’s heavy-handed religious themes and poorly paced romance.

Its profound insights and masterful craft make it a worthwhile read for those willing to embrace its weirdness, horror, and speculative theology. This chilling theological thriller fuses secondary world fantasy with deep explorations of death, judgment, guilt, and grace. It echoes the dark religious themes of Flannery O’Connor and the mind-bending narratives of Madeleine L’Engle, all while remaining anchored in horror and paganism.",

The story follows Lia, who is devoted to the Gods, and the narrative is steeped in their presence and power. Unlike other fantasy works where religion feels abstract or like magic, this book always feels distinctly religious. The exploration of religious trauma and questioning faith, especially in a world where the Gods’ existence is undeniable, added a layer of depth I found compelling.  \n\n- **World-Building and Deities:**  \n  The Gods in this world are both wondrous and terrifying, and I thoroughly enjoyed their descriptions. The saints associated with each God were brilliantly crafted. I was particularly intrigued by the heretical faith, which seemed modeled after Catholicism. It left me wondering if this God is the true creator across all universes or if the story is set in an alternate past or future of our own world.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Lia and Ruven’s love story had potential but felt underdeveloped. While there was tension between them, the focus of the story was more on Lia’s relationship with religion rather than her relationship with Ruven. I enjoyed their dynamic, but it could have been much more impactful with additional development.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The book kept me thoroughly engaged and even surprised me a few times.

I felt positive about it—happy to have read it—but I’m not sure I fully unlocked all it offers. It’s the type of book that, upon a second read, I might develop a deeper understanding and greater appreciation. For this first read, I felt a lot of intrigue and love for the story. It surprised me in a very good way. While the journey wasn’t always easy to traverse, it’s one I’ll look back on fondly.  \n\n- **The Leads:**  \n  Lia, the protagonist, is sent on a mission to kill one person to heal others, an action that haunts her throughout the story. She is not a warrior but intends to be a nun, focused on healing. Her actions alter her destiny, forcing her to question her identity. I enjoyed that Lia is deeply flawed—envious, insecure, stubborn, and sometimes ignorant. She is vulnerable and unsure but always full of love, hope, and a desire to better the world. Her ability to reflect and reconsider her actions, though sometimes slow, is refreshing in a YA lead.  \n  Ruven, though not a POV character, is a major foil to Lia. Their perspectives clash, yet they deeply understand each other. Both were born to be weapons without realizing it, and they share the inner turmoil of that realization. I enjoyed Ruven’s interruptions and his observations about the world Lia seemingly saved.  \n\n- **The Romance:**  \n  The romance is understated and a slow burn. While I was satisfied to some extent, I wanted more focus on the complex, complicated love story rather than the plot involving gods, saints, and royals. The connection between Lia and Ruven is immediate and undeniable, but their falling in love felt a bit sudden given their complicated history. I wish their relationship had developed more overtly.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  I struggled with the world-building, particularly the theology and magic. While everything was laid out, I found it difficult to fully grasp, which hindered my enjoyment at times. However, I recognize this may be more of an issue with me than the book.  \n\n- **Character Development (Lia’s Flaws):**  \n  While I appreciate Lia’s flaws and vulnerability, her willful ignorance frustrated me. Even when the truth became obvious, she denied it for too long. I wish she had been more decisive sooner. Despite this, I still loved her character, flaws and all.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book intrigued me and was a slow burn in many ways—not just in romance but also in its buildup.

The supporting characters are one-dimensional, ranging from complete jerks to outright foolishness, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story and leaving the world feeling flat and lifeless.",

Her earlier works featured lush descriptions, tragically compelling heroines, and romances that built slowly with an inescapable allure. Unfortunately, this book fell far short of those expectations.\n\n- **Main Character:**  \n  The protagonist is a spineless, whiny, and brainwashed hypocrite. She spends the entire book lamenting about the gods—how much she loves them, why they don’t love her, and why everyone else doesn’t love them. Her constant complaints became repetitive and grating, making it hard to connect with her or root for her.\n\n- **Love Interest:**  \n  The so-called \"love interest\" feels like an afterthought, serving no real purpose other than being the resident \"Hot Boi.\" He contributes nothing meaningful to the story, and anything he helps the protagonist with, she could have figured out on her own if she weren’t so obsessed with the gods. There’s zero chemistry between them, and their supposed \"romance\" feels entirely unconvincing.\n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  The side characters are one-dimensional and lack depth. They’re either complete assholes or just plain stupid, adding little to the story and failing to make the world feel alive or dynamic.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The book suffers from \"white page syndrome,\" where the setting is barely described, and I never felt grounded in the world. It was hard to visualize where the characters were or what was happening, making the story feel disjointed and unengaging.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  I started skimming around 50 pages in, holding onto the faint hope that the story would improve. Sadly, it never did. The pacing dragged, and the ending was particularly disappointing, leaving me with a sense of regret for having invested time in the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a major letdown compared to Hodge’s previous works.

It delves into complex themes such as Body Horror™, the tension of loving a being while also betraying them, the nature of service within that betrayal, sin, redemption, and the essence of monstrosity. The story explores the delicate balance of loving gods while consciously defying them, resonating with me on a spiritual level, despite my usual reluctance toward spiritual reading.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Concept and Themes:**  \n  The novel’s premise of a vaguely gender-swapped Sleeping Beauty immediately drew me in. The exploration of complex themes like Body Horror™️, the tension of loving a being you are also betraying, service within that betrayal, sin, redemption, love, and the question of what makes something monstrous was deeply compelling. It’s a story about balance and the internal conflict of loving gods while intentionally going against them, which resonated with me on a spiritual level (even though I’m not typically into spiritual reading).\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book made me go feral—it’s the kind of story that had me frantically highlighting and screenshotting passages. I even tortured a friend who hadn’t read it by sharing my excitement, much to the delight of another friend in the chat who had read it. The emotional depth and internal struggles of the characters were incredibly engaging.\n\n- **Writing Style and References:**  \n  I appreciated the Shakespeare and Hopkins references scattered throughout the novel. They added a layer of richness to the wacky Catholic fantasy setting. It’s clear the author’s homeschool education/UD degree influenced her writing, and it worked beautifully for this story.\n\n- **Imperfections:**  \n  While the book isn’t perfect, its flaws didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment. The strengths of the concept, themes, and emotional impact far outweighed any minor issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating blend of unique concepts, deep emotional conflict, and rich literary references. Despite its imperfections, it left a lasting impression on me and sparked intense discussions with friends. It’s a book that balances love, betrayal, and the question of monstrosity in a way that feels both thought-provoking and deeply personal.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

It hooked me right away, and I felt an instant connection with the heroine. However, the first part of the story moved incredibly fast, which surprised me. The sudden shift in direction took some time to adjust to, and while I eventually settled into the new narrative flow, it wasn’t the seamless experience I had hoped for.\n\n- **Writing Style and Readability:**  \n  The writing style is lovely, and the book was easy to read.

They were distinct, layered, and complex, making them incredibly interesting. Some characters revealed their personalities more quickly than others, but getting to know each one was rewarding. The gods, in particular, stood out as compelling figures.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The world-building was wonderful, and I appreciated the intricate politics woven into the story. However, I felt that the brilliance of the world-building might have slightly overshadowed the narrative. It was almost too expansive for this specific story, leaving me wanting more integration between the setting and the plot.\n\n- **Romance and Emotional Depth:**  \n  While there was a romantic element, it felt underdeveloped. The romance didn’t deepen as much as I had hoped, which left me wanting more emotional connection between the characters.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Critique:**  \n  Despite my high expectations, the book didn’t become the dream match I had envisioned. The combination of elements—while individually strong—felt a bit chaotic. There were so many amazing characters that some didn’t get enough page time, which was a pity. That said, I still loved the book and enjoyed reading it. My initial judgment is slightly clouded by the fact that I had expected a bit more.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had many strengths, including its engaging writing style, complex characters, and rich world-building.

            "The book was more Christian than I anticipated. What initially seemed like a lighthearted mention of Jesus turned out to reference the primary alternative god, worshiped by the MMC and other characters. As the main character's faith journey progressed, the religious themes became increasingly problematic and preachy. The narrative consistently emphasized the unworthiness of her gods and pushed the message that conversion to the “correct” god (Jesus) was essential. This lack of subtlety felt particularly forceful between the 40% and 50% marks.",

For instance, her harrowing journey through the briars is overshadowed by the relatively minor threats of a dangling skeleton and some whispers. Similarly, her encounter with the \"heretic\" sorcerer feels anticlimactic, as she defeats him in mere seconds due to embarrassment. These moments lack the depth and believability needed to engage the reader.",

There were a few questionable elements in the plot and ideas, but I was willing to overlook them. The mention of Jesus as a heretic god in the first chapter was funny and intriguing.  \n\n- **Religious Themes and Execution:**  \n  The book turned out to be heavily Christian, which was not what I expected. The “funny Jesus mention” at the beginning was actually a reference to the main alternative god in the story, who is the god of the MMC and many other characters. The religious themes became problematic and preachy, especially as the MC’s faith journey unfolded. The story repeatedly emphasized that her gods were unworthy of worship and pushed the idea of converting to the “correct” god (Jesus). This was not subtle and felt overly pushy, especially from the 40%-50% mark.  \n\n- **Character Development and Plot Logic:**  \n  The main character’s experiences felt inconsistent and underwhelming. For example, her journey through the briars was described as an all-consuming, traumatizing event, but the worst thing she faced was a dangling skeleton and some whispers. Additionally, her encounter with the “heretic” sorcerer was anticlimactic, as she defeated him in less than two seconds due to embarrassment. These moments lacked depth and believability.  \n\n- **Tone and Consistency:**  \n  The tone of the story shifted dramatically from the beginning, which was engaging and promising, to becoming overly preachy and repetitive. The constant emphasis on religious conversion and the superiority of one god over others became exhausting and detracted from the fantasy elements I initially enjoyed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI was disappointed with this book, especially after a strong start.

            "The story falters due to a lack of meaningful stakes, as Lia effortlessly completes every daunting task, from defeating the sorcerer Ruven to stealing powers from the gods and unraveling the mystery of the plague. These key events feel rushed and superficial, undermining the narrative's tension and impact. The pacing is uneven, with too many rapid-fire plot developments lacking adequate exploration. The predictable ending feels as convenient and implausible as the preceding events. Additionally, the story struggles with inconsistencies, particularly in Lia's communication with Ruven; at times, he seems to reside in her mind, knowing her thoughts, while at other moments, she faces external challenges in communicating with him.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Exploration of Religion in Fantasy:**  \n  I found the exploration of religion in this fantasy novel fascinating, especially since the gods have a tangible presence in the world. The book raises intriguing questions, such as what distinguishes a god from a powerful magical being, the nature of worship, the meaning of faith in a world with incomprehensible forces, and how miracles function in a magical setting. The novel delves into these themes through Lia’s evolving relationship with the gods she serves, and I appreciated that it didn’t take a simplistic “all organized religion is bad” stance. Instead, it focused on Lia’s changing understanding of the gods and how she reshapes the world around her.  \n\n- **World-Building and Theology:**  \n  The gods in this world are depicted as weird, eldritch, and terrifying, which immediately drew me in. The opening scene, describing the gruesome deaths of their chosen saints, set the tone perfectly. While I know the author is Catholic and suspect this influenced the world-building and theology, I read the book as a broader exploration of religion rather than a direct reflection of Catholicism. This approach worked well for me, as I’m not particularly religious myself.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The romance between Lia and the ghost of a man she murdered added an unexpected and intriguing layer to the story. Their dynamic was both complex and compelling, contributing to the novel’s overall appeal.  \n\n- **Setting and Technological Evolution:**  \n  I enjoyed the contrast between the medieval-inspired world of the cursed royal family and Lia’s more Victorian-esque present day. The significant social and technological advancements over the 500-year curse added depth to the setting and made the world feel dynamic and lived-in.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I had a great time reading this novel. It thoughtfully explored its themes of religion, faith, and power while delivering a compelling story with unique world-building, intriguing character dynamics, and a satisfying blend of the fantastical and the philosophical.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this story, Lia, the protagonist, shines through her compelling first-person perspective. With remarkable depth, analysis, and growth, she navigates her journey as a devout individual who survives a plague that has decimated her family. Gifted with a unique ability, Lia is tasked with awakening the royals and vanquishing Ruven, the sorcerer responsible for their magical slumber and the silence of the gods. However, as her mission unfolds, unexpected challenges cause her to waver. \n\nConversely, the secondary characters, particularly Ruven, felt disappointingly one-dimensional. His backstory—a boy killed by Lia whose spirit haunts her—offered the perfect setup for an engaging enemies-to-lovers arc filled with tension and complexity, but ultimately fell flat.",
            "The kingdom of Runakhia, inspired by Victorian England, captivated me with its intricate political, social, and religious tensions. Religion plays a central role in this land, fragmented by conflicting faiths and beliefs. The concept of the royal family awakening from a 500-year magical slumber is compelling, complemented by the presence of gods and saints who, despite their divine power, are fated to die painfully. However, while the world-building is rich in potential, it felt underdeveloped and somewhat vague. I was drawn to the dark fairy tale atmosphere that permeates the narrative, as well as the enchanting and evocative prose."

Religion takes a central role in the book, in a land divided between deeply different faiths and beliefs. The idea of the royal family, awakened after 500 years of magical sleep, is fascinating, as is the presence of gods and saints who, infused with divine power, are destined to die painfully. However, the world-building, while full of potential, seemed poorly developed and nebulous to me.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story proceeds hastily and chaotically, with plot holes, convenient situations, numerous time jumps, and scenes taken for granted. At times, I felt like pieces were missing, which left me frustrated.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Lia, the protagonist with her first-person POV, convinced me with her depth, analysis, and development. Born with a miraculous gift, having survived a plague that wiped out her entire family, and deeply devout, Lia is destined to awaken the royals and kill Ruven, the sorcerer responsible for their magical sleep and the silence of the gods. However, when her success leads to unexpected developments, Lia begins to falter.  \n  On the other hand, the secondary characters, including Ruven, seemed extremely shallow to me. This was especially disappointing for Ruven, whose premise—a dead boy killed by Lia, whose spirit begins to haunt her—had the potential for a perfect enemies-to-lovers dynamic with plenty of angst.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"What Monstrous Gods\" is a novel with a fantastic premise and a dark, evocative atmosphere, but its execution fell short for me. The world-building felt underdeveloped, the plot was chaotic, and the secondary characters lacked depth.

The beginning sets the stage for something truly special.

And to be completely honest, supposedly Reylo-inspired books rarely work for me in terms of world-building.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing proved to be a challenge—sometimes feeling rushed and at other times dragging slowly, making it difficult to stay fully engaged.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters didn’t quite manage to win me over. The emotional journey between Lia and her ghostly antagonist-turned-love-interest was intriguing, but their conflicts were not super interesting. It made it hard to fully invest in their relationship. While the ghostly romance had intriguing moments, the love-hate dynamic felt a bit jarring.

It came across as insta-love, even if they didn't acknowledge it right away. Although their shared experiences in their respective faiths provided some common ground, the relationship lacked sufficient development for me to fully invest in it. I found Lia compelling due to her struggles with religious trauma, but Ruven felt underdeveloped in comparison.",

Lia's journey to understand what it means to love and serve her gods—especially when they reveal themselves to be less admirable than she thought—is compelling. I found her feelings of doubt, guilt, and uncertainty relatable, even as her primary concern centered on the gods' worthiness rather than their existence.

While I didn’t end up loving this book, I found it immensely interesting.\n\n- **Theological Lore and Themes:**  \n  The theological lore and themes were a standout aspect of the book, though they might not be everyone’s cup of tea. Lia’s struggle with what it means to love and serve her gods, especially when they turn out to be less wonderful than she believed, was compelling. I could relate to her sense of doubt, guilt, and wavering, even though her primary concern was the gods’ worthiness rather than their existence. It’s clear the author is deeply devout, given Lia’s dedication to loving her gods despite everything.\n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n  I wish I liked the romance more. While I’m always up for enemies-to-lovers, I felt Lia and Ruven declared their love too quickly and easily, given their limited interactions. It felt like insta-love, even if they didn’t admit it until later. I understand they played similar roles in their respective faiths and could relate to each other, but there wasn’t enough development for me to fully invest in their relationship. I found Lia interesting due to her struggles with religious trauma, but Ruven, in comparison, didn’t have much depth.\n\n- **Pacing and Emotional Investment:**  \n  I also wish Lia’s biggest triumphs in the book didn’t feel so anticlimactic. Perhaps I wasn’t sufficiently emotionally invested? This is a complaint I’ve had with Hodge’s other books as well, so maybe I just have a difficult time connecting with her works, even though I appreciate her ideas intellectually.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I wish I liked the book more, but I did enjoy the theological discussions and found Lia’s character intriguing.

The book intrigued me from the synopsis to how the story unfolded, offering many different twists and ideas that made it feel like a story of its own.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved the different characters, especially how we see List struggle internally to find a place where she belongs and feels loved, torn between her duty and the evidence she sees before her.  \n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The book brought deep thinking to my mind, particularly in how the characters make choices based not on moral goodness but on pure selfish desires to live.  \n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  The only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars is that I wish the ending was more fleshed out. It felt slightly off and could have been developed further.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a captivating and original retelling of Sleeping Beauty that stood out for its unique twists, compelling characters, and thought-provoking themes. While the ending could have been more polished, it was still a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (due to the slightly underdeveloped ending)."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Anticipation and Expectations:**  \n  This was easily my most anticipated book release of the past four years. The author kindly granted me early access to *What Monstrous Gods*, and even on its publication day, I’m still not over it. As a fan of the author’s previous work, *Cruel Beauty*, I wasn’t surprised that this novel is a fairytale retelling only in the broadest sense. Instead, it delves into the aftermath of \"Sleeping Beauty's\" awakening from the perspective of the rescuer, blending mythology, worldbuilding, and body horror in a way that feels both familiar and elevated.  \n\n- **Mythology:**  \n  The novel introduces an index of the gods of Runakhia, a kingdom undergoing industrialization under parliamentary rule after the royal family was cursed into a centuries-long slumber. These gods are far from pretty—described in vivid, unsettling detail, such as the deity of wisdom and night, whose head is “a ring of pale flesh around a void.” The story poses profound questions about faith and philosophy: Can two belief systems coexist? Why don’t the gods I worship love me back? What am I willing to sacrifice for my religion? Themes of sacrifice and duty, recurring in the author’s previous works, are explored more exhaustively here, making it the most theological of her novels.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is insanely good. The story juxtaposes a vaguely Victorian present with the resurgence of Medieval aesthetics tied to the antiquated royal family, who struggle to adapt to modernity or accept that their subjects thrived without them for centuries. Despite being a standalone novel, *What Monstrous Gods* delivers intricate details about politics, international relationships, and language without overwhelming the reader.  \n\n- **Body Horror:**  \n  This novel is not for the faint of heart—read the trigger warnings. The saints, devoted to the gods of the pantheon, undergo mutilating transformations that ultimately lead to their deaths after years of performing miracles. The protagonist, Lia, becomes one of them, clinging to her faith despite the gods’ cruelty toward their most devoted followers. The love interest spends much of the story with a gaping knife wound to the throat, adding to the heavy, visceral content.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance is exceptional—a slow-burn that feels understated yet deeply compelling. It stands out from the formulaic love stories that have become common in recent years. While I’m not typically a fan of Reylo-style pairings, this one worked beautifully for me.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Themes:**  \n  As a YA novel, I’m curious to see how younger readers resonate with the religious themes. For me, it was a deeply satisfying and thought-provoking read, worth the wait a thousand times over.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*What Monstrous Gods* is a masterful blend of mythology, worldbuilding, and body horror, elevated by its theological depth and understated romance. It’s a novel that lingers long after the last page, offering a rich, immersive experience that more than justifies the years of anticipation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In the first third of the book, I found myself uncertain about its direction; by the second third, I thought I had figured it out, only to feel lost again in the final third. The quick pacing made this experience jarring, and it wasn’t until two-thirds of the way through that I genuinely started to care about what happened to Lia and her companions.",
            "Lia, the latest leading lady with magical heterochromia, is an unexpected addition to this year's trend, which seems to be gaining popularity. Raised by nuns, she embodies a certain naivety that leads her to make questionable decisions, including striking a deal with the ghost of the young man she killed in cold blood—surely a choice that can only end poorly.",
            "From the outset, the list of gods preceding the narrative establishes their monstrous nature. The suggestion that these deities have replaced a form of pseudo-Christianity and vanished following the fall of a specific ruling family creates an intriguing backdrop. The protagonist, Lia, seeks vengeance for their murder by targeting the responsible mage. Initially, her plan unfolds smoothly, but soon takes a dramatic turn for the worse.",
            "The book's ending was ultimately satisfying, but as someone aware of the complexities surrounding Christianity, I found it uncomfortable that the author presents Christianity—or a pseudo-Christian framework—as the superior religion. This is especially true given the dismal portrayal of the alternative pantheon. However, I appreciated Lia's innovative solution to the gods' dilemma.",
            "*What Monstrous Gods* is a strange and dark read that has lingered in my mind for over a month, which is quite an achievement considering I've read around eighty books since then. If you're looking for a story that will haunt you and deliver intriguing twists, I highly recommend this one."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *What Monstrous Gods* is an intriguing and dark novel with a unique premise and memorable details. While the pacing and initial lack of emotional investment were drawbacks, the ending was satisfying, and the story has lingered in my mind long after reading. It’s a solid read for those who enjoy dark, thought-provoking narratives.",

Tragically, her website is blocked by my work's filter, so I can't admire their other art.\n\n- **World-Building and Premise:**  \n  From the very beginning, with the list of gods that precedes the narrative, it is clear that these gods really are monstrous. The implication that these gods have supplanted some sort of pseudo-Christianity, and then disappeared from the world upon the termination of one particular ruling family, sets an intriguing stage. The main character, Lia, is set to avenge their murder by killing the mage responsible. Things go better than planned, and then they very much do not.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  I spent the first third of the book wondering where it was going, the next third being pretty sure I knew where it was going, and then in the final third, I found myself back to square one. Since this was a very quick read, it felt a little jarring, especially since it wasn't until about two-thirds of the way in that I actually found much reason to care about what happened to Lia and company.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Lia is yet another leading lady with magical heterochromia, a trait I would not have picked for this year's trend, but which seems to be cropping up all over the place. She also, having been raised by nuns, is very naïve and makes terrible bargains left and right, including with the ghost of the young man she killed in cold blood, because there's no possible way that could go badly.\n\n- **Ending and Themes:**  \n  Ultimately, the book's ending was satisfying, though as someone who lives in this world and is aware of all the baggage Christianity carries, I was not entirely comfortable with the conclusion that Christianity (or Hodge's pseudo-Christianity) is the superior religion in any case. Even considering how gods-awful the pantheon representing the other option is. I liked Lia's solution to the problem of the gods.\n\n- **Impact and Memorability:**  \n  It's a weird, dark book, but many of its weird, dark details have stayed with me for over a month, and that's pretty impressive given I've read something like eighty books in the meantime. If you want a book that will prey on your mind and present you with some interesting twists, I happily present you with *What Monstrous Gods*.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *What Monstrous Gods* is an intriguing and dark novel with a unique premise and memorable details. While the pacing and initial lack of emotional investment were drawbacks, the ending was satisfying, and the story has lingered in my mind long after reading. It’s a solid read for those who enjoy dark, thought-provoking narratives.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars - It was interesting. I liked it."

            "This novel, though presented as YA, offers a profound exploration of theological themes, tackling faith, justice, paganism, authority abuse, worship, and the essence of divinity. It posits love as the ultimate power, challenges the concepts of suffering and death, and examines humanity's ability to understand the divine. While it does feature quests and love triangles, the narrative's primary focus remains on theology.",
            "This novel presents itself as a YA fantasy with an unconventional premise, featuring intriguing protagonists: an apostate nun turned murderer and the ghost of a heretic sorcerer reminiscent of Guy Fawkes. Additionally, it serves as a retelling of Sleeping Beauty, suggesting elements typical of the genre such as action, romance, and critiques of organized religion. While some readers may express dissatisfaction with its religious themes and minimal romance, I hope the book finds success. The exploration of the question, “Should I worship this god?” is far more engaging than “Should I date this boy?”—though the narrative encompasses both aspects."

It’s also a Sleeping Beauty retelling, which initially suggests classic YA staples like action, romance, and critiques of organized religion.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  Despite its YA appearance, the novel delves deeply into theological themes, exploring faith, justice, paganism, abuse of authority, acts of worship, and the nature of divinity. It examines love as the ultimate power, the reversal of suffering and death as the ultimate right, and humanity’s capacity to comprehend the divine. While it includes questing and love triangles, the focus is primarily on theology.\n\n- **Religious and Spiritual Context:**  \n  The book is distinctly Catholic yet also incorporates pagan elements, offering a rich and chewy spiritual mythology. It avoids the vagueness often seen in Christianesque fantasy novels, presenting a clear theological perspective.\n\n- **Personal Reflection and Critique:**  \n  While I don’t necessarily agree with all the theological points or allegorical conclusions, I find the novel fascinating and am glad it exists. It’s the kind of thought-provoking, spiritually rich story I would have loved in high school, and I appreciate its presence in the YA genre.\n\n- **Reception and Audience:**  \n  I hope the book succeeds despite some disgruntled reviewers who criticize its religious themes and lack of romance. The question of “Should I worship this god?” is a far more compelling theme than “Should I date this boy?”—though the book offers both.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a surprising and thought-provoking blend of YA fantasy and deep theological exploration.

It’s religion, religion, religion, so if that’s not your cup of tea, you may want to avoid this.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel, particularly the enemies-to-lovers dynamic between Ruven and Lia and the unique ghost romance element. However, the heavy focus on religious themes might not appeal to everyone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book presents several intriguing plot points, such as the deadly briar, the red plague, a world-ending divine threat, an epidemic of unwilling sainthood, and a near-sacrifice. However, none of these elements are fully developed or sustained, as they are resolved too quickly—often within just a few chapters. This lack of commitment to any single storyline undermines the tension and stakes, leading to a predictable and lackluster narrative where it becomes evident early on that Lia will always come out unscathed. Ultimately, this predictability detracts from the overall impact of the story.",

Her knowledge of the briar and the gods is minimal, and she never takes the initiative to learn more. This naivety persists throughout the story, leaving her character stagnant and unengaging as she fails to grow or learn from her mistakes. Furthermore, her abrupt transformation into a trained killer—such as when she distracts Ruben while sitting in his lap—feels unconvincing and poorly executed."

The ‘heretics’ follow one God, and their temples feature imagery like apples, serpents, and two people, which felt overtly biblical. This God is also the only one whose followers aren’t condemned to a painful death, which seemed oddly specific and out of place in a fantasy setting. While I don’t know much about the author’s personal views, her acknowledgements mention her Christianity, which might explain the thematic focus.  \n\n- **Character Development (Lia):**  \n  Lia, the protagonist, was frustrating to follow. Despite being raised by nuns for nearly a decade to become a hero, she seemed woefully unprepared and uninformed. She knew almost nothing about the briar or the gods and never took the initiative to learn more. Her naivety persisted throughout the story, and she didn’t appear to grow or learn from her mistakes, which made her journey feel stagnant and unengaging. Additionally, her sudden transformation into a trained killer, such as when she killed Ruben by distracting him while sitting in his lap, felt unconvincing and poorly executed.  \n\n- **Plot Execution and Tension:**  \n  The book introduced numerous intriguing plot points, but none were fully developed or sustained. For example, the deadly briar, the red plague, a world-ending divine threat, an epidemic of unwilling sainthood, and a near-sacrifice were all resolved within a few chapters each. This lack of commitment to any single plotline eliminated any sense of tension or stakes. It became clear early on that Lia would always emerge unscathed, which made the story predictable and dull.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  The book was marketed as featuring a love triangle, but this felt like a stretch. Lia’s arranged marriage to a character she barely knew lacked any emotional depth, especially since she described their kiss as “flat.” This character’s defining trait was his obedience to his mother, which made him unappealing and unmemorable. Lia’s relationship with Ruben was equally unconvincing. They spent most of their time arguing, with no meaningful bonding moments, yet suddenly declared their love for each other. This abrupt shift felt unearned and left their relationship feeling hollow.  \n\n- **Sleeping Beauty Retelling Aspect:**  \n  The book hinted at being a Sleeping Beauty retelling, but this element was underutilized. The briar, a key aspect of the retelling, was resolved within three chapters, making it feel like an afterthought rather than a central theme.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell short of its potential due to inconsistent genre execution, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of sustained tension. The heavy Christian imagery clashed with the fantasy premise, and the romantic subplots felt forced and unconvincing. While the story introduced several intriguing ideas, none were explored in depth, leaving the narrative feeling disjointed and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This may stem from its pacing and ambitious scope, which limits deeper character exploration and leaves less lasting impression.

This book delivered that trope to the extreme—literally killing the man at one point (not a spoiler). It was peak enemies-to-lovers, and I loved it.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Lia, the protagonist, was well-developed, with many flaws and multi-dimensional struggles. Her inner turmoil—conflicted between what she should feel and what she actually feels—was realistic and relatable, especially for readers dealing with religious trauma. I enjoyed her growth from a blind faith follower to the person she becomes by the end.  \n\n- **Exploration of Personal Identity:**  \n  The novel delves into the theme of personal identity, particularly who you are outside of your religion. It emphasizes not losing yourself completely to any belief system, which I found thought-provoking and relevant.  \n\n- **Religious Themes:**  \n  The book is very religion-heavy, which I knew going in, but I didn’t realize just how much it would dominate the narrative. While the exploration of religious themes was interesting, I felt the same point was driven home repeatedly, which became a bit tedious for me.  \n\n- **Genre and Recommendation:**  \n  This is a fun and entertaining read, perfect for fans of fantasy romance where the romance is a side plot rather than the main focus.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its intense enemies-to-lovers dynamic, well-developed characters, and exploration of personal identity. While the heavy religious themes became repetitive at times, it was still a captivating and thought-provoking read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Though I appreciated the concluding resolution, the journey to that point was not without its flaws.",
            "Lia and Ruven's enemies-to-allies-to-lovers dynamic was the highlight of the story for me. I appreciated their evolving relationship, though I would have preferred an even slower burn. Unfortunately, the side characters came across as one-dimensional, lacking the depth and development I had hoped for.",
            "The author's writing style perfectly suits a YA dark fairy tale. The Sleeping Beauty-inspired curse at the beginning immediately drew me in, and the overall tone effectively captures the genre.",
            "The story offers a captivating exploration of the gods and saints of Lia, as well as the Royal Family's religion. However, I was disappointed by the limited examination of Ruven's heretical beliefs and the Magisterium. I craved a deeper understanding of how these two faith systems interacted, overlapped, or contrasted, particularly in relation to Ruven's sorcery and its connection to his own faith.",

I was inclined to DNF it at times but ended up finishing it. However, I’m just not quite sure why I couldn’t click with it. I wanted to give up a few times.\n\n- **Character Development (Lia):**  \n  The amount of love and adoration Lia has for the gods is admirable, but it felt overly repetitious throughout the book. It seemed like she was trying to convince herself of her feelings, which became obnoxious for my taste. I did like that she received powers from many gods and saints, which made her seem like a Queen in my mind. However, I was confused as to why she didn’t actually become queen after passing so many tests.\n\n- **Romance (Lia and Ruven):**  \n  The romance between Lia and Ruven felt forced and not necessarily genuine. Ruven fell in love with Lia because she was the only one he could communicate with, and Lia fell in love with him because he was dead and couldn’t challenge her wavering faith. Additionally, Ruven had been alone for 500 years, so it felt like he latched onto the first person he could connect with. Overall, the romance felt weird and unnecessary to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  I was glad the Queen died, but I also think the prime minister and a few other judgmental characters should have died too. They acted like royalty themselves and were too self-righteous. The resolution left me with mixed feelings, and while I’m glad it’s a standalone, I don’t feel the need to collect or revisit this book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I finished the book, I didn’t connect with it as deeply as I hoped.

Lia's devout and fanatical nature is a defining trait, yet her abrupt abandonment of lifelong beliefs in the face of danger feels unrealistic. Meanwhile, Ruven's background is hinted at but never fully explored, leaving his original curse and motivations ambiguous. Lia's obsessive mindset and holier-than-thou attitude make her a difficult character to connect with. Her continued worship of her flawed gods, even after uncovering the truth about them, feels inconsistent and frustrating. I would have preferred to see her take a more defiant stance against them.",

His physical allure is highlighted both on the cover and within the narrative, enhancing his appeal. However, his backstory feels fragmented, leaving me wanting to learn more about his history. The tale unfolds predominantly through Lia’s perspective, centering on her experiences and journey. Both Lia and Ruven are endowed with divine gifts, which elevate them to royal status and grant them extraordinary abilities.",

His physical attractiveness is emphasized, both on the cover and in the narrative, where he comes across as even more appealing. However, his backstory feels incomplete, leaving me curious about his full history.\n\n- **Characterization (Lia):**  \n  The story is primarily told through Lia’s perspective, focusing on her experiences and journey. Both Lia and Ruven are god-blessed individuals, granting them unique powers and placing them in positions of royalty.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel incorporates a fictional religion with elements reminiscent of real-world religions. Those blessed by the gods at birth can form pacts to gain powers, such as judging others, granting sainthood, or healing. This system elevates the god-blessed to royalty, creating a distinct social hierarchy.\n\n- **Political System:**  \n  The political landscape is complex and chaotic. After the monarchy fell asleep for five hundred years, the people established a parliament system. Upon the monarchy’s awakening, the two systems clashed dramatically. The monarchy is portrayed as more dangerous, as their upbringing normalizes extreme actions, including murder, which is frequently mentioned.\n\n- **Plot and Originality:**  \n  While the story is more than just a retelling of Sleeping Beauty, it didn’t fully captivate me. The incorporation of religion and politics adds depth, but the overall execution felt average, neither outstanding nor disappointing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers an intriguing blend of fantasy, religion, and politics, with strong character dynamics and a unique twist on the Sleeping Beauty trope.

However, Lia achieved her destiny right from the start. She was trained to kill Ruven, the heretic sorcerer who turned the royal family into sleeping beauties and silenced the gods, and wake the royals. She actually succeeded in this mission early on.\n\n- **Character Development and Struggles:**  \n  Lia’s faith and belief in the gods were tested throughout the story, and this was where she struggled the most. Her determination and intelligence in resolving situations were enjoyable to read about. Ruven’s character was initially hard to grasp, but it became clearer as the story progressed.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The politics of saints, gods, and the royal family was an interesting take, especially with the queen being portrayed as unreasonable and unfit to wield such powers. The religious aspect, though not personally relatable, was a strong element in Lia’s journey as she discovered the nature of the gods from her own perspective.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance in the story was pretty good and added depth to the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book! Having previously read Rosamund Hodge’s *Cruel Beauty* and *Crimson Bound*, I was excited to pick up *What Monstrous Gods*, and it did not disappoint.

The author skillfully maintains the essence of the original fairytale while taking the narrative in surprising new directions. The traditional Sleeping Beauty storyline concludes early, making the bulk of the book refreshingly different. While I appreciated that the main character learns alongside the reader, I felt that too much information was withheld from both Lia and the audience until the climax, leaving me feeling lost for much of the story—an experience I did not enjoy.",

However, I found the main character, Lia, quite frustrating. At 17 or 18 years old, her limited perspective felt unrealistic, especially as her world broadened. I wished for her to learn and adapt more rapidly in the face of challenges."

Despite being 17/18 years old, she had a small worldview and clung to it even as her world expanded. I felt she needed to learn and adapt more quickly when things went wrong.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  - While I appreciate the main character learning alongside the reader, I felt that too much was kept from Lia (and the reader) until the climax. This left me feeling in the dark for most of the story, which I didn’t enjoy.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I really enjoyed this story, though not as much as Hodge’s other works.  \n  - It was a good, swift read, and I’m happy to see Hodge back with another novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a well-crafted retelling with a unique twist on the Sleeping Beauty story.

Lia stands out as a memorable female protagonist, particularly for following through on a murder she was prepared for, which is a rare trait among female MCs in my experience.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  The beginning of the book is gripping, but the pace slows down considerably once Lia is ensconced in the palace. Despite this, the slower pacing aligns well with the story's style and allows for deeper exploration of character dynamics.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The dialogue between Ruven and Lia is appreciated, and the slow-burn, low-spice romance fits the narrative well.

The exploration of themes like faith, blessings, burdens, and the sacrifices made for the greater good added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Romance:**  \n  While Lia was a standout, the rest of the cast felt underdeveloped and sometimes empty. Ruven, her love interest, was particularly lacking in depth, often repeating the same lines. The romance started strong but eventually stalled due to a lack of progression or complexity.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  Fans of books like *Little Thieves* and *Vespertine* will likely enjoy this novel, as it shares similar thematic and stylistic elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*What Monstrous Gods* was a pleasant surprise, offering a compelling main character, rich world-building, and thought-provoking themes. While the supporting characters and romance fell short, the novel remains an engaging read, especially for fans of fantasy stories centered around gods and faith.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It captures the feeling of doing what you were raised to do, only to realize it fixes one problem while creating others. It also delves into the nostalgia for the past and the realization that the \"good old days\" weren't as perfect as they seemed, while the present demands attention.\n\n- **Religious and Philosophical Exploration:**  \n  The story features heretics inspired by Catholic Christianity, including a broken god who chose to become human and a holy mother figure, Mareya. These elements are not portrayed as the \"correct\" choice, but rather as one of many valid beliefs. The protagonist, Lia, respects the heretics' beliefs without abandoning her own faith in her gods. The narrative avoids preachy proselytizing, emphasizing that in a world where gods are undeniably real, no single belief system can claim absolute truth.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Belief Systems:**  \n  Lia's unwavering faith in her gods, Nin-Anna and Mor-Iva, is a central focus. The heretics, while significant, do not attempt to convert her aggressively. This balance highlights mutual respect and the coexistence of diverse belief systems in a world where multiple gods are real.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a profound exploration of faith, purpose, and the complexities of belief in a world where gods are undeniably real.

On a positive note, the twist of Lia teaching morals and ethics to a god adds a fresh perspective to the concept of prayer. Conversely, the Queen's inconsistent awareness of Lia's actions feels overly convenient for the plot's progression. Additionally, Ruven's sudden return to hearing Lia's thoughts at the end lacks clarity. Nevertheless, the decision to kill Ruven a second time provides a satisfying resolution to his character arc. Overall, the story has strong moments but is hampered by inconsistencies.",

Overall, it was an interesting experiment, but I’m unsure if I would choose audiobooks again for this type of story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The setting is immersive, with thorny briars, a silent divine presence, and an unstoppable plague adding depth to the world.\n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story begins with Lia, an orphan raised in a convent, who possesses the Royal Gift, allowing her to enter the briars and attempt to break the curse. She succeeds, becoming the first person in 500 years to survive the ordeal, confront the sorcerer Ruven, and awaken the royal family. The plot then shifts to a journey of awakening the Old Gods, uncovering their true nature, and navigating the challenges of a world 500 years removed from the royal family’s perspective. Ruven’s ghost haunting Lia adds a layer of tension and introspection.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Lia is a compelling protagonist, shaped by her orphaned upbringing and her faith in the Old Gods. Her journey is one of self-discovery, as she grapples with Ruven’s ghost and questions her beliefs. Prince Araunn and his sister are also well-developed, struggling to adapt to a world vastly different from the one they knew. Ruven, both as a sorcerer and a ghost, serves as a complex antagonist who challenges Lia’s convictions.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel delves into themes of faith, identity, and the nature of divinity. Lia’s internal conflict, spurred by Ruven’s haunting, forces her to reevaluate everything she was taught about the Old Gods. The royal family’s struggle to find their place in a new world adds another layer of thematic depth, exploring the tension between tradition and change.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n‘What Monstrous Gods’ is a masterful blend of fantasy, fairy tale retelling, and deep thematic exploration.

The overall story was a little lackluster for me.  \n\n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  I felt the FMC was relatable. Hodge wrote her with human flaws and ways of thinking that made it easy to understand her motivations.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was weird to me. It felt forced. One minute she hates him, then a complete 180 she loves him (but still low-key kinda hates him?).  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  I did like the parallels to Christianity, and it was cool to connect the dots.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I was excited to read this book, I found the plot somewhat underwhelming and struggled to engage with it.

While *What Monstrous Gods* isn’t quite as enchanting as *Cruel Beauty*, fans of the latter will still enjoy this novel.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The interactions between Lia and Ruven were delightful, from their instant attraction to their lively bickering. I was invested in their relationship from the start. However, despite the slow-burn nature of their romance, I felt their transition from frienemies to declaring love was too abrupt.\n\n- **Dialogue and Writing:**  \n  Some of the dialogue, both between Lia and Ruven and among other characters, felt repetitive at times. Another round of edits could have strengthened these exchanges.\n\n- **World-Building and Atmosphere:**  \n  I particularly enjoyed the eerie descriptions of the Gods and the afflictions that befall their saints. This added a horror-tinged touch to the YA fantasy, which I always appreciate.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot consistently kept me engaged, and I was always eager to pick up the novel to see what would happen next.

            "Lia, the main protagonist, embarks on a compelling journey, transforming from a manipulated young girl into a master manipulator herself, all while maintaining her unwavering faith in the gods. Her quest for affection and recognition adds emotional depth to her character. However, the secondary characters, especially the royal family who awaken after 500 years, feel underdeveloped. Their emotions and personalities lack depth, which is disappointing given their significance in the narrative. More interactions between Lia and the prince and princess would have enhanced their dynamics significantly. Additionally, the romance between Lia and Ruven, intriguing for its conflicting beliefs, suffers from a lack of intimacy and tension, making it feel underexplored and less engaging than it could be.",
            "The story’s world and plot are deeply rooted in religion and belief, resulting in a unique and immersive setting. The exploration of faith and devotion stands out as a central theme.",
            "The novel delves into profound theological questions regarding belief, devotion, and the human relationship with the divine. It challenges readers to consider whether one can believe in gods without submitting to them and whether the gods genuinely love humanity. These thought-provoking themes enrich the narrative and add depth to the story."

It prompts readers to reflect on whether one can believe in gods without obeying them and whether the gods truly love humanity. These themes are thought-provoking and add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development (Protagonist):**  \n  Lia, the main protagonist, undergoes a compelling journey. She evolves from a manipulated young girl to someone who manipulates others, yet her unwavering faith in the gods remains a constant. Her search for affection and recognition is touching and adds emotional weight to her character.  \n\n- **Character Development (Secondary Characters):**  \n  The secondary characters, particularly the royal family who awaken after 500 years, lack depth. Their feelings and personalities are underdeveloped, which is disappointing given their significant role in the story. More scenes between Lia and the prince and princess would have enriched their dynamics.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance between Lia and Ruven, while intriguing due to their opposing beliefs, lacks moments of closeness and tension. It feels underdeveloped and could have been more engaging.  \n\n- **World-Building and Plot:**  \n  The world and plot are heavily centered around religion and belief, creating a unique and immersive setting. The exploration of faith and devotion is a standout aspect of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is an interesting read with thought-provoking themes and a strong protagonist. However, the lack of depth in secondary characters and the underdeveloped romance detract from its potential.

Araunn's rigid worldview and alignment with his mother's ambitions further complicate Lia's journey.",

While Prince Araunn is a solid character, the connection between him and Lia felt lacking, possibly due to Ruven's constant presence in the background. Araunn's black-and-white perspective and alignment with his mother's goals further complicate Lia's position.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is engaging and keeps the reader turning the pages to see what happens next. Lia's journey from breaching the briar to facing the consequences of her success—marrying into the royal family and forging a pact with a god—is compelling. The tension escalates as the gods reveal themselves, forcing Lia to navigate danger and decide who to trust, with Ruven potentially being her only ally.  \n\n- **Standalone Nature:**  \n  As a standalone novel, the story is well-contained, with a satisfying arc that doesn’t require a sequel.

            "Lia is born with a miraculous gift destined to kill Ruvan and awaken the royals. However, after fulfilling her mission, she discovers her duty is far from over; she must marry into the royal family and forge a pact with a god—or face death. Complicating matters, Ruvan's spirit begins to haunt her. I particularly enjoyed the unfolding of the story, especially the revelations about the royal family, the nature of the gods, and the lengths Lia must go to survive. Her dynamic with Ruvan and her unwavering love for the gods, despite her growing doubts and the deconstruction of her upbringing by the nuns, drive these elements forward.",
            "The relationship between her and Ruvan is brilliantly crafted, with a captivating development that evolves and surprises throughout the story. I particularly appreciated how her core values remained consistent, even as she grappled with self-doubt and questioned the gods and those around her in light of her shifting worldview.",
            "In this captivating tale, the author's immersive world-building shines once again. Set in a realm reminiscent of the Victorian era of industrialization, the story follows Lia, who awakens a royal family enchanted by the sorcerer Ruvan to slumber for 500 years. It’s akin to waking from a dream during the Hundred Years' War only to find oneself in the midst of the industrial age.",
            "I admire the author's retellings for their dark, twisted narratives grounded in intriguing historical elements and her faith, which adds depth to the characters. This novel, a reimagining of Sleeping Beauty, skillfully flips gender roles and explores themes of religion, faith, and the use of religion as a political weapon. It is both gripping and absorbing, with an eldritch quality that keeps readers engaged."

They’re always dark, twisted, and rooted in fascinating historical elements, as well as her faith, which adds an interesting extra dimension to her characters. This novel, a take on Sleeping Beauty, flips gender roles and examines religion, faith, crisis of faith, and religion as a political weapon, all while being gripping, eldritch, and absorbing.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  As with all of Hodge’s stories, the world is rich and real. This one is analogous to the Victorian era of industrialization, with Lia waking a royal family kept under a sleeping enchantment by the sorcerer Ruvan for 500 years. (Imagine falling asleep during the Hundred Years’ War and waking up in the industrial era.)\n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  Born with a miraculous gift, Lia's destiny is to kill Ruvan and wake the royals. But when she succeeds, she finds her duty is not yet complete, for now she must marry into the royal family and forge a pact with a god—or die. To make matters even worse, Ruvan's spirit is haunting her. I really enjoyed the way the story develops, particularly the truth about the royal family, the nature of the gods, and the things Lia finds herself doing simply to survive. These elements are propelled by her dynamic with Ruvan and her unwavering love for the gods, even as she doubts what they are and deconstructs what she was taught by the nuns who raised her.\n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  Her relationship with Ruvan is brilliant, and I love the way it develops, transforms, and twists. I also appreciated how her core values remained the same even as she doubted herself, the gods, and everyone around her as her worldview shifted.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a dark, twisted, and absorbing retelling of Sleeping Beauty that masterfully explores themes of faith, religion, and identity. The rich world-building, complex character development, and evolving relationships make it a compelling read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Lia's journey is rife with unexpected challenges, including a pact with a god, an impending marriage to the prince, and the looming threat of death from the queen.

            "As someone who doesn't adhere to a faith that influences my character or life choices, I found it challenging to connect with the main character, Lia. My sister in Christ was overly judgmental towards others, making it difficult for me to empathize with her. Even by the end, I didn't particularly like her. However, I appreciated her transformation when faced with the consequences of the gods' wrath. This experience forced her to confront the harsh realities of sainthood and the royal family's attempts to appease the gods. While Lia does undergo a change and even challenges the gods, she ultimately continues to serve and love them. Personally, I would have taken a more rebellious stance—down with the gods, anyone? Holy war, anyone?",
            "The world-building, while not overly complex, was still exquisite. I enjoyed the contrast between the ancient world and the new one, which evoked a turn-of-the-century, industrial revolution vibe in my mind. The references to factories and a still-developing practice of medicine added to this atmosphere. The magic system in the book was delightful; although I would have liked to see Lia use her magic more independently, it's clear she’s still a novice, often relying on Ruven for assistance. Nonetheless, it was a joy to read.",
            "This book delves into the violent nature of the gods, showcasing their brutality until the very end. The narrative highlights the dire consequences faced by the royal family in their attempts to appease these deities, as well as the horrific realities of sainthood.",
            "While I don't have strong feelings about this book, I found it to be an enjoyable read. I wasn't familiar with the author, Hodge, before picking it up, but her deep Catholic faith is evident throughout the narrative. Overall, it was a solid read—nothing extraordinary, but definitely worth borrowing from the library."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I don’t have many passionate feelings for this book, but it was a lot of fun to read! I didn’t know anything about the author (Hodge) beforehand, but I can assure you of one thing—sister is VERY Catholic, haha. It comes through loud and clear in the book. All in all, it was a good read. Nothing amazing (sorry, Rosamond), but worth renting from the library.\n\n- **Character Development (Lia):**  \n  As someone who doesn’t practice a faith that drives my character or life choices, my biggest frustration was trying to understand the main character’s (Lia) frustrations. My sister in Christ was VERY judgmental towards her fellow man. I found it impossible to fall in love with her. Even in the end, I don’t think I particularly liked her either. What I did enjoy about her was her ability to change when she found herself on the other side of the gods’ wrath. She was forced to open her eyes to the atrocities of sainthood and the consequences of the royal family’s efforts to please the gods. While Lia DOES change and even “changes” the gods, she still serves and loves them. Personally, I would have slayed the gods—down boots, yas queen—HOLY WAR ANYONE?!\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was not sophisticated but was still exquisite. I loved imagining the juxtaposition of the ancient world traveling the new world. You never quite figure out what time period the new world is supposed to be in, but in my brain, I got a very turn-of-the-century, industrial revolution vibe. She mentions factories, and the practice of medicine is still very frontier.\n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic in the book is so fun. I wish we saw Lia use her magic more, but she would be considered a novice. Almost every time she used it, she had Ruven’s help. Still, it was a lot of fun to read.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  For her love interest to be the man she MURDERED and is now HAUNTING HER!?! Oh, Rosamond, you are diabolical. I am down ferociously bad for Ruven. I love his instigation. I love his sneakiness. He was probably my favorite character.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The gods in this book are violent—to the end. It’s horrific. The book explores the consequences of the royal family’s efforts to please the gods and the atrocities of sainthood.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable read with fun elements like the magic system, world-building, and the intriguing romantic subplot. However, the main character’s judgmental nature and the violent themes surrounding the gods made it difficult to fully connect with the story. It’s worth a read but didn’t leave a lasting impression.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Lia is a remarkable character whose determination to overcome obstacles captivated me. I appreciated her flaws and admired her strength in the face of adversity, especially from those who underestimated her. The romance in the story is not the main focus, which I found refreshing. While I would have liked to see more development in the relationship between the two characters (whose names I’ll withhold to avoid spoilers), it was still satisfying because the narrative doesn’t hinge on it. This stands in contrast to many young adult fantasy novels where romance often takes precedence. The story is loosely inspired by Sleeping Beauty, featuring a sorcerer who curses the royal family and their castle, plunging the kingdom into a slumber and severing their connection with the gods and goddesses. Lia is trained by nuns to become a weapon to break the curse and restore the divine connection.",
            "The world-building, deities, characters, and plot are all captivating. The story explores themes of religion, faith, love, acceptance, rejection, and survival, delving into the complexities of self-love, love for others, and the nuances of faith—or the absence of it."

It delves into love for oneself, others, and one’s faith—or lack thereof.  \n\n- **Character Development (Lia):**  \n  Lia is a standout character. I found myself enamored with her determination to survive every obstacle she faced. I loved her flaws and how strong she remained despite them and the people who looked down on her.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance is not a focal point of the story, which I appreciated.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot Complexity and Tone:**  \n  The novel is described as convoluted and dark, with an imperfect yet genius quality. The story feels heavy and intricate, which may not appeal to everyone but has a certain brilliance to it.\n\n- **Character Development (Lia):**  \n  Lia, the protagonist, is portrayed as someone stuck in a cycle of emotional turmoil, fixated on her past relationship with Ruven. Her inability to move on and her constant revisiting of what Ruven could have or would have said becomes exhausting. It takes a significant portion of the book before the reader might begin to care about her.\n\n- **Character Development (Arunn):**  \n  Arunn, the \"really nice guy,\" emerges as the most likable and relatable character by the end of the story. He stands out as someone the reader genuinely cares about, in contrast to Lia's prolonged emotional struggles.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The pacing feels slow, particularly due to Lia's repetitive focus on Ruven. This makes the middle section of the book drag, as it feels like the story isn't progressing meaningfully.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*What Monstrous Gods* is a dark and complex novel with moments of brilliance, but its pacing and the protagonist's prolonged emotional fixation on a past relationship can make it a challenging read. While Lia's character may eventually grow on the reader, Arunn shines as the most compelling and relatable figure by the end.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores are mentioned in the review."

It felt deeply metaphorical and heavily tied to a Catholic upbringing, which made it challenging for me to fully connect with the main character's motivations and journey.  \n- **Personal Resonance:**  \n  While I appreciate the creativity behind the book, it didn’t resonate with me as much as I had hoped.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Unfortunately, I can’t recommend this book, but I still value Hodge's other works and encourage readers to explore her other stories—or this one if they believe it would resonate with them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my admiration for Rosamund Hodge’s lyrical writing and the unique concept of *What Monstrous Gods*, the execution and heavy reliance on metaphorical and Catholic themes made it difficult for me to connect with the story.
