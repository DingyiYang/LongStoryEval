The ending is particularly satisfying, featuring a stunning twist that beautifully ties everything together. The secrets revealed are darker and more sinister than anticipated, leaving me shocked as I uncovered the truth. One twist, in particular, completely caught me off guard, as it was something I hadn't considered while theorizing about the events of that night. The idea that human bones can convey truth is both intriguing and poignant, offering closure to the victims' loved ones and justice for the perpetrators.",

The emotional depth and satisfying ending make it a standout read. I highly recommend it and am eager to see more from this author, especially if it involves Detective Jane.",

            "I thoroughly enjoyed this story from the outset. The discovery of a body beneath an old chapel sets the stage for a compelling mystery. Detective Jane Munro’s investigation into the duration and circumstances surrounding the body’s presence kept me engaged. The narrative unfolds from multiple perspectives, featuring six individuals who have waited over forty years for their story to be told. This approach provides insight into the possible identity of the corpse and hints at the individuals' involvement in the mystery. The plot thickens with the discovery of a second body, challenging the notion that Annalise simply ran away or was abducted by the prime suspect. With two bodies in play, Jane and her team grow increasingly wary of Annalise’s friends, as layers of lies and secrets complicate the investigation further.",

The narrative gradually unveils the last interactions each friend had with her and explores their potential roles in her vanishing. However, it struck me as peculiar that Annalise's name is withheld for a significant portion of the tale, despite being mentioned in the blurb. This choice felt unusual, particularly since even her sister doesn’t refer to her by name at first.",

The discovery of a body beneath an old chapel sets the stage for a compelling mystery.

The story is told from multiple perspectives, introducing six individuals who have been waiting over forty years for their story to come out. This narrative choice gives readers insight into who the body might be and hints at their involvement in the mystery.  \n\n- **Character Development and Backstory:**  \n  The six individuals referenced in the story are intricately connected to the girl, Annalise, whose disappearance is central to the plot. It’s slowly revealed how each of these friends last interacted with her and how they could have been responsible for her disappearance.

The layers of lies and secrets make the investigation even more intriguing.  \n\n- **Ending and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The ending is shocking and heartbreaking.

Alongside Jane, alternating chapters are told by Angela Sheldrick, a local reporter covering the story, the Shoreview Six (a group of friends now in their 60s who were teens when the girl disappeared), and other random characters whose relevance is revealed over the course of the story. It’s a whodunnit in the finest form; you’re never really sure who killed the mystery girl until it all starts to unfold near the end. There is also another missing local boy, and that mystery is solved as well.  \n\n- **Writing and Characters:**  \n  The book was well-written, and the characters were interesting. It really kept me guessing throughout.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  I listened to this on audio, which was excellent. Carly Robins really brought these characters to life and made the large cast of players easier to follow. Her narration was fantastic and made the book even more enjoyable for me.  \n\n- **Loose Ends and Hopes for the Future:**  \n  I wish a few of the loose ends had been wrapped up, but I’m crossing my fingers that maybe White will bring Jane back for a series or at least another story. A girl can hope, right?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI really loved this book! It was a gripping mystery with well-developed characters and excellent narration. While I would have liked a few more loose ends tied up, the overall experience was highly enjoyable, and I’m eager to read more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 for Goodreads."

Her story unfolds with a raw honesty that captures the ripple effects of her relationships and self-destructive choices. She deserved better—more love and validation.

Very clever.  \n  - The reporter, Angela Sheldrick, had a wonderful growth curve that showed her becoming more compassionate and wiser, thus more effective.  \n\n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n  - There was a twisted ending that I didn't guess, so I always appreciate when a writer surprises me.  \n  - The only disappointment was that this wasn't a series. There were SO MANY plot lines unanswered by the ending.  \n  - There were strong enough hints so we could assume how each life of the Shoreview Six would continue, but I like it wrapped up more neatly.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  - Now I'm left to worry about characters I deeply invested in. :)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel excelled in character development and delivered a surprising, twist-filled ending. However, the lack of resolution for many plotlines left me wanting more closure, especially for the characters I grew attached to.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The resolution was satisfying, even though it was heartbreaking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a captivating and emotionally charged mystery that held my attention from start to finish. The well-crafted plot, combined with excellent narration and a tragic yet cohesive resolution, made it a memorable read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The novel revolves around six high school friends who, as adults, are haunted by a crime they committed in their youth. The discovery of a teenage girl’s bones threatens to unravel their lives, as their shared secret resurfaces. The premise explores the consequences of their actions and the moral dilemmas they face, particularly when forced to choose between self-preservation and loyalty.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The characters, now in their mid-30s, are portrayed as deeply flawed individuals who once engaged in \"ugly behaviors\" as teenagers. Their adult lives are shaped by the crime they committed, and the tension between them intensifies as their secret is exposed. The narrative highlights how easily people can betray one another when faced with the choice of saving themselves or protecting others.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Accessibility:**  \n  The book is currently unavailable in my library’s Libby audiobooks catalogue but is accessible on Audible. The storytelling is engaging, with a focus on suspense and the psychological impact of the characters’ shared guilt.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“The Unquiet Bones” by Loreth Anne White is a gripping exploration of guilt, betrayal, and the long-lasting consequences of past actions. The plot is compelling, and the characters’ moral struggles are both relatable and unsettling. While the book’s availability is limited to Audible, it’s a worthwhile read for fans of psychological thrillers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The final chapters deliver an intense and impactful reveal that leaves a lasting impression. Centered around the discovery of bones beneath a chapel at a ski resort, the story is linked to the 47-year-old disappearance of a 15-year-old girl, Annilise Jansen, as well as the vanishing of another high school student around the same time. The narrative alternates between the present and 1976, establishing a gripping dual timeline.

This abundance makes it challenging to keep track of everyone, especially since some perspectives are introduced late and others are infrequent. Consequently, it's difficult to forge a connection with most characters, as some appear only in a single chapter. Jane, Angela, and certain members of the Shoreview Six seem to dominate the narrative, overshadowing others.",

            "The story relies on a somewhat familiar trope—a long-buried secret and friends who deceived one another, with the truth now on the verge of revelation. The timeline spans nearly 50 years as Jane investigates a cold case. The plot thickens when the bones of a missing girl are discovered beneath a chapel slated for relocation, challenging the belief that she was either abducted or left town. As the Shoreview Six begin to unravel, I find myself drawn deeper into the investigation, uncovering additional evidence linked to another missing person.

I'm eagerly hoping for another book from the author soon. Additionally, the storyline introduces another strong female character, Dr. Ella Quinn, a forensic anthropologist. As she examines the bones, Dr. Quinn uncovers clues that help unravel the mystery of the girl's identity. I also appreciated the reporter's perspective on the case. Her character arc is particularly compelling, transforming from an aggressive journalist willing to do anything for a story into someone who evolves significantly by the end."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  - My favorite part of this book is the detective, Jane; she’s smart and capable even while dealing with her own personal tragedy. I hope that author Loreth Ann White writes another book for her.  \n  - There’s an interesting storyline with another strong female character, Dr. Ella Quinn, who’s a forensic anthropologist. As Dr. Quinn begins to examine the bones, she finds clues to who the girl is, and her bones help tell the story to crack the case.  \n  - Another piece I really liked was the reporter's point of view on the case. I really liked the story arc with her and how she ended up at a very different place than the aggressive reporter who would do anything to get the story at the beginning.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - It is a somewhat tired trope, though, with a secret from many years ago, friends who lied about things, but now the truth is threatening to come out. The time gap is quite long here, as Jane investigates a cold case nearly 50 years old.  \n  - Things start unraveling for the friends, the Shoreview Six, when the bones of a missing girl are found under a chapel that is being relocated. So much for the theory that the girl was abducted or left town.  \n  - As the Shoreview Six group starts to fall apart, Jane keeps digging into old evidence in the case. This includes another missing person.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  - The story is engaging, with a mix of strong female characters and a well-paced investigation that keeps you hooked.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a compelling novel with strong female characters, particularly Detective Jane and Dr. Ella Quinn, who drive the story forward. While the trope of a long-buried secret is somewhat overused, the execution and character arcs make it an enjoyable read. The reporter’s transformation adds an interesting layer to the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 great female detective stars.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nMy thanks to NetGalley and Montlake for the opportunity to read and honestly review this one."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  The discovery of human bones buried more than fifty years ago beneath a chapel in the woods reopens a cold case long forgotten. I loved the concept of the bones that “speak” and how much a cold case can impact the family of the victims for decades, simply from the unknown.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The author is a master at setting the scene, and in *The Unquiet Bones*, it is a dark and gritty one with elements of Nordic Noir. The gritty atmosphere is brought to life brilliantly, making the story immersive.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character development, especially for a thriller, was very well done. The messiness of each character and their actions adds a great amount of depth to the story. However, I would suggest taking notes on who’s who at the beginning to prevent character confusion as the story ramps up.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Experience):**  \n  I read this, in part, via audiobook, and it was fantastic! Carly Robins is pitch-perfect at narrating a full cast of characters and bringing the gritty atmosphere to life. I felt fully immersed whenever I listened to the audiobook, which is yet another reason I love audiobooks.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This book is perfect for readers who enjoy detective stories, cold cases, domestic suspense, atmospheric reads, ensemble casts, and bingeable books.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  ⚠️ CW: There may be very serious triggers for some. Please DM me or research before reading if you are sensitive to certain topics.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Unquiet Bones* is a gripping and atmospheric thriller with a compelling cold case at its core.

The narrative remains cohesive as it delves into themes of friendship, family, loss, and grief, while provoking thought with questions like: How far would you go to protect a loved one? What lies would you tell? What secrets would you keep? The story challenges our perceptions of endings; Jane muses that not every story concludes happily—or even at all—prompting reflection on whether an unresolved ending is worse than a disappointing one. This ambiguity enriches the narrative, inviting readers to consider whether it’s better to confront a nightmare or cling to futile hope.",
            "The author crafts remarkably complex and nuanced characters who defy simple labels of hero or villain.

Five characters, having kept a secret for nearly 50 years, confront the events of Labor Day weekend in 1976, when two teenagers, Annalise and Darryl, mysteriously vanished. Additionally, the novel examines the theme of closure through Jane, the detective investigating the cold case.

It is told from multiple points of view (at least eight), yet it feels cohesive. The story explores themes of friendship, family, loss, and grief, while also posing thought-provoking questions like, \"How far would you go to protect someone you love? How many lies would you tell? How many secrets would you keep?\"  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The author, White, writes incredibly complex and nuanced characters. They are not portrayed as villains or heroes but as ordinary people, reflecting Neil Gaiman's observation that \"most of the great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused, not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad, but by people being fundamentally people.\"  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The story delves into the emotional weight of secrets and the passage of time. Five characters have kept a secret for almost 50 years, and now, in their early 60s, they confront what happened over Labor Day weekend in 1976 when two teenagers, Annalise and Darryl, went missing. The novel also explores the concept of closure, as seen through Jane, the detective on the cold case, who brings closure to others but remains trapped in her own \"grief limbo\" after her fiancé disappeared without a trace.  \n\n- **Ending and Ambiguity:**  \n  The novel raises questions about the nature of endings. Jane reflects that a story \"doesn't always have a happy ending, or any ending,\" leaving the reader to ponder whether no ending is worse than a bad ending. This ambiguity adds depth to the narrative, making the reader question whether they would rather face a nightmare or live in fruitless hope.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Unquiet Bones* is a deeply moving and suspenseful novel that masterfully weaves together complex characters, intricate plotlines, and profound themes. It challenges readers to reflect on the nature of secrets, grief, and the human condition, leaving a lasting emotional impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n~4.25"

I wish authors would consistently use either first or last names, as alternating between them only complicates things. However, once it gains traction, the plot accelerates and doesn't let up. There are perhaps too many perspectives, and the revelations are quite twisted, so I'd recommend checking the trigger warnings before diving in. The discovery of a body during the demolition of an old church sparks the central mystery, with everyone suspecting it's the remains of a young girl who vanished nearly 50 years ago.

However, the abundance of characters and POVs, some of which felt unnecessary, detracted slightly from the experience. Despite these flaws, it’s a book I would recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75/5 stars"

            "This book maintains an excellent pace, particularly in how it reveals key truths. Instead of saving the shock for the conclusion, the author skillfully employs flashbacks and ongoing investigations to gradually unfold the story. The buildup to the ultimate reveal is masterful, culminating in a satisfying resolution. However, the ending felt somewhat rushed; while the mysteries surrounding the unquiet bones and the other missing teen are resolved, the prosecution and aftermath are glossed over, leaving me wanting to see the impact of the guilty parties' actions and their punishment. \n\nI noticed a minor inconsistency regarding Angela Sheldrick receiving a tip about one of the Shoreview Six without revealing the tipper's identity. This stood out, particularly given the author's usual thoroughness in tying up loose ends. The narrative centers on a decades-old mystery involving a teenage girl and a boy who vanished 47 years ago, with the discovery of a body beneath a chapel triggering an investigation that unearths dark secrets within a small community. \n\nThe race to uncover the truth is gripping, evoking the Shoreview Six's hidden regrets and guilty feelings. Amidst this tension, the question arises: will our pact endure or crumble under the weight of our pasts?",
            "The characters collaborate effectively to unveil the truth, showcasing the author's skillful synchronization of their roles. Even Angela Sheldrick, the fame-hungry journalist, evolves from a nuisance to a valuable asset by the story's conclusion. Jane, the lead investigator, is a capable detective fueled by her grief over her missing fiancé. Her pain propels her relentless quest for justice for the deceased and closure for their families.",
            "This book poignantly explores the pain and anguish experienced by the loved ones of missing persons, effectively portraying the profound impact of such a loss. Jane's personal struggle with grief is particularly compelling, showcasing the emotional depth of the narrative. The heartbreaking ending reveals the predators as the true culprits, alongside individuals guilty of withholding crucial information that might have expedited the case's resolution. While justice is ultimately served, the conclusion feels rushed, leaving me wanting more detail on the prosecution and the aftermath involving the Shoreview Six and other offenders.",
            "Despite some minor flaws, this is an outstanding thriller and a must-read for mystery enthusiasts. The book is packed with unexpected revelations, and although there are subtle hints scattered throughout, they don't detract from the finale. With its emotional depth, intricately woven mystery, and satisfying conclusion, I would rate this a solid 4 stars. Highly recommended!",
            "Loreth Anne White is a trusted author for thrillers, and with nearly all her works under my belt, I eagerly picked up her latest release. The blurb raised my expectations, and I was thrilled to immerse myself in the story."

        "conclusion": "The author delivers another gripping thriller with *Beneath the Devil’s Bridge*.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author's Reputation and Expectations:**\n   - Loreth Anne White is one of my go-to writers for thrillers. I have read almost all of her work, so picking up this book as soon as it was released was a no-brainer.\n   - The blurb gave me high expectations, and I was excited to dive into the story.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**\n   - The book revolves around a four-decade-old missing person mystery involving a teenage girl and a boy who disappeared 47 years ago. The discovery of a body buried under a chapel kickstarts an investigation that uncovers ugly secrets within a small community.\n   - The story begins with the unearthing of the body, which has its own secret, and follows lead investigator Jane as she delves into the past. It is revealed that two people went missing, and the discovery rocks the lives of six friends who had made a pact to bury a secret that could destroy them.\n   - The race to uncover the truth is intense, with guilty feelings and hidden regrets rising to the surface for the \"Shoreview Six.\" The question of whether their pact will hold or unravel under the weight of their pasts drives the narrative.\n\n- **Pacing and Revelations:**\n   - The pace of the book is great, especially the pacing of the revelations. The author does not hold back the truth until the very end but uses flashbacks and the investigation to piece together the puzzle consistently throughout the story.\n   - The buildup to the ultimate reveal is expertly done, and everything comes together perfectly at the end.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - The characters work in tandem to reveal the truth, and I appreciated how the author masterfully synchronized their roles. Even the fame-hungry journalist, Angela Sheldrick, plays a significant part. She starts as a nuisance to the detectives but redeems herself by the end.\n   - Jane, the lead investigator, is a competent detective driven by her own grief over her missing fiancé. Her pain becomes the driving force behind her determination to bring justice to the dead and closure to the families.\n\n- **Emotional Depth and Themes:**\n   - The book deals with the pain and anguish of the loved ones of missing persons, portraying the impact such a loss can have on their lives. The emotional depth is well-captured, especially in Jane's personal struggle with grief.\n   - The ending is heart-breaking, with predators being the ultimate culprits. There are also people guilty of withholding information that could have solved the case earlier. While justice is served, the ending felt rushed, and I wished for more details on the prosecution and aftermath of the \"Shoreview Six\" and other culprits.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**\n   - The ending wraps up the mystery of both the unquiet bones and the other missing teen, but it felt rushed. The prosecution and aftermath were not shown on-page, and I wanted to see how the lives of the guilty changed and how they were punished.\n   - There was a minor inconsistency regarding Angela Sheldrick receiving a tip about one of the \"Shoreview Six,\" but the tipper's identity was never revealed. This small inconsistency stood out, especially since the author usually ties up all loose ends in her previous works.\n\n- **Overall Impression and Recommendation:**\n   - Despite the minor flaws, this was a great thriller and a must-read for mystery lovers. The book delivers \"whack you out of nowhere\" revelations, and while there are some obvious crumbs throughout the story, they don’t spoil the ending.\n   - The emotional depth, well-crafted mystery, and satisfying conclusion make this a solid 4-star read for me. Highly recommended!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLoreth Anne White delivers another gripping thriller with *Beneath the Devil’s Bridge*. The book excels in its pacing, character development, and emotional depth, though the ending felt slightly rushed and left some loose ends. Overall, it’s a well-written cold case mystery that keeps you hooked until the final revelation.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 4 stars."

            "The pacing of the story is uneven; it starts off slowly before ramping up with numerous revelations that blur the lines between facts and distractions. The extensive cast of characters, some with multiple names or nicknames, makes it difficult to keep track of everyone. Central to the plot is the discovery of human bones beneath a chapel at a ski resort, linked to the unsolved disappearance of 16-year-old Annalise Jansen in the mid-1970s. The narrative delves into how this revelation affects me and Annalise's friends, dubbed “The Shoreview Six,” as our alibis and secrets come under scrutiny during the investigation.",
            "Detective Jane Munro is a captivating protagonist, navigating her personal challenges—her fiancé's disappearance and her pregnancy—while remaining focused on solving the case. The dynamic between Jane and Dr. Quinn, the forensic anthropologist, is engaging and suggests promising future collaborations.",

I would be excited to see this develop further with these characters.",

            "The novel features an engaging slow-burn plot that evolves into a fast-paced narrative, making it easy to read quickly. It feels akin to a well-researched police procedural, skillfully blending forensics, a scheming journalist, glimpses of the antagonists, and a grieving protagonist. However, with nine narrators, character development suffers, resulting in some loose ends and unresolved subplots, such as Jane's husband. While the expansive cast keeps the plot moving, it often prioritizes advancement over deep character exploration.",
            "The story features a dozen dynamic characters, but due to the limited 350-page count, not all receive full development. Characters are introduced in three stages: first, through the discovery of the uncovered bones; next, as they come together to align their narratives; and finally, as they unravel the events surrounding their friend's murder. Only a few, like Jane, the female protagonist, Angela, the ambitious reporter, and the deceased girl, are well-developed. Some characters lack depth, with their backstories and current lives insufficiently explored, which diminishes the emotional impact of the resolution.",
            "This story skillfully depicts the complexities of a young friendship, highlighting both the desperation and flaws of the characters. It conveys the tension and panic they experience as they confront the repercussions of their past actions. However, the resolution would have been more emotionally resonant if it had delved deeper into the characters’ development over time."

The novel excels in its portrayal of a youthful friend group's dynamics and the tension surrounding a decades-old mystery.

As pieces were falling into place, it kept me hooked, and I really enjoyed seeing the author draw out the story. As an avid mystery/thriller and 'whodunit' reader, so many books rated with 'kept me guessing' reviews can still feel predictable. (This isn't a slight to authors but more of a comment on the genre as a whole.)  \n\n- **Use of Multiple POVs:**  \n  The biggest drawback for me was the number of POVs in the book. They were all different, and it wasn't difficult to keep the characters straight (a feat in itself, to be honest), but there were so many (I think around 9?) different POVs throughout the book. Most were interesting, but as a reader, I enjoy being left guessing why certain actions were made and what someone's motivations are. POVs let you get inside a character's head, and I don't think we needed to have that access to so many of the characters. It could have been just as impactful and effective with fewer POV changes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book and would give it a solid 3.5 stars, rounded up. The character development and plot engagement were strong points, though the excessive number of POVs detracted slightly from the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded up)."

            "The Unquiet Bones presents a captivating yet unsettling storyline that combines intrigue and suspense. Set in the 1970s, the plot effectively immerses readers in the era, maintaining a sense of realism for those familiar with it. However, the narrative's pace is hindered by the extensive focus on Jane's personal struggles, suggesting that an abridged version could enhance the reading experience. While the murder mystery is both compelling and original, the balance between the main plot and Jane's personal journey feels uneven.",

While character development is important, the overwhelming focus on Jane's personal life ultimately detracts from the central murder mystery. It appears the author intends for her journey to stand alone, which feels superfluous in the context of this story.",

The narrative reveals shocking details, including her three-month pregnancy at the time of death, which opens the door for DNA testing on the fetus. The story explores the intricate dynamics of the Shoreview Six, my group of friends, and the complicated relationships I had with them—ranging from my boyfriend to a casual lover, and even my best friend’s boyfriend, with whom I spent the night before my disappearance. Unexpected plot twists emerge, exposing the wrongful accusation and subsequent death of her tutor, Darryl, at the hands of the group in a moment of rage. Additionally, the narrative unveils the disturbing reality of her father’s sexual abuse, her mother’s complicity, and the horrifying circumstances surrounding her tragic demise.",
            "The characters are profoundly flawed and morally intricate. Knox, the old cop, is initially suspected of fathering the unborn child due to his affair with the girl. However, it is later revealed that he is merely a predator who betrayed his pregnant wife with a 15-year-old. The girl’s parents are monstrous figures: her father is a lifelong abuser, while her mother, an enabler, ultimately takes her daughter's life in a fit of rage. The Shoreview Six, a group of friends, become embroiled in violence and cover-ups, reflecting my own moral failings.",
            "The novel delves into dark and unsettling themes, including familial abuse, betrayal, and the extremes to which individuals will go to conceal their secrets. The chilling revelation that the girl's parents buried her and lied about her disappearance for decades serves as a stark commentary on how such crimes are often hidden within families. By highlighting the prevalence of these tragedies in real life, the story leaves a lasting impact on the reader.",

The severity of the crimes also made it challenging to connect with the characters on a deeper level.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I fully expected to get bored, but the story turned out to be surprisingly engaging.  \n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The narrative kept me hooked, and I consumed the book quickly, eager to see how the mystery unfolded.  \n- **Themes and Impact:**  \n  I found it fascinating to explore the ripple effects of a tragedy that occurred nearly 50 years ago. The idea that guilt and consequences can persist over decades, no matter how well someone tries to hide or move on, was compelling.  \n- **Character and Plot Depth:**  \n  The story effectively showed how even the most carefully constructed facades can crumble over time, which added depth to both the characters and the plot.  \n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  While I wouldn’t rate it a 5-star book, it was very good overall and left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial reservations about the writing style, the book turned out to be a captivating read with a thought-provoking exploration of guilt, consequences, and the passage of time.

While I didn’t hate it, it felt like it came out of nowhere and didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was interesting and well-crafted, with a strong true crime vibe. While the complexity and themes added depth, they also felt overwhelming at times. The twist, though unexpected, didn’t quite land for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The plot is filled with twists that kept me guessing, and I was constantly second-guessing my predictions.  \n  - It gave me a Harlan Coben vibe, particularly reminiscent of the series *SAFE*, with its group of friends harboring secrets from their past that they desperately want to keep hidden.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters are well-developed, and the multiple points of view (POV) are easy to follow.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  - The story kept me on edge, as I was leery of every character throughout the book. The suspense and unpredictability made it a gripping read.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  - If you enjoyed Loreth Anne White’s *The Maid’s Diary*, you’ll definitely want to preorder this one.  \n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  - I preordered this book a while back and was thrilled to read it early, thanks to the author, NETGALLEY, and the publisher.  \n  - This book has motivated me to revisit the author’s backlist, which I still need to catch up on.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Unquiet Bones* is a twisty, suspenseful mystery-thriller with well-developed characters and a compelling cold case plot. It delivers the same level of intrigue and unpredictability as Loreth Anne White’s previous works, making it a must-read for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5 stars)"

            "The story features multiple points of view (POVs), including all six members of the Shoreview Six, Jane, Annilese's sister, a journalist, and a few others. Initially, this variety made it challenging to connect with the characters, as the author frequently switches between last names, first names, and different identifiers. I often found myself trying to remember who was who, which detracted from my overall experience. However, as the story progressed, the tension built significantly, making the middle to the end truly captivating. The mystery revolves around the discovery of remains buried under a chapel at a ski resort, linked to a 15-year-old girl who went missing nearly 50 years ago. Ultimately, the unfolding drama and resolution made the read worthwhile.",

However, I decided to continue reading, and I am so glad I did!  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story is a mystery centered around the remains of a body found buried under a chapel at a ski resort. This discovery is connected to a 15-year-old girl who went missing almost 50 years ago.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and POVs:**  \n  There are many points of view (POVs), which initially made it difficult for me to feel connected. The POVs include all six members of the \"Shoreview Six,\" Jane, Annilese's sister, a journalist, and a few others. While I am usually good at following multiple POVs, this got a little confusing as the author switched between last names, first names, and other identifiers. I kept having to try to remember who was who, which made the book lose some points for me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**  \n  As the story progresses, the tension really builds, and the middle to ending was so worth the read.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Accessibility:**  \n  I definitely recommend this book, and it is available on Kindle Unlimited!  \n\n- **Reader Engagement and Experience:**  \n  I was actively trying to figure out who did it, and that was a fun journey.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings:**  \n  Trigger warning: Sexual abuse.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the initial struggle to connect with the multiple POVs and the confusion caused by the switching of names, the book's gripping plot, building tension, and satisfying payoff made it a worthwhile read.

The explanation of how bones can reveal a person’s health, diet, and even breastfeeding history is fascinating and elevates the novel above others with similar plots.  \n\n- **Pacing and Unfinished Business:**  \n  The story leaves room for a potential sequel, as there is a sense of unfinished business with the characters.

            "I appreciate the type of mystery woven into this novel, featuring a cold case, new evidence, a revealing past timeline, and clever red herrings. While the central mystery culminates in a significant, yet tragic revelation, the resolution left some aspects unfulfilled, which I found intriguing. The pacing, while not action-packed or thrilling, felt appropriate to the narrative, even if it didn't entirely match my expectations.",

This personal struggle adds depth to her pursuit of resolution in the case. While I found Jane’s circumstances sympathetic and emotionally resonant, I didn't feel a strong connection to her or any of the other characters. The extensive cast and multiple timelines left little opportunity to fully develop any individual, making them feel more like tools to advance the mystery than fully realized people.",

            "The author confusingly used the same name for two different victims, which left me puzzled. I questioned this choice, as authors usually take care to differentiate their characters. I wondered if Ms. White or her editor had lost track of names amidst their numerous stories. I suggest that Ms. White's team should create and maintain a character name list to prevent such issues in the future.",

I was particularly intrigued by the book’s premise, which explores the concept of an author forgetting about a character or reusing names for different characters."

There were just far too many characters to keep up with from the start, which made it a bit overwhelming in audio format.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The book has a complex and intense plot, with unexpected twists. The revelation of murder due to incest—Annalise being pregnant by her father and her mother killing her to cover it up—was shocking and heartless. The layers of betrayal, lies, and the consequences of those actions kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The characters were deeply intertwined, with each playing a significant role in the unfolding drama. Darryl stood out as the only true friend Annalise could trust, and his tragic demise was heartbreaking. Cara’s jealousy and the group’s collective lie about Annalise sleeping with Darryl led to a chain of events that resulted in Darryl’s murder and Rocco’s eventual suicide.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I was particularly invested in Jane’s journey into motherhood and her evolving relationship with her mother. While she hasn’t found closure on her own missing persons case, I’m glad she’s allowing her mother to be part of her life and support her during this new chapter.  \n\n- **Moral and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story raises questions about morality, justice, and the long-term consequences of actions. Characters like Knox, the former sheriff, faced their comeuppance, while others, like Jill, continued to live in denial. The emotional weight of the story, especially the themes of betrayal and loss, left a lasting impression.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  The book definitely gives off series vibes, and I’m interested in seeing if there will be another installment. I’m invested in Jane’s story and would love to see how her journey progresses.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a solid 3.5-star read for me.

There were too many points of view (POVs), and almost every character had one or two nicknames, which made it confusing. Some characters, like the journalist and the random doctor at the university, seemed unnecessary and didn’t add value to the story.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was overly wordy, with excessive detail given to things that didn’t seem important. The sentences were repetitive, often starting the same way, which made the prose feel bland and monotonous.\n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  Despite being bored, I felt compelled to finish the novel. The lack of engaging storytelling and the unnecessary details made it a struggle to stay interested.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel suffered from poor character development, an overly wordy and repetitive writing style, and a lack of engagement. While I managed to finish it, the experience was largely unsatisfying due to these issues.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The use of diary entries comes across as a lazy plot device; those attributed to 16-year-old Annalise are unconvincing and fail to reflect how a teenager would realistically write, further detracting from the narrative's authenticity. The endings for both Annalise and Darryl are unsettling, with Annalise's conclusion feeling disconnected from the main storyline involving the Shoreview Six.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Filler Content:**  \n   - The book contained a lot of unnecessary filler, particularly in the form of overly long lists or examples that didn't contribute to the story. These felt like the author was trying to showcase their knowledge rather than enhance the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development (Main Character):**  \n   - The main character was unlikable and unpleasant. She was mean to people who tried to help her, which made it hard to sympathize with her, especially given the unresolved subplot of her missing fiancé, which seemed designed solely to evoke pity.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n   - The inclusion of explicit sex scenes, particularly involving 15-year-olds, felt unnecessary and detracted from the psychological/thriller/crime genre. The author could have conveyed their point without such detailed depictions.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n   - The ending was unsatisfying and unrewarding. The big twist felt out of nowhere, done purely for shock value, and didn't align with the established character motivations. The subplot involving the “Shoreview 6” was underwhelming and left unresolved, adding to the dissatisfaction.  \n\n- **Author's Writing Style and Repetition:**  \n   - The book reused tropes from the author's previous work, “Beneath Devil's Bridge,” making it feel like the author had recycled ideas or written a new book to explore an alternate ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a disappointment. The excessive filler, unlikable protagonist, unnecessary explicit content, and unsatisfying ending made it feel like a waste of time. Having also disliked the author's previous work, I won't be returning to their books in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."
