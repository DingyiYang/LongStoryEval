            "*Of Jade and Dragons* draws inspiration from real historical events and figures of the late Ming to early Qing dynasty, particularly focusing on the first Qing emperor, Huang Taiji, and his relationship with Harjol (also known as Hai Lan Zhu). The narrative delves into the untold chapters of Harjol’s life before she entered the palace, imaginatively depicting the origins of her relationship with the emperor.",
            "The author suggests that *Scarlet Heart* and *The Long Ballad* serve as ideal comparisons for the book, given their popularity as C-dramas. In contrast, the publisher highlights *Mulan* for its theme of a girl disguising herself as a boy within a patriarchal society, *Iron Widow* for its blend of Chinese elements and technology, and *Six Crimson Cranes* for its YA Asian fantasy appeal.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Inspiration and Historical Context:**  \n  The book, *Of Jade and Dragons*, was inspired by actual historical events and characters from the late Ming to early Qing dynasty, particularly the life of the first Qing emperor, Huang Taiji, and his relationship with Harjol (also known as Hai Lan Zhu 海兰珠). The story explores the blank pages of Harjol’s life before she entered the palace and imagines how her relationship with the emperor might have begun.\n\n- **Comparisons and Themes:**  \n  The author’s ideal comparisons for the book are *Scarlet Heart* and *The Long Ballad*, both popular C-dramas. However, the publisher’s chosen comps are *Mulan* (for the theme of a girl disguising herself as a boy in a patriarchal society), *Iron Widow* (for its Chinese and technology elements), and *Six Crimson Cranes* (for its YA Asian fantasy vibes).  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes content warnings for parental death, murder, violence (with blood but not much gore), mentions of war, descriptions of weapons of war, and misogyny reflective of a patriarchal society.  \n\n- **Creative Choices and Fun Facts:**  \n  There are no real dragons in the book, despite the title. The author also humorously shares their indecision about which actor (Leo Wu, Dylan Wang, or Zhang Linghe) would best portray the male lead, Aogiya Ye-yang, in a potential drama adaptation.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Gratitude:**  \n  The author expresses heartfelt gratitude to readers for considering or picking up their debut novel, *Of Jade and Dragons*, and appreciates the support from the reading community.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Jade and Dragons* is a compelling debut novel inspired by historical events and characters, blending themes of love, identity, and societal challenges within a patriarchal framework.

The synopsis hooked me with its intriguing premise of a girl disguising herself as a man to enter an engineer's guild trial and solve her father's murder.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ying is an exceptional character—intelligent, headstrong, and fiercely determined to uncover the mystery behind her father's death. She carries the story beautifully. The two male leads, Ye-Yang and Ye-Kan, were intriguing, though they didn’t receive as much focus in this book. Their dynamic as friendly academic rivals added a great layer to the story, and I hope to see more of them in book 2.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The Asian fantasy setting combined with a steampunk atmosphere was a perfect backdrop for the tale. It felt fresh and immersive, providing a unique twist to the familiar Mulan narrative.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The chosen narrator did a great job, making it easy to fall into the story and stay engaged while multitasking. I appreciated that the narrator knew how to pronounce the names correctly, adding an authentic touch to the experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating blend of strong character development, a unique and immersive setting, and a gripping premise. The audiobook narration enhances the experience, making it a highly enjoyable read. I’m eagerly looking forward to the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Every scene between them had me silently rooting for them to kiss. Ye-yang’s ability to always see Ying and notice her every move was endearing, and his intelligence and careful planning made him a compelling character. However, his vulnerabilities, which he only showed to Ying, added depth to his personality. The moment he revealed his plan, which inadvertently hurt Ying, was heartbreaking. She didn’t deserve to be caught in the crossfire, especially after her father’s death.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ying):**  \n  Ying’s journey was captivating. Her perseverance and passion for engineering felt authentic and integral to the story, not just a plot device. I admired her growth as she bonded with others at the Engineers Guild and uncovered more about her father’s past. Learning about her father’s life and understanding his reasons for leaving brought her a sense of peace, though she still struggled with her own inner turmoil.  \n\n- **Friendship (Ying and Ye-kan):**  \n  The unexpected friendship between Ying and Ye-kan was a delightful addition to the story. Their care for each other added warmth and depth to the narrative, showcasing Ying’s ability to form meaningful connections beyond her romantic relationship.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book was fast-paced but slowed down at key moments, allowing me to savor the interactions and emotional beats. While the plot of finding her father’s murderer sometimes felt secondary to her experiences at the Engineers Guild, I didn’t mind because her journey there was so enthralling.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The story’s exploration of the Engineers Guild and the looming war between the Antarans and the Empire added layers of intrigue. The bittersweet ending left me curious about Ying’s future, her passion for engineering, and the potential consequences of the impending conflict.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was breathtaking and impossible to put down.

Her evolving motivations and goals, shaped by her experiences and ideals, kept me invested as I found myself rooting for her, worrying for her, and even occasionally yelling at her. Ye-Yang was a complex and intriguing character; I would love to read a book from his perspective to gain deeper insights into his feelings for Ying, which, while sincere, hinted at more intricate layers.

However, the absence of closure on certain plot points, such as Ying’s brother and her return home, left me wanting more. Despite this, the story felt original and fresh, borrowing little from Mulan aside from Ying's disguise. I also appreciated the introduction to SilkPunk as a genre.",
            "In this story, I admired Ying's strength, intelligence, and independence. From the beginning, she was a fierce character, fighting to protect her a-ma, rather than transforming from a timid individual into a warrior. However, Ye-Yang felt underdeveloped; he seemed more like a fleeting distraction for Ying, lacking a strong connection to her. In contrast, Ye-Kan emerged as a supportive figure, yet his role felt unresolved by the story's end. I appreciated that Ying couldn't trust Ye-Yang or her own judgment anymore; some relationships built on deceit simply can't endure, and not all second chances lead to happiness. Unfortunately, I felt disappointed by the lack of closure between Ying and Ye-Kan. He consistently protected her secrets and stood by her side, yet she overlooked him until her return home, which felt unsatisfying. Additionally, the \"found family\" dynamic within the guild did not resonate with me, as her so-called friends vanished without much meaningful development by the story’s conclusion."

It's a refreshing change from typical YA romances, free from unnecessary drama or embellishments.

The supporting characters are equally enjoyable, enhancing the narrative without overshadowing Ying's journey. Ye-Kan, in particular, shines with his dynamic interactions with Ying, and I look forward to seeing more of him in future installments. Overall, the characters are well-developed and engaging, earning a solid 5 out of 5 stars.",

I fell in love with *Of Jade and Dragons* practically from the first page. Asian fantasy definitely has something special, and I’m realizing it suits me well. The setting and atmosphere reminded me of another Asian fantasy I read last year, *Iron Widow*, which I absolutely devoured.\n\n- **Plot and Execution:**  \n  The plot was brilliantly thought out from start to finish. I can’t believe this is the author’s debut! The protagonist, Ying, loses her father under tragic circumstances, and her sole goal is to uncover his murder and seek revenge. The story incorporates a *Mulan*-esque twist, as Ying disguises herself as her brother and spends most of the book in hiding, dressed as a boy. This created constant tension, as I was always on edge, wondering if she’d be discovered.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The main love interest, Ye-Yang, who is some kind of prince, was absolutely perfect. The scenes between him and Ying were flawless, and their chemistry was off the charts. Their relationship ends in a way that sets up an amazing premise for a sequel. I believe this is meant to be a duology.  \n  I also really appreciated the friendship between Ying and Ye-Kan. It’s rare to find a purely platonic friendship between a boy and a girl in books, so this was one of the best aspects of the story.\n\n- **Critique:**  \n  The only downside is that there’s no live dragon in the book, which the title might suggest. However, I’m absolutely thrilled and really hope I won’t have to wait long for the sequel!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Jade and Dragons* is a captivating Asian fantasy with a well-crafted plot, compelling characters, and a perfect balance of tension and romance.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Pace:**  \n  The story was incredibly engaging, and I was so captivated that I would have finished it in one sitting if not for work and my slow reading pace.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I was intrigued by the unique world the author created, which blends engineering and steampunk elements rather than relying on typical magical fantasy tropes.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I was deeply invested in Ying's journey and appreciated how well-developed her character was. I also really liked Ye-yang, especially how he had his own motivations and ambitions separate from Ying, which added depth to his character.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  The story came together gloriously, leaving me desperate for the second book. I can’t wait to continue the story and see where it goes next.  \n\n- **Romance and Tone:**  \n  The romance and yearning in the story were delightful but decidedly YA. Readers expecting something similar to *Fourth Wing* might be disappointed, as this book has its own unique flavor.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a refreshing and engaging YA read with strong world-building, well-developed characters, and a unique blend of engineering and steampunk elements. While the romance is distinctly YA, it adds to the charm of the story. The ending left me eagerly anticipating the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story is engaging, though the ending concludes more swiftly than anticipated, hinting at possible future developments. The twist at the end is satisfying, tying up key plot points while leaving readers eager for more. The opening scene, where Ying tests her wings, effectively introduces her character and establishes the tone of creativity and ambition that pervades the narrative. The plot follows Ying as she strives to uncover her father's murderer while facing the challenges of joining the forbidden Engineering Guild. As the story progresses, Ying discovers darker truths about her father's past and the reasons behind his departure from a prestigious position.",
            "Ying is a compelling protagonist caught between her passion for engineering and her burgeoning feelings for Ye-Yang, the Eighth Prince. Her character is richly developed through her struggles and determination. Ye-Yang's role is particularly intriguing, as he appears to possess more knowledge about Ying's father's murder than he divulges, leading to a poignant reveal. The secondary characters are also well-crafted, ranging from friendly academic rivals to arrogant bullies who eventually recognize Ying's talents. The Fourteenth Prince brings a charming dynamic to the story, evolving into a loyal younger brother figure with hints of a possible crush on Ying. The romance between Ying and Ye-Yang unfolds as a slow burn, with Ye-Yang's feelings developing first, while Ying grapples with her emotions amidst her mission and societal constraints. Their relationship is further complicated by Ye-Yang's secrets and Ying's struggle to forgive him for his lies, adding significant emotional depth to the narrative.",

            "The story feels somewhat superficial, with overly convenient solutions to Ying's problems. Key elements, such as Ying's apparent lack of culture shock as a village girl navigating a big city, are noticeably overlooked. However, the ending is satisfying, particularly for older readers, as Ying remains steadfast in her beliefs about war.",
            "Ying is a determined character, but her emotional responses, particularly in mourning her father's death, feel underdeveloped. While her friends are likable, many of the other trial candidates lack depth, appearing almost faceless.",
            "The writing is charming and witty, capturing a delightful YA tone that makes it easy to read and enjoyable. Its lighthearted style offers a refreshing break from heavier narratives, making it an ideal palate cleanser between darker reads.",
            "The worldbuilding is intriguing yet could benefit from more detail. Set mainly in Huarin and Fei, the story leaves plenty of potential for exploring surrounding regions in a sequel. Additionally, the absence of airship flying action feels like a missed opportunity, especially given its anticipation.",
            "This engaging coming-of-age story boasts rich Asian-inspired worldbuilding and a strong, relatable female protagonist, Ying. Her journey defies traditional gender roles as she prioritizes her career over marriage. The narrative skillfully intertwines an academic trials plotline with a mini murder mystery that gradually expands into a larger narrative.",
            "This middle-grade/YA novel is ideally suited for readers aged 12 and up. While I noticed a few shortcomings as an adult, I believe my younger self would have eagerly embraced this story. Fans of Tamora Pierce, *Squire* by Nadia Shammas, and *The Scarlet Alchemist* by Kylie Lee Baker are sure to enjoy it."

            "The story centers on Aihui Ying, an eighteen-year-old girl who disguises herself as a boy to seek revenge for her father's murder and chase her dream of becoming an engineer in a sexist society. While Ying's quest for justice is compelling, the narrative takes a notable detour midway through as she focuses on joining the Engineer’s Guild and passing their trials. This shift in focus detracts from the central plot. The climax is primarily introspective, delving into Ying's thoughts and feelings rather than presenting external stakes or challenges. Although the action scenes are enjoyable, the lack of tension diminishes their impact, as characters often escape perilous situations too easily. While the emotional climax resonates, it fails to significantly alter Ying's external circumstances. Overall, the pacing is generally good, but the transition from the murder mystery to the guild trials feels somewhat disjointed.",
            "Ying is a remarkable protagonist—intelligent, creative, witty, and cautious. Her gradual opening up adds depth to her character. Supporting characters like Ye-Yang and Ye-Kan are equally compelling, with Ye-Yang's enigmatic background and Ye-Kan's strong character development enriching the narrative. However, despite the well-crafted characters, I struggled to connect with them on a deeper level, as their flaws and weaknesses were not explored sufficiently.",

In a bold move, she disguises herself as her brother to participate in the Engineer's Guild trials, seeking to unravel the mystery of her father's murder. The plot starts off briskly but initially lacks depth in developing Ying's relationships with her family and community. However, it gains momentum as she navigates the trials and uncovers secrets about her father. The first volume concludes on a bittersweet note, rich with angst and leaving a lasting impact.",
            "Ying is a determined and complex protagonist who embodies a mix of maturity and immaturity, showcasing both flaws and strengths. Her unwavering desire for revenge intertwines her life with that of the enigmatic eighth prince, Ye-yang. Ying's compelling growth throughout the story, marked by difficult choices, ultimately leads her to prioritize herself. Ye-yang is a secretive figure, shrouded in more mysteries than truths. While their relationship could have benefited from deeper exploration, it is crafted with care and adds an emotional depth to the narrative. The romance between Ying and Ye-yang, though present, would have been more effective if it had developed gradually and in greater detail.

I’m looking forward to the sequel.\n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  If you enjoyed books like *A Magic Steeped in Poison*, *Spin the Dawn*, *Daughter of the Moon Goddess*, or works by Tamora Pierce, you might enjoy this one as well.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Jade and Dragons* is a fast-paced, plot-driven YA novel with engaging action and just enough world-building and character development to keep readers invested. While it has some conveniences and lighter touches in certain areas, it remains an enjoyable and entertaining read. I’m excited for the sequel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was action-packed and fast-paced, making it hard to put down.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was very compelling and never felt overwhelming. Elements of it reminded me of other books I enjoyed, such as the trials in *The Scarlet Alchemist*, the Guild master Gerel’s resemblance to Snape, and Ying’s Mulan-like disguise as Min.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ying):**  \n  I really appreciated Ying’s arc and her motives. She was naive and impulsive but never dumb or stupid. Her actions made sense, and her train of thought was consistent with her strict morals and self-doubts. She felt like a very real character.  \n  Ying’s relationship with her father was explored beautifully, with well-timed exposition that never felt overbearing. I understood their dynamic well, which contributed to her motivations aligning with my expectations.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  I was taken with Ye-lang from the start, but I fear he is now wholly incompatible with Ying. He needs to review his priorities and face his inner demons before he can be the right person for her, especially given how things ended between them.  \n  Ye-kan, on the other hand, is definitely harboring a one-sided crush on Ying. A friends-to-lovers scenario with them would be very plausible (and cute), and I would 100% approve of it because I love Ye-kan.  \n\n- **Anticipation for the Next Installment:**  \n  I’m very curious about the next book. I want to see how the world will be shaken by the ending of Book 1 and how Ying will be forced back into the action, as she’s adamant about wanting nothing to do with Fei and the Guild anymore. I’m wondering if her sister’s wedding will force her to return to the capital or if something else will motivate her.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking a well-developed plot set in an interesting world, featuring a badass female character and an angsty slow-burn romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the story was pretty predictable, which detracted from the overall experience.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I mostly enjoyed Ying's character, but the character development felt very surface level. The interactions between characters lacked authenticity and significant emotions, often feeling more like summaries of interactions rather than genuine moments.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romantic tension for the first 60% of the book was on-point, but I was frustrated by the direction the romance took in the last 30-40%. It didn’t resonate with me as much as I had hoped.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The silk-punk fantasy setting was intriguing, and I appreciated the unique blend of technology and fantasy elements. It added depth to the world and made it stand out.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I had a good time with this book and think I would have absolutely loved it if I had read it when I was younger. While I enjoyed it, certain elements didn’t work as well for me, leaving me undecided about continuing the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Of Jade and Dragons* was an enjoyable read with a unique setting and engaging plot, but its predictability, surface-level character development, and unsatisfying romantic arc held it back from being a standout for me. I’m still on the fence about whether to continue the series, but I’ll consider it when the next book is released.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nEnjoyed It, 3.5 Stars, rounded up to 4.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and Penguin Teen for an eARC of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own. *Of Jade and Dragons* releases on June 18, 2024."

            "I always look forward to reading works by AAPI authors, particularly those from my homeland of Singapore. I buddy-read *Of Jade and Dragons* with Zana, who also belongs to the Singaporean diaspora. \n\nI appreciated the inclusion of Chinese words such as \"A-jie\" for sister and \"A-ge\" for brother, though I found the use of \"A-ma\" for father puzzling, as I typically associate it with grandma. Additionally, the protagonist's name, Aogiya Ye-Yang, felt like an inconsistent blend of Japanese and Chinese influences.\n\nThe story follows Ying, a girl who disguises herself as a boy to investigate her father's murder. I admired her determination to join the Engineers Guild, an unconventional path for women in both fiction and reality (as a woman in engineering myself). Ying's journey is both entertaining and humorous, and her growth and friendships are genuinely heartwarming. While the book stands on its own, I eagerly anticipate the next installment.",

It follows Aihui Ying, an engineer and inventor, who disguises herself as a boy to enter the Engineers Guild after witnessing her father’s murder. She aims to uncover the truth about her father’s past, his departure from the Guild, and the identity of his killer.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I enjoyed the creative fusion of steampunk elements with ancient Asian culture, which added a unique and immersive layer to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  While the story was engaging, there were some issues with plot lines that felt unbelievable. The ending left me uncertain, but since it seems to be part of a series or trilogy, I understand that the story isn’t fully resolved yet.  \n\n- **Character Development and Trust:**  \n  A central theme of the story revolves around trust—Aihui Ying must navigate a world where she doesn’t know who to rely on as she pursues her goals.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  Despite my mixed feelings about the ending, I’m curious about where the story will go next and plan to continue the series when the next book is released.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the novel to be an enjoyable read with its inventive world-building and intriguing premise.

            "The three-act tournament arc was expertly paced, and the murder mystery unfolded in a cleverly deceptive manner. I felt as though I was slowly making progress toward the solution, yet it kept me on my toes, never revealing the answer too soon.",
            "In this story, the main character, Anhui Ying, shines with her delightful headstrong nature. The morally ambiguous love interest is well-crafted and charmingly complex, adding depth to the narrative. Several characters display deviousness and capriciousness, enhancing the story's richness. However, there is a disconnect in their ages; Ying and Ye-Kan seem to share the same maturity, while Ye-Yang feels notably older, creating inconsistency with the characters' stated ages. The romance is well-executed and feels authentic, and the tension throughout keeps the reader thoroughly engaged.",
            "The world lacked depth and distinction, with nations, cultures, and groups feeling rather generic. It wasn't until midway through the book that I realized the setting was inspired by a blend of political elements from Malaysia and Singapore, alongside cultural aspects from Manchuria. The name “Anhui Ying” added to the confusion, as Anhui is a real location in Northern China rather than a surname. Additionally, the term “A-ma/ama/ahma,” which means “dad” in Manchu, was perplexing since it typically refers to “grandma” or “mom” in most Chinese dialects, including those used in Singapore. A brief clarification regarding these terms would have been beneficial."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a fantastic book with a strong main character, engaging romance, and well-paced plot. However, the world-building felt underdeveloped, and some aspects, like character ages and cultural terms, were confusing. Despite these issues, the book’s strengths outweigh its weaknesses, making it a solid recommendation for fans of light fantasy.",

            "The dynamic characters greatly enhanced the story's appeal. Ying and Ye-yang's contrasting upbringings shaped their determination to achieve their goals. Despite the obstacles she faced, Ying was relentless in her quest for revenge against her father's death, while Ye-yang, driven by a painful past, was ruthlessly committed to his plans. Both characters grappled with the consequences of their choices.\n\nThe romance between Ying and Ye-yang was fraught with conflict. From their initial encounter, honesty was absent, and as the story progressed, it became increasingly clear that a future together seemed unlikely. With Ye-yang's betrayal hanging over them, it’s uncertain whether they can reconcile, but one can still hope!"

Ying and Ye-yang couldn't have been more different in their upbringings, but they shared a common determination to achieve their goals. Despite all the disadvantages she faced, Ying was relentless in her quest to avenge her father. Similarly, Ye-yang, with his painful past, stopped at nothing to execute his plans. He was definitely crueler than his quiet exterior. Both had to live with the consequences of the choices they made.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The writing and pacing sometimes dragged, which made it difficult for me to fully immerse myself in the plot at times. However, the story was full of deceit and ambition, which kept my curiosity piqued.  \n\n- **Engineering Trials:**  \n  My favorite part of the novel was the engineering trials. Although nerve-wracking to watch, they were exciting to learn from. Each trial was unique, and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Ying outwit her fellow competitors. The inventions for the last trial were especially impressive to witness in action.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance between Ying and Ye-yang was riddled with conflict. From the moment they met, they were not truthful with one another. As the story progressed, it became more apparent that a future together for them was next to impossible. I'm not sure they can come back from Ye-yang's betrayal, but one can hope!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t enjoy every second of *Of Jade and Dragons*, it was an interesting read. The dynamic characters, intriguing engineering trials, and themes of deceit and ambition kept me engaged.

            "The pacing was well-executed, and the plot was straightforward. The heroine's key challenges and developments were engaging. The ending, while somewhat predictable, also had an intriguing quality. It concluded in an open-ended manner, without relying on a clear cliffhanger, giving readers the option to decide if they want to continue the journey.",
            "Ying, the protagonist, is the story's greatest strength. She embodies resolve, cleverness, thoughtfulness, and strength, making her an easy heroine to champion. However, her character also highlights the story’s weaknesses. Despite facing formidable obstacles—such as leaving her sheltered hometown, posing as a boy, being the child of her guildmaster's rival, and being supported by a prince—these challenges are insufficiently developed. The gender dynamics, a central theme in this Mulan reimagining, are particularly underexplored. For instance, Ying is quickly discovered by the beile, who offers to keep her secret, and other critical elements, like her appearance and menstrual cycle, are largely overlooked. Her eventual reveal to the Guild is treated superficially, lacking a thorough examination of its implications.",
            "The story effectively grapples with the intriguing question of when progress crosses the line into unethics, adding significant depth to the narrative."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was an easy and enjoyable read with a strong protagonist and an engaging plot. However, the story missed opportunities to explore the nuanced conflicts and challenges Ying faced, particularly regarding her gender and social status. The ethical themes and open-ended conclusion left me hopeful for the next installment.",

The key developments and obstacles for the heroine were interesting.  \n\n- **Characterization (Protagonist):**  \n  The protagonist, Ying, is the book's biggest strength. She is an easy heroine to root for, with resolve, cleverness, thoughtfulness, and strength.  \n\n- **Character Development and Conflict:**  \n  Ying becomes a foil for the book's biggest weakness. Despite the incredibly huge odds stacked against her—such as leaving her sheltered hometown, posing as a boy, being the child of the guildmaster's rival, and being sponsored by a prince—these elements barely materialize in the story. Specifically, the gender issue, a key theme in this Mulan reimagining, is underutilized. She is discovered immediately by the beile, who agrees to keep her secret, and other aspects like her appearance and lack of periods are ignored. Her reveal to the Guild at the end is glossed over, with no detailed exploration of its impact.  \n\n- **Themes and Ethical Questions:**  \n  The recurring question of \"at what point is progress unethical?\" was appreciated and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  The ending was both predictable and interesting. It wrapped up open-endedly, without an obvious cliffhanger, allowing readers to choose whether to continue with the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an easy and enjoyable read with a strong protagonist and an engaging plot. However, the story missed opportunities to explore the nuanced conflicts and challenges Ying faced, particularly regarding her gender and social status. The ethical themes and open-ended conclusion left me hopeful for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The beginning feels rushed, with Ying’s father's death happening too quickly, which diminishes its emotional impact due to insufficient character development. However, as the plot gains momentum, it becomes compelling, filled with solid action and tension that keeps me engaged. The ending is especially gripping, even prompting late-night reading sessions.",
            "The familial relationships in the story could have benefited from deeper exploration. While Ying’s siblings are introduced, their dynamics remain largely unexplored, with Ying barely considering her surviving family until much later in the book, which feels like a missed opportunity. Additionally, the budding relationships Ying forms during her quest are engaging but lack further development.",

            "The atmosphere is captivating, blending elements reminiscent of *Breath of the Wild*, *The Legend of Korra*, and *Howl’s Moving Castle*, but with engineering taking the place of magic. The Qing dynasty-inspired setting, along with the intricate machinery and contraptions, creates a delightful and immersive experience. There's significant potential for future books to further explore the world-building and political dynamics.",
            "The emotional connection between Ying and her father is weak, even as their past moments unfold. This deficiency reduces the impact of the revelations surrounding his murder. Additionally, Ying's reaction to her father’s death feels underdeveloped, diminishing the overall emotional depth of the story."

While she embodies typical teenage traits like being occasionally hotheaded and thinking she knows best, these aspects are handled deftly and enhance rather than detract from the story.

While the pacing isn’t consistently fast throughout, it works well for building the story elements.  \n\n- **Characterization (Ying):**  \n  Ying’s personality and resolve are clear from the start. Her determination to stick to her goal, even after her father’s killer is revealed and Ye-Yang starts acting shady, is one of my favorite aspects of the book.  \n\n- **Originality and World-Building:**  \n  The story is original, with a Mulan-inspired take but a unique focus on engineering. While it’s a fantasy with war elements, the engineering aspect takes center stage, which sets it apart from other fantasy novels.  \n\n- **Romance (Ying and Ye-Yang):**  \n  The romance isn’t the main focus of the book, but it’s intriguing. Initially, I was strongly rooting for Ye-Yang, who seemed like a respectable and supportive character. The scene where Ying kisses him on the forehead while he’s awake was perfect. However, his dynamic became confusing towards the end, especially when he gets betrothed to Ying’s sister and his secrets are revealed. This uncertainty might mirror Ying’s feelings, but it left me conflicted about his intentions.  \n\n- **Character Arc (Ye-Yang):**  \n  Ye-Yang’s character has potential for a redemption arc, especially if he’s meant to be the ultimate love interest. His actions at the end, claiming he’ll come back for Ying, could set him up as a morally gray character or just a jerk. It’s hard to tell, but if he had been more transparent with Ying from the start, they could have been a morally gray, power couple.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Jade and Dragons* is an interesting and original read with strong character development and a unique focus on engineering. While the romance adds intrigue, it leaves some unresolved questions about Ye-Yang’s character. Overall, it’s a compelling story with a lot of potential for further exploration in future installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

I reached out to the author, Amber Chen, who kindly sent me an advanced reader’s copy. It felt like a perfect coincidence that its release day, June 18, is my birthday—this book was calling to me! I’m grateful to Amber and Penguin Teen for allowing me to experience this story early.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  The cover, designed by Kelly Chong (@afterblossom_art), is stunning and only added to my excitement. Kelly has created some of my all-time favorite covers, and this one does not disappoint.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  Eighteen-year-old Ying dreams of becoming a world-class engineer like her father. When her father is killed by a masked assassin, her life turns upside down. Disguised as a man (with strong Mulan vibes), Ying joins the prestigious Engineers Guild to uncover her father’s secret past. While joining the Guild has always been her dream, her mission becomes a fight for survival, with a touch of complicated romance woven in.  \n\n- **Genre and World-Building:**  \n  *Of Jade and Dragons* is a thrilling YA fantasy with Mulan vibes and a hint of *Legend of Korra*. Amber Chen crafts a captivating world with a unique blend of fantasy and industrial elements—think airships and incredible inventions alongside a society with strict traditions. The silkpunk vibes were right up my alley, and while the ‘dragons’ might surprise you, the Chinese legend-inspired fantasy was a delight.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really liked Ying! She’s smart, resourceful, and determined to find justice for her father. I loved following her journey of self-discovery and perseverance in a world that underestimates her.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  Chen’s writing is engaging and easy to follow, with a fast pace that kept me glued to the pages for hours. I finished the book in a single day. While the writing style leans towards simplicity, the story and characters shine through.  \n\n- **Ending and Sequel Potential:**  \n  The conclusion leaves plenty of unanswered questions, making me very eager for the sequel. Unfortunately, reading this book early means I’ll have to wait even longer for the second one.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  This is a fantastic debut YA fantasy novel by Amber Chen, and I highly recommend it to fans of YA fantasy with strong heroines and intricate worlds. Although the writing is on the simpler side and there were a few predictable moments, these are minor points compared to how much I enjoyed reading it overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Jade and Dragons* is a captivating YA fantasy with a strong heroine, intricate world-building, and a blend of fantasy and industrial elements.

She breaks gender barriers by successfully infiltrating an all-male engineering guild while secretly seeking revenge for her father's murder. In contrast, the male lead, Ye-Yang, felt underdeveloped. Though he is an enigmatic and handsome prince who aids Ying at a pivotal moment, he ultimately fades into the background, leaving her as the central figure. I hope to see his character expanded in the second book. \n\nI also preferred Ying's relationship with Ye-Kan, the youngest prince and her fellow apprentice, over her romance with Ye-Yang. Their best-friend dynamic was engaging, and it seemed that Ye-Kan desired more than just friendship—I'd be interested in him taking on a leading role in the sequel. The romance between Ying and Ye-Yang lacked chemistry for most of the story, only reaching a climax in the final pages.",
            "The worldbuilding is somewhat limited, focusing primarily on The Guild while providing little information about the broader world. However, I appreciated the steampunk and silkpunk elements, such as the weaponized fan and the mechanical-eyed cyborg fox. The author skillfully evokes the richness of Chinese history, language, customs, and societal norms, making the writing effortlessly accessible. My enjoyment was further heightened by my familiarity with historical C-Dramas like *Scarlet Heart* and *A Long Ballad*, which the author recommends."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this Asian-inspired YA fantasy offers a compelling mix of women in STEM, political intrigue, and cultural richness. While the pacing slowed in the middle and the romance didn’t fully deliver, the strong protagonist, intriguing relationships, and unique worldbuilding elements kept me invested. I’m eager to read book two to see how the story concludes for Ying, Ye-Yang, and Ye-Kan.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story features a mix of murder, revenge, Mulan-esque disguise, dangerous trials, political intrigue, and engineering, which kept me engaged.  \n  - However, the plot slowed down significantly once Ying became an apprentice at the engineering guild. It felt like too many events were happening at once, with more telling than showing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I absolutely loved the female protagonist, Ying. She’s young, relatable, and shatters gender barriers by infiltrating an all-male engineering guild while excelling at it and secretly plotting revenge for her father’s murder.  \n  - Ye-Yang, the male lead, felt underdeveloped. He’s an enigmatic, handsome prince who appears just in time to help Ying but then conveniently disappears, leaving her as the center of the story. I hope to see him more developed in book 2.  \n  - I enjoyed Ying’s relationship with Ye-Kan, the youngest prince and her fellow apprentice, much more than her romance with Ye-Yang. Their best-friend dynamic was compelling, and it felt like Ye-Kan wanted more than just friendship. I wouldn’t mind seeing him as the main male lead in book 2.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  - The worldbuilding is okay-ish. We mostly learn about The Guild but not much about the world beyond its walls.  \n  - I appreciated the steampunk silkpunk elements, such as the weaponized fan and the cyborg fox with mechanical eyes.  \n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  - The author adeptly captures the essence of Chinese history, language, customs, and societal norms. Her writing is effortlessly accessible.  \n  - Having watched historical C-Dramas like *Scarlet Heart* and *A Long Ballad* (which the author recommends) enhanced my reading experience.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The romance between Ying and Ye-Yang fell flat for me until the last few pages. I didn’t feel the chemistry between them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this Asian-inspired YA fantasy offers a compelling mix of women in STEM, political intrigue, and cultural richness. While the pacing slowed in the middle and the romance didn’t fully deliver, the strong protagonist, intriguing relationships, and unique worldbuilding elements kept me invested. I’m eager to read book two to see how the story concludes for Ying, Ye-Yang, and Ye-Kan.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned, but the reviewer implies a rating below 5 stars due to pacing and romance issues."

After her father's murder, Ying discovers that the answers she seeks lie within the guild he left behind. Disguising herself as her brother, she enters the trials to gain admission.

From the first chapter, it was clear that the author is original and believable. While the fate of their society does come into play, it is introduced only after solid groundwork is laid, and for the protagonist, it remains secondary to her father's fate. This avoids the common trope of immediately thrusting the character into a savior role, making the plot refreshing and engaging.\n\n- **Writing Quality and Enjoyment:**  \n  The novel is well-written and solidly enjoyable. The details of the setting are intriguing and beautifully described, adding depth to the story. The protagonist is likable and easy to identify with, which enhances the reading experience.\n\n- **Target Audience Appeal:**  \n  This book is absolutely worth the read for YA fantasy lovers. It offers a fresh take on the genre while maintaining elements that fans will appreciate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis fantasy novel stands out for its originality, well-crafted plot, and relatable protagonist.

            "The pacing of the novel is generally strong, but some relationships and character developments feel rushed. The epilogue is particularly confusing and inconsistent with Ying's established character traits and aspirations. Set in a silk-punk Chinese fantasy world, the story follows Auhio Ying, a rural chieftain's daughter determined to join the Engineer's Guild despite societal taboos. Her journey involves investigating her father's murder, deciphering a mysterious book, and uncovering its connection to the Qirin Empire. However, the ending disappoints as Ying abandons her goal of becoming an engineer in favor of her love interest, retreating to her village. This shift contradicts her earlier bravery and ideals.",
            "Ying is a brave yet naïve character grappling with her beliefs and identity. However, her relationships, especially with her father and Huarin, feel underdeveloped and rushed. While supporting characters like Beile Ye-Yang and Ye-Kan offer some depth, Ye-Yang's red flags are apparent from the beginning. Additionally, the portrayal of female characters is frustrating, as they are depicted primarily in opposition to Ying and lack depth.",
            "The writing is skillfully executed, although the dialogue feels a bit stiff at the outset. While the narrative carries a YA tone replete with clichés and themes of young love, it remains engaging, especially with the unexpected twists toward the end.",

Although the ending wraps up the main mystery, I'm uncertain if I would read the next installment—though an eye-catching cover could sway my decision.",

The writing system, reminiscent of Chinese characters, is crafted with meticulous brush strokes. The author introduces a distinctive vocabulary—terms like a-ma, e-niye, and beilel— which, while not explicitly defined, can be interpreted through context. Ying's home, the Nine Isles, grapples with the looming threat of the Empire, where engineers are celebrated for their airship designs and technological innovations.

Chong’s artwork is impressive, and she has a portfolio of attractive book cover illustrations. However, despite the title, there are no real dragons and not much jade in the book.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  At times, I was annoyed by the plot, which relied too heavily on coincidences, especially in the middle of the story. This was my least favorite part of the book. However, the story did resolve the major plot point of who killed Ying’s father and why, while leaving room for a sequel.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I liked the characters, particularly the determined heroine, Aihue Ying, who aspires to attend the prestigious engineering academy and follow in her father’s footsteps. I also enjoyed the other major characters, including Ye-yang, the fourth beile of the kingdom, who becomes Ying’s sponsor. I cared enough about their fates to finish all 466 pages in less than a week.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The world has an oriental flavor, featuring elements like throwing stars, pagodas, lacquered wood floors, and jeweled robes. The writing system resembles Chinese characters created with careful brush strokes. The book uses a unique vocabulary (e.g., a-ma, e-niye, beilel) that is not explicitly defined but can be inferred from context. The Nine Isles, where Ying lives, face a formidable foe in the Empire, and engineers are revered for constructing airships and other technological advancements. However, the lack of a map was a disappointment.\n\n- **Originality and Genre:**  \n  I was initially worried that this would be another stale fantasy novel set in a magic academy, but it felt fresh and not obviously derivative. The focus on engineering and technology, rather than magic, was a refreshing change.\n\n- **Ending and Sequel Potential:**  \n  The ending resolved the main mystery but left room for a sequel.

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the Mulan-inspired retelling, especially Mulan's disguise as a boy to prove her worth during the guild apprentice trials. The cultural emphasis on engineering—covering everything from weapons and buildings to innovative machines—was captivating. Set in a restrictive era with no respect for women, the story's tension heightened her journey. Although I anticipated the plot twist, I was impressed by how Mulan handled it; she stood her ground, confronted the situation, and chose to walk away. It was both surprising and somewhat frustrating that the love interest ended up marrying her sister, yet it marked a significant turning point in her character's arc. Ultimately, Mulan returned to her starting point, but with a deeper understanding of her father's choices and her own values. The bittersweet ending was refreshing, as she remained true to her beliefs, refusing to compromise her morals for romance or forgiveness.",
            "The protagonist is a brilliant and skilled engineer, as well as a good person, but her sheltered life as the chief’s eldest daughter on a small island shapes her character significantly. While her father’s influence adds depth to her personality, her disguise as a boy is executed too easily; after an initial close call, she faces no significant challenges or risks even in a vast, technologically advanced city over several months. Her mannerisms and interactions lack the tension that would make her disguise believable.\n\nThe romance fell flat for me as well. It was quite subdued, featuring only a small kiss and a tame scene where she washes his back. Although the non-physical aspect aligns with the cultural norm of abstinence before marriage, there was insufficient romantic tension, gestures, or emotional depth to engage me in their relationship. Their bond seemed to develop too quietly through time spent together, which felt more understated than compelling.",
            "The book seems better suited for a younger teenage audience than for young adults. Its absence of physical romance and its overall tame nature lend it a lighter, more accessible feel."

The cultural focus on engineering—like weapons, buildings, transport, and inventions such as machine animals and modifications—was fascinating. However, it’s set in a \"no girls allowed\" era with no respect for women, which adds tension to her journey.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The protagonist is brilliant, clever, and a skillful engineer, as well as a good person. It’s clear she’s been somewhat sheltered on her small island as the chief’s eldest daughter. She mirrors her father’s personality, which adds depth to her character. However, her disguise as a boy felt too easy—after the initial close call when someone grabbed her waist, there were no further struggles or close calls, even over months in a massive, technologically advanced city. Her mannerisms and interactions didn’t seem to challenge her, which felt unrealistic.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was underwhelming for me. It felt very laid-back, with only a small kiss and no physical intimacy beyond a scene where she washes his back (which was very tame). While the non-physical relationship fit the genre and cultural norms of no sex before marriage, there wasn’t enough romantic tension, gestures, or emotional depth to make me invested in the pairing. They simply started caring for each other by spending time together, which felt too subtle.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Ending:**  \n  I saw the plot twist coming and expected a more dramatic reveal. However, I appreciated how the protagonist handled it—standing her ground, confronting the situation directly, and walking away. It was surprising and somewhat frustrating that he ended up marrying her sister, but it felt like a full-circle moment for her character. By the end, she’s back where she started but with a newfound understanding of her father’s choices and her own values. The not-so-happy ending was refreshing, as she stayed true to her beliefs and didn’t compromise her morals for romance or forgiveness.  \n\n- **Age Rating and Tone:**  \n  The book felt more suited to a younger teenage audience rather than young adults.

Ying's internal struggles, her concealed identity, and her wavering loyalties add significant depth to her character.\n\nI also appreciated her dynamic with Ye-Yang.

Ying, the protagonist, is strong-willed and intelligent, though her naïveté occasionally shines through, as solutions to her dilemmas often come too easily. Many supporting characters, including Ying's friends and teachers, feel interchangeable and lack depth. One teacher, who exhibits jealousy toward Ying's father, is mentioned repeatedly, but this trait remains unexplored, rendering the character underdeveloped. Most female characters, aside from Ying, are one-dimensional. However, the romance between Ying and YeYang is executed well and feels authentic. Ying's choice to reject an unsuitable life highlights her strength of character, contrasting sharply with YeYang's delusional viewpoint.",

This pacing issue makes the story feel uneven.  \n  - The ending, however, is satisfying, as it shifts the relationship dynamics between characters in an engaging way.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  - The world feels vast yet small, with detailed descriptions of settings but a lack of historical depth.  \n  - Ying mentions the Empire and its impact on her country, but this isn’t explored further, leaving the world feeling underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  - The romance between Ying and YeYang is well-executed and believable.  \n  - Ying’s decision to reject a life that doesn’t suit her is a strong character moment, contrasting with YeYang’s delusional perspective.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Jade and Dragons* is a solid debut with a compelling protagonist and an engaging romance, but it suffers from underdeveloped characters, uneven pacing, and a lack of depth in its worldbuilding. Despite these flaws, the ending leaves a strong impression and sets up potential for future installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While the plot was engaging, I found myself wishing it had priority over the romance. Ying's revenge-driven motivation was problematic; a focus on investigating her father's death would have been more compelling. Additionally, I felt Ying lacked character development, as she learned little from her actions aside from the realization that revenge did not bring her happiness. Her continual lying and hypocrisy, particularly towards Ye-Yang, were frustrating to witness.",
            "I appreciated the characters, but I found Ying challenging to connect with. Her hot-headedness, immaturity, and impulsive nature often led her to act without considering the consequences. Her hypocrisy was particularly exasperating; while she condemns violence and war, she seeks revenge that involves both violence and the dissemination of dangerous weapon plans.\n\nAs for Ye-Yang, he felt somewhat one-dimensional, and I hope to see more depth in his character in the next installment.",
            "I truly appreciated the concept of this book, particularly its Asian-inspired steampunk theme. The world-building is impressive, creating a rich and immersive setting that I thoroughly enjoyed."

        "conclusion": "While I enjoyed the concept, world-building, and audio narration, Ying’s character and her revenge-driven actions significantly impacted my overall experience.

The steampunk with an Asian focus is phenomenal, and the world-building is good.

She is hot-headed, immature, and super impulsive, often acting without thinking through her actions. Her hypocrisy was particularly frustrating. She condemns violence and war, yet she pursues revenge, which involves violence and releasing dangerous weapon plans into the world.  \n  Ye-Yang felt a bit flat to me, and I wished he had more depth. I hope to see more development in the sequel.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The plot was good, but I wish it had taken more center stage than the romance. Ying’s revenge-driven motivation was a major issue for me. If she had focused on investigating her father’s death rather than seeking revenge, I would have been more satisfied.  \n  I also felt that Ying didn’t grow as a character. She didn’t seem to learn from her actions, except realizing that revenge didn’t make her happy. Her constant lying and hypocrisy, especially regarding Ye-Yang, were frustrating.\n\n- **Sequel Expectations:**  \n  I’m glad there is a sequel, and I’m excited to see Ye-Kan and Nian make appearances. I hope Ying gains more maturity in the next book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the concept, world-building, and audio narration, Ying’s character and her revenge-driven actions significantly impacted my overall experience.

            "I'm mixed about the ending. While it didn't surprise me, it left me both happy and sad. I believe it was ultimately for the best, but it still felt disappointing. I also wish the chimera had reappeared later in the story—it was such a standout element that I wanted to see more of it. Initially, I hesitated with the plot since it deviated from my usual fantasy reads, but I found *The Engineer’s Guild* to be a fascinating concept. The trials of the guild, Ying’s hidden identity, her quest to uncover her father's death, and her romance interwove well at times, though the balance occasionally felt off. Some obstacles seemed overly contrived to remind me of the end goal, which disrupted the narrative flow.",

            "The story begins at a rapid pace, which may feel overly convenient at first, but it quickly settles into a satisfying blend of action, mystery, and intrigue. While the cross-dressing subplot introduces an element of excitement, it primarily serves to create tension around the protagonist's hidden identity rather than exploring themes of gender or misogyny in depth.",
            "Ying is an exceptional female lead—competent, determined, self-confident, and outspoken. She draws comparisons to Nhika from *The Last Bloodcarver*, which is high praise. While the side characters aren’t fully fleshed out, they possess enough personality to suggest potential for further development. The romance is sweet and believable, seamlessly woven into the main plot without overwhelming it. Although I appreciated Ying's decision to part ways with Ye-Yang, I felt the story could have had more emotional depth if she had stayed with him, introducing internal conflict over loving a villain. Ying’s growth is somewhat limited; she seems to advance through her own studies and experiments rather than learning from the guild. While her independence is commendable, it leaves room for deeper development in future installments.",

Her goal is to uncover the truth behind his death while navigating the challenges of the guild. The premise, while not entirely unique, is executed in a way that makes the book engaging and fun to read. The trials at the Engineering Guild were particularly interesting, showcasing Aihui’s ingenuity and the idea that engineering is both a science and an art.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Aihui is a compelling protagonist who uses her father’s lessons to solve the case and survive. Her journey is well-crafted, and her interactions with the two princes add depth to her character. The author avoids a clichéd, Disney-style ending, allowing the characters to remain true to themselves and letting the story unfold naturally.\n\n- **Cultural Influence and Setting:**  \n  The book is rich in Chinese culture and influence, which is woven seamlessly into the narrative. This cultural backdrop not only enhances the story but also provides thought-provoking reflections on the modern world.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The first few pages were challenging to get into, likely due to formatting issues with the ARC on Kindle, but once the story gained momentum, it was a compelling read from start to finish. The pacing was well-balanced, keeping the reader engaged throughout.\n\n- **Originality and Genre:**  \n  The novel introduces the concept of “silk punk,” which was unfamiliar but intriguing. While the setting and setup weren’t groundbreaking, the execution and unique elements, such as the engineering trials, made the story stand out.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivers on its promise of a Mulan-inspired tale with a fresh twist. Aihui’s journey is both thrilling and thought-provoking, enriched by the cultural influences and the author’s refusal to take the easy way out with the ending.

Ye-kan, one of her friends, stands out as a favorite. Their relationship starts as grudging allies who know each other's secrets but develops well, aided by Ye-kan's forgiving nature.

While the ending felt rushed and the investigation into Ying's father's murder could have been more fleshed out, the book left me eager for the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to NetGalley and Penguin for the ARC.

            "Of Jade and Dragons is a fast-paced novel that artfully combines elements of Mulan and Iron Widow. The story follows the female main character who disguises herself as a man to join a magical engineering guild in her quest to uncover her father's murderer and seek vengeance. As she navigates her journey, she faces three tests for guild membership, hides her true identity, and grapples with her growing feelings for the royal male main character. With the world teetering on the edge of war, the narrative is steeped in tension and high stakes.",
            "The FMC's quest for justice and ambition to join the guild make her a captivating protagonist. Her evolving relationship with the royal MMC enriches the narrative with emotional depth.",
            "Set against the backdrop of two feuding empires, this story masterfully intertwines character growth and challenges with the realities of war. The inclusion of a magical engineering guild brings an intriguing twist to the fantasy landscape, enhancing the narrative's depth.",
            "The book evokes strong Mulan vibes, especially through the protagonist's disguise and journey. It also recalls *The Daughter of the Moon Goddess* and *The Poppy Wars*. Initially, I thought of *Fourth Wing*, but the similarities are minimal, as there’s no resurrection element—at least not yet."

        "conclusion": "Of Jade and Dragons is an engaging and fast-paced YA fantasy that combines elements of Mulan with a unique magical engineering twist. With a compelling protagonist, rich world-building, and a promising setup, it’s a great choice for fans of Asian mythology-inspired stories.",

            "The ending left me wanting more. Though not a cliffhanger, it felt incomplete, making me hope for a continuation where the characters find happiness, regardless of whether they end up together. The plot was engaging, with Ying seeking revenge for her father's murder. Her journey—disguising herself as her brother, joining the engineering guild, and unraveling the mystery behind her father's death—was well-paced and kept me engaged. Her relationship with the eighth prince added depth to her story, and the final choice between duty and desire was particularly impactful.",

Her strong moral compass often clashes with her ambitions, adding depth to her character. Ying’s choice to disguise herself as a boy to join a male-dominated institution showcases her determination and resilience. While she values her past freedom to express her femininity, she acknowledges having previously underestimated the worth of traditionally ‘feminine’ arts. Importantly, Ying respects the choices of other women and works to demonstrate that femininity should never be a reason for underestimation.\n\nThe romance in the story feels somewhat rushed, but this seems deliberate, reflecting Ying’s vulnerabilities and the nature of her situation.

I would have loved more depth and atmospheric vibes to fully immerse me in the world.  \n- **Friendship Dynamics:**  \n  The friendship dynamics in the book were enjoyable and well-portrayed. However, I felt the academic settings and rivalries could have been explored more.  \n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romantic vibes were not a strong focus, which I didn’t mind, but they could have been developed further for readers who enjoy that aspect.  \n- **Plot and Investigation:**  \n  The plot was okay overall, with some twists and turns. The investigation into Ying’s father’s assassination, as well as the kingdom alliances, tricks, and political intrigues, could have been more thoroughly written.  \n- **World-Building and Technology:**  \n  The steampunk elements, such as engines, airships, weapons, and cannons, were interesting but could have been more lively and engrossing. I wanted to feel more connected to the technological aspects of the world.  \n- **Ending and Climax:**  \n  The ending had some nice twists, but the final act felt anti-climactic. It left me wanting a more impactful conclusion.  \n- **Potential for Future Installments:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I might read the next installment to see if the story improves and delves deeper into its potential.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Jade and Dragons* is a light, easy-to-read YA fantasy with a promising premise and enjoyable friendship dynamics. While it has great potential, it falls short in depth, atmosphere, and thoroughness in certain areas like the investigation and world-building. The ending, though twisty, felt anti-climactic. However, the unique blend of Mulan-inspired themes, steampunk elements, and political intrigue makes it worth a try for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars"

The story weaves together technology, clashing clans, royalty, scheming, mythical creatures, and a hint of romance, creating a rich and immersive world.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I absolutely loved following Ying’s character through her journey to become an engineer in the engineers guild.  \n  - Her character was fun, strong-willed, and determined, making her relatable and inspiring to me as a woman in STEM.  \n  - It was interesting to read how Ying had to disguise herself as a man in the engineers guild and navigate the struggles of keeping this secret.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  - I am thrilled that this book featured a woman in STEM in a world dominated by men, which made Ying’s character empowering and meaningful.  \n  - The story reminded me of Mulan, which I love, and it immersed me from the beginning.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  - The plot twists in this book were incredible—I have no words for them!  \n  - I can’t wait to see where the next book begins and to dive back into the world Ying lives in.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - My only critique is that the world-building was not as detailed as I had hoped.  \n  - While I understood the basics of the story and world, I wasn’t as immersed as I expected to be, and some aspects of the politics and setting were unclear.  \n\n- **Writing and Quotes:**  \n  - Overall, I loved the writing in this book.  \n  - My favorite quotes were: “These seas can never trap those who are meant to fly” and “I was your sword, but you were never mine.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis YA novel combines mechanical beasts, a woman in STEM, and romance into a captivating story. Ying’s journey as a determined and inspiring engineer in a male-dominated world was both relatable and empowering. While the world-building could have been more detailed, the plot twists and writing kept me hooked. I eagerly await the next book in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars"

            "A two-star reviewer criticized the author for misusing the phrase \"confused glimmer.\" However, I find this critique to be unjustified. Authors have the creative liberty to play with language, and in this instance, the phrase resonates well, particularly when considering the nuances of the Chinese language. The Chinese character can signify glimmering, twinkling, or dazzling, but it can also convey feelings of perplexity or confusion. This exemplifies the layered meanings within Chinese, making the author's choice of \"confused glimmer\" feel both appropriate and natural."

However, I believe this critique is unfounded. Authors are allowed creative freedom, and in this case, the phrase makes sense when considering the nuances of the Chinese language. For example, the Chinese character 熒 can mean glimmering, twinkling, or dazzling, but it can also mean perplexed or confused. This shows how words in Chinese can have layered meanings, and the author’s use of \"confused glimmer\" felt appropriate and natural to me.  \n- **Cultural Sensitivity in Reviews:**  \n  I find it frustrating when American or white reviewers critique the language in books by authors of color without understanding the cultural and linguistic context. It’s important to acknowledge that authors, especially those who grew up in Asian countries, may associate words differently due to their linguistic backgrounds. Reviewers should broaden their perspectives and avoid nitpicking language choices without considering these nuances.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling read with strong representation and thoughtful use of language that reflects the author’s cultural and linguistic background. I encourage readers to approach reviews with an open mind and consider the cultural context before critiquing language choices.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating score mentioned in the review.)"

I hope future installments will explore a different romantic direction, possibly with Ye-kan.

The Asian steampunk theme was very cool, and I hope the main character travels more in the next book(s). The ships, the inventions, and even the fun tavern were all very neat.\n  \n- **Guild:**  \n  The guild was surprisingly bland. I didn’t find it particularly engaging or memorable.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  I didn’t care for the romance at all, and it honestly could have been taken out. Ye-yang was just kind of there, barely making an impact. They would have worked just as well, if not better, as friends. They only spent a handful of scenes together. I’m so over insta-love, though at least she didn’t come off as head-over-heels for him the second she saw him. But it was close. I’m hoping in future books she’ll drop Ye-yang and find someone better for her.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I’m personally hoping for Ye-kan. It would be interesting to see him grow up and step up as a prince. There’s a lot of potential for character development there. However, I know that’s unlikely. He might grow up a bit, but she’ll probably still end up with Ye-yang.\n\n- **Plot and Betrayal:**  \n  I really wanted a full betrayal. I wanted Ye-yang to be 100% unforgivable, as I think that would have been a great setup for the next book. But I have a feeling she’ll forgive him and work together with him. I’d be super excited if she doesn’t, though.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the world setting and the steampunk elements, but the romance fell flat for me, and I was disappointed by the lack of a full betrayal.

Her journey is compelling and well-developed, driving the narrative forward.\n\n- **Subversion of Tropes:**  \n  The author, Amber Chen, adeptly subverts expected tropes, which makes the story a breath of fresh air. For instance, the male character’s death serves as the narrative motivation for the hero, flipping traditional storytelling conventions. As Chris Kluwe of *Lightspeed Magazine* noted, this subversion extends to the romance elements, which start in an expected direction but end up in a completely different, yet natural, progression.\n\n- **World-Building and Genre:**  \n  The story’s focus on the engineering guild and airships gives it a steampunk feel, though the wondrous world-building makes \"Silkpunk\" a more fitting description.

The plot also explores deeper themes, such as the tension between doing what is right and what is necessary, adding layers to the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  Inspired by the Qing dynasty, the world-building is rich and immersive. The political intrigue, particularly the rivalry among the royal princes (九子奪嫡), is juicy and adds depth to the narrative. The incorporation of technological systems gives the story a modern twist while maintaining its historical roots. The mythical creatures and heartwarming friendships further enrich the world, making it a pleasure to explore.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  The prose is captivating, and the story incorporates iconic scenes from Chinese dramas, which I found deeply satisfying. Even the cliché moments are executed well and add to the overall enjoyment. The novel explores themes of revenge, ambition, power, and the cost of staying true to one's beliefs, making it thought-provoking as well as entertaining.  \n\n- **Standalone Potential and Series Appeal:**  \n  As the first book in a duology, *Of Jade and Dragons* is a fun and engaging read that can also be enjoyed as a standalone. The almost 500 pages felt effortless to read, and the story leaves readers eagerly anticipating the conclusion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Jade and Dragons* is a captivating blend of adventure, romance, and political intrigue, set in a richly imagined world inspired by the Qing dynasty. With a strong protagonist, a well-paced plot, and thought-provoking themes, it is a highly enjoyable read that leaves a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5 stars  \n\n**Note:**  \nI received an ARC from the publisher, Penguin Teen. All opinions are my own. (I also wondered about the language inspiration behind certain terms, such as \"A-ma\" for father, which felt slightly distracting at times.)"

I believe young readers can piece together plot developments without excessive explanation.  \n\n- **Engagement and Appeal:**  \n  - I was frequently drawn back to the story and found it highly engaging.  \n  - I would recommend this novel to fans of *Iron Widow* and Tamora Pierce's works.  \n\n- **Potential for Series:**  \n  - I am already looking forward to the next installment in this series and am curious to see how certain elements, like Ying's ease in overcoming challenges, might develop further.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a strong debut novel with a creative and surprising plot, memorable characters, and an engaging narrative. While the writing could be less explanatory at times, the story's charm and appeal make it a worthwhile read, especially for fans of YA fantasy and Steam Punk-inspired tales.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The only similarity is the plot point of a girl dressing up as a boy. However, her love interest knew her true identity all along, and her reason for disguising herself was to join an engineering guild, not an army. There is no defined enemy, as the story focuses on the ambiguity of allegiances.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  The friendships in the story feel underdeveloped. One friend exists solely because he is an important character to the plot, while the other is barely memorable beyond his name. These relationships lack depth and significance.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  The book is entertaining but doesn’t offer much beyond that. The ending, however, was particularly enjoyable and stood out as the highlight of the story.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  While the ending was satisfying, the fact that this is part of a series raises concerns. There’s a risk that future installments could undo what made the ending so compelling, though I remain hopeful that this won’t be the case.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book is an entertaining read but falls short of being a Mulan retelling, as it shares only one superficial similarity.

            "Initially, I found the main character's portrayal frustrating. The author struggled to balance her naivety and common sense, often emphasizing her spoiled upbringing—her father encouraged her to pursue engineering instead of traditional female roles—and her quick temper. Her impetuousness, particularly in the face of a murder, felt unrealistic; even a foolish person would likely exercise more caution. However, these flaws created engaging conflicts that ultimately made the story compelling. As the character developed over time, I let go of my initial criticisms. The inclusion of a handsome man, a group of endearing friendships among the kids, and an intriguing array of teachers enriched the narrative.",

            "I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which offers a unique twist reminiscent of Mulan, though the parallels are limited. I initially expected it to be a standalone novel, so I was surprised to discover it isn’t. The story follows Ying, who, after witnessing her father's murder, disguises herself as a man to enlist in the male-dominated engineers guild and seek the truth. However, she quickly learns that nothing is as it seems. The trials are more challenging than she anticipated, and trust becomes a significant issue, even with her one trusted ally.\n\nDespite its length, the book is an easy read, packed with action that keeps the pages turning. The world-building is straightforward, enhancing the smooth reading experience. If you're looking for a fairytale with a happy ending, this isn’t it—at least not in this installment. In fact, I’d say it’s quite the opposite; by the end, none of the characters seem to find happiness. I'm hopeful for some resolution in the next book."

I was expecting it to be a standalone novel and was surprised to find that it doesn’t seem to be. The story follows Ying, who, after witnessing her father’s murder, enlists in the engineers guild—a top institution that only accepts males—by disguising herself as a man to uncover the truth. However, nothing is as it seems. The trials are more intense than she anticipated, and she can’t trust anyone, including the one person she does trust, who may not be deserving.\n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  This was a very easy read. Despite the book being chunky, it is packed with action, making it a breeze to get through. The world-building is not overly complex, which contributes to the smooth reading experience.\n\n- **Ending and Emotional Impact:**  \n  If you’re expecting a fairytale where everyone lives happily ever after, this is not it (at least not in this book!). I’d go so far as to say it’s the exact opposite—I don’t think anyone was happy by the end of this story. I hope we get some closure in the next book.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I enjoyed the book, but I hope this isn’t a very long series. While I liked it, it feels like it could be a forgettable one if stretched out too much.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this book to be an engaging and action-packed read with a compelling protagonist and a plot full of twists.

It’s a refreshing and engaging read that stands out in the fantasy genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While it’s not unsatisfying, it creates a strong emotional ache and a desire for more of the story.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Chen excels at crafting intriguing and engaging characters that I genuinely cared about.  \n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing slows down towards the middle, but the beginning is fantastic, and the story picks up significantly after the midpoint. The slower pacing serves as a calm before the storm, adding depth to the storyline. However, readers who prefer consistently fast-paced narratives should be prepared for this shift.  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel incorporates elements of Chinese culture and a steampunk-inspired world, creating a unique and immersive setting.  \n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  Ying’s story kept me hooked until the very last page, sentence, and word.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a highly engaging and emotionally resonant novel with well-developed characters, a unique world, and a compelling plot. Despite a slower middle section, the story builds to a satisfying yet cliffhanger-filled conclusion that leaves me eagerly anticipating a sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nHighly recommend!"

Her internal thoughts and decisions, especially at the end, are well-crafted and satisfying.  \n  - The inclusion of mysterious, morally grey men adds intrigue and complexity to the character dynamics.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The novel features unexpected plot twists that are both shocking and impactful, keeping the reader engaged.  \n  - The pacing is described as a slow burn, which allows for gradual development of the story and characters, making the eventual revelations more rewarding.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The setting, which begins in a small village and expands into a larger, more dramatic world, is vividly portrayed through Ying’s eyes, creating an immersive reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating read for fans of stories like Disney’s Mulan, with its blend of adventure, moral complexity, and character-driven narrative. The themes of invention and misuse, combined with Ying’s compelling journey and the unexpected twists, make for a memorable and thought-provoking story. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am eagerly anticipating the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I love her nonetheless.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The story is off to a slow start until around 150 pages in, after which it quickens.  \n  - Once the world-building and story-building are more or less complete, and you better understand all the engineering terms, you’re free to simply enjoy the heartbreaking and emotional moments.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The story leaves you with deeply emotional and heartbreaking moments.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Installments:**  \n  - I’m really excited for book 2!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel starts slowly but gains momentum after the first 150 pages, delivering a richly built world and emotionally resonant moments. The characters, particularly Ying, are compelling despite their flaws, and the story leaves a lasting impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4⭐️"

The story struggled to balance its many elements—murder mystery, academics, politics, and romance—resulting in narrative threads that felt lost and inadequately tied together. Although I enjoyed the Mulan-inspired plotline, the mystery element was less prominent than I had hoped, often overshadowed by the academic focus until the very end. The conclusion was too quick and resolved too easily, leaving numerous loose ends. While some may be addressed in future installments, I believe many should have been resolved within this book.",

Additionally, her rudeness towards her friends, along with a lack of apologies and expectations for their forgiveness, left me frustrated. The supporting characters—Ye-kan, Chang-en, and Ye-yang—felt one-dimensional; I wanted more depth. For instance, what drives Ye-kan's abrasiveness? Why is Ye-yang so emotionally troubled? While Chang-en played the role of the loyal best friend, he lacked complexity. Characters like Arban and Master Gerel seemed promising as antagonists but were ultimately underutilized and fell flat.

The pacing between trials felt slow, and not much tended to happen, making the book boring at times.  \n\n- **Plot and Inspiration:**  \n  - The Mulan inspiration and plotline were enjoyable.  \n  - The mystery element wasn’t as prominent as I’d have liked. It took a backseat to the academics until the very end.  \n  - The ending felt rushed and resolved too quickly, making it seem too easy.  \n  - There were a lot of loose ends, some of which might be resolved in a sequel, but I felt most should have been addressed in this book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I didn’t connect with the main character, Ying. She came across as naive, whiny, and young. Her father dies at the beginning, but I don’t recall her ever mourning. She was also rude to her friends, never apologized, and expected them to forgive her, which they did.  \n  - The supporting characters—Ye-kan, Chang-en, and Ye-yang—were one-dimensional. I wanted more depth. For example, why is Ye-Kan so abrasive? Why is Ye-yang such a tortured emo boy? Chang-en was a golden retriever best friend, but there wasn’t much else to his character.  \n  - Some characters, like Arban and Master Gerel, were introduced as antagonists but were underutilized and disappeared or fell flat in their roles.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The pacing wasn’t great. The book got boring in between the trials, and the ending felt rushed.  \n  - The story tried to juggle too many elements—murder mystery, academics, politics, romance—but the threads were lost or not convincingly woven back in.  \n\n- **Originality and Expectations:**  \n  - I went in with high expectations due to rumors of this being a book box pick, but I was not impressed.  \n  - Nothing felt new or distinctive compared to other books in the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the academic setting and the Mulan-inspired plotline, the book fell flat for me overall. The characters lacked depth, the pacing was uneven, and the story tried to tackle too many elements without weaving them together effectively. The rushed ending and loose ends further diminished my enjoyment. While I was curious enough to finish the book, it didn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5)"

            "The pacing of the story is inconsistent, with some sections dragging while others feel hurried. The ending particularly suffers from a lack of development; an extra chapter or two would have improved its effectiveness. Although the book is framed as a murder mystery, the outcome is relatively easy to anticipate, and the mystery itself ultimately takes a backseat. If you're seeking a strong focus on the plot's intrigue, you may find it disappointing. My main issue lies with the ending, which left me questioning some of Ying’s motives and wishing for more buildup. Without giving away spoilers, it ultimately left me with mixed feelings.",
            "I enjoyed Ying as the main character. As a teenager, she makes typical mistakes, but I admired her strong morals and her reluctance to compromise them. However, I had some reservations about the ending, which I’ll hold off on judging until the sequel. I also felt the side characters could have been further developed. While we spend ample time with Ying, characters like Ye-Yang, the male lead, don’t receive enough attention. Although he has intriguing plot points, I wished for a deeper exploration of his character beyond just being noble and Ying's love interest.",
            "The author’s vivid descriptive writing truly immersed me in the setting, which I appreciated. However, I found the book lacking in world-building, particularly concerning the political conflict that often unfolded off-page and was merely recounted by the characters.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Premise and Initial Appeal:**  \n  I was so excited for this book, just based on the premise and cover alone. The idea of a Mulan-inspired story with a silkpunk twist was incredibly appealing and drew me in immediately.\n\n- **Main Character (Ying):**  \n  I liked Ying as a main character. She’s a teenager who makes teenage mistakes, but I appreciated her strong morals and how she rarely compromises them. However, I had some issues with her ending, though I’m reserving judgment until the sequel.\n\n- **Writing Style and Immersion:**  \n  The author’s descriptive writing helped me immerse in the setting, which I enjoyed. However, I felt the book needed more world-building, especially regarding the political conflict, which often happened off-page and was only discussed by characters.\n\n- **Character Development (Side Characters):**  \n  I would have liked to see the other characters built up more. While we spend a lot of time with Ying, the side characters don’t shine as much. Specifically, I wish we had more time with Ye-Yang, the male main character, to develop him beyond being noble and Ying’s love interest. He has interesting plot points, but I wanted to know more about him.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing wasn’t consistent. Some parts slowed down significantly, while others felt rushed. I think the ending could have benefited from an extra chapter or two to build it out more effectively.\n\n- **Plot (Murder Mystery):**  \n  While the book is framed as a murder mystery, it wasn’t terribly hard to guess the outcome. The mystery becomes a B-plot, which is fine, but if you’re expecting a strong focus on the mystery, you might be disappointed.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  My biggest gripe is with the ending. It made me question some of Ying’s motives, and I wish it had been built up more. I’ll avoid spoilers, but it left me with mixed feelings.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Sequel Potential:**  \n  Despite my critiques, this was an enjoyable debut, and I will definitely read the sequel. I’m eager to see the world built out more and to find out what happens next.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a promising debut with a compelling premise and a strong main character. While there are areas for improvement, such as world-building, character development, and pacing, I found it enjoyable and am looking forward to the sequel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The mystery and intrigue kept me invested, though the ending was disappointing and felt weak. The emotional intensity was low, which made it feel detached, but overall, it was a pleasant read. If I went back in time, knowing what I know now, I might still read it.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Ying, the main character, was fascinating and held my attention.

The story is filled with mystery and tension, though the ending left much unresolved.\n\n- **Emotional Intensity:**  \n  The emotional intensity was low (1/5), which I attribute to its YA nature and the unfamiliar cultural setting. While the story was engaging, it lacked the depth and emotional connection I sometimes seek in a book.\n\n- **Cathartic Fulfillment:**  \n  The emotional journey fell short for me, with only 25% fulfillment. The ending was frustrating, as it felt abrupt and unresolved. While the mystery was solved, other aspects of the story were left hanging, leaving me unfulfilled. Knowing there’s a sequel slightly mitigates this, but I’m unsure if I’ll continue reading.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was an engaging and pleasant read, with a fascinating protagonist and a plot filled with mystery and intrigue.

Key details and scenes could have been trimmed to streamline the plot, while additional context and background in certain areas would have enhanced clarity. Furthermore, the absence of a dragon, as suggested by the title, was a letdown.",

The academic setting and engineering focus, which I looked forward to, were not well-developed.

The two main characters (mc) didn’t wow me, and I didn’t connect with them or their relationship, which I found predictable and lacking context.

She was strong and determined, and I appreciated her growth throughout the story. However, I found the budding “romance” between her and Ye-Yang not compelling in the least. That said, I was pleased with the ending when she chose herself and the life she wants rather than falling for his platitudes.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The steampunk elements and the Engineers Guild were well-crafted and added depth to the world. I particularly enjoyed the cultural details and the way the setting was brought to life through the narration.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  I listened to the audiobook, and Jen Zhao did a great job with the narration. It really helped me learn to pronounce some of the character names and other cultural words, enhancing my overall experience.\n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  The side characters were enjoyable and added richness to the story. They complemented Ying’s journey and made the guild scenes even more entertaining.\n\n- **Physical Edition (Illumicrate):**  \n  An aside: I have the Illumicrate edition, and it’s one of the most beautiful editions on my shelf. I love the illustrated endpapers by jhocaaa on Instagram!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this debut novel and found it to be a strong start to the series. While the romance fell flat for me, the plot, world-building, and character development were compelling. I’m excited to continue the series and see what’s next for the main character.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️🎧"

The setting was particularly captivating, with colorful descriptions that drew me in. The introduction of steampunk technology set the stage for exciting developments throughout the series, and the small, detailed touches added a lot of charm and creativity to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the setting was a highlight, the plot and pacing felt lacking. Many big moments were set up but then skipped over, only to be alluded to in later scenes. The story often jumped through weeks at a time, which felt like a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the narrative and develop key relationships on page.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters had potential for interesting complexity, but their development was underwhelming. We were told a lot about the main character and others, but we weren’t shown much of their personalities or brilliance in action. This was disappointing, as it left me wanting more depth and immersion in their journeys.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  Despite these shortcomings, I remain hopeful that some of the issues stem from the stage-setting nature of a first book in a series. I’m optimistic that the second book will be more immersive and deliver on the potential hinted at in this installment. In fact, I’m eager to read the next one!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was a creative and enjoyable read with a captivating setting, but it fell short in plot execution and character development.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Writing Style and Technique:**  \n  The author demonstrates good technical writing skills, but the novel feels like a debut work. The storytelling often relies on telling rather than showing, which detracts from the immersive experience. For example, we are told about the characters' attraction to each other, but the chemistry isn't effectively conveyed.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  It was challenging to connect with or care deeply about any of the characters. The protagonist's motivations and actions, particularly at the end, felt inconsistent. She initially aspires to follow in her father's footsteps and join a guild, but abruptly changes her mind, which felt unsatisfying.\n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  The book is marketed as a Mulan retelling, but the connection is superficial, limited to the trope of a girl pretending to be a boy. This element is quickly resolved, as the male lead figures out her identity early on. The ending was abrupt and unclear about whether it was setting up a sequel, which was only clarified after checking external sources.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The corruption in the world is evident from the start, but the protagonist's decision to leave after achieving her revenge felt rushed and undermined the stakes. The world-building had potential but wasn't fully explored or utilized.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was enjoyable and showed promise. The author's growth as a writer is evident, and I am optimistic that future installments will improve. I plan to read the sequel and am curious to see where the story goes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential and was enjoyable, it suffered from issues in character development, storytelling, and pacing. The ending felt abrupt and inconsistent, but the author's technical skills and the story's premise leave room for improvement in future works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I wish there had been a guide at the start or end of the book to help with proper pronunciation.

Comparing it to something like *The Poppy War*, there’s a glaring difference in how well the worlds and different countries are crafted. I have little to no understanding of the cultural differences between the Empire and the Nine Isles.  \n\n- **Moral Ambiguity and Antagonists:**  \n  I’m not sure if the Nine Isles are supposed to be the “good guys,” but they are, in every sense of the word, the antagonists in this war. The fact that we’re supposed to be rooting for them feels almost paradoxical.  \n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was incredibly entertaining. The pacing was well done, and I enjoyed my time reading it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s concept is intriguing, its execution leaves much to be desired, particularly in terms of character development, world-building, and moral clarity.

However, I was disappointed by the lack of focus on the actual principles of engineering.  \n\n- **Themes of Sexism and Traditionalism:**  \n  I appreciated how the book used engineering as a vehicle to challenge sexism and traditionalism. Ying’s defiance of the outdated and inaccurate “accepted truths” of *The Annals* felt like the most authentic engineering aspect of the story.  \n\n- **Engineering as a Vehicle for Empire:**  \n  The exploration of engineering as a tool for empire-building fell short. There wasn’t enough background on how the weapons functioned or what principles the apprentices were studying. The sudden creation of a weapon by Ying felt underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  The political climate, romance, and progression of the apprenticeship trials were all introduced but lacked sufficient development. Having all three elements present without adequate depth made each feel weaker.  \n\n- **Potential for a Sequel:**  \n  Despite the shortcomings, I’m curious about where a second book might take the story, as this one felt nicely wrapped up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s focus on engineering and its themes of challenging sexism and traditionalism were compelling, the lack of depth in exploring engineering principles, empire-building, and key plot elements left some aspects feeling underdeveloped.

            "The pacing of the story felt uneven; the first trial dragged on too long, leaving the latter half rushed as the author crammed multiple major plot events into a limited space. The narrative would have benefitted from more pages to allow key moments—such as the banquet, betrayal, revelations, and revenge—to develop more organically. Additionally, the editing was clumsy, with continuity errors that caused confusion, including a scene where the main character is inexplicably naked.\n\nWhile the plot contained intriguing ideas, the execution faltered. The murder investigation was poorly handled, with only three inquiries that failed to showcase the main character’s engineering skills. The twist regarding the male lead's true nature was compelling, yet the overall narrative felt weak and unrefined. The story would have prospered as a historical fantasy, incorporating deeper political intrigue and a richer exploration of societal dynamics.",
            "In this story, most characters lack depth and development. The female main character (FMC) comes across as a generic placeholder, with inconsistent actions, such as abruptly revealing her father's pendant after concealing it. The supporting characters, including the apprentices, are lifeless and underdeveloped. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Ye-kang, who stood out due to his vibrant personality. Conversely, the male main character (MMC), Ye-yang, exhibits the most significant character growth, evolving from a typical love interest into a morally ambiguous and ambitious figure.",
            "The book presents itself as centered on engineering, yet this element remains underdeveloped. The responsibilities of the engineering guild appear inconsistent, and the female main character's engineering brilliance is largely underutilized in the murder investigation. Although the societal and political intrigue hints at greater potential, it ultimately goes unexplored, resulting in a shallow worldbuilding experience.",

The engineering guild’s responsibilities seemed inconsistent, and the FMC’s engineering genius was barely utilized in the murder investigation. The societal and political intrigue hinted at in the story had potential but wasn’t fully explored, leaving the worldbuilding feeling shallow.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Most characters lacked depth and development. The FMC felt like a generic placeholder (*Y/N*) with inconsistent actions, such as suddenly revealing her father’s pendant after keeping it hidden. Supporting characters, like the apprentices, were lifeless and underdeveloped. However, I surprisingly liked Ye-kang, who felt alive and had a distinct personality. The MMC, Ye-yang, was the only character with noticeable development, transitioning from a typical love interest to a morally grey, ambitious figure.\n\n- **Plot and Execution:**  \n  The plot had intriguing ideas but fell apart in execution. The murder investigation was poorly handled, with only three instances of inquiry, none of which showcased the FMC’s engineering skills. The twist involving the MMC’s true nature was compelling, but the overall narrative felt weak and unpolished. The book would have been stronger as a historical fantasy with deeper political intrigue and exploration of societal dynamics.\n\n- **Potential and Missed Opportunities:**  \n  I was more interested in the elder generation of characters—Ying’s father, the High Commander, and the Grand Master—and their backstories. Their relationships, motivations, and sacrifices could have added depth to the story. The book had fragmented scenes and ideas I genuinely liked, but they didn’t come together cohesively.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I loved the concept and some individual elements, the execution was lacking.

The unexpected ally in the form of a prince added an interesting dynamic to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n  The plot included many tropes I enjoy, such as competition academia and hidden identities. However, I felt the execution fell short in some areas. For instance, the trials at the Engineers Guild, which were a central part of the story, lacked depth. While the competition aspect was present, there was little buildup, alliance-building, or tension between trials, which are staples of this trope.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The silk punk fantasy world had potential, but it felt surface-level at times. The Engineers Guild, in particular, could have been more vividly described to make it come alive. The setting and scenes didn’t fully jump off the pages, which was a missed opportunity.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was pleasant and easy to read, but it lacked the depth and excitement needed to fully immerse me in the story. Certain moments, like Ying’s near misses with her identity being discovered, felt too easily resolved and lacked the tension and humor seen in similar stories like *Mulan*.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  I appreciated the themes of ambition and the consequences of creation, especially in the context of engineers contributing to the war effort. The exploration of how inventions can lead to destruction added a layer of depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book to be a pleasant and easy read with an engaging premise and likable characters. However, it lacked the depth, tension, and vivid world-building needed to make it truly exciting. While I enjoyed the story, it didn’t fully captivate me or leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

            "Around page 250, the book began to falter. A key scene that should have been dramatic felt poorly executed, burdened with unnecessary details and leaving several questions unanswered. This moment could easily have been cut without impacting the plot. The second half of the book felt disjointed, with awkward transitions and a lack of emotional resonance. It was akin to traveling down a rough, swampy road, ultimately diminishing my overall enjoyment.",

I believe these problems are fixable, and I encourage both the publisher and author to invest the necessary time in refining the next installment. The characters, world, and writing truly deserve it.",
            "Initially, I was deeply engaged with the book, feeling it could be a 4-star read or higher. I particularly enjoyed the characters, especially Ying and Ye-Yang, and appreciated the thoughtful name choices. The premise evoked a classic coming-of-age story infused with a steampunk twist set in a Qing Dynasty-inspired world. Themes of disguise, wonder at the capital, and the evolution of relationships with classmates resonated strongly with me. The first half of the book unfolded like a well-paved road, with a comfortable rhythm of classes and an immersive fantastical world."

            "The relationships between Ying and her fellow students were a standout aspect of the story. I appreciated the dynamics among them and wished for more focus on these interactions, as they added depth and warmth to the narrative. However, Ying's desire to be seen as \"the exception\" felt problematic; it suggested a longing to be the only girl in the field rather than advocating for broader inclusion of women in engineering. This was underscored by the absence of other female characters interested in technology, creating a “not like other girls” vibe. Furthermore, the revelation of a female instructor at an all-male academy felt inconsistent with the academy's strict gender policies. I was also disappointed that Ye-Yang quickly discerned Ying's true gender, as this missed an opportunity to explore potential romantic tension or ambiguity regarding his sexuality. Lastly, I found myself wondering about practical details, such as how Ying managed her period while concealing her gender, especially since she couldn't use communal bathrooms.",
            "The story felt confined since most of it unfolds within the isolated academy, which is shut off from the rest of the island. I would have preferred more exploration of the outside world, especially the everyday lives of the people and the political dynamics. Ying’s limited interactions beyond the academy left the narrative feeling less grounded.",

This unique premise is captivating, blending silkpunk elements with engineering in a refreshing way, even for someone like me who isn't technically inclined. I appreciated how the imaginative devices used in the narrative allowed for a willing suspension of disbelief, despite their questionable real-world feasibility."

While the trials were intended to be high-stakes, they often felt overlooked, as the protagonist, Ying, didn’t appear to invest much in them. Additionally, the narrative occasionally lost focus on crucial aspects, like Ying's grief over her father's death and the challenges of her disguise and cultural transition.",

The supporting characters are underdeveloped, often reduced to mere names, which diminishes the impact of the trials and eliminations. Additionally, the love interest lacks depth, and their relationship feels more like a familiar trope than a compelling connection.",
            "The narrative effectively utilized a \"show, don't tell\" approach in many instances; however, this often resulted in key emotional beats and character motivations feeling underdeveloped.",

Ying's skills, which could have been pivotal, end up playing a less significant role than anticipated. Additionally, the promise of dragons in the title is misleading, as the mechanical dragon has a minimal presence throughout the narrative.",

Her failure to mourn her father's death and her unrepentant rudeness toward friends are particularly off-putting. The supporting characters—Ye-kan, Chang-en, and Ye-yang—are one-dimensional and lack depth, while the romance between Ye-yang and Ying feels confusing and unconvincing given their contrasting personalities.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  The book is compared to beloved YA and Middle Grade Sci-Fi and Fantasy series like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and The Hunger Games. It shares elements of fast-paced plots, imaginative settings, and relatable characters. The novel also draws parallels to Poppy Wars, Harry Potter, and Fourth Wing but doesn’t fully delve into the dark academia vibe it hints at.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is fast-paced and engaging, with a Mulan-inspired premise where the protagonist, Aihui Ying, infiltrates a male-only Engineers Guild to uncover the truth behind her father’s murder. However, the ending feels rushed and too convenient, leaving room for improvement in pacing and structure.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ying’s character is consistent in her inner monologue but feels underdeveloped and robotic in her interactions with others. Her hyper-focus on her mission limits her engagement with other characters, making her romantic dialogue with Ye-Yang feel forced and plot-driven rather than organic.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The novel has the potential for rich world-building, especially with its prestigious academic setting and diverse cast of characters. However, it fails to fully explore these elements, leaving the academic environment and secondary characters underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is easy to follow, making the book accessible and enjoyable. The author effectively conveys the characters’ motives and desires without overcomplicating the narrative.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The romance between Ying and Ye-Yang feels necessary to the plot but lacks depth and natural progression. It often comes across as forced rather than a genuine emotional connection.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Books:**  \n  The reviewer expresses hope for a second book, suggesting that the first installment could have focused more on academic world-building and set up the mystery for a sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book doesn’t fully meet the high expectations set by its genre predecessors, it is an enjoyable read with a fast-paced plot and accessible writing style. The underdeveloped characters, rushed ending, and missed opportunities for deeper world-building hold it back from being a standout. However, the reviewer appreciates the author’s efforts and looks forward to seeing how the story progresses in a potential sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "After Ying departs from Huaren, the plot and pacing effectively maintain my engagement. However, the investigative aspect feels weak, as Ying often stumbles upon clues regarding her father's murder rather than actively uncovering them. While the set pieces are compelling, a more coherent investigation would have strengthened the overall plot.",
            "The characters were adequate but lacked the depth and complexity to be truly memorable. Ying’s response to her father's murder seemed superficial, serving mainly as a plot device to propel her toward Fei. My favorite dynamic was between Ying and Ye-kan, though their frequent conflicts left me puzzled. Furthermore, I was unclear about the author's intentions with Ying and Ye-yang's relationship; his early possessiveness made it difficult for me to empathize when their bond took a tragic turn.",
            "My main disappointment with the story was the writing, which, while not terrible, lacked polish and often distracted me. The dialogue felt wooden and stilted at times, and questionable word choices, such as “smiled imperceptibly” or “tilted his head imperceptibly in a nod,” raised inconsistencies—if something is imperceptible, how could Ying perceive it? Additionally, there were moments when the third-person point of view shifted unintentionally to an omniscient perspective. These issues seemed like they could have been caught by copyeditors, leaving me puzzled about the editing process. Listening to the audio version made it easier to overlook these flaws, but I believe they would have been more bothersome in written form.",
            "I appreciated the worldbuilding and found the conflict between the Antaran Isles and the Great Jade Empire reminiscent of the Manchus' conquest of China. However, I can't comment on the accuracy of the Manchu representation. Additionally, I was uneasy with the idea that airships were invented by white people and later adopted by the Qirins/Antarans; it felt both unnecessary and out of place."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I had fun with this book and enjoyed it more than many other fantasy books I’ve read this year.

However, I can't speak to the accuracy of the Manchu representation. I also didn’t like the choice that airships were invented by white people and then adopted by the Qirins/Antarans—it felt unnecessary and odd.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  After Ying leaves Huaren, the plot and pacing generally kept me engaged. However, the investigative plot was weak, and Ying seemed to mostly stumble her way into clues about her father's murder. While the set pieces were compelling enough to keep me interested, I felt the plot could have been stronger with a less haphazard investigation.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were fine, but none were deep or complex enough to be particularly memorable. Ying’s reaction to her father’s murder felt shallow, as if the event primarily served as motivation for her to leave for Fei and kick off the plot. My favorite relationship was between Ying and Ye-kan, though I’m unsure why they kept having conflicts. Additionally, I was uncertain about the author’s intentions regarding Ying and Ye-yang’s relationship. Ye-yang came off as possessive early on, making it hard for me to feel sad when their relationship took a tragic turn.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  My main disappointment was with the writing. While not awful, it lacked polish, which consistently distracted me. There were instances of wooden and stilted dialogue, as well as questionable word choices like “smiled imperceptibly” or “tilted his head imperceptibly in a nod.” If it’s imperceptible, Ying shouldn’t have been able to perceive it! I also noticed moments where the third-person POV unintentionally became omniscient. These issues could have been caught by copyeditors, so I’m left wondering what happened during the editing process. On audio, I was able to gloss over these problems more easily, but they would have bothered me more if I had been reading the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I had fun with this book and enjoyed it more than many other fantasy books I’ve read this year.

            "Ying's impulsive behavior and stagnation grew tiresome as the story progressed. While character flaws can be intriguing, her lack of meaningful growth diminished the impact. The supporting characters felt forgettable, though I did appreciate the gradual development of Ying's friendships throughout the trials. The romance between Ying and Ye-yang was predictable, yet I enjoyed the tension that accompanied it. Ultimately, I found Ying's friendships more engaging than the romantic subplot.",

            "The ending stands out as a highlight of the book, illustrating Ying’s growth and the poignant consequences of her choices. It hints at an intriguing direction for the sequel, especially in her relationship with Ye-kan, which feels more authentic and engaging than her forced dynamic with Ye-yang. However, the romance overshadowed the central plot, which was disappointing. Ying's brilliance as an engineer was reduced to just three significant inventions, and the high-stakes trials posed little challenge, lacking struggle or depth. I wished for a deeper focus on her journey within the Engineer’s Guild and her engineering feats, which were only briefly touched upon.",
            "Ying is a compelling character, torn between her thirst for revenge and her inclination to value knowledge and nostalgia over family. While her intellectual maturity is fascinating, her internal dialogue sometimes diminishes the weight of her actions. Although she possesses great potential, I believe her character could benefit from deeper exploration.",
            "The world-building was intriguing, particularly during moments of steampunk magic, such as when Ying reminisced about her father's inventions. However, the combination of steampunk elements with Mongolian-era China occasionally felt disjointed, making mechanical creations like the fox and hellhound seem more fantastical than integrated. While I sensed a richer world underlying the narrative, I caught only glimpses of it, leaving me eager for more exploration."

However, her motives go deeper; she is also on a quest to uncover the truth about her father's past and the identity of his killer.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Target Audience and Personal Connection:**  \n  I think if I was in my teens or early twenties, I would have eaten this book up. It had everything I would have wanted within the scope of a silkpunk fantasy. The mixture of a sweeping YA story, a secondary romance, all wrapped up in a STEM-inspired plot and backdrop would have been instant catnip. So, I really did wish I read a book like this back then.\n\n- **Premise and Themes:**  \n  The premise was cool enough; you have a girl who pretends to be a boy to take part in a set of engineering trials that would get her into a prestigious guild of engineers. It's Mulan but in engineering. However, to add and build up to the story, the girl does this because she is searching for answers about her father's past, and the whereabouts and identity of her father's killer. The story from here branches out to encompass a sweeping theme of following in a father's footsteps and the cost of making the same mistakes.\n\n- **Execution of STEM Elements:**  \n  Mostly, I was a bit let down on the appearance of the STEM marvels and the lack of actual engineering happening in this book. I loved the trials (even though I ranted about the first one at length at some point), and I wish there had been more focus on the actual applications of the engineering they were learning within the book.\n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  Unfortunately, part of the story was this focus on a romance arc that I was only kind of lukewarm over. The male love interest only got interesting the minute I started to see how his life paralleled Ying's, but the romance itself was kind of lackluster. (Again, I probably would have eaten all this angst up in my teens.)\n\n- **Pacing and Chapter Structure:**  \n  Those chapters were looooooong. I needed them cut up a bit more frequently because the pacing threw me off.\n\n- **Character Highlights and Sequel Potential:**  \n  I am, however, here for Ye-kan and his antics. I will read the next book for Ye-kan and his antics. And maybe for the potential of generally great villainy that's definitely coming up in the sequel. Here's hoping.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I liked the idea itself, and the book was good, don't get me wrong, I felt like some parts were a hit, and others a miss. The story had a lot of potential, especially with its unique premise and themes, but the execution of certain elements, like the STEM focus and romance, fell short for me. That said, I’m intrigued enough by certain characters and the promise of future developments to continue with the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 out of 5 stars"

            "The story captivates with its unique perspective, though Ying's journey occasionally veers from her primary goal of finding her father's killer. The author skillfully intertwines this quest with Ying's apprenticeship, offering an engaging spin on the chosen-one narrative. I appreciated the focus on Ying's experiences as a woman confronting misogyny. The way her competitors and guild members express their biases is effectively portrayed, making it all the more rewarding to see Ying strive and ultimately challenge their assumptions, even if they remain unaware of her true identity.",
            "The romance felt somewhat rushed; it was hard to believe that the love interest was the only one who saw through Ying’s disguise immediately, while everyone else, aside from Ye-kan, remained oblivious for months. This created an insta-love dynamic that left me wanting more interactions between them before their relationship developed. Additionally, I would have appreciated a queer subtext in this Mulan-inspired retelling, though that’s just a personal preference. I truly adored the characters, especially Ye-yang, whose graceful yet deadly instincts and quiet demeanor made him a standout for me. I’m intrigued by his story and hope the next book explores his perspective, even if we continue to follow Ying.",
            "I have a more neutral perspective on this book compared to many readers. While I appreciated numerous aspects, I also found several elements that could have been improved. Overall, it feels like a mid-tier debut for me. Nevertheless, I’m excited to see where the author takes the story, as I believe there’s great potential for expansion in this universe."

However, I’m eager to continue with the series, as I believe Amber Chen has incredible potential to expand on this story and the greater universe.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  The story was interesting, though I felt Ying’s journey strayed slightly from her original goal of finding her father’s killer. That said, Chen did a fairly good job weaving this goal with the apprentice path Ying pursued. It was an intriguing take on a chosen-one narrative, and I appreciated how it centered on Ying’s experience as a woman facing misogyny. The misogynistic comments from her competitors and guild members were handled well, and it was satisfying to see Ying work hard and prove them wrong, even if they didn’t directly know her true identity.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance felt a bit rushed to me. I found it hard to believe that the love interest was the only one who immediately saw through Ying’s disguise, while no one else did over several months (except Ye-kan). This dynamic fueled an insta-love type of relationship, and I wish we had more interactions between them before their romance developed.

She matures, experiences betrayal and remorse, and ultimately desires the peace her father sought. However, the development of other characters, such as Ye-Yang, feels lacking. His actions are often selfish, and while he has redeeming qualities, he leans more toward the “dark side.” The bond between Ying and Ye-kan stands out as the most compelling relationship in the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The story touches on themes of perseverance, betrayal, and the pursuit of dreams. However, the execution of these themes feels brief and underdeveloped. Each sequence lacks the depth needed to convey a strong, impactful message, which is a notable fault in the narrative.  \n\n- **Ending and Future Potential:**  \n  The arc that initiated Ying’s journey concludes by the end of the book, leaving room for potential continuation. It will be interesting to see how the story proceeds, especially given the unresolved dynamics between characters like Ying and Ye-Yang.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel offers an engaging and easy-to-follow adventure with a relatable protagonist in Aihui Ying. While the plot is predictable and the themes could have been more deeply explored, Ying’s character development and her bond with Ye-kan are highlights. The story’s conclusion sets the stage for potential future developments, making it a worthwhile read despite its shortcomings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The bittersweet ending marked a stark departure from the guild trials and the friendships I had invested in, and the absence of reactions from Ying's family and friends felt like a missed opportunity. While I have no predictions for the next installment, I hope it addresses these unresolved threads. The story centers on Ying, who aspires to be an engineer but is driven to find her father's assassin following his murder. Disguised as a boy, she enters the Engineer’s Guild apprentice trial to investigate his death. While the mystery was intriguing, its progression was inconsistent, and the rushed ending left much unresolved, leaving me wanting more.",
            "Ying is a clever character, and I appreciated the friendships she formed within the guild. However, her grief over her father’s death felt somewhat superficial, primarily revolving around her quest for answers and revenge, which left it underdeveloped. The slow-burn romance between Ying and Ye-yang was believable, enhanced by the tension stemming from their differing social statuses and Ying’s uncertainty about trusting him, adding depth to their relationship.",
            "The world-building seamlessly complemented the unfolding action, and I appreciated the steampunk elements. However, I felt the motivations behind the war were underexplored and left me wanting more.",

Ying's internal conflict between avenging her father and seeking acceptance into the Guild created a sense of inconsistency, as the narrative fluctuated between these two goals. While there was a mildly intriguing reveal, it ultimately lacked originality.",
            "The romance lacked depth. Although the protagonists were drawn to each other, their connection felt superficial, as their feelings appeared rooted in proximity rather than genuine love. Ying had closer relationships with other boys at the Guild, which diluted the authenticity of their bond. I did appreciate the bittersweet ending, which would have served as a satisfying conclusion for a standalone story. However, knowing there’s a sequel suggests their romance will extend, which feels unnecessary.",

While there were creative glimpses, like airships and chimeras, these ideas weren't fully explored. The guild trials presented intriguing concepts, but they were too brief to make an impact.

Additionally, the mechanical forest concept, while intended to be impressive, felt unrealistic due to the noise and obviousness of the moving parts.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance lacked spark. While the protagonists were attracted to each other, their connection felt superficial. It didn’t seem like they fell in love solely due to proximity, as Ying was closer to many other boys at the Guild.

Ying, however, was a challenging protagonist for me. I often found her clumsiness off-putting, especially when she literally fell into her love interest's arms. Her overwhelming emotions led her to wander into inappropriate spaces or fail to notice when someone entered the room, creating moments of unnecessary chaos that detracted from the narrative.",

It felt a bit too tame for the deep love that was implied, though this might fit the book’s target audience of teens.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s writing style wasn’t bad—it flowed and was easy to read. However, the wording and phrasing were unspectacular, sometimes formulaic, and lacked imagination. While it’s a YA book, that doesn’t mean the writing couldn’t have been more imaginative or lyrical.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was entertaining but nothing outstanding. I’m unsure if I’ll read the sequel, as it didn’t leave me eager for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 1/2 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Title and Expectations:**  \n  Despite the title, there are no actual dragons in this book. Additionally, there is very little focus on engineering, which was disappointing as I was excited for a fantasy book about a woman in STEM.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance felt underdeveloped. It wasn’t clear why the main character was so deeply attracted to the love interest, and their relationship came across as surface-level rather than deeply meaningful.\n\n- **Mystery/Revenge Plot:**  \n  The mystery and revenge aspect of the story was intriguing, but it often took a backseat to other elements like the school competition or the romance, which detracted from its impact.\n\n- **Pacing and Cohesion:**  \n  The three main threads of the story—romance, mystery/revenge, and the school competition—seemed to compete with each other rather than weave together cohesively. This lack of integration made the overall story feel disjointed and unsatisfying.\n\n- **Potential:**  \n  I could see the potential in this story, but it never fully realized that potential for me, leaving me wanting more depth and cohesion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had intriguing elements, such as the mystery/revenge plot and the premise of a woman in STEM, it fell short in execution. The romance felt underdeveloped, and the competing storylines lacked cohesion, making the overall experience less satisfying than I had hoped.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The characters also come across as unbelievable, further diminishing the impact of the story.\n\n- **Plot and Character Dynamics:**  \n  While I appreciated the detail that the male character immediately recognized the protagonist wasn’t a man, this was the only aspect that stood out to me. Beyond this, there wasn’t much compelling me to continue reading or to care about where the story was headed.\n\n- **Overall Investment:**  \n  I wasn’t invested enough to finish the book and decided to stop reading at the 30% mark (DNF).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel struggles with tone, emotional engagement, and character believability, making it difficult to stay invested.

Ying’s motivation to join the engineer’s guild (to discover her father’s murderer) was clear initially, but it faded as the story progressed. Other characters, like Ye-yang and the boys Ying interacted with, felt underdeveloped and lacked meaningful background. They seemed to exist only to further Ying’s actions rather than having their own depth or purpose.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot, particularly the central mystery of Ying’s father’s murder, was overshadowed by other elements, such as Ying’s participation in the engineer’s guild’s classes and trials. There was little indication of Ying actively trying to solve the murder until information was conveniently presented to her. The plot felt disjointed, with multiple threads (like the ongoing war) that were introduced but never fully explored or connected in a meaningful way.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was lacking, leaving the setting and context underdeveloped. The war, for example, was mentioned but not explained in detail, making it feel disconnected from the main story. The absence of a cohesive and immersive world made it difficult for the plot and characters to feel grounded.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing itself was not bad, though it leaned toward being overly explanatory and felt somewhat young in tone.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n  The novel is a fantasy adventure set in an Asian-inspired, steampunk aesthetic world. It leans heavily into the YA fantasy genre with a sprinkling of romance subplot.  \n\n- **Main Character and Motivation:**  \n  The protagonist is Mulan-coded and passionate about following her father's footsteps to become a great engineer and join the Engineers Guild.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is light, and while the story maintains a fast pace, I found myself wanting to learn more about the lush world the author created.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I felt the characters lacked layers and depth, which prevented me from becoming attached to them.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I liked the book but didn’t fall in love with it. It’s a good choice for readers who enjoy YA fantasy adventures and are looking for an easy story to dive into.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Of Jade and Dragons* is a vibrant YA fantasy adventure with a unique setting and a fast-paced plot. While I enjoyed it, I wished for more depth in the characters and worldbuilding. It’s a solid read for fans of the genre seeking an engaging, light story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

I considered giving it an extra star in response to the racist reviews I saw, but ultimately chose to stay true to my honest rating.

I’ve been spoiled by other books with more in-depth approaches to science or whimsical mechanics, and I would have loved to see more of that here.  \n\n- **Creativity and Whimsy:**  \n  - The creations weren’t as whimsical as I expected. While the winged glider in Chapter One had me fawning over it, the rest of the creations didn’t quite capture the same level of imagination.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The characters were fun and memorable. Ye-Kan, in particular, stood out to me—Ye-Kan 4 life!  \n\n- **Imaginative Scenes:**  \n  - Some parts of the book were incredibly imaginative and had my mind doing flips. These moments were truly amazing.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  - The worldbuilding was delivered on a need-to-know basis. Important details that would have been helpful early on weren’t explained until over 300 pages into the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book.

The love interest's divided loyalties as a potential future ruler introduce unnecessary complexity without any meaningful development. While the conclusion allows the story to stand alone, it feels abrupt and leaves unresolved questions about character growth and the repercussions of their actions. Despite the book's visual appeal, inconsistencies in the narrative and character decisions hinder full engagement with the plot. For instance, the teacher’s provision of lethal materials for a weapon lacks justification, undermining the story’s credibility.

The cover showed a beautiful fantasy world filled with dragons, magic, and Chinese culture. The blurb promised an interesting plot, and the praise for it made it out to be an incredibly detailed book. Unfortunately, it fell far short of my expectations.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was bland and plain boring. There was a lack of detail in the world-building beyond the names of places and their positions in the hierarchy. I didn’t get a sense of what the protagonist’s home looked like, where she went (Fei, I think?), or even the Engineers Guild. The descriptions were superficial, focusing more on trivial details like the love interest’s grey eyes rather than creating a vivid, immersive world.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was hard to follow, and the ending was confusing. For instance, the High Commander being an Aogiya was never explained, leaving me to wonder if I was supposed to just know what that meant. The protagonist’s actions, like her dig at the High Commander with the cannon, didn’t make sense since she didn’t know he was aware of it until later. The time skips were jarring, with significant periods passing without clear transitions. Additionally, the assassin’s role felt pointless, and his actions, like sneaking into her room to open a suitcase, were unclear in their purpose.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The chemistry between Ye Yang and the protagonist was the only redeeming quality for the first 70% of the book. However, Ye Yang’s character changed drastically, and by the end, he became an overly ambitious and unlikable figure. The protagonist’s quick conclusions and actions, like her sudden hatred for the High Commander, felt rushed and poorly justified.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the major letdown, I’ll likely read the second book when it comes out because I can’t leave a series unfinished without knowing what happens next.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a major disappointment. The writing lacked depth, the plot was confusing, and the character development fell flat. While there were moments of potential, especially in the chemistry between the main characters, the overall execution left much to be desired.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.7 stars"

I was initially drawn in by the promise of a steampunk fantasy.\n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I found myself struggling to stay engaged. I often zoned out and lost track of the plot, which is never a good sign. I had to re-read pages because I wasn’t invested in what was happening.\n\n- **Execution of Themes (Engineering Aspect):**  \n  One of my biggest disappointments was that the engineering aspect, which I was so excited about, didn’t play as central a role in the story as I had hoped. I wanted to see more of Ying’s skills in action, more inventive uses of her engineering knowledge, and more challenges that put her abilities to the test. Instead, it felt like a background detail rather than a driving force in the plot.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters didn’t feel fully fleshed out, and I struggled to connect with them. The lack of character development made it hard to care about their fates or the outcome of their journeys.\n\n- **World-Building and Diversity:**  \n  While I appreciated the diversity in the cast and the world, the story felt flat. I kept waiting for that moment when everything would click into place, but it never quite happened.\n\n- **Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  I was left with a sense of disappointment, feeling like the book had all the right elements but didn’t know how to use them effectively. I wanted more—more excitement, more character development, more depth.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had so much potential but ultimately fell short for me.

            "The pacing of the story is uneven, primarily revolving around the romantic subplot, which detracts from other elements. While several characters are introduced, they remain underdeveloped, leaving me eager for more insight into their backgrounds. The political dynamics between territories are vague until the conclusion, and a crucial plot point that could shift the balance of power is quickly overlooked. Overall, the emphasis on the central love story, which lacks tension and feels predictable from early on, overshadows richer themes of political intrigue and character depth.",
            "In this story, the protagonist, Ying, grapples with conceptual thinking and lacks a broader awareness of injustice and oppression. Her emotional turmoil following her father's death overshadows any deeper exploration of her motivations or beliefs, resulting in a character that feels underdeveloped and less engaging. Additionally, the author's repetitive and problematic approach to character descriptions based on body type detracts from the narrative. One introduction, in particular, comes off as mean-spirited and is ill-suited for a young adult audience. By using physical appearance as a shorthand for character traits, the author produces a boring and reductive portrayal. While physical descriptions can contribute to characterization, the book's overemphasis on body type in introductions undermines the storytelling and feels unwarranted."

The political relationships between territories are unclear until the very end, and a significant plot point with the potential to alter the balance of power is abruptly forgotten within mere paragraphs. Overall, broader development of themes, characters, and places seems sacrificed in favor of the central love story, which lacks tension since the outcome feels predictable.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Ying, struggles with conceptual thinking and lacks a grander sense of injustice or oppression. Her emotional response to her father’s death overshadows any deeper exploration of her opinions or motivations. This limited perspective makes her character feel underdeveloped and less compelling.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The book’s approach to describing characters by their body types is repetitive and problematic. One character, in particular, receives a mean-spirited introduction that feels unsuitable for a YA audience. The author uses body type as a signifier for character traits, which is both boring and reductive. While physical descriptions can be relevant, the book’s structure positions body type as a central factor in introductions, which detracts from the storytelling and feels unnecessary.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The central love story is not always convincing and lacks tension, as the eventual pairing feels predictable from early on. This focus on romance overshadows other potentially rich aspects of the narrative, such as political intrigue and character depth.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has an intriguing premise—an engineer scheming in the heart of the Jade Empire—its execution falls short due to odd pacing, underdeveloped characters, and an overemphasis on a predictable romantic subplot.

Many of these are written by authors with East Asian heritage, which I hope encourages readers to explore the culture and history. This book, *Of Jade and Dragons*, is clearly inspired by C-dramas, which I enjoy, but it fell short of its potential in delivering a compelling narrative.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The premise is intriguing: Aihui Ying, an 18-year-old girl passionate about engineering, witnesses her father’s murder and uncovers secrets from his past. Disguising herself as her brother, she infiltrates the Engineers' Guild to seek the truth, encountering a prince, palace politics, and intrigue along the way. However, the storyline feels stereotypical, reminiscent of many C-dramas where a rebellious daughter disguises herself as a boy and embarks on a quest. The integration of silkpunk elements—Asian-based fantasy with advanced technology—could have been fascinating, but it wasn’t fully realized.  \n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**  \n  The characters, including the heroine, feel underdeveloped. Aihui Ying is supposed to be 18 but reads more like a 13-14-year-old, and the same applies to the overall complexity of the book. The relationships, including the romantic subplot, lack depth and believability. The villains are one-dimensional caricatures, and the motivations of the characters are shallow.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**  \n  The dialogue often feels out of place, with modern phrases like \"chauvinistic\" breaking the immersion in the historical fantasy setting. This makes the heroine seem like a modern teenager rather than a character from the intended era. The writing lacks the sophistication expected for a YA audience, leaning more toward middle-grade in tone and complexity.  \n\n- **Pacing and Predictability:**  \n  The plot is overly predictable, with too many conveniences that reduce tension and engagement. The story drags in places, losing its initial intrigue and momentum.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Of Jade and Dragons* had a promising premise and the potential to explore unique themes like silkpunk and engineering, it ultimately fell short due to underdeveloped characters, predictable plotlines, and dialogue that felt out of place.

Unfortunately, it just didn’t hit the mark for me.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story itself had potential. I liked the plot and its progression, and the setting was interesting. The overarching themes were present and engaging.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  My major disappointment was with the writing itself. The book was billed as YA, but it read extremely middle grade, which felt mismatched with the intended audience.  \n\n- **Character Development (Main Character):**  \n  The main character, Ying, was a significant issue for me. While she is supposedly 18 years old, her behavior often felt more like that of a preteen. This inconsistency made it hard to connect with her.  \n\n- **Character Logic and Consistency:**  \n  A specific example that stood out was Ying’s reaction to communal bathing. She sneaks off to bathe privately, not because she’s worried about being discovered as a girl, but because she doesn’t want to see “icky boy bodies.” This reasoning felt absurd, especially since she has several brothers and should logically be more concerned about maintaining her disguise. This misstep in character logic significantly impacted my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the plot and setting had promise, the writing style and inconsistent character development, particularly Ying’s illogical behavior, detracted from my overall experience. The book fell short of my expectations, especially given its beautiful presentation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book suffers from a lack of urgency, primarily due to Ying’s perspective. Her prolonged inaction and distraction from her main goal significantly slow the plot. While the political intrigue is engaging, Ying’s behavior undermines the story's momentum. The romance between Ying and Ye-yang feels forced and unconvincing; I struggled to understand his attraction to her, and their relationship lacks meaningful development. By the end, I found myself hoping they wouldn’t end up together.",
            "I found Ying to be a frustrating protagonist. Despite her initial goal of finding her father's murderer, she spends two months being largely unproductive—neither investigating nor studying. Instead, she engages in vague interactions with the beile and loses sight of her purpose. Her lack of subtlety and reckless decisions only made her less sympathetic. Additionally, the insta-love dynamic with Ye-yang felt unconvincing and poorly developed. \n\nHowever, I appreciated the supporting characters, particularly Ye-kan and Chang-en, who added depth to the story and were often more compelling than Ying. Their presence balanced Ying's shortcomings and kept me invested in the narrative."

Despite her initial goal of finding her father’s murderer, she spends two months doing almost nothing productive—neither investigating nor studying. Instead, she engages in vague interactions with the beile and fails to focus on her purpose. Her lack of subtlety and reckless actions later in the story only made her more annoying and hard to sympathize with. I also couldn’t understand the insta-love dynamic between her and Ye-yang, as it felt unconvincing and poorly developed.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book lacked a sense of urgency, which I attribute largely to being stuck in Ying’s perspective. Her prolonged inaction and lack of focus on her primary goal slowed the plot down significantly. While the political intrigue was engaging and kept me interested, Ying’s behavior often detracted from the story’s momentum.\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  I appreciated some of the supporting cast, particularly Ye-kan and Chang-en. They added depth to the story and were more compelling than the protagonist. Their presence helped balance out Ying’s shortcomings and kept me invested in the narrative.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The romance between Ying and Ye-yang felt forced and unconvincing. I couldn’t see what Ye-yang saw in Ying, and their relationship lacked meaningful development. By the end, I hoped they wouldn’t end up together.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t hate the book due to its intriguing political elements and strong supporting characters, Ying’s frustrating behavior and lack of focus made it difficult to fully enjoy the story.

I’m glad I did not DNF only to know for sure this read was not for me and it did not get better.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  This was written VERY young.

The relationship made little sense to me.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot’s original goal of revenge felt like it was never taken seriously. Why do the one thing you were asked not to do?

However, her cross-dressing to get into the guild felt unnecessary. The book is based on a society where women can't be in STEM, but it isn't really focused on gender equality. Instead, it’s more about the FL learning the mysteries of her father and his killer. I think the book would have been fine without the cross-dressing aspect and the \"only men\" in the guild rule. The ML figures out the FL pretty early, so the cross-dressing didn’t add anything to the story.\n\n- **Male Lead (ML):**  \n  The ML is a meh for me—not really my cup of tea. Based on other people's reviews, there's a second ML, which sets up for a potential love triangle. No thank you.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has an imaginative world and a likable FL, the unnecessary cross-dressing plotline and the unappealing ML (along with the potential love triangle) made it difficult for me to continue.

This is technically a school, and most schools, even if involved in wars, aren’t looking to kill their students (with exceptions like Basgiath War College).

Although the pace slowed down during the scenes at the Engineer’s Guild, it wasn't sufficient to enhance engagement with the story. The inciting incident—Ying witnessing her father’s murder—failed to evoke any emotional response due to the lack of character development. This hurried pacing diminished the impact of such a pivotal moment.",

For instance, she struggles to reconcile her sponsor’s behavior across different contexts, leading to inconsistent reactions—such as being repulsed by chest hair while finding her love interest’s lip-licking appealing. This lack of depth makes it difficult to empathize with her or care about her goals. Her interactions with other characters, especially her sponsor and roommates, are frustrating, as her exaggerated responses to her sponsor's aloofness and failure to grasp his motivations feel forced. Additionally, her recurring remarks about how \"gross\" boys are, aside from her love interest, come off as misandrist and body-shaming, ultimately leaving a negative impression.",

Her thought processes often felt immature and illogical, such as her inability to reconcile her sponsor’s behavior in different contexts. Her reactions, like being disgusted by chest hair but enamored by her love interest licking his lips, felt inconsistent and childish. Her lack of depth made it hard to root for her or care about her goals.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  Ying’s interactions with other characters, particularly her sponsor and roommates, were frustrating. Her overreaction to her sponsor’s aloof behavior and her inability to understand his motivations felt forced. The constant emphasis on how “gross” boys are, except for her love interest, came across as misandrist and body-shaming, leaving a poor impression.\n\n- **Plot and Inciting Incident:**  \n  The inciting incident—Ying’s father being killed in front of her—failed to evoke any emotional connection because the reader didn’t know the characters well enough. The rushed pacing further undermined the impact of this event.\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  Attempts at humor, such as Ying’s exaggerated disgust toward men, felt outdated and unfunny. The tone often veered into misandry, which was off-putting and detracted from the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel struggled with unpolished writing, inconsistent pacing, and a poorly developed protagonist. Ying’s superficiality, immature thought processes, and the misandrist tone made it difficult to engage with the story. While there were moments that could have been intriguing, the overall execution fell flat, leading to a decision to not finish the book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF’d at 25% (page 127)."

The worldbuilding was very barebones, and the fast pace seemed like an attempt to mask this issue.  \n\n- **Narrative Style (Show vs. Tell):**  \n  The book relies heavily on telling rather than showing. For example, the protagonist is described as an engineering prodigy, but we never actually see her skills in action. Instead, there’s a lot of inner dialogue like, “I’ve always been SOOO good at engineering,” which became annoying very quickly.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist’s development felt shallow.

The implied romance between Ye-Yang and the main character feels contrived and clichéd, particularly the overdone scene where he catches her after a trip—it's gratuitous and adds little to the narrative. Furthermore, the encounter with the chimera appears to be a clumsy attempt to introduce Ye-Yang into the story. As for the protagonist, I found her unlikeable; while there's nothing inherently wrong with a character lacking physical strength, her portrayal is unengaging. Her emotional immaturity and inability to control her anger are framed as “quirks,” but they come off as childish and frustrating instead.",

            "The main plot elements, including murder and war, were poorly developed, relying too heavily on deus ex machina moments and contradictory plot points, which detracted from the overall narrative. Ying, despite her lack of formal training and her focus on scheming rather than studying, inexplicably becomes the top student, creating a Mary Sue effect. The pacing was inconsistent, with the only enjoyable part being the ending, which ultimately frustrated me due to character inconsistencies. This undermined what could have been a redeeming conclusion to the story.",
            "The characters, particularly Ying, felt underdeveloped. Ying’s actions often lacked maturity and self-control, making her seem more like a child than a credible protagonist. Her grief over her father’s death appeared absent, as she quickly shifted her focus to revenge, which contradicted her father’s wishes. Additionally, the relationships between characters were shallow and lacked believability, further undermining the emotional core of the story.",
            "The world-building felt lacking, rendering the guild, its teachings, and the overall setting hollow. The narrative relied too heavily on exposition rather than demonstration, undermining the believability of the world and its systems.",
            "I was initially intrigued by the idea of an engineering guild apprenticeship, expecting it to echo the depth of *Babel* or *The Name of the Wind*. Unfortunately, the execution did not meet my expectations."

        "conclusion": "While the premise of the novel held promise, the execution fell flat due to underdeveloped characters, weak world-building, and a poorly executed plot. The reliance on contrivances and inconsistencies, along with an unsatisfying ending, made the book a disappointing read.",

However, the execution fell far short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, especially Ying, felt underdeveloped. Ying’s actions lacked maturity and self-control, often behaving like a small child rather than a believable protagonist. Her grief over her father’s death was nonexistent, as she immediately focused on revenge, acting in ways that contradicted her father’s wishes.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was insubstantial, leaving the guild, its teachings, and the broader setting feeling hollow. There was too much telling instead of showing, which made the world and its systems unconvincing.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The main plot points, such as murder and war, were poorly established. The story relied heavily on deus ex machina moments and plot contradictions, which detracted from the narrative. Despite Ying’s lack of formal training and her focus on scheming rather than studying, she inexplicably emerged as the star pupil, making her feel like a Mary Sue.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The pacing was uneven, with the only enjoyable section being the end. However, the ending itself was frustrating and inconsistent with how the characters should have acted, ultimately ruining what could have been a redeeming part of the book.  \n\n- **Relationships:**  \n  The relationships between characters were underdeveloped and lacked believability, further weakening the emotional core of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the novel held promise, the execution fell flat due to underdeveloped characters, weak world-building, and a poorly executed plot.
