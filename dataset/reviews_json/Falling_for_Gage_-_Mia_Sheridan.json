            "Gage embodies loyalty, love, and sweetness, dedicating his life to the happiness of others while suppressing his own dreams. His journey leads to a profound transformation, allowing him to embrace the person he was always meant to be. Rory represents passion, peace, and presence, grappling with the belief that love demands sacrifice. As she searches for her father and seeks to reconnect with her uncles, she learns that her father passed away without knowing her. However, she finds a new family that welcomes her with love and acceptance. \n\nWhile Gage and Rory's individual journeys are beautifully crafted, their love for each other is even more compelling. They uplift one another, fostering personal growth and acceptance of each other's flaws. The third-act breakup, which I typically dislike, adds authenticity to the narrative, allowing them to develop individually before fully committing to one another.",

In contrast, Rory grew up on the other side of the lake in a very different environment. She works tirelessly to keep her family's business afloat, raised by a single mother and supported by loving uncles. Although she feels a strong connection to the water, her true calling has always been just out of reach.

Characters from *Archer’s Voice* and *Travis* are mentioned, so I would recommend reading those books first. However, I didn’t, and I still really enjoyed this one.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  Rory and Gage’s story was relatable, and the characters were developed well. I really liked their journey, from their one-night stand to Rory showing up in Gage’s hometown. Their attraction was palpable, and I was rooting for them to get together throughout the book.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The small-town setting worked so well, and I loved how most of the characters were supportive of Rory finding her father.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook was done exceptionally well. The dual points of view were great, and I loved both narrators, Maeve York and Benjamin Sands. They brought Rory and Gage to life and made me feel all the emotions. I don’t think I’ve listened to anything they’ve narrated before, but I’ll be keeping an eye out for them in future audiobooks.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Writing Style:**  \n  I wasn’t expecting to love this book as much as I did, but it hit all my emotions. It had me smiling, laughing, and even crying at times. Sheridan definitely knows how to write contemporary romance set in a small town, and she’s an author I’ll definitely be reading more of.  \n\n- **Future Reading Plans:**  \n  Now that I’ve read *Falling for Gage*, I plan to go back and read *Archer’s Voice* and *Travis*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was my first book by Sheridan, and I loved it! The relatable characters, engaging story, and excellent audiobook narration made it a memorable read. Sheridan’s ability to evoke a range of emotions and her skill in crafting small-town romance have made me a fan of her work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While they can be read independently, they build on the characters, which enhances the overall experience.  \n\n- **Character Development (Gage):**  \n   - Gage is portrayed as an upstanding citizen and \"perfect\" in many ways, following in his father's footsteps and expanding the family business internationally. However, he feels unfulfilled, as this path isn't his dream. He longs for someone to share his life with, which adds depth to his character.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics (Gage and Rory):**  \n   - The chemistry between Gage and Rory is compelling. Rory, nicknamed \"Cakes,\" is described as beautiful, challenging, and different. Gage is immediately drawn to her, even declaring her off-limits to his friends. Their connection is tested by the fact that Gage is just passing through and plans to move overseas, while Rory is on her own journey to discover her father's identity.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The story combines romance with a slight mystery, as Rory embarks on a mission to find her father, which leads to her crossing paths with Gage again. The plot is engaging, with good friendships and the inclusion of characters from previous books, creating a sense of continuity and community.  \n\n- **Steamy Content:**  \n   - The book contains very steamy sex scenes, which may not be for everyone. However, there is a strong storyline throughout, so readers who prefer less steam can skip those scenes without losing the overall narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a strong addition to the series, earning a 4.5 ⭐ rating from me. It features well-developed characters, a compelling romance, and an engaging plot with a touch of mystery. The inclusion of characters from previous books adds depth, and while the steamy scenes are prominent, the story remains interesting even if they are skipped.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- This book: 4.5 ⭐  \n- Archer's Voice: 5 ⭐  \n- Travis: 4.5 ⭐"

It leaned more toward being a sweet, fun, small-town romance with elements like dogs and self-discovery.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I loved Gage and Rory as characters. Their dynamic was engaging and well-developed. Additionally, I found myself intrigued by secondary characters like Rory's uncles and Easton, who left me wanting to know more about their stories.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolved around searching for one's place in life, which added depth to the otherwise lighthearted tone. The inclusion of a small-town setting and a dog added charm and relatability.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable read that balanced sweetness with emotional moments. While it was lighter than other Mia Romances, it still delivered a heartfelt story with memorable characters. The potential for spin-off stories about secondary characters like Rory's uncles and Easton left me excited for more.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I wished for her father to be alive, the outcome still worked beautifully, giving Rory a wonderful new family.

Rory's business is inspiring; I would love to work for her!",

Gage was carefree and playful around Rory, which added a charming boyish quality to his character. However, I disliked Blakely. She came across as a pushover, selfishly informing their parents about their agreement without Gage's consent and then declaring their engagement without consulting him.

In contrast, Gage Buchanan initially disappointed me; I dislike when a main character feels burdened by family expectations and has to conform to societal norms regarding marriage. To me, that reflects a lack of willpower and authenticity. However, as the story unfolded, I found myself warming up to Gage. His humorous antics, especially the scene where he hilariously dashed around his parents' house in just a towel, added a delightful touch. The chemistry between Rory and Gage is palpable—intense and electric.",

It was a joy to return to Pelion Lake and see so many familiar faces.  \n\n- **Main Characters (MCs):**  \n  Rory and Gage’s story felt like a journey of passions versus obligations.

Their shared struggle makes them the perfect match, as they help each other realize they can be so much more if they choose to.  \n\n- **Story:**  \n  After a one-night stand neither can forget, Rory and Gage are brought back together to solve the mystery of Rory’s father’s identity and whereabouts. I loved how this plot device kept them in close proximity, giving them an excuse to spend time together while they tried to deny their growing feelings.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  I appreciated seeing more of Archer/Bree and Travis/Haven, as well as getting updates on their lives. It added depth to the story and made the world feel more connected.  \n\n- **Audio Narration:**  \n  Both narrators did a fantastic job bringing the characters to life. I usually struggle with audio-only versions of books, but I was completely captivated by this one.  \n\n- **Tropes and Topics:**  \n  The story includes several engaging tropes: one-night stand, instant connection, forbidden romance, different worlds, slow burn, small-town setting, and dual first-person POV.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful blend of romance and mystery, with well-developed characters and a captivating plot.

Despite their very different backgrounds and upbringings, they were perfect for each other. Their love story is both sweet and spicy.  \n- **Plot and Suspense:**  \n  Unlike another reader, I didn't find the plot point that they might be half-siblings concerning because I was sure this author wouldn't create this couple if they weren't going to have a happily ever after (HEA). I had read both of the previous books in the series (Archer's Voice and Travis), but it'd been so long since I reread Archer's Voice that I didn't guess the identity of Rory's father before the official reveal.  \n- **Series Context and Standalone Potential:**  \n  This is a good story that I definitely recommend! It could be read as a standalone, but it would be more meaningful and impactful if the previous books are read first.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGage and Rory's love story is a delightful blend of sweetness and spice, with well-developed characters and a plot that keeps you engaged. While it works as a standalone, reading the previous books in the series enhances the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I found *Archer’s Voice* too lovey-dovey and sad for my tastes (though I still gave it 4 stars), this book was a refreshing change.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Vibe:**  \n  This book is an absolute vibe! I loved the tone, the atmosphere, and how it kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Nicknames:**  \n  I adored the nicknames between the characters—they added a unique charm to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Elements (Mystery and Small-Town Romance):**  \n  The inclusion of mystery in the plot was a great touch, and I’m a huge fan of small-town romances, which this book delivered beautifully.  \n\n- **Interpersonal Relationships:**  \n  While the interpersonal relationships were good, I felt they had the potential to be spectacular. They were enjoyable but could have been more deeply developed.  \n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  Maeve York and Benjamin Sands did an amazing job with the audiobook narration—their performances truly brought the story to life.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Disclosure:**  \n  Thanks to Dreamscape Media for providing the ALC (audiobook listening copy) and finished review copy. All opinions expressed are my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful read (or listen) that stood out for its unique vibe, charming character dynamics, and engaging small-town romance with a hint of mystery.

However, the buildup and depth their relationship gained as they spent more time together made me forget the initial rushed start.  \n  Gage’s character annoyed me a decent amount at times, and a lot of problems could’ve been solved quicker with better communication.  \n\n- **Cameos and Connections to Other Works:**  \n  I LOVED seeing further into Bree & Archer’s (from *Archer’s Voice*) and Haven & Travis’s (from *Travis*) lives. Aside from *Falling for Gage*, those two books have been my other real winners by Sheridan.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  I listened to the audiobook and really enjoyed the narrators. They truly added a lot to the story. Narrators can make or break an audiobook, and these two were definitely not a letdown.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Recommendation:**  \n  Thank you, NetGalley and Dreamscape Media, for the opportunity to read this ARC! I highly recommend reading this book after it comes out later this month, friends!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a cute and enjoyable read that delivered the sweet rom-com I was craving.

            "I completely fell in love with Gage. Initially, I expected this book to be mediocre, perhaps even less enjoyable than Travis, but I quickly became captivated, especially after a hilariously absurd scene. From that moment on, I didn’t want it to end. I loved Gage's journey of self-discovery as he pursued his passions while grappling with the desire to make his father proud. His struggles were relatable, and I found myself rooting for him to break free from the condescending people around him and be with Rory.\n\nRory was equally endearing as she sought her own place in the world and embarked on a quest to find her father. The connection to Travis and Archer’s town added a nice touch. I adored the scenes between Gage and Rory; his devotion to her was incredibly sweet. The author once again portrayed the male character caring for injured animals, which was so touching it made me scream with delight.",

At first, I thought this would just be a mediocre book that I’d like less than \"Travis,\" but slowly, I became captivated, especially after a scene that was so ridiculous and funny. From there, I didn’t want it to end. I loved the idea of Gage finding himself and pursuing what he loves and dreams of, despite his desire to make his father proud. There was so much room to relate to him, and I really wanted him to break free from all the condescending people around him and be with Rory.  \n  Rory was also sweet, as she was searching for her place and decided to find her father. The connection to Travis and Archer’s town was a nice touch.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  I adored the scenes between Gage and Rory. Gage simply worshipped her (and was completely addicted to her), which I found incredibly sweet. The author once again had the male character caring for injured animals, which made me scream—it was so touching.  \n\n- **World-Building and Continuity:**  \n  It was amazing to read about the previous couples and the families they built. The shared scenes were heartwarming, and the way everything came full circle was very satisfying.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Engagement:**  \n  These books are generally intriguing and captivating. This one gave me the urge to reread \"Archer’s Voice\" because I might have missed some of the enjoyment the first time around.  \n\n- **Desire for More:**  \n  How can we convince Ms. Sheridan to keep writing books about these couples? I wouldn’t mind reading more about them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was stunning, engaging, and left me wanting more.

The production and the narrators were great for these characters!  \n\n- **Character Connection and Development:**  \n  I enjoyed this story, particularly the connection between Rory and Gage, which was strong from the start. What began as a one-night stand turned into something deeper as they couldn’t get each other out of their minds. Fate brought them together again as Rory sought to discover her father’s identity.  \n\n- **Themes of Identity and Purpose:**  \n  I appreciated the juxtaposition of Rory’s journey to find her identity and her place in the world, while Gage thought he had everything planned out with his new job for his family. Both characters grew significantly—Gage realized he could follow his own dreams instead of the path laid out for him, and Rory learned she could pursue her own goals rather than just giving back to her uncles who raised her.  \n\n- **Found Family and Community:**  \n  I loved being back with the Hales and seeing both Archer’s and Travis’s families thriving. The sense of found family within their community was heartwarming and added depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a cute and enjoyable story with strong character development, meaningful themes, and a wonderful sense of community. The audio production enhanced the experience, making it a delightful listen.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐️"

While I could tolerate it, I don’t think it added much to the story.  \n   - There’s also some “other woman drama,” which I typically dislike, but it was forgivable here because Gage’s actions and intentions were transparent and likable.  \n\n- **Character Likability and Development:**  \n   - Gage is a very likable character and a “green flag” throughout the book.  \n   - My favorite moments were when Gage seemed to lose his composure over Rory, which added humor and charm to the story.  \n   - Rory’s arrival in town and Gage’s reactions were particularly enjoyable.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The book gives off cozy found family and small-town vibes, with an upper-crust twist.  \n   - The setting made me feel safe and confident that everything would turn out well.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - I listened to the audiobook and was overall satisfied, though I felt Gage’s narrator could have shown more emotion, especially when discussing Rory.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing and Storytelling:**  \n   - Mia Sheridan is a talented romance writer, and despite using less-liked tropes, she managed to create a well-rounded story.  \n   - I doubt this book will gain as much traction as *Archer’s Voice*, but it was still an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a satisfying read with likable characters, a cozy small-town atmosphere, and a touch of humor. While it uses some unpopular tropes, Mia Sheridan’s storytelling makes them work. The book can be read as a standalone, but it might be more enjoyable after reading *Archer’s Voice* and *Travis*. The audiobook was decent, though the narration could have been more emotionally expressive.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

He always seemed like the bridesmaid, never the bride, but in his own story, he finally feels the urge to settle down, find a wife, and start a family. It was a joy to reconnect with the Hale gang and catch up with Archer, Bree, Travis, and Haven—there's just something about Archer that I can never get enough of. I adored Rory's uncles and would love to see either (or both) of them get their own books. Additionally, I hope Haven's brother Easton gets a story in the future.",

Rory pretends to be an art appraiser, while Gage struggles between his attraction to her and his duty to his family legacy.  \n  - The novel offers a refreshing change from Mia Sheridan's usual romance books, with plenty of hilarious moments that made me laugh at Rory and Gage's antics.  \n  - The book delivers instant attraction with a dash of mystery, making for an engaging experience.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - Rory and Gage's relationship feels like a cat-and-mouse chase, lacking honest conversations about their expectations.  \n  - Gage's existential crisis and strong sense of duty to his family are commendable, but his unclear intentions toward Rory are underwhelming.  \n  - The swoon factor didn’t happen for me until the very end, where Gage redeems himself.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  - The dual narration by Maeve York and Benjamin Sands is excellent, capturing the essence of the characters perfectly.  \n  - The audiobook provides a great listening experience, especially for fans of the series who enjoy glimpses of familiar characters like Archer and Bree.  \n\n- **Series Connection:**  \n  - If you’ve read the previous books in the series, you’ll appreciate the appearances of favorite couples and familiar characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is a delightful mix of instant attraction, humor, and mystery, though the relationship dynamics between Rory and Gage could have been more compelling.

            "The arranged marriage subplot with Blakely had the potential for greater angst and conflict. I would have liked to see Gage assert himself more and confront others directly. While Rory’s character arc was well-developed, Gage’s personal growth and resolution felt less pronounced.",
            "Gage and Rory are a perfect match, despite their differences, as they bring out the best in each other. Gage's internal struggle with his future and fear of disappointing his father adds depth to his character, while his willingness to enter a marriage of convenience showcases his selflessness. Rory's determination to uncover her father's identity and her ability to inspire Gage to pursue his dreams further enrich her character. I appreciated how their relationship evolved as they collaborated to solve the mystery, discovering their mutual affection along the way. The book strikes a great balance between plot and romance, keeping the story engaging without overshadowing its focus. Reuniting with Archer, Bree, Travis, and Haven was a delightful touch, as the Hale family has become a cherished part of the narrative. Rory's integration into the Hale family felt both meaningful and heartwarming.",

I still enjoyed it, but I felt a slight disconnection that I don’t usually experience with her books.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  It took me longer to read this book than usual because I just started grad school and have a lot going on. I think if I had read it more consistently and in a shorter timeframe, it would likely have been a 4-star read for me.  \n\n- **Interconnected Storylines:**  \n  I would recommend reading this book after *Archer’s Voice* and *Travis*, as it’s interconnected with those two. There are storyline elements and characters from those books that appear here, which was a fun surprise! It was great seeing familiar characters from her other works.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  While this is a romance novel, it also includes fun mystery elements that kept me guessing and trying to figure things out. The tropes in this book include right person/wrong time, mystery, found family, opposites attract, lots of dogs, one-night stand, and small-town vibes.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Quotes:**  \n  There were many cute moments and memorable quotes that stood out to me, which I really appreciated.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I listened to this book on audio, and the narration was excellent. I would highly recommend the audiobook if you choose to read it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book, but it didn’t captivate me as much as some of Mia Sheridan’s other works.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n  I really like Mia Sheridan as an author; I think she writes romance really well. Her writing is heartfelt and witty without being too cheesy or overdone.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved Rory and Gage’s characters and the banter between them throughout the story. The character development for both of them was written well, and the author does a great job at conveying internal struggles, such as the tension between wanting to please those around you while also choosing to live for yourself.  \n\n- **World-Building and Crossover Elements:**  \n  The story takes place in Calliope/Pelion, the same setting as *Archer’s Voice*. If you’ve read *Archer’s Voice*, you’ll see some of the other characters mentioned and involved in this new storyline, which I enjoyed. The crossover between their stories added depth and familiarity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements and Tropes:**  \n  This book has some spice, but not a ton, and it’s not overly detailed, so it doesn’t distract from the main story. It includes tropes like “the new girl in town,” found family, friends to lovers, and the tension between family expectations and what the male main character (MMC) actually wants.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I’d definitely recommend this book if you’re looking for a cozy small-town romance. It was fun, heartfelt, and engaging, with a perfect balance of emotional depth and lighthearted moments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by Mia Sheridan is a delightful small-town romance with well-developed characters, witty banter, and a heartfelt storyline. The crossover elements from *Archer’s Voice* add an extra layer of enjoyment for fans of the author’s previous work. It’s a cozy, engaging read that balances emotional depth with lighthearted moments, making it a great recommendation for romance lovers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I recommend reading *Archer's Voice* and *Travis* first, as the characters from those books are intertwined with this story.\n\n- **Story and Character Development:**  \n  I liked the story and how it was built, particularly the dual points of view (POVs). The characters and their development were well-crafted, and I enjoyed how everything unfolded.\n\n- **Narration Quality:**  \n  Maeve York and Benjamin Sands did a perfect job narrating the story. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the audiobook.\n\n- **Author and Future Works:**  \n  I’m excited to read Mia Sheridan’s future books and see where her storytelling takes me next.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley, Mia Sheridan, and Dreamscape Media for providing me with the audiobook for review.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this installment to be a well-developed and engaging story, enhanced by excellent narration. While it can stand alone, reading the previous books in the series adds depth to the experience. I look forward to more from Mia Sheridan.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

His inner dialogue had me laughing out loud at times because it was so insane and perfectly suited to his character.

Rory's search revolves around a small painting, which leads her to Calliope under the pretense of being an art appraiser.

            "Rory and Gage's chance encounter at her bar leads to a one-night stand that sets off a chain of events. Rory uncovers details about her enigmatic father, prompting her to visit his hometown while posing as an art dealer. The narrative primarily focuses on unraveling the mystery of Rory's father. However, a semi-spoiler reveals that Gage's father is a suspect in this mystery, creating an uncomfortable tension over the possibility of Rory and Gage being half-siblings. This subplot feels prolonged and detracts from the overall pacing of the story.",

Archer and Bree’s role in the ending was particularly moving, and as a fan of *Archer’s Voice*, getting even small glimpses of them left me in shambles.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The storyline was fun and engaging, especially with the art element woven throughout. I was both entertained and invested the entire time.  \n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  I loved the little cameos from past couples in the series, which added a layer of nostalgia and connection to the broader story universe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The combination of a vivid setting, well-developed characters, emotional depth, and a fun, engaging plot made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n10/10 for Gage’s character and the overall emotional impact of the story."

Their initial attraction sparks a one-night stand, but their lives intertwine again when Rory visits Gage's hometown, Calliope, to uncover the truth about her father while posing as an art appraiser.

In contrast, Rory was a more compelling character, but Gage's stagnation overshadowed her potential.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  - The \"they could be siblings\" storyline was problematic and felt unnecessary. It reminded me of Cassandra Clare's City of Bones series and the parabatai lore, which made it feel derivative and uncomfortable.  \n  - The B plot about the protagonist finding her father had some odd moments, particularly her decision to pretend to be someone else instead of simply asking around. This choice felt contrived and didn't make much sense to me.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - The main couple, Rory and Gage, had their moments and were cute together, but their relationship didn't fully captivate me.  \n  - I enjoyed the Hale moments more, mainly because I recognized the characters from previous reads, which added a layer of familiarity and nostalgia.  \n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n  - The sibling fake-outs were overdone and frustrating. This trope has been overused, and it significantly dragged the book down for me.  \n  - Some smaller elements of the story fell flat, making the overall execution feel uneven.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments, particularly with the Hale characters and the occasional charm of Rory and Gage, the problematic sibling storyline and the contrived B plot detracted from my enjoyment.

The chemistry between Gage and Rory was palpable, making their emotional navigation while awaiting DNA test results enjoyable.

Rory, in particular, stood out as a great character with a cute name.  \n  - Gage was an intriguing character, but his lack of quick action was frustrating at times.  \n  - The side characters added humor and wit, making the story more enjoyable.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The book was funny and witty, with plenty of \"stories and tea\" that added depth to the narrative.  \n  - The spice in the book was unexpected and came out of nowhere, which was a surprising but enjoyable element.  \n\n- **Connection to Other Works:**  \n  - I would recommend this book to anyone who has read *Archer's Voice*, as it feels like a cute and complementary addition to that story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had a great mix of mystery, romance, and humor, with well-developed characters and an engaging plot twist.

            "The plot's central conflict—discovering a potential familial connection after an unforgettable one-night stand—creates compelling stakes. The taboo nature of their situation adds thrilling tension as the characters grapple with their feelings while awaiting test results. This dramatic struggle heightens the suspense, even if it feels a bit naughty to root for them. However, Gage's relationship with his parents and his decision to move to London resolve too easily; a single honest conversation leads to their full support of his restaurant dream and relationship with Rory, rendering earlier conflicts unnecessary. Similarly, Rory's motivation to help her uncle escape their small town stems from a misunderstanding, which feels like a weak resolution to her main conflict. Much of the plot is predictable, especially towards the end. While the crossover with familiar characters is a nice touch, it feels somewhat forced for continuity's sake. Although charming, it seems like an attempt to capitalize on the success of *Archer’s Voice*, and I hope the author explores new stories beyond Pelion and Calliope for now.",

The intensity of their physical pull to each other was portrayed well, and I felt pretty invested for the most part.  \n\n- **Plot Obstacles and Tension:**  \n  The plot obstacle of finding out they could *potentially* be related after having the best one-night stand of their lives made for interesting high stakes. While uncomfortable, the taboo nature of their situation added thrilling tension, especially as they internally battled their feelings while awaiting the test results. It was a dramatic \"oh shittttt\" kind of struggle that heightened the tension, even if it felt naughty to root for them.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  The theme of passion vs. duty felt too on-the-nose and repetitive, with the importance of following your dreams being hammered in ad nauseum. It often came across as in-your-face rather than natural or relatable.  \n\n- **Conflict Resolution:**  \n  Gage’s relationship with his parents and the resolution of his need to move to London felt too easy. All it took was one honest conversation for his parents to fully support his restaurant dream and his relationship with Rory, which made the earlier stress seem unnecessary. Similarly, Rory’s key drive—wanting to give her Uncle the freedom to leave their small town—was based on a misunderstanding, which felt like a cheap resolution to one of her main conflicts.  \n\n- **Predictability and Series Continuity:**  \n  Most of the plot was predictable, especially towards the end. The crossover with the Hales and Archer’s Voice characters was a welcome pivot, but it felt slightly forced for the sake of series continuity. While it was cute, it seemed like an attempt to capitalize off the success of *Archer’s Voice*, and I hope the author moves on from Pelion and Calliope stories for now.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had strong character dynamics and tension, but the themes and messaging felt overdone, and the conflict resolutions were too convenient.

Her growth throughout the story was well-executed.  \n  - Gage, on the other hand, felt somewhat dull. His slow approach to pursuing love and his dreams was frustrating, though his moments of impulsiveness (like running his car into a fire hydrant) added some charm.  \n  - The undeniable chemistry and tension between Rory and Gage were palpable, making their love story intriguing.  \n  - The side characters, such as Romeo, Cassius, Lexi, and Faith, were enjoyable. Romeo, in particular, stood out as a caring uncle, and I hope to see more of his story in the future.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing had a delightful wit and engaging style that completely absorbed me.  \n  - The epilogue was a favorite, as it was adorable and tied the story together beautifully.  \n\n- **Series Connection:**  \n  - I might have missed some references due to not having read Mia Sheridan’s other books, *Archer’s Voice* and *Travis*, which are linked to *Falling for Gage*. However, I plan to catch up on those soon.  \n  - The book works well as a standalone, but reading the first two books in the series would likely enhance the experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Falling for Gage* is a solid read that beautifully captures the theme of searching for what’s missing in life, intertwined with a compelling romance.

Rory's internal dialogue, questioning, \"Who cares! We've already crossed the line. How would two times be worse than once?

While there are characters from the previous books, I don’t think you need to read the others to enjoy this one. It works fine as a standalone.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I enjoyed Sheridan’s writing style. It’s good, and I plan on reading more of her books, including Travis’s story.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The story itself was decent, but I found myself more invested in the mystery of Rory’s paternal parentage than the romance between her and Gage. The plot felt too easily solved, with everything conveniently working out perfectly. It lacked unique flairs and felt like a very already-done story.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  I didn’t care for Gage or their love story. This was the quickest insta-love I’ve read in a while, and I’m personally not a fan of that. I would have preferred a slow burn over the instant, lust-filled connection. The short plotline of them possibly being related was a huge ick, especially since they were still lusting hard for each other.  \n\n- **Character Connection:**  \n  I had no connection with the characters. I found myself not caring for them and not really liking them, which made the story just an okay read for me.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I think *Archer’s Voice* was a better book than this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a decent but unremarkable read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  - The story begins with Gage and his friends getting stuck in a small town due to car problems. They end up at a local pub where Gage meets Rory, the waitress, and they share a one-night stand. Weeks later, Rory reappears in Gage’s hometown under the guise of being an art appraiser, but her real mission is to uncover her mysterious past. Gage recognizes her and decides to help her instead of exposing her.  \n  - While I enjoyed the overall plot, I wasn’t a fan of a couple of storylines, particularly the one involving Blakely. There’s another storyline I didn’t like, but I won’t mention it to avoid spoilers.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - Rory and Gage have a lot of cute moments together, and their chemistry is a highlight of the book. I especially loved the scenes involving the dogs and Gage’s humorous mishap of running his car into a fire hydrant.  \n  - The epilogue was one of my favorite parts, as it was super cute and tied things together nicely.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  - The book is a fast-paced romance with a mysterious twist. It leans more toward sweet than spicy, which I found enjoyable.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  - This was my first audiobook narrated by Maeve York and Benjamin Sands, and I thought they worked well together. Their performances added to my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite some issues with certain storylines, I did enjoy the book overall. It was engaging and had plenty of charming moments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a sweet and mysterious romance with a fast-paced plot and endearing characters. While a couple of storylines didn’t resonate with me, the chemistry between Rory and Gage, along with the humor and charm, made it an enjoyable read. The epilogue was a standout, and the audiobook narration was a great addition.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)  \n\n**THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU IF:**  \nYou like mysterious, fast-paced romances that are more sweet than spicy."

            "This romance novel features several plot twists, which may not be typical for the genre. The sibling subplot was particularly strange; while it added intrigue, I found it uncomfortable to read their thoughts about each other while they were unaware of their potential connection. A later revelation about their relationship would have created a more impactful shock and alleviated some of the awkwardness. Like many romance novels, this one drags around the 200-page mark, with some tedious moments, especially during discussions about business and future plans. I believe the story could benefit from being more concise by eliminating filler content. Overall, I enjoyed the read but wished for a more direct approach to the plot.",

Additionally, the mystery-solving subplot and excessive details about secondary characters detracted from the main story, resulting in uneven pacing. Dramatic moments, such as Rory’s uncles arriving at the party and Cage’s delayed realization of his feelings, came off as over-the-top and poorly executed. The overwhelming drama in such a short span felt unrealistic. Furthermore, the characters' lack of proactive efforts to fight for their love was disappointing; Cage’s passivity and Rory’s indecision made it difficult to root for their relationship.",

The timing and execution of this scene come across as overly contrived and melodramatic.",

However, the introduction of a potential blood-related sibling dynamic felt uncomfortable and out of place in a story that wasn't intended as a dark romance. The romantic tension between Rory and Cage lacked emotional depth and intensity, making their inner thoughts about wanting each other come across as awkward rather than compelling.",

However, this book strays from her usual tone by incorporating a mystery thriller element that didn't meet my expectations. The attempt to blend forbidden romance with a thriller resulted in an inconsistent tone, where the soft, sweet moments clashed with the darker, more dramatic aspects. As a result, the emotional and romantic scenes felt lacking."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Genre Expectations and Tone:**\n   - I love Sheridan's writing style, especially her soft and sweet approach to romance. However, this book deviated from her usual style by introducing a mystery thriller element, which didn’t align with my expectations.\n   - The story attempted to blend forbidden romance with a mystery thriller, but the tone felt inconsistent. The soft, sweet style clashed with the darker, more dramatic elements, making the emotional and romantic moments fall flat.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot dragged unnecessarily, especially with the prolonged DNA test results. This delay felt contrived and frustrating, as it extended the tension without adding meaningful depth.\n   - The mystery-solving subplot and excessive details about secondary characters detracted from the main story, making the pacing feel uneven and tedious.\n\n- **Character Development and Decisions:**\n   - The characters, particularly Cage, came across as weak and indecisive. His thoughts about wishing Rory was his sister to justify ending their relationship felt unnatural and off-putting.\n   - Rory’s decision to confront Cage at his farewell party, only to second-guess herself, added unnecessary drama. The timing and execution of this scene felt overly contrived and melodramatic.\n\n- **Romantic Tropes and Themes:**\n   - I typically enjoy forbidden romance tropes, including step-siblings and step-parents, but the introduction of a potential blood-related sibling dynamic crossed a line for me. It felt uncomfortable and out of place in a story that wasn’t framed as a dark romance.\n   - The romantic tension between Rory and Cage lacked emotional depth and heat, especially given the circumstances. Their inner thoughts about wanting each other felt more awkward than compelling.\n\n- **Drama and Conflict Resolution:**\n   - The dramatic scenes, such as Rory’s uncles arriving at the party and Cage’s delayed realization of his feelings, felt over-the-top and poorly executed. The excessive drama in a short span of time was overwhelming and unrealistic.\n   - The lack of proactive efforts by the characters to fight for their love was disappointing. Cage’s passivity and Rory’s indecision made it hard to root for their relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I typically enjoy Sheridan’s work, this book fell short of my expectations. The inconsistent tone, dragged-out plot, and overly dramatic scenes made it difficult to connect with the story or characters. The forbidden romance element, which could have been compelling, felt uncomfortable and poorly executed. Ultimately, the book lacked the emotional depth and coherence I look for in a romance novel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "Gage, the town's golden boy, had the potential for a compelling love story, but his character ultimately fell flat. He lacked depth and came across as merely a \"perfect little rich boy feeling sad.\" Rory, the female lead, was equally uninspiring and clichéd. Her backstory—being poor, orphaned, and searching for her mystery father—felt unoriginal and unengaging. Both characters lacked distinct personalities, and their romance seemed purely physical rather than emotionally resonant. Their connection was minimal, consisting of only two meaningful conversations; the rest of their interactions were dominated by arguments, sex, or the unsettling question of whether they might be siblings. The suggestion of incest added an uncomfortable layer to their relationship, yet it did not deter them from pursuing their sexual fantasies.",

It’s incredibly beautiful, touching, and deep, with well-developed characters and romance.  \n   - *Falling for Gage* feels like a letdown compared to her usual profound, dark romance stories with sweet male main characters (MMCs) and intriguing mysteries.  \n   - I refuse to accept this book as part of the same universe as *Archer’s Voice*.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Gage had potential as the town’s golden boy who struggles to find real love, but his character fell flat. He lacked personality and depth, coming off as just a “perfect lil rich boy being sad.”  \n   - Rory, the female main character (FMC), was boring and cliché. Her backstory (poor, orphaned, family named after Shakespeare characters, searching for her mystery dad) felt unoriginal and uninteresting.  \n   - Both characters lacked personality, and their romance felt purely sexual rather than emotionally meaningful.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n   - The romance between Gage and Rory was nonexistent. They only had two meaningful conversations; the rest of their interactions were either arguments, sex, or wondering if they could be siblings.  \n   - The possibility of incest (they question if they’re blood-related after having sex) was bizarre and uncomfortable, yet it didn’t stop them from continuing their sexual fantasies.  \n\n- **Plot and Side Plot:**  \n   - The main plot lacked the darkness and depth I expect from Mia Sheridan. It felt like a generic, forgettable small-town romance.  \n   - The side plot involving Rory’s search for her father through her mother’s diary was unengaging and repetitive. I found myself uninterested and bored every time it was mentioned.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Originality:**  \n   - The book lacked the dark, profound themes and originality that make Mia Sheridan’s other works stand out.  \n   - It felt like a cliché, unoriginal small-town romance with no memorable elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Falling for Gage* was a disappointing read compared to Mia Sheridan’s previous works, particularly *Archer’s Voice*.

It felt slightly below average and easily forgettable.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I wouldn’t be quick to recommend this book unless someone loved *Archer’s Voice* and wanted more content involving distantly related characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sequel-adjacent novel was an okay read—entertaining but weighed down by cringe and cheesiness. It didn’t stand out enough to make a lasting impact, and I’d only recommend it to fans of *Archer’s Voice* seeking more from its universe.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5-3/5"

            "The first 70 pages are captivating, but the story loses its appeal once the characters arrive at Pelion Lake. It relies on clichéd tropes, such as the wealthy protagonist idealizing the working class, which comes off as unrealistic and uninspired. The ending is both predictable and unsatisfying, marred by unnecessary twists like Aurora’s lineage and her mother’s overly cryptic diary.",
            "The relationship between Aurora Casteel (the \"Sexy Poor Girl\") and Gage Buchanan (the \"Rich White Guy\") begins with potential but soon falls into shallow clichés. Gage embodies the typical wealthy character who romanticizes the simplicity of lower-class life, a portrayal that feels both disingenuous and overused. Meanwhile, Aurora lacks depth; her defining traits are primarily her looks and financial struggles, rendering her character unremarkable and one-dimensional.",
            "The writing lacks compelling romance and meaningful character interactions, resulting in a narrative that feels shallow and uninspired. This lack of depth makes it hard to stay engaged, while the intended humor and wit fall flat, ultimately contributing to the book's overall mediocrity.",
            "The romance between the main characters feels hollow, lacking a genuine emotional connection. Their relationship is based on superficial traits, such as wealth versus poverty, rather than meaningful compatibility or shared values. The intimate scenes are uninspired and do little to enhance the story's depth or excitement.",
            "The novel relies heavily on clichéd tropes, such as the rich-poor dynamic and the \"not like other girls\" stereotype for the female lead. It fails to bring anything new or innovative to the table, feeling more like a rehash of countless similar romance novels. The characters' aspirations and conflicts lack authenticity, making the story feel predictable and uninspired."

Despite a promising start, the novel quickly devolves into a shallow, cliché-ridden story with underdeveloped characters and an uninspired plot. The romance lacks depth, the writing fails to captivate, and the ending feels contrived and unsatisfying. Overall, the book misses the mark on nearly every front, making it a forgettable and unenjoyable read.",
