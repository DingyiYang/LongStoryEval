            "The story introduces Neferura, Kemet's most powerful priestess, and her formidable mother, Pharaoh Hatshepsut. Their world is destabilized by the emergence of Neferura’s half-brother, Thutmose, who schemes to accuse Hatshepsut of their father’s murder. The first third of the book is character-driven, effectively establishing the groundwork for later action, while the remainder shifts to a more plot-driven narrative. With themes of shifting alliances, espionage, murder, revenge, and intrigue, the story captivates. However, some revelations lack the desired intensity, and certain twists fall flat, diminishing their surprise impact.",
            "The characters are well-developed and engaging, with their backstories intricately revealed to enhance their motivations and actions. The dynamic between Neferura, Hatshepsut, and Thutmose is captivating, as alliances shift throughout the story. The emotional weight of the narrative is heightened by the sacrifice of one character for the truce between the others.",

Their world is threatened by the arrival of Neferura’s half-brother, Thutmose, who plots to accuse Hatshepsut of their father’s murder. The first third of the book is character-driven, building up to action, while the remaining part is more plot-driven. The story includes shifting alliances, spies, murders, revenge, and scheming, making it intriguing. However, some revelations lacked intensity, and the surprise factor fell flat in certain moments.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are richly imagined and interestingly presented. I enjoyed how their backstories were revealed, adding depth to their motivations and actions. The dynamic between Neferura, Hatshepsut, and Thutmose is compelling, with alliances shifting throughout the story. One character pays the price for the truce between the other two, adding emotional weight to the narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The story is woven with beautiful prose, which enhances the immersive experience. The author’s writing style is impressive and contributes significantly to the overall appeal of the novel.  \n\n- **Historical Imagination:**  \n  The story imagines a scenario where Neferura marries her half-brother, Thutmose, though there is no historical proof of this. This creative liberty adds an intriguing layer to the narrative, blending historical elements with imaginative storytelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Neferura* is a richly imagined novel with compelling characters, impressive prose, and an intriguing plot.

            "The pacing of the book is uneven, with a slow and tedious first half that contrasts starkly with the rushed latter sections, culminating in an abrupt ending. While the epilogue provides some resolution, better pacing could have enhanced the overall reading experience. The plot becomes increasingly engaging in the second half, filled with scheming, court politics, and intrigue. Neferura's character development and her eventual decision to take control of her life are particularly satisfying. However, some events strain believability, such as Thutmose’s unchallenged accusations against Hatshepsut and Senenmut’s sudden confession.",
            "The characters came across as two-dimensional and lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with or care about them. Consequently, a significant character's death near the end elicited minimal emotional response, which was disappointing.",
            "The writing is straightforward and lacks the atmospheric depth one would expect from a richly depicted historical setting like ancient Egypt. The prose feels overly simplified, more appropriate for a middle-grade or YA audience. Additionally, while the romance has potential, it ultimately falls short due to its lack of detail.",
            "This book is meticulously researched and historically accurate, with the author skillfully balancing respect for history and imaginative storytelling. Minor characters, such as Hathor and Senenmut, are thoughtfully inspired by historical evidence and excavations, adding depth to the narrative.",
            "This book is marketed as a fantasy, but it offers minimal magical or fantastical elements. Hathor's hinted magical powers are not fully developed, which may disappoint readers looking for a more magical exploration of ancient Egypt."

        "conclusion": "Despite its flaws, I enjoyed reading this book, particularly for its historical accuracy, female empowerment, and engaging court intrigue. However, the uneven pacing, weak characterization, and lack of atmospheric writing prevent it from being a standout read. I would recommend it as a light YA historical fiction novel, but readers should temper their expectations regarding fantasy elements and depth.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Historical Accuracy and Research:**  \n  The book is thoroughly researched and historically accurate. The author, Evans, did an excellent job of respecting history while filling in gaps with fiction. Some minor characters, like Hathor and Senenmut, were inspired by historical evidence and excavations, which added depth to the story.\n\n- **Female Relationships and Empowerment:**  \n  The book features uplifting female friendships, such as Neferura’s close bond with her handmaiden Iset and her priestesses Satiah and Nebtah. There’s no backstabbing or jealousy, and the portrayal of female power and well-written friendships is a highlight. Hathor’s network of female spies, known as the 'scorpions,' is particularly intriguing and empowering.\n\n- **Plot and Intrigue:**  \n  The plot is engaging, especially in the second half, with lots of scheming, court politics, and intrigue. Neferura’s growth and her eventual decision to take control of her life are satisfying. However, some events felt too easy or unrealistic, such as Thutmose’s accusations against Hatshepsut going unchallenged and Senenmut’s abrupt confession.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing is uneven. The first part of the book is slow and tedious, while the latter parts feel rushed, especially the abrupt ending. The epilogue helps, but better editing of the pacing could have improved the reading experience.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters felt two-dimensional and lacked depth, making it hard to relate to or care about them. A major character’s death towards the end elicited little emotional response, which was disappointing.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is simple and lacks atmosphere, which is surprising given the rich historical setting of ancient Egypt. The prose feels watered down and more suited to a middle-grade or YA audience. The romance, while having potential, fell flat with its lack of detail.\n\n- **Fantasy Elements:**  \n  The book is marketed as fantasy but contains very little magical or fantastical elements. Hathor’s hinted-at magical powers are never fully explored, which may disappoint readers expecting a magical take on ancient Egypt.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed reading this book, particularly for its historical accuracy, female empowerment, and engaging court intrigue. However, the uneven pacing, weak characterization, and lack of atmospheric writing prevent it from being a standout read. I would recommend it as a light YA historical fiction novel, but readers should temper their expectations regarding fantasy elements and depth.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded up)."

The author achieves a precarious balance between sharing history and telling a compelling story. I appreciated the deep dive into the life of a woman during this period, exploring her rights, setbacks, limitations, practices, and way of thinking. The story provided a fascinating comparison between ancient and modern women’s experiences, highlighting what we’ve lost or gained throughout history.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Neferura, the protagonist, held a unique position in history as the only child of two pharaohs. Her challenge was the lack of examples to follow in forging her own path to power. I loved witnessing her growth, bravery, and determination to create a new way of being powerful. Her struggles with her half-brother’s return and the resulting chaos were compelling, and I rooted for her as she navigated the challenges and pitfalls of her journey. The strong women in her inner circle added depth to her character and story.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel’s themes resonated deeply with me. I particularly appreciated the encouragement to make a difference and to take the road less traveled. These messages were woven seamlessly into Neferura’s journey, making her story both inspiring and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Writing Style and Engagement:**  \n  Evans’ writing style kept me thoroughly engaged.

The novel is a must-read for all historical fiction lovers, offering both entertainment and a deeper appreciation for Ancient Egypt’s contributions to modern society.\n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  As someone who has always been fascinated by Egypt and has traveled there twice, this novel deepened my connection to its history. I can’t wait to return and explore the historical records left by this family.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating blend of history and storytelling, offering a unique perspective on Ancient Egypt through the eyes of a remarkable woman.

Despite my love for Hatshepsut and my intrigue about her daughter Neferura's fate, the novel failed to captivate me. While I am open to alternate conclusions about historical figures, this story didn’t resonate with me.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I would suggest that the intended audience is teens or young adults. The novel did not meet the standard I expect from historical fiction aimed at adult readers, particularly those seeking something innovative or who have prior knowledge of the subject.\n\n- **Historical Perspective and Creativity:**  \n  I appreciate the author’s effort in tackling Neferura’s story and offering a creative explanation for her mysterious disappearance from history. However, this aspect alone wasn’t enough to fully engage me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s focus on Neferura and its creative approach to her historical disappearance are commendable, the overall execution failed to engage me as an adult reader with an interest in historical fiction. It seems better suited for a younger audience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot was slow and uneventful, failing to maintain my interest. The power struggle between Neferura and Thutmose felt one-sided, lacking tension and depth, which made the narrative flat. The second half dragged on, and despite my commitment to finish, I found it particularly tedious. The ending came abruptly and was unsatisfying; Neferura’s childbirth scene cuts away, and the epilogue reveals that she was secretly saved by the wise woman, with her death staged. This pivotal moment is omitted, leaving the resolution feeling unearned and dissatisfying after the buildup throughout the book.",
            "Character development was largely absent, resulting in many characters blending together by the end, making it hard to distinguish or care about them. Neferura, the protagonist, lacked significant growth or transformation, further diminishing the story's impact.",
            "The writing style leans heavily towards young adult (YA), characterized by simplistic dialogue and a superficial treatment of adult themes like sexual assault. This approach results in a tone that feels diluted and bland, suggesting the story is intended for a younger audience.",
            "While I’m reluctant to label this as historical fiction, as further research reveals little evidence supporting the actions of Neferura, daughter of Pharaoh Hatshepsut, depicted in the book. The narrative centers on a power struggle between Neferura and her half-brother, Thutmose, yet the historical accuracy feels dubious."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the novel’s research into Egyptian culture and mythology was impressive, the lack of a compelling plot, weak character development, and unsatisfying ending made it a disappointing read. The YA-style writing and superficial handling of serious themes further detracted from its potential. Overall, it wasn’t my cup of tea, and I found myself bored through much of the story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Research and Detail:**  \n  The novel is meticulously researched, offering a wealth of detail about Egyptian culture and mythology that I found educational and intriguing. However, this depth of information didn’t compensate for the lack of engaging plot development.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy:**  \n  I’m hesitant to fully categorize this as historical fiction because, upon further research, there’s no evidence that Neferura, the protagonist and daughter of Pharaoh Hatshepsut, actually did many of the things depicted in the book. The story revolves around a power struggle between Neferura and her half-brother, Thutmose, but the historical authenticity feels questionable.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot felt slow and uneventful, with not much happening to sustain my interest. The power struggle between Neferura and Thutmose was one-sided and lacked tension, making the narrative feel flat. The second half of the book was particularly boring, though I felt too committed to stop reading.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style felt very young adult (YA), with simplistic dialogue (e.g., “he said/she said”) and a lack of depth in handling adult themes, such as sexual assault (SA), which were only superficially addressed. The overall tone and execution made the story feel watered down and bland, as if it were aimed at a younger audience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Character development was virtually nonexistent. Many characters started to blend together by the end, making it difficult to distinguish or care about them. Neferura, as the protagonist, didn’t undergo significant growth or transformation, which added to the story’s lack of impact.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was abrupt and unsatisfying. Spoiler: Neferura’s childbirth scene fades to black, and the epilogue reveals she was secretly saved by the wise woman, with her death faked. However, this crucial moment is never shown or experienced, leaving the resolution feeling unfulfilling after the buildup of the rest of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s research into Egyptian culture and mythology was impressive, the lack of a compelling plot, weak character development, and unsatisfying ending made it a disappointing read. The YA-style writing and superficial handling of serious themes further detracted from its potential.

            "This novel is rich in politics, court intrigue, and clever scheming, which I found quite engaging. It centers on women empowering themselves within a patriarchal society, highlighting the importance of female friendships and alliances. While it includes elements of romance and some tragic events, none are too graphic or triggering.",

            "The author, an Egyptologist, skillfully depicts the life of Neferura, Hatshepsut's only child, despite the challenges posed by limited historical records. Although many characters are based on actual figures, fictional characters have been thoughtfully introduced to fill in the gaps. The narrative offers a less flattering portrayal of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, contrasting with their historically recognized era of peace and prosperity.",

Winning an advance copy in a Goodreads Giveaway was a delightful surprise. The book weaves together mythology and magical elements, yet I wouldn't classify it as fantasy. Rather, it stands as speculative historical fiction, narrated from Neferura’s perspective."

            "The story centers on the political conflict between Hatshepsut’s ambitions for Neferura to ascend as Pharaoh and Thutmose’s schemes to usurp power. The stakes are high, with tension mounting as Thutmose’s accusations and plots intensify. Neferura’s choice to enlist the aid of a tattooed wisewoman and her network of spies adds an intriguing dimension to the narrative. The resolution places Neferura in a powerful yet unconventional role, which I found both satisfying and thought-provoking.",
            "Neferura is a complex character—naïve yet determined, devout yet conflicted. Her relationship with her mother, Hatshepsut, is multifaceted, oscillating between prickly and caring, yet always challenging. In contrast, her half-brother Thutmose is a cruel and power-hungry antagonist, indifferent to the harm his ambitions cause. Neferura’s journey, as she evolves from being influenced by those around her to discovering her own voice, is both compelling and skillfully portrayed.",

            "Neferura is portrayed as a sheltered yet devoted daughter, adept at learning the art of espionage, though her decisions often come across as impulsive. Hatshepsut embodies the ideal queen and pharaoh: cold and calculating with a rarely seen vulnerability. Thutmose III, while despicable, illustrates the roots of his animosity towards his stepmother and half-sister, driven by an egotism and spoiled disposition that make him a volatile character. My favorite was the wise woman, whose duplicitous nature made her compelling. She acted decisively for the good of her group and nation, unhesitating to sacrifice royals and nobles when necessary.",

Historically, not much is known about Neferura, and I enjoyed Evans’ take on what could have happened, including a twist and addressing the idea of animosity between Hatshepsut and Thutmose III.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The plot was engaging and well thought out, with extensive research. However, I felt it was rushed in some places, possibly to progress the story and show tension. Some events could have lasted longer to make them more impactful.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Neferura’s character was portrayed as a sheltered but loyal daughter to her mother. While she’s a quick learner in the art of spying, her judgment at times felt rash and not well thought out.  \n  - Hatshepsut was depicted as the kind of queen and pharaoh she needed to be: cold and calculating, but with a vulnerable side she rarely showed.  \n  - Thutmose III was despicable, but his experiences shed light on his hatred for his stepmother and half-sister, though his egotism and spoiled nature made him a recipe for disaster.  \n  - The wise woman was my favorite character, with her duplicitous nature. She did what she thought was necessary for her group and nation, unafraid to throw royals and nobles under the bus.  \n\n- **Immersion and Appeal:**  \n  - I found myself immersed in Ancient Egyptian history and enjoyed the glimpse into what Hatshepsut might have been like as a ruler.  \n  - I would recommend this book to those interested in Ancient Egyptian history, women of the time, and historical fiction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I had a good time reading this book and appreciated the author’s effort to bring Neferura’s story to life.

While this could make the story feel academic, Evans skillfully balances historical accuracy with engaging storytelling, making the world of Ancient Egypt (or Kemet) both educational and entertaining.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Neferura, is the daughter of the famous pharaoh Hatshepsut. Although little is known about Neferura historically, Evans uses the available information to craft a captivating character. All characters, including minor ones, are well-developed with distinct personalities and backstories, making them feel real and relatable.  \n\n- **Historical Authenticity and World-Building:**  \n  Evans incorporates ancient Egyptian names and terms to reflect the time period, which I appreciated. She also uses modern terms sparingly to aid reader comprehension. The novel paints vivid pictures of ancient Egypt, from the opulence of the court to the intricate details of daily life, reigniting my childhood fascination with the era.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is intriguing and well-paced, making it hard to put down. There are several twists, most of which were unexpected, keeping me engaged throughout. The ending is satisfying, tying up most loose ends while leaving some aspects open for interpretation.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  I particularly enjoyed the exploration of how women wielded power in ancient Egypt, both overtly and subtly. The novel highlights the “quiet power” of women who influenced their communities without receiving recognition, prompting reflection on the uncredited contributions of women throughout history.  \n\n- **Author’s Note and Additional Context:**  \n  The author’s note provides valuable background information about Neferura and Hatshepsut’s reign, enhancing my understanding and appreciation of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNeferura by Malayna Evans is a masterful blend of historical fiction and feminist retelling, set in the richly depicted world of ancient Egypt. With its well-developed characters, engaging plot, and thoughtful exploration of women’s power, this novel is a must-read for fans of court intrigue, found family dynamics, and historical stories outside the typical Greek setting. I eagerly await more ancient Egyptian tales from Evans!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It’s not the central focus of the story, which I appreciate, as it doesn’t detract from the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Setting and Language:**  \n  The setting and language are exquisite, adding depth and beauty to the story.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I was initially nervous about the ending, but it turned out to be perfect.  \n\n- **Physical Edition:**  \n  I wish there was a stunning hardback version of the book, as I feel it deserves one.  \n\n- **Favorite Quotes:**  \n  “Oh, Ra, help me.” I drop to the floor. I intend to fall with finesse, but I have the grace of a hippo, so even my dramatic, fake faint is clumsy.”  \n  “No, dear one,” he whispers from the dark. “You’re not the child of my body. You’re far more than that. You’re the child of my heart.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterpiece that left me in awe. From the exquisite writing and setting to the empowering characters and tender romance, every aspect is beautifully crafted. It’s a must-read, and I highly recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned, but the tone suggests a perfect or near-perfect rating."

Set in Ancient Egypt, this novel offers a refreshing departure from the frequently explored retellings of Ancient Greece.

            "The characters are remarkably well-developed, steering clear of the extremes of villainy and unrealistic virtue often found in myth retellings. Neferura, in particular, shines as she evolves throughout the story, navigating her journey without embracing the cruelty or ruthlessness of her mother. Her growth is both compelling and relatable.",

While romance is present, it is well-balanced and never detracts from the core themes."

            "The story opens with a dramatic flair but lacks direction. There’s a need for deeper character development, particularly regarding Neferura’s role as the ceremonial wife. Additionally, the climax in the final chapter occurs off-page, leaving it feeling disjointed. Thutmose is portrayed as a villain, yet we don’t experience this directly, which diminishes the impact.",

The story breaks patriarchal norms in Ancient Egypt, and the atmosphere and setting felt authentic. I appreciated the extensive research and historical accuracy from the author.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  While the beginning was dramatic, it felt aimless. I wanted more in terms of character development and details about Neferura’s role as the ceremonial wife. The final chapter’s climax points happened slightly off-page, which felt disconnected. Thutmose was painted as a villain, but we didn’t get to see that firsthand.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The strongest and most interesting plots for me were Neferura’s friendship with Iset and the secretive network of women marked with scorpion tattoos. These relationships added depth and intrigue to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The book centers around themes of family, loyalty, political cunning, and the inequalities women have faced throughout history. These themes were well-explored and resonated strongly.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Although I didn’t connect deeply with the characters, the book was easy to follow, and the ending was gratifying. It skewed slightly YA but was still very enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel offers a compelling retelling of Neferura’s story with a strong feminist lens and rich historical context. While it could have benefited from more character development and a tighter narrative structure, the themes of loyalty, political intrigue, and women’s struggles were well-executed.

            "The plot is solid, though not groundbreaking, and its slower pacing didn't bother me. Told mostly from Neferura’s perspective in chronological order, the story is logical and easy to follow. However, the emotional impact of certain scenes felt diminished due to a noticeable distance between the narrative and the reader.",
            "Neferura is a well-crafted and relatable protagonist—intelligent yet naïve, with an optimistic view of others. She stands out as a complex female character, avoiding the clichés of the sassy sidekick or the emotionless killer. While the supporting characters are well-developed, they didn't engage me as much. The story includes uncomfortable themes of normalized incestuous thoughts, though these are portrayed as problematic within the narrative. The male love interest is likable, but the romance remains a minor element, serving more as a backdrop than a central focus.",
            "The writing style is engaging and captivating, even keeping me up at night. The author skillfully balances respect for Egyptian history with accessibility for modern readers. However, I would have preferred a greater emphasis on historically accurate language, as I selected this book specifically for its Egyptian context. Overall, the prose is beautiful and well-suited to the narrative.",
            "The author, an Egyptologist, clearly conveys their passion for Egyptian history and mythology in this reimagining of Neferura, a lesser-known historical figure, through a feminist lens. While the narrative includes deities, it avoids fantasy elements, instead portraying certain practices as magical due to the era's limited scientific understanding. The worldbuilding effectively incorporates Egyptian clothing, food, and daily life; however, I found the atmospheric details lacking. I craved more vivid descriptions of weather, scents, and immersive sensations, such as the relentless heat of the sun. As a result, while the world felt authentic, it remained somewhat distant, hindering full immersion."

Neferura, a lesser-known historical figure, is reimagined in a feminist light, allowing for creative storytelling. While deities are present, there are no fantasy elements, and certain practices are described as \"magic\" due to the limited scientific knowledge of the time.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Evans’ writing style is engaging and kept me hooked, even causing me to lose sleep. She balances respect for Egyptian history with accessibility for modern readers. However, I wished she had leaned more into historically accurate language, as I chose this book specifically for its Egyptian context. Overall, the writing is beautiful and fitting.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding features Egyptian clothing, food, and everyday items, but I found the atmospheric elements lacking. I wanted more descriptions of weather, scents, and immersive details, like the unrelenting heat of the sun. The world felt real but distant, preventing full immersion.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot is solid but not groundbreaking, with a slower pacing that I didn’t mind. The story is told chronologically from Neferura’s perspective for most of the book. However, the emotional impact of certain scenes was diminished by the perceived distance between the story and the reader. The plot is logical and easy to follow.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Neferura is a well-developed and relatable protagonist—intelligent yet naïve, with a desire to see the best in people. She stands out as a complex female character, unlike the overused tropes of \"sassy small girl\" or \"emotionless murderer.\" The supporting characters are fleshed out but didn’t capture my interest as much.\n\n- **Relationships:**  \n  The story includes normalized incestuous thoughts, which I found personally uncomfortable, though it’s depicted as problematic within the narrative. The male love interest is likable, but romance plays a minor role, serving as a background element rather than a central focus.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed *Neferura* and would recommend it to fans of Egyptian historical fiction.

Neferura’s growth and her motivations driven by duty and morality made her a relatable and inspiring character.\n\n- **Historical Authenticity:**  \n  The use of Egyptian names instead of modern equivalents added authenticity, immersing me in Neferura’s world. The inclusion of historical elements, such as the lingering influence of the Hyksos and the speculations surrounding Hatshepsut’s reign, was particularly intriguing.

Her interactions with her troupe of priestesses were particularly compelling.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was uneven, which detracted from my overall enjoyment. The first half of the novel felt excessively slow, causing moments of boredom and a lack of motivation to continue. Conversely, the latter half, especially the final chapters, was rushed, leading to confusion and a somewhat anti-climactic ending.  \n\n- **Characterization (Satiah):**  \n  Satiah’s character arc was problematic for me. While she is portrayed as beautiful, clever, and manipulative, her role in the story felt uncomfortable. The power imbalance between her and Neferura, combined with her use of her body and beauty as tools for espionage, undermined her agency. Despite her expressed consent, the dynamic felt exploitative, reducing Satiah to a plot device rather than a fully realized character.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing occasionally suffered from repetitive phrases, such as the frequent mention of sandals clacking on stone floors, which became distracting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel excels in its historical authenticity and Neferura’s characterization, it struggles with pacing and the portrayal of Satiah’s arc. The uneven narrative flow and repetitive writing detract from the story’s potential. Despite these issues, the book has moments of enjoyment and showcases the author’s deep knowledge of ancient Egypt.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars"

            "The story's pacing was uneven, with a slow first half followed by a rushed second half that often required me to backtrack to grasp the plot. Engaging elements like mystery and court intrigue were crammed into the latter part, leaving little space to appreciate them fully. Some plot twists, such as the Tutor’s survival and Neferura’s choice to fake her own death, felt predictable. Additionally, Neferura's transition to the leader of the Scorpions lacked conviction, as her intelligence and strategic thinking were not convincingly demonstrated throughout the book.",
            "The character development in the story was lacking, relying heavily on exposition instead of showing through actions. Neferura’s relationships, particularly with Isit, felt inconsistent and underdeveloped. Her initial dismissive attitude towards Isit rendered her subsequent emotional attachment unconvincing. Although Neferura’s intelligence is often stated, it is seldom demonstrated, which makes her appear unwise and slow to understand evident situations.",

        "conclusion": "While the book excels in its detailed depiction of Ancient Egyptian life, it falls short in pacing, character development, and plot execution. The uneven pacing and predictable twists detracted from the story’s potential, and the inconsistent treatment of religion left some aspects feeling underdeveloped.

Her early dismissive descriptions of Isit made her later emotional attachment feel unearned.  \n  - Neferura’s intelligence is frequently stated but rarely demonstrated through her actions, making her seem unwise and slow to grasp obvious situations.  \n\n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n  - Certain plot twists, such as the Tutor’s survival and Neferura’s decision to fake her own death, were predictable.  \n  - Neferura’s eventual role as the leader of the Scorpions felt unconvincing, given her lack of demonstrated intelligence and strategic thinking throughout the book.  \n\n- **Treatment of Religion and Belief:**  \n  - The portrayal of the gods and characters’ beliefs was inconsistent and sometimes jarring.  \n  - Neferura’s deep devotion to the gods contrasted sharply with Hapshetsut’s disregard for them, which felt out of place and underdeveloped.  \n  - The author missed an opportunity to explore how Hapshetsut could have used the gods to justify her rise to power, making her character’s motivations less clear.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excels in its detailed depiction of Ancient Egyptian life, it falls short in pacing, character development, and plot execution.

            "The novel's pacing is uneven, particularly in Part I and portions of Part II, which can feel like an info dump and may drag for some readers. While this didn't detract from my enjoyment as an ancient history enthusiast, it could be a drawback for others. Set during the Eighteenth Dynasty in Ancient Egypt, the story delves into political intrigue, corruption, and power struggles within the royal family. It follows Neferura, the daughter of Hatshepsut and Thutmose II, as she navigates the tension between her mother's pragmatism and her half-brother's ambition to rule. The narrative offers a feminist perspective on women's lives in Ancient Egypt, emphasizing the various forms of power they wielded and the significance of female relationships.",
            "The author vividly brings Neferura to life, transforming her from a figure overshadowed by her mother's legacy into a compelling character. Neferura's development is skillfully woven through significant events and her interactions with other strong female figures. However, Hatshepsut's characterization feels underutilized; given her historical significance as a powerful female ruler who rose from Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh and fostered an era of peace and prosperity, her potential remains unfulfilled.",
            "The author's expertise as a historian and passion for ancient history are evident throughout the novel. The rich historical details—such as the revitalized trade with Western Asia, Punt, and the Aegean Islands, along with Hatshepsut's architectural accomplishments—enhance the story's depth and authenticity."

        "conclusion": "*Neferura* by the author is a compelling piece of historical fiction that offers a feminist lens on Ancient Egypt. While the novel excels in its portrayal of Neferura and the exploration of female power, it falls short in fully utilizing Hatshepsut's rich historical potential.

The book would have benefited from additional material and a more cohesive storytelling style.

I didn't wish for more tragedy, but the conclusion lacked realism and ultimately left me feeling disappointed.",
            "Neferura starts as a naive and timid character, but her development is commendable, and by the end, I found myself truly loving her. However, I wished for more depth in her relationship with Kamut. While their love is evident, I wanted to witness its evolution rather than simply being told they loved each other. Understanding the reasons behind their feelings and the spark that ignited their romance would have made it more believable. Instead, the romance felt diluted, with awkward phrases like “he made love to me” interrupting the narrative flow.",
            "The dialogue occasionally comes across as juvenile, leading me to question whether the story truly fits within the YA genre. Additionally, some language choices, such as the use of \"literally,\" feel anachronistic and out of place in the context of ancient Egypt.",
            "I have a deep appreciation for mythological and historical retellings, and Madeline Miller's Greek novels are among the finest I've encountered. This is why *Neferura* immediately piqued my interest. Although I've long been fascinated by Egyptian culture, I had yet to read a story set in Egypt.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Theme Appeal:**  \n  I’m a sucker for a good mythological or historical retelling. Madeline Miller’s Greek retellings are some of the best novels to grace this planet, which is why *Neferura* caught my attention so easily. I’ve always been interested in Egyptian culture but had never read anything set in Egypt. I’m happy to say that I wasn’t completely disappointed and was quite pleased overall.  \n\n- **Pacing and Storytelling:**  \n  I found the pacing to be very inconsistent. Things either happened way too slowly or way too fast. The book could have benefitted from extra material and a steadier storytelling style.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Language:**  \n  The dialogue felt very juvenile at some points, making me question whether it was YA or not. The language itself felt out of place during certain moments—for example, the word “literally” was used in a sentence, which felt too modern for ancient Egypt.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Neferura began as a naive, timid shell of a character, but her development throughout was applaudable. By the end, I loved her. However, I wish she and Kamut had more time to develop their relationship. Their love for each other was obvious, but I wanted to see it unfold rather than being told they loved each other. I wanted to understand the why, the spark, and the reason for their love to make it believable. Instead, it felt like a watered-down romance with lines like “he made love to me” inserted awkwardly into a paragraph.  \n\n- **Feminist Themes and Female Relationships:**  \n  What I loved most about this story was the feminist aspect. Other than a few antagonistic female characters, the female friendships were beautiful and strong. I found myself attached to these friends as if they were my own and relished in their platonic love for each other. These bonds are very important in modern storytelling, and I’m happy that it’s become a genre of its own.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Although the ending was wrapped up well enough and gave us a happy glimpse at everyone’s lives, it felt very forced. I’m not saying I wanted anyone else to die or suffer, but the ending was less than realistic and therefore somewhat disappointing.  \n\n- **Research and Effort:**  \n  I don’t doubt the incredible amount of time and research it took to put together a novel of this caliber—that alone is astounding to me. However, I think the book could have benefitted from a little more time in development or the guidance of someone more experienced in writing fiction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Neferura* was an enjoyable read with strong feminist themes and beautiful female friendships. However, its inconsistent pacing, juvenile dialogue, underdeveloped romance, and forced ending detracted from my full enjoyment. Despite these flaws, the effort and research behind the novel are commendable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

It follows Neferura, the daughter of Hatshepsut, as she navigates the treacherous political landscape of her mother’s reign and contends with her half-brother Thutmose’s plots to usurp the throne.",
            "Neferura is a captivating protagonist—naive yet impactful, deeply attuned to the moral and spiritual struggles of those around her, especially her mother. Her choices are profoundly shaped by her belief in the afterlife and the weighing of hearts against a feather. Hatshepsut is depicted with nuance, highlighting both her achievements as a ruler and her shortcomings as a parent. In contrast, Kamut feels underdeveloped and lacks depth, making it difficult to engage with his role in the narrative.",
            "The writing often lacks vitality, and pacing issues occasionally make certain sections drag. Neferura's narration tends to be repetitive, suggesting the need for more meticulous editing. Additionally, the flashbacks and childhood stories of Neferura and Thutmose exacerbate the pacing problems. It may have been more effective to focus the first section of the book on their youth before progressing chronologically."

Thutmose III, in particular, resembled a cartoon villain, lacking vulnerability and depth, driven solely by cruelty and a thirst for power.

Evans did an excellent job explaining minute features of the ancient world, from wig-wearing and the foods they ate to the cultural hierarchy of Ancient Kemet. There were so many moments where I felt fully immersed in the story.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The secondary characters, such as Senemut, Kamut, Iset, Hathor, and Thuiu, were compelling and nuanced. They felt fully fleshed out, and I enjoyed reading about them until the very end. However, the royal characters—Neferura, Thutmose III, and Queen Hapshepsut—often felt a bit over the top. Thutmose III, in particular, came across as a cartoon villain, driven solely by cruelty and power without much vulnerability or depth. Neferura, while initially pompous and stubborn, showed growth by the middle and end of the book, taking more agency in her life, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was well-established, with moments of calm that allowed me to catch my breath before being swept into the next conflict. This balance kept the story engaging without feeling overwhelming.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The central plot, revolving around a chilling secret about the death of Neferura’s father, was intriguing. It added tension and stakes to the story, making Neferura’s journey to uncover the truth both compelling and impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The rich worldbuilding, nuanced secondary characters, and well-paced plot made it a captivating read. While some of the royal characters felt exaggerated, Neferura’s growth and the immersive setting more than made up for it.

Although the portrayal of Neferura is largely a product of the author's imagination, it is skillfully balanced with a rich sense of place and an impressive depth of knowledge about the setting and time period, thanks to the author's background in Egyptology.",

While at first, I made the erroneous connection to the similarly named Nefertiti, a glance at the blurb and some Googling about the different pharaohs showed me how wrong I was, with Neferura being the daughter of Hatshepsut.  \n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**  \n  Neferura as a character is well-drawn, and I like how Evans imagines her as she navigates finding her place in the world as the daughter of two pharaohs and sister to another. She has no real role models, no one who has traversed the path in the same way as she does, so she’s forced to make it more or less on her own. She also doesn’t make the wisest decisions as a result, being rather naive, but she’s fairly easy to sympathize with, given the struggles she deals with throughout.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and World-Building:**  \n  While Neferura herself has largely been overshadowed by her legendary mother, the struggle to get out of her massive shadow makes for a solid driving force for the book itself, even if the Neferura of the book is largely a product of Malayna Evans’ imagination. This is well-balanced with a great sense of place and a wealth of knowledge of the setting and time period, due to Evans’ background in Egyptology.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  I really enjoyed seeing the roles of strong women in this society. While Neferura doesn’t have the easiest relationship with her mother, Hatshepsut is still recognized as the powerful pharaoh she is. I also really enjoyed Neferura’s bond with some of the other women in the story, like Satiah, especially in how that allows for nuances in female sexuality.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  This was an enjoyable read, and I’ll definitely keep an eye out for more books from Malayna Evans. I recommend this book if you’re interested in historical fiction about Ancient Egypt.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers a compelling exploration of Neferura’s life, blending imaginative storytelling with rich historical detail. The strong character development, nuanced relationships, and focus on powerful women in Ancient Egypt make it a standout read in the historical fiction genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While Neferura is depicted as clever and brave, utilizing her priestly estate to aid the poor and orphans, these actions are rarely shown in practice. Her romance with a lifelong love feels underdeveloped; we hear about their devotion rather than witnessing it.

The conclusion of Part I hints at her transformation into a more assertive and cunning protagonist, signaling her adaptation to the political landscape. However, in Part II, she fails to fully realize this potential. Although there are brief moments of growth, she never becomes a truly shrewd player, and by the time she does begin to navigate the complexities of her situation, it feels a bit too late.",

Given her sheltered upbringing, she is understandably naive and prone to making mistakes. The end of Part I signals a turning point, suggesting a shift toward a more assertive and manipulative Neferura as she adapts to the political game for survival. However, in Part II, she never fully lives up to that potential. While there are glimpses of her growth, she doesn’t become a particularly crafty player, and when she finally does, it feels a little too late.\n\n- **Portrayal of Hatshepsut:**  \n  Hatshepsut doesn’t play as big of a role as expected for such a larger-than-life figure, likely to avoid overshadowing her daughter. However, whenever she appears, Evans compellingly portrays her ruthlessness. The frequent references to Hatshepsut’s competence in rising to power and maintaining her station made me almost wish the book was about her instead.

Even though Neferura is a bit of a mystery to historians, Evans clearly did exhaustive research. The book illuminates how women lived during this period, their rights and societal expectations, how they ruled and tried to prevent attacks against their rule, and how they came together to lend support and friendship to one another.\n\n- **World-Building and Character Development:**  \n  There is a good deal of world-building and character development in the first third or so of the book. Neferura's character arc was well done. As the daughter of two Pharaohs, she is intelligent but a bit naive. However, it was satisfying to see her growth and strength as she faced all of the politics, manipulations, intrigues, and scheming.\n\n- **Feminist Themes and Female Characters:**  \n  This was well-written, with fantastic female characters and feminist themes.

The societal context, where women married young due to shorter lifespans, further reinforces this YA feel. Neferura’s limited autonomy and her mother’s control over her life also contribute to this perception.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Neferura’s journey is more about her personal growth and coming into her own rather than grand, kingdom-altering actions. This focus on self-discovery and limited agency felt more characteristic of a YA protagonist.\n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The story explores themes of female friendships, the Egyptian pantheon, and a feminist perspective.

While the suspense is minimal, the narrative remains engaging and enjoyable. The ending is satisfying, though Hathor's swift acceptance of Neferura as her successor feels somewhat implausible. Neferura's lack of demonstrated leadership throughout the story makes this decision seem abrupt.",

Their portrayal adds significant depth and richness to the narrative.",

This book takes place during the reign of Hatshepsut, one of the most powerful female rulers and one of the few women to hold the title of Pharaoh. I was particularly pleased to see the story centered around her daughter, Neferura, a largely overlooked figure in history. This choice allowed for creative storytelling while still feeling like a plausible representation of her life. The author’s note at the end provided a wealth of historical information, further enhancing my appreciation for both the story and its setting."

The book is set during the reign of Hatshepsut, one of the most powerful female rulers and one of the only women to claim the title of Pharaoh. I was delighted to see a book featuring her daughter, Neferura, who is largely unknown in the historical record. This allowed for a lot of creative license while still feeling like a reasonable depiction of her life.\n\n- **Characters and Representation:**  \n  The book features a fantastic number of strong female characters from all backgrounds. It was lovely to see Neferura breaking out of her insular shell and learning to rely on the women supporting her. The portrayal of these characters added depth and richness to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot itself was fairly standard, relying on a strong dose of historical reality (such as brother-sister marriages in Egyptian royalty to preserve the dynasty) tempered with an interesting political intrigue plot. While there wasn’t much suspense, what was present was engaging and fun to read.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending was satisfying, though I had trouble believing that Hathor agreed so readily to Neferura’s offer to be her successor. I didn’t feel Neferura had shown a particular knack for leadership throughout the book, which made this decision feel a bit abrupt.\n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Author’s Note:**  \n  The book included a wonderful amount of historical information in the author’s note at the end, which added to my appreciation of the story and its setting.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a satisfying book with a fantastic setting, strong female characters, and an engaging blend of historical reality and creative storytelling.

I picked up this book eager to explore the relationship between mother and daughter, but Hatshepsut comes across as a selfish and unlikable figure. The only thing that prevents her from being the worst character is that she lacks the overt cruelty of Thutmose, who is depicted as a mustache-twirling villain. I've always viewed Hatshepsut as a fascinating historical figure deserving of admiration, but in this narrative, she resembles an Egyptian version of Cersei Lannister—without the engaging complexity.",

I thought her ending was satisfying, and I’m happy with where her character arc went.  \n  However, Hatshepsut’s depiction was a major disappointment. I picked up this book because I recognized Neferura as her daughter and was eager to read about them both. In this book, Hatshepsut is portrayed as an incredibly selfish, horrible mother and overall extremely unlikeable. The only reason she wasn’t the worst character is that she’s not a physically abusive, mustache-twirling villain like Thutmose. I’ve always thought Hatshepsut was a fascinating historical figure worthy of admiration, but here she’s just Egyptian Cersei Lannister—and not in a fun way.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  I did like the depictions of friendships between women and the idea of a network of women helping each other in a world that was often hostile to women. However, sometimes the message or modern sentiments felt a little too on-the-nose.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Detail:**  \n  I really liked the afterword in the back of the book explaining the real history behind the story. The author apparently has a Ph.D. in Egyptology, and it definitely shows in the little details in the story. That’s always something I appreciate.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is definitely worth reading for lovers of ancient Egypt, though Hatshepsut fans should be prepared for a less-than-flattering portrayal of her. The political intrigue and historical details are strong points, but the character development, particularly for Hatshepsut, left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nSoft 4/5."

The book fulfilled these descriptions to some extent.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was uneven. The first half felt slow and dragged until around the 50% mark, while the second half felt rushed and somewhat off-balance.\n\n- **Plot and Direction:**  \n  While there was always something happening, the story lacked clear direction at times. I was unsure where it was heading, which wasn’t necessarily bad but occasionally left me feeling a bit lost. Ultimately, it felt like a story of Neferura taking power into her own hands as she navigated her role in court.\n\n- **Character Development and Moral Ambiguity:**  \n  I found it intriguing to see Neferura’s moral ambiguity. Despite being used as a tool in her mother and brother’s schemes, there was always the question of whether she was any better than them or if she, too, was using others for her gain (e.g., Satiah or Iset). This lingering question added depth to the story.\n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Writing Style:**  \n  The historical context was well-researched and intricate, reflecting the author’s expertise as an Egyptologist. However, the writing sometimes felt clunky, especially as more characters and plot points were introduced. I appreciated the historical detail but wished the atmosphere had been more immersive.\n\n- **Overall Satisfaction and Recommendation:**  \n  While I didn’t feel completely satisfied by the end, I found the book worthwhile for its exploration of a woman finding her power and its appeal to my interest in Ancient Egyptian history. I wouldn’t fully recommend it to friends, but it was a meaningful read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Neferura* is a well-written novel with strong historical elements and an intriguing exploration of power and morality. However, its uneven pacing, occasional lack of direction, and clunky writing style detract from its overall impact.

            "The characters, with the exception of Neferura, felt underdeveloped and lacked depth.

Furthermore, I found Neferura herself to be a weak protagonist.",

            "In a dramatic turn of events, Thutmose's quest for power puts Neferura and her loved ones in jeopardy. She is forced to risk everything to protect herself. However, the ending felt abrupt, leaving me with unanswered questions. A few more pages to resolve these loose ends would have been appreciated.",
            "Neferura is a compelling and strong character, with her role as a priestess of Amun and the associated rituals and beliefs clearly articulated. In contrast, Thutmose is thoroughly unlikable—a power-hungry and cruel man. The wise woman and her intricate web of influence add an intriguing layer to the story. However, Hatshepsut truly stands out as the most captivating character. Historically one of the longest-reigning female pharaohs, she is portrayed as ruthless in this narrative. While I didn’t find her personally likable, her character is exceptionally well-written, and her unpredictable actions kept me engaged throughout.",
            "As a lifelong enthusiast of Ancient Egypt, I found this book to be a captivating portrayal of the New Kingdom period. The vivid descriptions of the temples and palaces beautifully captured the era's grandeur. This historical fiction piece excels in exploring one of my favorite historical periods, with impressive attention to detail in its cultural elements."

This book really captured the grandeur of the New Kingdom period. The depictions of the temples and palace were beautiful.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Neferura was a very likeable, strong character. As a priestess of Amun, her role and the rituals and beliefs surrounding the deities were well explained. Thutmose was thoroughly unpleasant—a power-grabbing, unkind man. The wise woman and her intricate web were intriguing. Hatshepsut, however, was the standout character for me. Historically, she was one of the longest-reigning female pharaohs, and in this book, she was portrayed as ruthless. I didn’t like her as a person, but she was written incredibly well, and her actions surprised me at times.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  When Thutmose starts to act against her mother, wanting all the power for himself, Neferura's life is turned upside down. Both the princess and those she loves are in danger, and she must risk everything to save herself. I did find the ending a bit abrupt, though. I was left with a few unanswered questions and would have liked a couple more pages to tie up some loose ends.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Depth:**  \n  The book is a great piece of historical fiction, exploring one of my favorite areas of history. The attention to detail in depicting the New Kingdom period and its cultural elements was impressive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a captivating historical fiction novel that brought Ancient Egypt to life with its rich setting, well-developed characters, and intriguing plot.

It leans more toward historical fiction with a focus on Egyptology.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy:**  \n  A lot of care and research went into keeping the story historically accurate, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing lacked a bit of flavor and didn’t fully evoke the rich, mythological atmosphere expected from the setting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Neferura* is worth the read for those interested in historical fiction, particularly Egyptology, with a focus on female dynamics. However, it might not fully satisfy readers looking for more fantasy elements.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars  \n\nThank you to NetGalley for providing this gifted copy in exchange for my honest review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Engagement with Historical Context:**  \n  I was thrilled to dive into a book about ancient Egypt, as it’s been a while since I’ve explored this setting. The novel focuses on a historical figure, Neferura, whom I knew nothing about, and I love discovering new people from history to learn about. The author, Malayna Evans, provides an excellent description of what we actually know about Neferura in the author’s notes, as well as where she took creative liberties. This added depth to my understanding and appreciation of the story.\n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  The book covers a short but fascinating snapshot of a long and intriguing dynasty. It follows Neferura, a young priestess and daughter of two pharaohs, who is thrust into a dangerous situation disguised as a marriage. Despite being raised at court, she was blissfully unaware of the schemes and machinations of those closest to her. Her survival now depends on her ability to quickly learn to navigate this treacherous underworld. This premise kept me hooked and invested in her journey.\n\n- **Recommendation and Publication Details:**  \n  I highly recommend reading the author’s notes at the end of the book for additional context and insight. The novel is set to hit shelves on February 13, 2024, and I believe it’s a must-read for fans of historical fiction, especially those interested in ancient Egypt.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a captivating exploration of a lesser-known historical figure, Neferura, set against the rich backdrop of ancient Egypt. The author’s blend of historical accuracy and creative storytelling makes for an engaging and educational read. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, character development, and the additional context provided in the author’s notes.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Originality:**  \n  - It is refreshing to read historical fiction that is not set in Regency England or World War 2. The story takes place in ancient Egypt, which provides a unique and engaging backdrop.  \n  - The focus on Neferura, the daughter of two Pharaohs, and her role as a high priestess adds depth and originality to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Political Intrigue:**  \n  - The power struggle between Neferura's mother, the regent Pharaoh, and her brother, the Pharaoh, is compelling and drives the story forward.  \n  - The political intrigue, sneaking, and backstabbing make the book fun to read.  \n  - The emphasis on soft power rather than military strength adds a refreshing layer to the conflict.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Neferura starts as a passive heroine, with events happening to her and around her, leaving her to react rather than act.  \n  - Her character arc transforms her into a more proactive individual, which is satisfying to witness.  \n\n- **Substance and Depth:**  \n  - While I enjoyed the book, I felt it could have had more substance. The story, while engaging, left me wanting deeper exploration of its themes and characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I liked the book for its unique setting, compelling political intrigue, and Neferura's satisfying character arc. However, I felt the story could have offered more depth and substance to fully realize its potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The author's clever choice of conclusion is particularly effective, given that Neferura's fate remains historically uncertain, allowing for creative interpretation. The story begins simply but evolves into a complex narrative filled with unexpected twists, mirroring the rise of an empire.",

Her character is compelling, and I found myself genuinely rooting for her as she navigates various challenges. The seamless integration of fictional characters with historical figures lends the story a natural flow. The real-life figures are depicted with realism, showcasing their flaws and the complexities of power and ambition within royal dynamics. Power emerges as a central theme, driving the motivations of most characters and often resulting in morally ambiguous outcomes.",

This rich and iconic civilization deserves greater representation in media, and this novel truly does it justice."

The book sparked my interest with its beautiful cover and blurb.  \n  - The author’s additional background information about her inspiration for Neferura and the current state of knowledge and theories about the time and characters added depth and appeal.  \n\n- **Narration and Language:**  \n  - I loved the narration style and language the author used. It allowed me to get lost in the ancient world and feel truly present with the characters.  \n\n- **Characterization and World-Building:**  \n  - The names were unusual, but as a fantasy reader, I quickly got the hang of all the family and friendship connections.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The pacing was inconsistent; it felt like everything was happening at once or moving too slowly. The ending, in particular, felt a bit rushed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a great story that immersed me in the ancient world and kept me engaged despite some pacing issues. I would recommend it to others, especially those interested in Egyptian history or richly narrated historical fiction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "**Neferura:** As the protagonist, Neferura is relatable in her confusion and lack of control over her life. However, her naivety seems unrealistic for a princess in a politically charged environment, particularly her failure to recognize Senenmut’s obvious ambition and scheming, which is frustrating. **Hatshepsut:** Hatshepsut is a complex and intriguing antagonist. Her abusive behavior and obsession with her legacy profoundly affect both Neferura and Thutmose III, making her a compelling yet unlikable character. **Thutmose III:** Although he initially appears to be the clear villain, his cruelty is rooted in Hatshepsut’s actions, adding depth to his character. I appreciated the minimal focus on romance; Kamut, as a side character, appears sparingly, and his interactions with Neferura are refreshingly devoid of melodramatic declarations of love.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  I never had much patience for historical fiction, but *Neferura* is making me think it’s not so bad! While it felt a little anti-climactic at times, it was still a treat to read. The novel’s focus on strong women, accurate historical retelling, and royal drama makes it appealing for fans of these elements.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Setting:**  \n  The Egyptian setting, rituals, and historical details were absolutely fascinating. The author’s Ph.D. in Egyptian history shines through in every word, making the ancient customs, traditions, and references (like potions, spells, and festivals) feel authentic and immersive.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - **Neferura:** As the protagonist, Neferura is relatable in her confusion and lack of control over her life. However, her naivety felt unrealistic for a princess in such a politically charged environment. Her inability to see through Senenmut’s scheming, despite his obvious ambition, was particularly frustrating.  \n  - **Hatshepsut:** Hatshepsut is a complex and fascinating antagonist. Her abusive behavior and obsession with her legacy deeply impacted both Neferura and Thutmose III, making her a compelling, though unlikable, character.  \n  - **Thutmose III:** While he appears as the obvious villain, his cruelty is rooted in Hatshepsut’s actions, adding depth to his character.  \n\n- **Female Relationships:**  \n  The depiction of female relationships was a highlight. Neferura’s friendships with Iset, Satiah, Nebtah, and Hathor showcased the strength and support women can offer each other, making the story empowering and engaging.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story starts slow and takes time to get used to, especially with the unfamiliar setting and glossary. This slowness persists in patches throughout the book, including the final chapters. The ending felt abrupt, and the epilogue seemed rushed and unsatisfactory, leaving me wanting more closure.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  I appreciated the minimal focus on romance. Kamut, as a side character, appeared sparingly, and his interactions with Neferura were refreshingly free of over-the-top declarations of love. This approach felt logical and well-balanced for a historical fiction novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Neferura* is a decent historical fiction novel with strong female characters, an immersive Egyptian setting, and a focus on royal drama. While the pacing was uneven and the ending felt rushed, the book’s exploration of complex relationships and historical accuracy made it an engaging read. It’s a one-time read for me, but it has sparked my interest in exploring more historical fiction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.  \n\nThanks to NetGalley for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review! #netgalley #arcreview #historicalfiction"

            "The characters, particularly the younger ones, felt out of place in the ancient Egyptian setting, as their dialogue reflected a modern sensibility.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I found it difficult to read this book after finishing Michelle Moran’s *Nefertiti* and *The Heretic Queen*. My expectations were high because I wanted to re-enter the ancient Egyptian world Moran created. However, this book wasn’t written by Moran, and I tried to remain unbiased in my review. It’s often compared to *Kaikeyi*, and I had similar issues with both—this is one of the most overhyped books I’ve ever read. If you didn’t enjoy *Kaikeyi*, you probably won’t enjoy this one either. Conversely, if you loved *Kaikeyi*, you’ll likely love this book.\n\n- **Exploration of Themes:**  \n  I adored the exploration of women expressing and discovering their power in this book. The ending also had a nice twist, which I appreciated.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The writing felt YA, and I believe this book should be shelved in the YA section rather than the fiction section. While there were some beautiful, nearly literary descriptions, the dialogue and the narrator’s inner monologue often cheapened them. The tone and style didn’t align with my expectations for a historical fiction novel set in ancient Egypt.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, especially the younger ones, felt transplanted from today into an ancient Egyptian setting. Their dialogue was a clear sign of this disconnect. Additionally, the characters didn’t seem to develop or wisen up organically. Instead, the novel relied on exposition and dialogue to *tell* the reader that the characters had grown, which felt forced and unconvincing.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot and pacing kept me engaged after the 50% mark, though I might have considered not finishing it (DNF) if I hadn’t been invested by that point.\n\n- **Recommendations:**  \n  If you’re looking for a book set in ancient Egypt, I recommend Michelle Moran’s *Nefertiti* and *The Heretic Queen*, as well as *The Memoirs of Cleopatra* by Margaret George. Alternatively, you could read this book but approach it as a YA novel to manage your expectations. I think I would’ve enjoyed it more if I had done so.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book had some redeeming qualities, such as its exploration of women’s empowerment and a surprising twist at the end, it fell short of my expectations. The YA writing style, lack of authentic character development, and overhyped comparisons to other works diminished my overall enjoyment. I recommend adjusting your expectations or choosing a different book if you’re seeking a more immersive ancient Egyptian experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Development:**\n  - Neferura is portrayed as shallow, overly idealized, and naive, making her uninteresting.\n  - Hatshepsut is depicted as neurotic, vain, and weak, which is hard to appreciate given her historical significance.\n  - Senmut is characterized as an inept, passive figure who lacks depth and is easily manipulated.\n  - Thutmose is seen as a spoiled and resentful character, lacking complexity.\n\n- **Plot and Logic:**\n  - The plot devices are described as silly and lacking logical coherence.\n  - The story feels simplistic, with a lack of depth in exploring the intricacies of ruling a country.\n  - The revelation about Hatshepsut’s potential murder of Neferura’s father and her attempts to kill Thutmose feels unconvincing and poorly executed.\n\n- **Historical and Cultural Representation:**\n  - The references to Egyptian culture, particularly the religious aspects, are appreciated and add some value to the story.\n  - The portrayal of Hatshepsut as weak and easily defeated contradicts her historical reputation as a powerful and revolutionary ruler.\n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**\n  - The characters are difficult to like or connect with, which diminishes overall engagement.\n  - The story’s lack of depth and complexity makes it underwhelming and unsatisfying.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel attempts to weave historical facts with fiction, it falls short in delivering compelling characters and a logically sound plot. The portrayal of key historical figures like Hatshepsut feels inconsistent with their real-life legacies, and the story’s simplicity leaves much to be desired. Despite some appreciation for the cultural references, the overall execution fails to captivate or provide the depth needed to fully appreciate the historical context.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nNo explicit rating scores are mentioned in the review."

The author skillfully captures the essence of ancient Kemet, moving beyond familiar Egyptian lore to portray a society where the strength, wisdom, motherhood, and fertility of women serve as beacons of empowerment. Additionally, the exploration of gender fluidity, particularly through figures like Pharaoh Hatshepsut and her unconventional representation, introduces compelling themes of identity and power."

Evans, with her heart clearly set in Egypt’s ancient past, weaves a narrative enriched by her profound knowledge and fervent passion for the era. The historical tapestry Evans has crafted is undeniably rich, painting a lush, vivid portrayal of ancient Kemet that deserves recognition.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The tale of Neferura, a princess entwined with destiny and embroiled in the complex webs of royal intrigue, offers a window into a world where powerful women navigate treacherous politics and plays for power. The bonds between women form the core of the story, set against a backdrop as vibrant and unpredictable as the desert itself. Evans’ commitment to capturing the essence of ancient Kemet, stepping beyond the well-trodden paths of Egyptian lore, brings to life a detailed picture of a society where the strength and wisdom of women, motherhood, and fertility shine as beacons of empowerment. The exploration of gender fluidity, especially through figures like Pharaoh Hatshepsut and her unconventional representation, introduces fascinating themes of identity and power.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The narrative, much like the legendary Nile, meanders through a pacing that starts too slowly and then hastens toward a conclusion that rushes past too quickly. This uneven pacing creates moments of disconnect from the characters' emotional journeys.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dialogue:**  \n  The dialogue, intended to illuminate the plot and character dynamics, often serves more as an expository tool than a means to reveal the emotional complexities of its characters. This approach tends toward telling rather than showing, creating a barrier to deeper emotional engagement and rendering the characters’ voices, even those meticulously carved, as distant echoes lost in the expanse of history and the clamor of secondary characters.  \n\n- **Depth of Exploration:**  \n  While the novel introduces complex discussions of identity and power, these themes sometimes feel overshadowed, reduced to simpler narratives of ambition. This leaves the reader longing for a more nuanced exploration of the characters’ inner worlds and the societal implications of their actions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Neferura\" is an ambitious endeavor that blends meticulous research with narrative potential, offering a vivid portrayal of ancient Kemet and the powerful women who shaped its history. While the novel’s uneven pacing and lack of emotional depth hinder full immersion, its rich historical detail and exploration of feminist themes make it a noteworthy addition to modern feminist historical retellings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 Scorpion Stings 🦂🦂🦂 out of five."

The story gave these women distinct voices and stories, showing them working together towards a greater purpose.\n\n- **Research and Authenticity:**  \n  As a historian, I appreciated the glossary at the beginning of the book and the chapter at the end where the author explained which parts of the story were rooted in research and theories about Ancient Egypt. This demonstrated the care and effort that went into writing the book, which I greatly valued as a reader.\n\n- **Recommendation and Audience:**  \n  I would definitely recommend this book to readers who enjoy historical fiction and mythology, such as *Circe*, *Clytemnestra*, and *Ariadne*. They are likely to enjoy this book as much as I did.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book is a masterfully written piece of historical fiction that combines rich prose, well-developed characters, and a nuanced exploration of women’s roles in Ancient Egypt. The author’s dedication to research and authenticity adds depth to the story, making it a highly recommended read for fans of the genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(This review did not include specific numerical ratings.)"
