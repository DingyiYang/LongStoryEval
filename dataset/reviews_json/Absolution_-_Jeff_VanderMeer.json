        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Anticipation and Context:**  \n  I read the Southern Reach trilogy a couple of years ago and came across a tweet from VanderMeer about *Absolution*, which made me look forward to it ever since.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  While I sometimes missed the simplicity of *Annihilation*, *Absolution* showcases VanderMeer diving even deeper into the genre of \"new weird\" than ever before—surpassing even his previous works featuring mushroom people and a five-story-tall flying bear.  \n\n- **Structure and Experimentation:**  \n  The book is divided into three sections, with the first and third being more experimental than the middle section. The experimental structure requires some readiness from the reader, as it’s not the easiest read, but it doesn’t sacrifice readability.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  Bronson Pinchot’s narration of the audiobook is excellent, particularly in the third section, which made it incredibly entertaining to listen to.  \n\n- **Substance and Originality:**  \n  There’s a lot of substance to *Absolution*, and VanderMeer’s originality shines through. His stories are uniquely his own—you can’t imagine them until he tells them to you.  \n\n- **Author’s Influence and Legacy:**  \n  VanderMeer’s work has the same impact on readers as Angela Carter’s prose had on him when he was 20. He described her work as something that “blew the back of my head off, rewired my brain,” and now VanderMeer has created his own canon of prose that does the same for us.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Absolution* is a great read that highlights VanderMeer’s mastery of the \"new weird\" genre. While its experimental structure may challenge some readers, it remains highly readable and substantial. I highly recommend this book, as well as all of VanderMeer’s works, for their originality and impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book defies easy explanation, leaving me with lingering questions—not due to unresolved plot points, but rather as a reflection of its existential themes within the sci-fi/horror genre. The intentionally ambiguous narrative invites deep engagement, compelling me to wrestle with its underlying ideas.",
            "This story explores existential and surreal themes through vivid and often unsettling imagery. The metaphor of rabbits eating fiddler crabs, as well as rabbits consuming each other after the thistle grows, symbolizes the brutal cycle of existence. Additionally, the notion of consuming flesh as a means of communion and absolution adds philosophical depth, prompting reflections on morality, survival, and the rules that govern our behavior.",

It leaves the reader with lingering questions, but this is not due to the author failing to tie up loose ends. Instead, it reflects the existential nature of the sci-fi/horror genre. The narrative is intentionally ambiguous, challenging the reader to grapple with its themes and ideas.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The story delves into existential and surreal themes, using vivid and often unsettling imagery.

The concept of consuming flesh as a form of communion and a path to absolution adds a layer of philosophical depth, forcing the reader to question morality, survival, and the rules that govern behavior.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement and Provocation:**  \n  The book is designed to provoke thought and challenge conventional perspectives. It dares the reader to question societal norms and rules, as exemplified by the note that says \"Do Not Eat\" but leaves the reader wondering if breaking such rules is necessary for survival or enlightenment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterfully crafted piece of existential sci-fi/horror that leaves a lasting impression.

This leads to frequent timeline shifts that can feel overwhelming at times. The narrative is divided into three parts, demanding careful attention from the reader. Although I found the beginning disappointing and slow, I was pleasantly surprised as the story unfolded.",
            "The most significant character in this book is Area X itself—a captivating and terrifying landscape that has lingered in my mind since the earlier installments. I appreciate the intricate flora and fauna, as well as the palpable sense of dread that arises when everything begins to unravel, often with the characters unaware of the looming danger. This setting prompts deep questions and infuses the narrative with an unsettling unpredictability.",
            "This book is likely my favorite to date. It offers essential perspectives and rich details that enhance my connection to the story. The writing is a mix of both flawed and beautiful, leaving me eager for more. I'm even considering collecting signed hardback editions of the entire series.",
            "From the outset, I was fully immersed in this universe. The book creates a constant sense of bewilderment that is both intriguing and captivating. Embracing an open mind is essential, as not everything is fully explained, and that uncertainty adds to its charm."

The book gave me a constant feeling of \"what the actual f*ck is happening,\" which was both intriguing and captivating. It requires an open mind and an acceptance that not everything will be fully explained, but that’s part of its charm.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Timeline:**  \n  The book takes us back 20 years before the barrier on Area X came down and 18 months before and during the first expedition. This results in frequent timeline jumps, which can feel heavy and demanding at times. The story is divided into three parts that require a lot of attention, and while I initially felt disappointed and bored at the beginning, I was pleasantly surprised as the narrative progressed.  \n\n- **Answers and New Questions:**  \n  This book provides many of the answers we’ve been craving since the first book, but it also introduces even more new questions. Some details that initially seemed unimportant turned out to be significant, and I appreciated how the story made me reconsider earlier assumptions.  \n\n- **Character and Setting Development:**  \n  The most important character in this book is Area X itself. It’s a fascinating and terrifying place that I’ve missed since the earlier books. I love the flora and fauna, as well as the sense of terror when everything starts to fail and the characters seem oblivious to the danger. The setting makes you question everything and adds a layer of unpredictability.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Personal Connection:**  \n  This book is probably my favorite of the series so far. It provides much-needed points of view and reveals many details that deepen my connection to the story. Jeff Vandermeer’s writing is both awful and beautiful, leaving me eager for more. I’m even interested in collecting signed hardback editions of the entire series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe fourth book in the Southern Reach saga is a thrilling and thought-provoking addition to the series. While it has moments of heaviness and demands attention due to its complex timeline, it delivers answers, raises new questions, and deepens the mystery of Area X.

However, the content in this section didn’t particularly grab me, and I wasn’t invested in resolving the mysteries from the earlier parts.  \n\n- **Connection to the Original Trilogy:**  \n  As a fan of the Southern Reach Trilogy, I was disappointed that this prequel didn’t add much to the original storyline. While it was nice to revisit Area X briefly in the third section, the book overall felt unnecessary and didn’t deepen my understanding or appreciation of the original series.  \n\n- **Narration and Character Engagement:**  \n  The narration style in the third section was initially off-putting, and the narrator came across as insufferable. This made it harder to connect with the story, and I found myself less engaged with the characters and their journeys.  \n\n- **Standalone Accessibility:**  \n  The book assumes familiarity with the original trilogy, and I doubt it would make much sense to readers who haven’t read the earlier books. Despite being a prequel, it doesn’t stand well on its own.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I struggled to stay engaged with the book and likely would have abandoned it partway through if not for the obligation to review it as an ARC.

I’ve come to wonder if *Annihilation* was a happy accident of genius, or if I’m simply not able to appreciate the nuances of *Authority*, *Acceptance*, and *Absolution*.  \n\n- **Understanding the Plot:**  \n  I still don’t fully understand what happened in this book. The confusion persisted throughout, especially in Part 3, where the writing didn’t resonate with me as much.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my disappointment, I acknowledge that the book has merit, particularly in its writing (except for Part 3). If I hadn’t been so enamored with *Annihilation*, I might have enjoyed this one more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had moments that reminded me of what I loved about *Annihilation*, it ultimately left me confused and underwhelmed. My high expectations, fueled by my love for the first book, may have clouded my judgment. However, the writing still deserves recognition, even if the story didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars."

Unfortunately, it ended up being even more confusing and frustrating.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The first two parts of the novel (pre-Area X) were somewhat intriguing at times, but they didn’t contribute much to understanding the supernatural element tied to the forgotten coast.  \n\n- **Tone and Narrative Style:**  \n  The last part of the book was a profanity-laden narrative from the first expedition, which felt like a misplaced “Fear and Loathing” acid trip. This shift in tone and style made it difficult to connect with the story.  \n\n- **Overall Reading Experience:**  \n  Finishing this book was laborious as hell. The lack of clarity and the disjointed narrative made it a challenging and unsatisfying read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this fourth book to provide clarity and depth to the series, it ultimately fell short.
