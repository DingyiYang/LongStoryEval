The connection between Simon’s daughter, Penelope, and Sylvie was heartwarming. Sylvie’s journey of coming to terms with the reality of her previous husband was a compelling and emotional plot point.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  The complicated relationship between the three sisters—Sylvie, Cleo, and Emma—and the secrets they shared and kept from each other added depth to the story. It was a wonderful exploration of complex family dynamics.  \n\n- **Themes of Honesty and Resolution:**  \n  I loved how the story emphasized the importance of honesty. Once the characters could be honest with themselves and each other, they were able to find the endings they needed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a beautiful and emotional read, with well-developed characters and intricate relationships. Despite some slower parts, the story’s payoff made it highly rewarding. I highly recommend it!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The introduction of Penelope's viewpoint at the end beautifully ties the narrative together, highlighting the family's redemption and her personal growth.

            "The premise of this story is promising: Sylvie, a widowed librarian, is set to remarry a seemingly perfect man, culminating in a lavish wedding at an English castle. The narrative introduces estranged sisters, a narcissistic mother, and a mystery surrounding Simon's wealth, adding layers of intrigue. While the book touches on family drama, romance, and humor—such as the chaotic dinner scene—it fails to fully explore any of these themes. Although Sylvie and Simon share palpable chemistry, Simon's character feels underdeveloped, lacking depth. The portrayal of the narcissistic mother is compelling but veers into exaggeration. Unfortunately, the sisters and Sylvie herself do not receive enough attention to develop or demonstrate significant growth. The entire story unfolds over a single weekend, which feels insufficient for the complexity of the plot. Similar to *The Lifeguards*, the ending is rushed and overly neat, leaving the narrative feeling incomplete. An additional 50-100 pages (or about two hours of audiobook time) would have enhanced the story's memorability and impact.",
            "One of the authors who rekindled my passion for reading after college, particularly through her early 2000s works like *How to Be Lost* and *Sleep Toward Heaven*, holds a special place in my literary journey. As a local Austin author, I feel a personal connection to her and always cheer for her success.",
            "Although I appreciate the author's writing style and plan to continue supporting their work, this novel didn't resonate with me as strongly as their earlier books. I suspect that some critical elements may have been cut during editing, which could have made the story feel more cohesive and satisfying."

Alongside Sylvia, we meet her sisters, Emma and Cleo, each grappling with their own challenges, and their self-absorbed mother, Diane. Set against the historical and romantic backdrop of Mumberton Castle in northern England, the story piques interest with its connections to the era of King Henry VIII. With suspenseful elements that kept me engaged, I was eager to discover whether Sylvia and Simon would find their happy ending. The book's brisk pace makes it an ideal choice for a beach read or light escapist fiction.",

            "The wedding in England marked a turning point for the sisters, allowing them to reconnect and appreciate how much they had missed each other. The truth about Alexander should have been communicated to Sylvie sooner, as it could have strengthened their bond. Although the wedding didn’t go as expected, it ultimately solidified their relationship.",
            "The Peacock sisters—Sylvie, Cleo, and Emma—are a captivating yet highly dysfunctional family. Their mother, Donna, is a terrible parent, whose actions, such as bringing Emma along on her rendezvous, are utterly appalling. Sylvie and Simon are a perfect match, bonded by their mutual love of books and his genuine affection for her, quirks and all (including her biting dog). Cleo's struggles to recognize a healthy relationship, particularly in her dynamic with Danny, can be frustrating to watch. Meanwhile, Emma's poor choices, like falling into a pyramid scheme and naming her children Jameson and Guinness, add complexity to her character. Overall, the Peacock sisters make for a compelling and thought-provoking read.",

The emotional depth, compelling characters, and engaging plot kept me hooked from start to finish. The resolution in England was satisfying, and I appreciated the growth in the sisters’ relationships. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more by the author.",

Cleo is a high-powered lawyer in NYC, Emma is a housewife entangled in a pyramid scheme, and Sylvie is a widowed librarian in Miami. Sylvie's whirlwind romance with Simon and their plans to wed in his ancestral castle particularly captivated me; however, I found myself more invested in Emma's journey and her uncertain future.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Family Dynamics and Complexity:**  \n  I love the complicated families in Amanda Eyre Ward's novels, and the family in this one was definitely complicated! The Peacock sisters have been estranged since youngest sister Sylvie's husband died in a tragic accident 10 years ago. Sylvie has finally found love again with Simon Rampling, a wealthy Brit with a castle to his name. She's invited her two sisters, Cleo and Emma, and their toxic mother to her wedding at the castle. All three sisters are hiding something from themselves and from each other.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are complicated, but the material isn't overly heavy. I thought the sisters were very well-drawn, though a little cliched in their birth order characteristics (e.g., oldest Cleo is always trying to protect Emma and Sylvie). However, they were very relatable, and all their struggles were things I could see people in my life struggling with.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  There are a lot of themes of sisterhood, family, and forgiveness woven throughout the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  I enjoyed this fun read. It's a fairly light, easy read and would be perfect for the beach this summer.  \n\n- **Criticism:**  \n  My main criticism is that there were some minor characters that I felt weren't necessary to the story. They were just sort of thrown in and didn't necessarily add anything.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is an enjoyable and relatable family drama with well-drawn characters and themes of sisterhood and forgiveness. While some minor characters felt unnecessary, the story is a light and engaging read, perfect for fans of family dramas and sisterhood books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

It transcends its RomCom appearance, weaving together humor, psychology, and history into a tapestry that fully immersed me in its world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the premise was intriguing and aligned with my interest in stories about sibling or friendship relationships, the execution didn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  None of the characters made a deep impression on me. I found it difficult to get invested in their individual stories, which made the overall experience less engaging.  \n\n- **Memorability:**  \n  Two weeks after reading the book, I struggled to recall what made it worth reading. It felt like a breezy, forgettable read rather than something impactful or memorable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting premise and was an easy, breezy read, it ultimately fell short in terms of character development and memorability. It didn’t leave a lasting impression, making it just an \"OK\" read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a moderate or average rating."

The abrupt time jumps in the second half were particularly jarring, detracting from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
