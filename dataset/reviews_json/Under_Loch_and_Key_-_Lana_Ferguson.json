The hero was swoony without being over-the-top, and I just loved him so much.  \n  The romance felt fairytale-like, and the banter between characters was fun and laugh-out-loud funny.\n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n  The story offered a fun spin on the Loch Ness legend and Scottish folklore, which I absolutely adored. It’s exactly the kind of entertainment I seek when I read.  \n  I really hope we get more from this world because it felt so immersive and captivating.\n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The audiobook is literal perfection. The narrators acted out the dialogue in duet, and their performances, especially the Scottish accent, were flawless.  \n  I borrowed it on Libby but plan to buy it on Audible because I know I’ll want to listen to it again and again. It made the experience so much better.\n\n- **Memorable Quotes:**  \n  “Are you ever going to stop calling me that?”  \n  “I will when it stops making you blush.”  \n  “Because in a world where it feels like I’ve never had much of anything…it suddenly feels like I have everything to lose.”  \n  “What if I can’t save you? What if I fail?”  \n  “It doesn’t matter,” he hums, kissing me again gently. “Because it won’t change how much I love you.”\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an emotional rollercoaster that left me deeply attached to the characters and the world. The romance, humor, and folklore elements combined to create a perfect reading experience, further elevated by the exceptional audiobook. It’s a story I’ll revisit again and again.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n10/10 for the audiobook and overall experience."

The Scottish accent was essential for this story, and the true duet narration was absolutely perfect.  \n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  Scotland is on my bucket list, and I adored how this book brought the country and its traditions to life. The unique spin on the Loch Ness Monster lore was captivating.  \n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  Lochlan and Key were incredible together.

Key’s unwavering support for Lochlan as he tried to break his curse was heartwarming, and their chemistry was electric.  \n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The book masterfully incorporated themes of monster romance, enemies to lovers, magic and curses, and the “touch him and die” trope. The banter between the characters was a standout element.  \n- **Creativity and Originality:**  \n  Lana’s decision to reimagine Nessie as a swoon-worthy man was brilliant. The interplay of lore and family dynamics added depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful blend of romance, magic, and Scottish charm. The narration, setting, and character dynamics were all executed flawlessly, making it a memorable and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5⭐️/4❤️‍🔥"

Meanwhile, Lachlan Greer is a mysterious figure burdened by secrets imposed on his family long ago by the McKays.

Her ability to seamlessly blend contemporary romance with elements of the paranormal is impressive—something I haven’t often seen in romance writing.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Versatility and Writing Style:**\n  - I've become a pretty big Lana Ferguson fan. I love that she can write contemporary but also venture into the mythical realm of the paranormal without batting an eyelash. I've honestly not seen this with many romance writers, and she does a fabulous job with it. I venture to say I may like her paranormal romances more than her contemporary ones!\n  - Ferguson does a great job keeping the pacing going in this story, especially considering how long the book is. I was never bored. I kept wanting to pick the story up and see what would happen next.\n  - She inserts spice where it's needed and doesn't overdo it. And the banter! I caught myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions. This author knows how to do it and do it right.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n  - Keyana McKay is a great character. She's spunky but also a bit shy and unsure of where she fits in the world. With no immediate family left, she jumps over the pond to Scotland to find her roots and her family that her father left behind.\n  - Lachlan Greer is a secretive character. Secrets he carries because he has no other choice. Secrets that were thrust upon his family long ago by the McKays. Ferguson weaves a feud between Loch and Key's families that rivals the Hatfields and the McCoys.\n  - I loved the twins so much. They were super supportive of Loch and were not inclined to give away any of his secrets, lest people persecute him. I can see how they might have their own little stories in the future.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n  - I love that Ferguson took the lore of the Loch Ness Monster and expanded it to make it more relatable. I won't get into too much as I don't want to spoil it, though I think the reader figures out pretty early on something is amiss!\n  - I enjoyed how Ferguson also wove some magic into Key's past.\n  - I love the mystery woven into the romance. I figured out early on who the \"villain\" was, but it was interesting to see how and why it was that person.\n  - She does a nice job with the world-building and backstory. I love the use of the journal entries to help this story along.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n  - The only thing I would have liked to see more of is the actual country of Scotland. I feel like Ferguson tried to put some of it in the story through the farm and a visit to an adjacent town, but for the most part, I did have a hard time picturing the Loch and how it was situated to the surrounding areas. I needed a bit more description of what I know from friends/family who have visited is a beautiful country.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n  - Overall, this is just a fun story intermingled with mystery, romance, folklore, curses, and a bit of the paranormal. Ok, not a bit, but you'll see what I'm going on about.\n  - I am definitely a lifelong Lana Ferguson fan and cannot wait to see what she has in line for the future! If you enjoyed *The Fake Mate* by this author, this one will reel you right in!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a delightful blend of romance, mystery, and paranormal elements, showcasing Lana Ferguson's versatility and skill as a writer. While the setting could have been more vividly described, the strong character development, engaging plot, and well-paced narrative make it a highly enjoyable read. Fans of Ferguson's previous works, especially *The Fake Mate*, will likely find this book equally captivating.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "The story follows Key, a young woman who journeys to Scotland to uncover the secrets of her father's life after his death. Armed only with a bedtime story about a monster that saved him and the name of his estranged family, she faces a surprising reception, particularly from the gruff and irritable farmhand, Lachlan. Lachlan is on his own quest for answers and is initially displeased by Key's presence. However, as they connect, they realize that they can assist each other in unraveling family curses and mysteries, all within a looming deadline. The potential for magic hinges on their willingness to open their hearts.\n\nThe narrative is light and immersive, with Key discovering the reasons behind her father's departure from Scotland while Lachlan attempts to break a family curse. Their intertwining stories, along with subplots involving their families and budding attraction, maintain an engaging pace. The pacing strikes a perfect balance, featuring humorous escapades, such as an auction and a children's museum, that keep the story lively. The climax delivers a bit of intensity, but the conclusion wraps up with a satisfying happily ever after, complete with an extended epilogue that leaves readers eagerly anticipating more.",
            "In this story, Key emerges as a resilient and empathetic character who embraces change with grace. Her willingness to engage openly is refreshing; while she’s no pushover, her vulnerability adds significant depth. Lachlan, initially gruff and carrying a compelling backstory that explains his demeanor, undergoes a delightful transformation as he warms up to Key, unable to resist her charm. \n\nThe supporting cast, including Key’s stubborn grandmother, caring grandfather, quirky cousin, two mischievous bartenders, and a quietly impactful character, enhances the narrative's richness and breadth. Notably, Bethie stands out as a vibrant addition. \n\nThe romance between Key and Lachlan is adorable and smoothly unfolds, featuring a pleasant mix of spice that kicks in around the 50-60% mark. While it includes familiar elements, there are unexpected twists reminiscent of Omegaverse without fully adopting its conventions. The author notably excels in crafting these spicy scenes, offering readers an enjoyable experience. Overall, the well-developed attraction between Key and Lachlan adds to the story's charm.",

While the pacing and focus on folklore could have been better balanced, the compelling writing, adorable couple, and exceptional audiobook narration make it an engaging and bingeable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly stated, but the reviewer mentions it’s not quite a 5-star read due to pacing issues."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved the dynamic between Keyanna and Lachlan. There is a lot of development that happens in their relationship that feels genuine and realistic, despite the paranormal aspects of the story. Lachlan is such a swoon. He is a little gruff at the beginning, and the tension he has with Key is off the charts. Their banter is written so well, and the buildup of their relationship works perfectly.\n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  Key is searching for the history of her family after being estranged from them for her entire life, and her overall journey is fun to read. The mystery of Lachlan’s family curse and the animosity between their families feels well-balanced against the romance. It feels like two complete plot lines that complement each other really well. The story just feels a tad long, but the payoff at the end and the epilogue make it worth it.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The audio is outstanding. Samantha Summers and Flint Park are great narrators, and the duet narration is a dream. The Scottish accent also makes it feel immersive and adds that extra depth to the audiobook.\n\n- **Genre and Personal Preference:**  \n  Admittedly, paranormal romances aren’t something I generally seek out, but I was into this story from the beginning. I’ve really enjoyed Lana Ferguson’s other books, so I was excited to get to this one.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel delivers a compelling blend of romance and mystery, with well-developed characters and a satisfying payoff. The audiobook narration enhances the experience, making it immersive and enjoyable. While the story feels slightly lengthy, the emotional depth and resolution make it worthwhile.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story is enjoyable, but the antagonist could use more development. The betrayal lacked impact, as the character didn't have enough presence on the page to make their actions feel significant.",
            "In Scotland, Keyanna Key MacKay embarks on a journey to honor her father's wish of spreading his ashes in the loch and to reconnect with her estranged grandparents. Her relationship with Lachlan Greer, the farmhand burdened by a family feud with hers, is a captivating blend of cheesiness and steam. I appreciated how Lachlan, despite calling himself a jerk, comes off as playful and flirty rather than genuinely rude. This refreshing take deviates from the typical grumpy archetype, making their romance all the more enjoyable.",
            "The author's clever and engaging writing shines through in the title, *Under Loch and Key*. This delightful play on words cleverly references the Loch Ness Monster, Key's name, and Lachlan's nickname, Loch.",

The premise is unique and engaging, blending paranormal romance with humor and heart.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Keyanna \"Key\" MacKay is in Scotland to fulfill her father's wish of spreading his ashes in the loch and to reconnect with her estranged grandparents. Her dynamic with Lachlan Greer, the farmhand with ancestral beef with her family, is both cheesy and steamy. I loved that Lachlan, while a self-proclaimed jerk, was more of a teasing and flirty character rather than genuinely rude. This avoided the typical grumpy archetype and made the romance more enjoyable.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The novel is heartwarming, dealing with family reconnections, ancestral trauma, and figuring out a new future. It balances humor and emotional depth well, making it more than just a steamy romance.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Creativity:**  \n  Lana Ferguson’s writing is clever and engaging, especially with the puns and wordplay in the title, *Under Loch and Key*. The title itself is a delightful nod to the Loch Ness Monster, Key’s name, and Lachlan’s nickname, Loch.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  While the story is overall enjoyable, I felt the antagonist could have been more fleshed out. The betrayal lacked impact because the character didn’t have enough page time to make their actions feel significant.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a fantastic paranormal romance that blends humor, heart, and steam. It’s an excellent introduction to monster romance, with a unique premise and well-developed characters. Despite a slightly underdeveloped antagonist, the story is engaging and emotionally satisfying. Lana Ferguson has once again delivered a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (due to the underdeveloped antagonist).  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group for providing this digital review copy in exchange for my honest thoughts."

I found myself curious about Lachlan's motives for uncovering secrets on the MacKay farm, Key's father's reasons for moving her to the US, and Brodie's odd behavior. These questions added depth to the narrative. While the book features the increasingly common spicy content found in cartoon-cover romances, it took some time to reach those moments.

I still think it’s worth a read because I did have an overall fun time reading this.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I do find myself comparing this to her other two books I’ve read that I LOVED!

But for those who love those kinds of books, I think this will hit all the right notes for you!\n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The book includes tropes like monster romance, magic & mystery, one barn, enemies to lovers, and a Scotsman X American girl dynamic.\n\n- **Audience Appeal:**  \n  This is going to be very hit or miss with people. Very different than a typical Lana Ferguson book!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t quite meet my expectations compared to Lana Ferguson’s other works, I still found it enjoyable overall.

However, it eventually gets spicy, especially after the supernatural twist.  \n- **Supernatural Twist:**  \n  The story takes a supernatural turn (not a spoiler—it’s hinted at in the title and dedication). This twist adds depth and intrigue, making me wonder if it qualifies as a monster romance book.  \n- **Found Family Theme:**  \n  It’s definitely a found family book, but in a literal sense—she finds her actual family. However, she discovers much more than that, including a centuries-old secret tied to Nessie, which deepens the supernatural elements.  \n- **Lore and Backstory:**  \n  I enjoyed the lore and backstory that were gradually uncovered. It added richness to the narrative and made the world feel more immersive.  \n- **Villain’s Arc:**  \n  I wasn’t surprised by the villain’s identity, but I was sad to see the person go down that path.  \n- **Narration and Audio Experience:**  \n  Thank you PRH Audio for the read! I loved the narration and the accents. They really added to the ambiance and setting, especially when the grandparents were speaking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel combines romance, supernatural elements, and a found family theme with rich lore and a compelling backstory.

While it’s categorized as an omegaverse romance, it’s lighter than expected—more of a fairytale than a story about werewolves or vampires. The book also explores deep themes of familial love, adding emotional depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Writing and Depth:**  \n  Author Lana Ferguson brings surprising depth and heart to what might initially seem like a “monster romance.” The story is more than just spicy moments; it’s a heartfelt and heartbreaking tale that exceeded my expectations.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I highly recommend this book. Even if omegaverse romance isn’t typically your thing, don’t let that stop you. It’s a captivating read that you won’t regret picking up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Under Loch and Key* is a delightful blend of fairytale charm, emotional depth, and romance. It’s a story that surprises with its heart and leaves a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Keyanna's estranged family, especially her grandmother, adds tension, while her cousin Brodie’s suspicious behavior heightens the mystery. Lachlan is mysterious and brooding, with a background that makes his connection to Key full of conflict. The tension between Keyanna and Lachlan is palpable—there’s attraction, but also wariness due to their family histories. Keyanna’s internal dialogue feels a bit overdeveloped at times, but once her relationship with Lachlan begins to develop, their chemistry really shines.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story unfolds slowly at first, as Keyanna navigates her family struggles and begins to unravel the curse that ties Lachlan and her family together. The plot really gains momentum around the halfway point. The mystery surrounding Lachlan's curse and Keyanna's newfound powers keeps you invested as they try to uncover how to break it.\n\n- **Paranormal and Mythical Elements:**  \n  One of the standout aspects of the book is its integration of Scottish mythology. From the Loch Ness monsters to Keyanna’s Kelpie Witch heritage, the paranormal elements add a fresh and intriguing layer to the story. While the magic system isn’t always fully explained, especially when Keyanna’s healing powers first appear, the lore surrounding Lachlan’s family curse and Keyanna’s ties to the mystical creatures keeps the story compelling.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance between Keyanna and Lachlan is a slow burn at first, with tension building throughout the story. Lachlan’s reluctance due to his curse and Keyanna’s growing feelings for him create a push-pull dynamic that’s both engaging and emotional. There is paranormal spice (think *Bride* by Ali Hazelwood!!) and it reached a 3.5-4 out of 5 spice rating in certain points.\n\n- **Mystery and Suspense:**  \n  The central mystery—why the curse came to be and how to break it—is engaging, and the twists and turns involving Brodie and his mysterious behavior keep you on edge, particularly as his true motives are revealed.\n\n- **Tone and Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is atmospheric and descriptive, which works well for the setting of a mysterious Scottish loch. The inclusion of Scottish slang adds authenticity, though it may require some effort to follow for readers unfamiliar with it (Google helped me a lot!).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Under Loch and Key* is a fun and engaging paranormal romance that brings Scottish folklore and mystery to life.

If you’re a fan of folklore, magic, and romance, this book is worth picking up.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nFinal Rating: 4.25/5.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I went into this book expecting a lighthearted, spicy monster romance with minimal plot. Instead, the story focused heavily on solving a mysterious curse, which caught me off guard. Because I wasn’t prepared for a more intricate plot, I found myself confused at times, especially with the smaller details. This confusion was entirely my fault for not paying closer attention, but thankfully, I had a buddy-reader who helped clarify things.\n\n- **Narration Style:**  \n  The book was marketed as having \"duet narration,\" but the actual narration style didn’t fully align with my expectations. The male narrator handled the male protagonist’s chapters and lines, while the female narrator did the same for the female protagonist. However, both narrators also voiced the secondary characters, which deviated from the typical duet format. This made it harder for me to keep track of who was speaking, especially in the beginning.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Engagement:**  \n  The middle of the book felt slow and dragged a bit. While I appreciated the author’s unique take on Scottish mythology, I never fully connected with the storyline, which made it challenging to stay invested at times. Despite this, I still found the book enjoyable overall, particularly for its world-building and the themes it explored.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes multiple open-door scenes with explicit descriptions, strong language, and several trigger warnings such as loss of a loved one (recounted), mention of a family member with Alzheimer’s, grief and loss depiction, strained family dynamics, physical violence, blood, fire, fire injury, injury detail, abandonment (recounted), and alcohol consumption.\n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The story features popular tropes like monster romance, grumpy x sunshine, forced proximity, and dislike-to-love. It also delves into deeper themes of identity, choice, and personal growth, as highlighted by the quote: “You are not who you are because of where you come from; you are who you are because of where you choose to go.”\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t fully meet my initial expectations, it offered a unique blend of romance, mythology, and mystery.

            "A certain romance author has become one of my favorites, and after reading *The Nanny*, I knew they’d be an autobuy for me. However, I find myself still chasing the high that book gave me. While her other works, including this one, are enjoyable, they just don’t have the same impact. One of the things I appreciate most about this author is her willingness to explore various contemporary romance subgenres, from paranormal to monster to hockey romances. So, when she announced a Loch Ness monster romance, I was instantly intrigued, especially by the brilliantly designed cover art."

While there’s nothing wrong with her other books, including this one, they just don’t hit me the same way.\n\n- **Genre and Creativity:**  \n  One thing I love about Ferguson is her willingness to explore different types of contemporary romance, from paranormal to monster to hockey romances.

Her grandmother was unwelcoming, which made Key’s situation heartbreaking, while her grandfather became a favorite character and often served as the voice of reason.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The duet narration by Samantha Summers and Flint Park was outstanding. Flint Park, a new narrator, delivered a flawless Scottish accent that added so much to the story. I could easily see him being used in future books.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to readers who love a mix of mystery and romance, dysfunctional family dynamics, and a Scottish setting.

I appreciated the dynamic where Key and Laughlin initially acted as adversaries but ultimately collaborated. Overall, Key's character was impressive with her keen observational skills, sharp problem-solving abilities, and critical thinking—aside from the Bridle oversight.",

Key's poignant backstory of losing her father while attempting to connect with a family she never knew was both heartbreaking and inspiring, drawing me right in. Laughlin is simply charming; his reclusive nature due to his curse, combined with his deep desire to help his father find his way home, adds a layer of depth to his character. I appreciated Laughlin's sarcastic wit and found the arrogant character who clashed with Key on day one—living and working on her grandparents' property—to be a fantastic addition. The enemies-to-lovers trope was executed beautifully, with their close proximity heightening the tension. The banter was entertaining, and their relationship was both steamy and passionate.

I absolutely liked everything about this book — from the beautiful setting to the super sweet romance between the main characters.\n\n- **Uniqueness of the Story:**  \n  I thought the story itself was unique because I’ve never read any paranormal romance about the Loch Ness Monster before. It was such an interesting take on this mythical creature, and I fell in love with how it played out.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Keyanna was a wonderful character that I couldn’t help but adore. Lachlan… ugh, he’s a hot, cursed man who ticked all my boxes so easily.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, this was an incredible read.

            "The plot was generally coherent, though at times a bit predictable. The villain arc added an enjoyable layer, even if it wasn’t the main focus of the romance. The pacing was swift but manageable. However, the conclusion's twist felt lackluster and could have delivered a greater impact.",
            "I really enjoyed the character development of both main characters. The depth provided to the supporting characters was also a nice touch. However, the villain's arc felt rushed, and their backstory lacked the detail needed to clarify their motivations. The romance was emotionally satisfying and packed with genuine feelings. I appreciated that the third-act breakup was concise, lasting just a page and a half, which was a welcome relief.",

            "While Brodie’s storyline was engaging, it fell into predictability, particularly with the cheesy kidnapping plot. The brief third-act breakup, lasting only two pages, felt unnecessary and unwarranted; it seemed to serve merely as a device to enable a scene with Brodie, when the more fitting conclusion would have been Key and Lachlan working together to break the curse. Additionally, I found it frustrating that many romance authors feel compelled to include a baby in the epilogue. Can't we just appreciate a couple's happiness without the added expectation of parenthood? Ugh.",
            "I adored Key and Lachlan's relationship, especially how it intertwined with Lachlan's Loch Ness predicament. The Loch Ness scene was a perfect 12/10—nothing to improve!",

What is stopping all romance authors from being as good as them?  \n\n- **Setting and Authenticity:**  \n  The setting is fantastic. Everything about the Scottish characters and setting felt authentic throughout the whole story.  \n\n- **Main Characters and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  I loved Key and Lachlan and the intertwining of his Loch Ness predicament in their relationship. The Loch Ness ~scene~ was a 12/10, no notes.  \n\n- **Dialogue and References:**  \n  Shoutout to Lana for including both Twilight and Lord of the Rings references in character dialogue. I almost expected a, \"You nicknamed my baby after the Loch Ness Monster?!\" in the epilogue.  \n\n- **Predictability and Plot Issues:**  \n  My only complaints are that Brodie’s story was super predictable, and his whole kidnapping scheme was so cheesy. The tiny third-act breakup, which lasted about two pages, was unnecessary and dumb. I don’t even get why Key would have been so upset. I think it was just thrown in to make the Brodie scene happen, when the closing plot could have just been Key and Lachlan breaking the curse together.  \n\n- **Epilogue and Tropes:**  \n  *Spoiler* I think my new least favorite thing, aside from third-act breakups, is that every romance author feels the need for the couple to have a baby in the epilogue. Can we not ever just see two people be happy without kids?? Ugh.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book, particularly the authentic Scottish setting, the main characters’ relationship, and the clever dialogue references.

His tragic backstory, including losing his parents and being raised by his grandmother, made him deeply sympathetic. His journey to finding love was heartwarming.  \n\n- **Romance Dynamics:**  \n  - The romance features a sunshine x grumpy dynamic, heavy banter, and the trope of “he falls first and harder.”  \n  - The relationship evolves from enemies to lovers, adding tension and depth to the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The Scottish setting is richly woven into the narrative, enhancing the story’s mystical and emotional tone.  \n  - The incorporation of Scottish mythology and the cursed bloodline adds a unique and engaging layer to the plot.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  - The concept is fun and refreshing, offering a new perspective on a well-known legend.  \n  - The pacing keeps the reader engaged, with a mix of emotional depth, banter, and action.  \n\n- **Spice and Tone:**  \n  - The book delivers a good level of spice, making it a satisfying read for fans of monster romance.  \n  - The tone balances humor, heartbreak, and passion effectively.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a highly enjoyable paranormal romance with a unique twist on Scottish mythology and a compelling cursed bloodline storyline. While Keyanna’s character didn’t fully resonate with me, Lachlan’s journey and the romance dynamics made the book a standout. I recommend it to readers looking for a fun, spicy, and emotionally engaging monster romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.9 Stars"

That said, she was the only character I truly loved.\n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The story is predictable but has a fun vibe. I didn’t expect some of the plot twists, especially in the spice scenes—Ferguson really went there! These unexpected moments added a layer of intrigue.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The setting on the shores of Loch Ness provided a unique backdrop for romance and mystery. While it was enjoyable, I felt the world-building could have been more detailed to enhance immersion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was an enjoyable, easy read with likeable characters and unexpected twists, it fell short in creating a fully immersive experience due to a lack of chemistry or deeper world-building. It’s a good choice for those seeking a light-hearted, fun story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars"

The ending gave me everything I wanted, and I had a good time overall.  \n\n- **Creativity and Setting:**  \n  The setting and idea of this book were so creative, unique, and well-executed that I was easily immersed in the story. The way Lana made the legend of the Loch Ness monster her own and incorporated Scottish \"history\" was really interesting. I also enjoyed how she weaved Key and her family into the legend.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The beginning felt like reading a mystery book, with so many questions about the monster and the magic that needed answers. This hooked me in easily. However, the book was longer than I expected, and toward the middle, it did feel like it dragged a little.  \n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**  \n  I love enemies-to-lovers tropes, and the banter turning into flirting was fun and kept me giggling. The tension between Lachlan and Key from the very beginning was amazing, and the way Lachlan called Key \"devil woman\" had me blushing. The smut was also really fun, and the way the monster aspects were incorporated was unexpected but appreciated.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  While I could predict some of the things that happened, I still enjoyed them.

You might find yourself having a good old time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a fun, spicy, and creative read with a unique take on the Loch Ness monster legend.

I typically dislike reading about such problem-solving elements, and this aspect persisted throughout the entire book, which made it challenging for me to fully engage with the story.\n\n- **Characters and Romance:**  \n  The characters and romance, which I expected to carry the story, felt underdeveloped compared to the author’s previous works. I didn’t feel attached to the characters at all, and their dynamics didn’t resonate with me. From the very first page, the tone and vibes felt off, and I struggled to reconcile with this throughout my reading experience.\n\n- **Author Comparison:**  \n  While this book didn’t meet my expectations, I still highly recommend the author’s other works. I believe her previous novels showcase her strengths much more effectively. Despite my disappointment with this particular story, I remain a devoted fan of the author and am eager to explore her future projects.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel had an interesting premise but fell short in execution, particularly in its reliance on tropes I dislike and its weaker character development. While I didn’t connect with this story as much as I’d hoped, it hasn’t diminished my admiration for the author or my enthusiasm for her other works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the setting had potential, the use of Scottish jargon without clear explanations made it difficult to follow initially. The ambiance and tone felt mismatched with the story’s theme, blending multiple genres like Urban Fantasy, War, Romance, and Historical Romance, which made the narrative feel disjointed.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The story had a promising plot, but it was too predictable for my taste. I was hoping for more jaw-dropping twists but found myself a little disappointed. The inclusion of the Loch Ness Monster piqued my curiosity, but the overall execution didn’t fully deliver.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The chemistry between Key and Lachlan felt rushed and shallow, lacking depth. The reason behind Rhona and Duncan’s estrangement also seemed too shallow, making their long-standing family feud hard to believe. On the other hand, Sorcha and Tavish’s love story felt more compelling and could have made a better narrative focus.  \n\n- **Romantic and Steamy Elements:**  \n  The romance was fast-paced, and the steamy scenes were incredibly passionate, bordering on intense. While I’m okay with spicy scenes, the level of explicitness, including coitus with a monster, felt excessive and didn’t align well with the story’s overall tone.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The novel explores themes of forbidden love, family estrangement, small-town secrets, and mythical creatures. While these tropes were intriguing, their execution felt uneven, with some elements overshadowing others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Under Loch and Key* was a wild and steamy read, but it didn’t fully resonate with me.

It was extremely and painfully mediocre.  \n  I didn’t really care about solving the Loch Ness curse, and that was the majority of the story. I was just bored!  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  This ultimately had too much plot for me. It felt like women’s fiction in the first half and mystery-solving in the second half, but with added sex scenes.  \n  Not enough was happening to make it as fantastical as it could’ve been. There were some shifter moments, but it would’ve been better if she had gone full monster romance.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The overusage of the word “c*nt” was distracting. I get it—you like that word and think it’s sexy! But it didn’t add anything for me.  \n\n- **Twists and Ending:**  \n  The villain twist at the end was low-key one of the best parts because it was so out of left field and ridiculous that I had to laugh.  \n  She could’ve kept the epilogue, though. I’m admittedly not an epilogue person to begin with, but we just don’t care.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  I don’t know why I keep reading her books because none of them compare to the werewolf one. None of her books are bad, but none of them are good either. I’m now four books in, and this opinion hasn’t changed, so I might have to call it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a few standout moments, like the unexpected villain twist, it ultimately fell flat for me.

            "The story revolves around Keyanna MacKay, who travels to Scotland to reconnect with her estranged grandparents and uncover the truth behind her father's departure. Meanwhile, Lachlan Greer is burdened by a curse that transforms him into the Loch Ness monster each night, and he is determined to break it.

Their evolving banter shifts from playful flirtation to a profound, obsessive connection, creating a compelling enemies-to-lovers arc filled with tension and passion. The romance is both spicy and heartfelt, marked by moments of vulnerability and longing that deepen their bond. Their chemistry is captivating, striking a balance that is “spicy but never dark.”",

Keyanna's attempts to bond with her grandparents and Lachlan's struggle to reconnect with his mother introduce emotional depth. Their mutual desire to rectify past wrongs serves to unite the characters in compelling ways."

            "The story begins with a compelling premise and engaging dual perspectives from Lachlan and Key. However, around the 60% mark, the plot becomes predictable, culminating in a resolution that feels overly convenient and reliant on magic. Certain elements, like Key's ability to magically track Lachlan, come across as forced and unrealistic.",

The dialogue, especially for specific characters, stood out, adding depth to the narrative.

However, the frequent reliance on magic to resolve conflicts diminished the stakes and made the resolutions feel overly simplistic."

            "I have a soft spot for cryptids, especially one cursed to shift forms in an unbreakable way. The plot was enjoyable, with an intriguing curse at its center. However, it would have been more captivating if the characters had unraveled a riddle on their journey, culminating in the curse's resolution. While each puzzle piece was engaging, the overall progression felt drawn out. At 400 pages, the length felt excessive; this story could have easily fit into 280 pages, especially by omitting unnecessary farming discussions that didn't contribute to the narrative. The pacing was uneven—I appreciated the various adventures, but a better rhythm would have significantly improved the reading experience.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the side characters, particularly Key's grandma and grandpa, as well as Loch's dad—they added great depth to the story. However, there was an excess of internal monologue that detracted from my connection to Key and Loch. On a positive note, the smut was unexpectedly steamy, especially with the giant monster aspect. The story would have greatly benefited from being a concise, smutty romance centered on a shape-shifting cryptid and a curse that needed breaking."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, the book had so much promise with its unique concept of a shape-shifting cryptid and a curse to break. However, the excessive length, slow pacing, and unnecessary internal monologues made it hard to stay invested. While the smut and side characters were highlights, the story would have been far more enjoyable as a shorter, faster-paced romance.",

The plot line was such fun to read about.  \n  - The curse was intriguing, but I think it would have been much better had they been solving lines of a riddle at each journey, for it all to culminate at the end, solving the curse. Each piece in the puzzle was good, but it took too much time to get there.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - I loved the side characters, especially Key's grandma and grandpa. They were a wonderful addition to the story, as was Loch's dad.  \n  - There was a lot of internal thoughts that I didn’t need. It did not make me feel connected to Key or Loch.  \n\n- **Romance and Smut:**  \n  - The smut was surprisingly hot, especially with the giant monster element.  \n  - This would have been 800 times better as a quick little smutty romance about a shape-shifting cryptid and a curse that needed to be broken.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  - The length was excessive—400 pages for what! This could have been pared down to a 280-page romance, especially by skipping the farming talk that in no way added to the story.  \n  - The pacing was off. I enjoyed each little journey they went on, but had this been better paced, it would have been a much better book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had so much promise with its unique concept of a shape-shifting cryptid and a curse to break.

            "The initial 'dislike to love' dynamic between Lachlan and Key was promising, but the story lost its momentum once they became a couple. The third-act breakup was particularly frustrating; while Lachlan tried to explain the curse, Key dismissed his concerns, focusing instead on her own desires and then accusing him of dishonesty. Additionally, the final confrontation with the villain lacked impact. Brodie's character development was mishandled, and the antagonist should have been portrayed as an evil businessman exploiting Lachlan and his father, rather than someone experiencing a mental breakdown. Moreover, the premise of the curse felt implausible; it's hard to believe that over 700 years, no one considered breaking the curse by choosing not to have children.",
            "Lachlan and Key’s relationship lacked emotional depth, and the monster-fighting aspect failed to resonate despite its potential. Although there were intriguing hints about a deeper connection between Lachlan's dad and Key's dad, this angle remained unexplored. Additionally, Brodie’s character showed promise for future development, particularly with the possibility of a romantic subplot involving Rory, which could have added an engaging twist.",
            "The logistics of the curse felt unrealistic—how could no one have ever been caught or failed to reach water by sunset for centuries? Additionally, the 700-year-old journal seemed implausible; its condition and language were inconsistent with a farmer keeping a journal in the 1200s. Shifting the curse's origin to the 1800s would have provided a more credible context.",
            "Having thoroughly enjoyed *The Fake Mate*, I found myself disappointed by the author's later works, such as *The Nanny* and *The Game Changer*. I had high hopes for *Under Loch and Key* due to its intriguing paranormal theme, but it did not meet my expectations. Nevertheless, I'm willing to give the author another chance with *Overruled*."

All of the ambiguous \"she's\" and \"hers\" got to be a little too repetitive for me. I understand it was trying to create a sense of mystery about Lachlan's past, but when reading from both perspectives, it just got a bit tedious. If the story had been told only from Key's perspective, I think it would have played out okay.\n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romance was alright? It definitely had the enemies-to-lovers storyline, and I'm a sucker for that. However, it felt almost too forced. The riddle felt too easy, and I honestly saw all the twists coming. But the book wasn't written to be a suspenseful novel really, so I'll let it slide.\n\n- **Conflict and Stakes:**  \n  I think there was a little of the miscommunication trope with the end of the riddle, but it felt too low-stakes, and the fight in the third act didn't read as genuine because of this.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Overall, the book was okay, but I don't think that I would recommend it to anyone.

The magical elements combined with a family saga added depth, especially as the FMC tries to connect with her estranged family after her father’s death, which was both heartbreaking and endearing.  \n\n- **Audio Performance:**  \n  Flint Park’s Scottish accent was perfect for this novel, immersing me in the Scottish setting and enhancing the atmosphere. Samantha Park also delivered a fantastic performance as the narrator for the FMC, with excellent pacing and inflection.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  Lana Ferguson excels at writing steamy scenes, and this book was no exception. It featured dirty language, a literal monster MC, and plenty of spice. While the dynamics between the MCs were fun, they were also predictable.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The curse plotline and paranormal aspects were enjoyable, but the story overall felt very predictable. There were moments where the dialogue seemed repetitive, which slightly detracted from the experience.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you’re looking for a lighthearted yet spicy monster romance with a touch of magic, I recommend giving “Under Loch and Key” a try.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was predictable and had some repetitive dialogue, it delivered a fun, lighthearted, and steaky monster romance with engaging magical elements and a heartfelt family saga. The audio version, in particular, enhanced the experience with its excellent narration.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The \"will they/won't they\" dynamic didn’t last long enough, which made the middle of the book feel like it drifted from one sex scene to another without much plot progression.  \n\n- **Magical Realism and Themes:**  \n  I really loved the magical realism elements, especially the BIG magic tied to Lachlan's curse. The inclusion of the Loch Ness monster was a delightful and unique touch, giving the monster some much-deserved romantic attention.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main characters, Keyanna \"Key\" McKay and Lachlan Greer, had great chemistry, with sharp words and sparks flying between them. Lachlan’s secrets added depth to his character. The endearing side characters were a highlight, and I’d love to see the twins get their own stories.  \n\n- **Language and Content:**  \n  A word of caution for readers sensitive to explicit language: Lachlan frequently uses the \"c-word\" in his dirty talk, which might not appeal to everyone.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The lush scenery of Scottish lochs and castles was beautifully depicted, adding to the book’s charm and atmosphere.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Under Loch and Key\" is an engaging monster romance with a mix of magical realism, steamy moments, and a captivating Scottish setting.

The MMC came across as rude and condescending, which made it hard for me to see the chemistry between him and the FMC.\n- **Pacing and Plot Focus:** The pacing fell flat for me, especially in the beginning half of the book.

Ferguson always delivers on the sex—monster romances will always be hot. Their relationship grew on me, and they had some really cute moments. The epilogue was adorable (I’m a sucker for girl dads).\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:** The setting of the Scottish Highlands was very cozy and gave perfect fall/winter vibes.\n- **Recommendation:** If the premise seems interesting to you, I’d say pick this book up on release day (December 3rd).\n- **Anticipation for Future Work:** I’m so excited for Ferguson’s next book—the preview has me on the edge of my seat, and I need that book now!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile this book didn’t fully meet my expectations due to issues with engagement, chemistry, and pacing, it still had its strengths, particularly in the romantic and sexual elements, the cozy setting, and the adorable epilogue.

However, it truly wasn’t for me. I also didn’t enjoy the author’s previous work, *Fake Mate*, so I’m not sure if their writing style aligns with my preferences.

However, the pace picked up significantly after the 67% mark, and I found myself engrossed and reading quickly.\n\n- **Character Development and Focus:**  \n  The female main character (FMC) is a witch, but this aspect of her identity wasn’t explored enough until the very end. The author missed opportunities to delve deeper into the witch element, which could have added more depth to the story. Additionally, the frequent use of puppy metaphors felt unnecessary and slightly distracting.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romantic tension between the couple was decent but could have been stronger. The \"spice\" level was a solid 3.5/5, and the swooning factor for the couple was rated 3.25/5. While the romance was enjoyable, it didn’t stand out as particularly memorable.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  While I didn’t dislike the book, I found it somewhat boring and drawn out. As a fan of the author, I felt this particular story wasn’t executed as well as her other works. I wouldn’t strongly recommend it, especially to readers who tend to give up on books quickly if they don’t grab their attention early on.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had its moments, particularly in the latter half, but the slow start, underdeveloped plot, and missed opportunities with the witch element made it less engaging overall.

Of the few monster romances I’ve read, this was the best in terms of execution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had a strong concept and setting, with some creative elements that stood out.

A supernatural romance centered around the Loch Ness monster sounded like so much fun.  \n- **Enjoyment and Expectations:**  \n  The book was fun, but I definitely overhyped it in my head.  \n- **Pacing and Stakes:**  \n  The biggest thing that bothered me was the stakes. It took so long to build up, with super low stakes and the supernatural elements as a very minor plot point. The ending amped it up and became super high stakes, centered around the supernatural elements, which was fun. However, I wish it had that level of stakes and focus on the supernatural elements the whole time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book delivered on some fun elements, especially toward the end, it didn’t fully meet my expectations due to the slow buildup and lack of consistent focus on the supernatural aspects.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️3.5⭐️"

It’s a quick, fun read, even if the plot didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars"

The spicy scenes came one after another in quick succession, which felt overwhelming and poorly paced.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Works:**  \n  I was disappointed but not entirely surprised, as I also didn’t enjoy Lana Ferguson’s previous book, *The Game Changer*. *The Fake Mate* remains the only book of hers that I absolutely love. I’m hopeful that *Overruled* and the second *Fake Mate* book will be favorites.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Under Loch and Key* didn’t work for me due to weak character development, distracting language use, underwhelming plot elements, and poorly executed romantic and spicy scenes. While I pushed through to finish it, I ended up skim-reading from page 200 to the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist's abilities and understanding of her magic felt underdeveloped. It was frustrating that she just \"knew\" how to use her magic without any prior experience or knowledge of its existence. Similarly, her sudden realization that the curse was lifted lacked depth and felt unconvincing.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The narrative had moments that came across as cringe-worthy, detracting from the overall reading experience.  \n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  Despite the criticisms, there’s a reluctant acknowledgment that the reader might return to the author’s works, indicating a mix of frustration and lingering interest.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel left much to be desired in terms of character development and narrative execution, with moments that felt both underdeveloped and cringe-worthy. However, the reader’s conflicted feelings suggest a potential willingness to give the author another chance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores were mentioned in the review."
