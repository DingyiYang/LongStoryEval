The pacing feels unnecessarily slow, which detracts from the overall reading experience.\n\n- **Story Execution:**\n   - While the idea of the novella is intriguing, the execution falls flat. The setting, a private club, is a concept I usually enjoy, but this particular portrayal is poorly handled. The rules of the club, which are repeated twice in quick succession, are poorly formulated and unrealistic. For example, the rule about \"only three consecutive times a month\" is easily circumvented, which breaks immersion and makes the story feel contrived.\n\n- **Consent and Ethical Concerns:**\n   - The biggest issue with the book is its handling of consent. The story presents a disturbing lack of safeguards for the women involved, referred to as \"girls.\" The idea that the \"patreon\" has a free pass to whatever they want, with no regard for the women‚Äôs personal limits or ability to withdraw consent, is deeply troubling. This, combined with the theme of \"selling virgins,\" makes the entire premise feel exploitative and uncomfortable.\n\n- **Characterization and Themes:**\n   - The characters, particularly Cassius and Faith, are poorly developed. Their actions, such as the way they navigate the club‚Äôs rules, feel unrealistic and forced. Additionally, the fetishization of virgins and the extreme measures taken to fulfill this desire come across as distasteful and add to the overall discomfort of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this novella fails to deliver on its potential.

While the concept of a private club setting could have been interesting, the poor handling of the rules, characters, and themes makes it a disappointing read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- The review does not explicitly mention a numerical rating, but the tone and critique suggest a very low score, likely 1 or 2 out of 10."
