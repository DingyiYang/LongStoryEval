As she gains the unsettling ability to inhabit others’ bodies and memories, the boundaries between reality and illusion blur. Fast-paced and engaging, the narrative is gripping and aligns seamlessly with the author’s previous works, meeting high reader expectations.",

The multi-genre approach is well-executed, and the story holds depth and surprises at every turn.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Nora, the main character, is interesting because she didn’t fit in as a kid and hasn’t entirely grown out of that. She has a few friends who accept her quirks, but her relationship with Becca is central to the story. Their friendship starts as an obsessive childhood bond but changes due to a pivotal event explored through flashbacks.

The pacing kept me hooked, and I couldn’t put the book down.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth:**  \n  The author does an excellent job of portraying a wide range of emotions, from grief and worry to fear, anger, frustration, attraction, lust, and vengefulness. This emotional complexity adds depth to the characters and the story.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The novel includes heavy themes such as grief, death of a parent (off-page), blood, mention of sexual assault, self-harm, bullying, toxic relationships, homophobia, murder, and religious intolerance.

            "The story concludes with puzzling details that left me somewhat confused, yet I appreciate the author's decision to avoid a completely open-ended finale. Set in a small town, it centers on two best friends whose lives are forever altered by a traumatic event in their preteen years, prompting them to seek their own form of justice. Years later, four individuals, including Becca, one of the friends, mysteriously disappear. Nora, the other friend, refuses to accept Becca's fate and investigates the town's local folklore, including a dark ritual known as the goddess game. This compelling premise effectively explores the shift from childhood enchantment to the stark realities of adulthood, resonating powerfully with readers.",
            "Nora and Becca's friendship is central to the narrative, despite Becca's absence throughout the book. Nora's memories and her evolving understanding of their shared experiences and trauma authentically illustrate the complexities of childhood best friendships. While a minimal romance with a side character is present, equal attention is given to Nora's new friendships and support system. The author successfully emphasizes Nora's ongoing commitment to these relationships beyond the story's conclusion, which feels both refreshing and realistic. Additionally, a side sapphic romance and a character's backstory involving religious trauma are emotionally resonant, eliciting feelings of anger, horror, and grief.",
            "The writing is neat and engaging, offering a clear and captivating style. While the conclusion is satisfying, it leaves some questions unresolved. This uncertainty may stem from the reader's oversight, the nature of an Advance Reader Copy (ARC), or the author's choice to keep certain details open-ended.",
            "This book delves into themes of loss, adolescence, and the diminishing magic of childhood, effectively capturing the emotional nuances of these transitions. The exploration of religious trauma enriches the narrative, adding depth and emotional resonance to the character’s journey."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a deeply emotional and thought-provoking exploration of friendship, loss, and the transition from childhood to adulthood. The realistic portrayal of relationships, the inclusion of impactful themes like religious trauma, and the evocative writing style make it a compelling read. While the ending leaves some questions unanswered, the overall narrative is satisfying and refreshing in its focus on healthy support systems and personal growth.",

A traumatic event in their preteen years leads them to seek their own justice. Years later, four people, including Becca (one of the friends), disappear in a single night. Nora, the other friend, refuses to accept Becca’s disappearance and delves into the town’s local folklore, including the \"goddess game,\" a dark slumber party ritual tied to a local legend.\n   - The premise effectively captures the transition from childhood magic to the harsh realities of growing up, resonating deeply with the reader.\n\n- **Characterization and Relationships:**\n   - Nora and Becca’s friendship is central, though Becca is missing throughout the book. Nora’s memories and her evolving understanding of their shared experiences and trauma realistically depict a childhood best friendship.\n   - The romance between Nora and a side character is present but minimal, with equal focus given to Nora’s new friendships and support system. The author emphasizes Nora’s continued investment in these new relationships, even after the events of the story, which feels refreshing and realistic.\n   - A side sapphic romance and a character’s backstory involving religious trauma are emotionally impactful, evoking anger, horror, and grief.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**\n   - The book explores themes of loss, growing up, and the fading of childhood magic. It effectively conveys the emotional weight of these transitions.\n   - The inclusion of religious trauma and its impact on a character adds depth and emotional resonance to the narrative.\n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Structure:**\n   - The writing is described as \"neat and tidy,\" with a clear and engaging style.\n   - The conclusion, while satisfying, leaves some questions unanswered. The reader is unsure if this is due to their own oversight, the nature of reading an ARC (Advance Reader Copy), or the author’s intentional choice to leave certain details open-ended.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**\n   - The story concludes with strange and weird details that leave the reader slightly confused. However, the reader appreciates that the author avoids leaving the ending completely open-ended.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a deeply emotional and thought-provoking exploration of friendship, loss, and the transition from childhood to adulthood. The realistic portrayal of relationships, the inclusion of impactful themes like religious trauma, and the evocative writing style make it a compelling read. While the ending leaves some questions unanswered, the overall narrative is satisfying and refreshing in its focus on healthy support systems and personal growth.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "The plot centers on the mysterious disappearance of four individuals in one night, immediately hinting at supernatural elements that elevate the suspense. Rather than relying on the conventional trope of human culprits, the story embraces supernatural horror. While the climax may initially disappoint—particularly with the twist involving the goddess possessing Nora—the absence of a traditional “logical twist,” like a vengeful ghost, proves to be a refreshing surprise. The explanation for Becca’s disappearance is particularly chilling, suggesting brainwashing and captivity, which the author leaves to the reader's imagination.",
            "Nora and Becca stand out as the most developed characters, with Becca’s mysterious disappearance propelling Nora’s investigation and keeping me engaged. Their platonic friendship is refreshingly believable, particularly given their complex history of conflict and steadfast loyalty. The integration of Becca’s photography and Nora’s writing adds depth to their characters. Despite limited screen time, Nora’s sister, Cat, makes a memorable impression in a single comforting scene. Although the love interest, James, is forgettable, his minimal presence in the story makes this a minor concern.",

However, the absence of a “logical twist” (e.g., a vengeful ghost) is itself a surprising and effective twist.\n   - The explanation for Becca’s disappearance is subtly terrifying, with implications of brainwashing and captivity that are left to the reader’s imagination.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - Nora and Becca are the most developed characters, with Becca’s mysterious disappearance driving Nora’s investigation and keeping the reader invested.\n   - Their platonic friendship is refreshing and believable, especially given their history of conflict and unwavering loyalty to each other.\n   - Becca’s photography and Nora’s writing are cleverly integrated into the story, adding depth to their characters.\n   - Nora’s sister, Cat, is memorable despite limited screen time, showcasing her personality in a single comforting scene.\n   - The love interest (James) is forgettable, but his minimal role in the story makes this a minor issue.\n\n- **Themes:**\n   - The novel explores themes of friendship, revenge, justice, belief, and the blurred line between reality and make-believe.\n   - The supernatural elements highlight the fear of the unknown, which is more terrifying than something easily understood.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n“The Bad Ones” by Melissa Albert is a masterfully written YA horror novel with a gripping plot, well-developed characters, and thought-provoking themes. The suspenseful supernatural elements, combined with the refreshing portrayal of platonic friendship, make this a standout read. Despite a minor flaw in the believability of one plot point, the story delivers a satisfying and immersive experience. The year-and-a-half wait for this book was well worth it, and I eagerly anticipate Albert’s next work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 5 stars."

The deep love they share captures the essence of tightly knit bonds, showcasing the lengths one would go for their platonic soulmate.

I don't fault young Rita for her actions; I believe in supporting both women's rights and their wrongs, humorously speaking. At one point, I thought Nora might align with Rita and embrace the goddess's work. If Becca hadn’t been captured and taken away, the two might have explored that path together. However, Nora was deeply affected by the aftermath of their prayer to the goddess of vengeance."

(I support women’s rights but also women’s wrongs, lol.) I almost thought that Nora might agree with Rita and decide to continue the work of the goddess. If Becca hadn’t been taken and trapped away by her, I think the two girls might have been up for something like that.

While this exploration of grief and toxic bonds is compelling, it also felt unsettling and uncomfortable.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing of the book is slow and plodding, which may not appeal to readers looking for a faster-paced narrative. However, the slower pace aligns with the book's focus on grief and the process of finding peace after loss.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The novel is categorized as YA, horror fiction, and paranormal. It maintains a dark and mesmerizing tone throughout, which effectively captures the eerie and unsettling atmosphere of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Bad Ones* by Melissa Albert is a haunting and thought-provoking novel that delves into the complexities of grief, toxic relationships, and the supernatural. While its themes and tone are compelling, the inclusion of paranormal elements and witchcraft made it challenging for me to finish. The slow pacing, though intentional, may not resonate with all readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "While the romance element felt unnecessary and didn't contribute meaningfully to the story or characters, I was captivated by the mystery at its core. The plot centers on the sudden disappearance of four individuals in one night, leaving behind clues for the friend of one victim. I particularly enjoyed the unsettling children’s game that drives the narrative, which kept me guessing throughout. Despite the gripping buildup, the ending didn’t quite deliver the impact I had hoped for. Nonetheless, I completed the last half of the story in a day, eager to see how it would unfold.",

I would have preferred to explore Becca's experiences from her own perspective instead of relying solely on Nora's point of view.",
            "Nora and Becca's friendship deepens throughout the story, revealing more of Becca's struggles. Given her fragile mental state, her vulnerability to the goddess games and the goddess herself makes sense. However, I was taken aback by the twist that it wasn’t Becca at all.",
            "I admire the author's willingness to embrace darkness in her narratives. Her characters and stories often dwell in complexity rather than lightheartedness. Even when the ending is not negative, it doesn't equate to a happily ever after. The book effectively conveys a lingering sense of unresolved tension and trauma, leaving me with the impression of unfinished business.",

The book maintains a sense of unresolved tension and trauma, leaving the reader with the feeling that there's unfinished business.  \n\n- **Themes and Premise:**  \n  *The Bad Ones* is billed as a story about semi-toxic friendships and the thin line between reality and make-believe in children's games. It mostly lives up to that billing, exploring the complexities of Nora and Becca's friendship, which doesn't seem particularly equal or healthy at first.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  This book was hard for me to put down, even in the slower parts. The narrative kept me hooked throughout, despite some lingering questions about the plot.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nora and Becca's friendship evolves as the story progresses, and we learn more about Becca's experiences. Given her implicit fragile mental state, her susceptibility to the goddess games and the \"goddess\" herself is not surprising. However, I was surprised by the twist that it wasn't Becca at all.  \n\n- **Plot Clarity and Resolution:**  \n  I wasn't entirely clear on what happened to Becca's body while the goddess was possessing Nora or how Becca came back with such scarred lungs. I would have liked to read more about Becca's experiences from her own perspective, rather than solely through Nora's POV.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Bad Ones* is a compelling and dark exploration of friendship, trauma, and the blurred lines between reality and imagination.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Complexity and Pacing:**\n   - The book feels very complicated to read and is not something you can binge in one go. The plot is thick, which might be a drawback for some readers, but I found it enjoyable because Melissa Albert kept the narrative thread consistent throughout the story.\n\n- **Horror Elements and Characters:**\n   - The horror aspects are well-scattered throughout the book, adding to the overall atmosphere. Characters like Ruth and James are particularly enjoyable. Nora, the main character, is very likable, though her fate at the hands of the goddess felt a bit inconsistent with the goddess's usual targets (e.g., murderers, pedophiles, and implied school shooters). Nora's actions (lying as a kid) didn't seem severe enough to warrant such a fate, but this twist added tension and intrigue to the plot.\n\n- **Plot Engagement and Breadcrumbs:**\n   - The book kept me engaged even when I wasn’t reading it. There were many breadcrumbs about how the story could end and who could be trusted, which made me deliberate on the plot constantly. The ending tied everything together nicely, leaving me satisfied as a reader.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Critique:**\n   - Despite the complexity and the many layers of the plot, Albert did an incredible job of maintaining consistency. The book was an incredibly enjoyable read, though the sheer amount of content and some plot inconsistencies (like Nora's fate) kept it from being a five-star read for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a complex, layered read that rewards careful attention. While some aspects of the plot felt inconsistent, the overall narrative was engaging and satisfying. Melissa Albert’s ability to maintain a consistent thread throughout the story made it a highly enjoyable experience, even if it wasn’t perfect.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 4 out of 5 stars."

            "The ending didn't quite meet my expectations. Although I enjoyed the unexpected twists, they felt underexplained, particularly regarding the supernatural elements.

            "Set in a small U.S. village, the story follows Nora as she confronts her ex-best friend, Becca, after receiving a cryptic message. Shortly after, four people—including Becca—vanish under mysterious circumstances. Becca leaves a series of clues that lead Nora to uncover an urban legend about a vengeful goddess targeting those who have committed terrible deeds. Although the prologue was gripping, I found the pacing sluggish, making it difficult for the story to fully engage me initially. The ending felt a bit rushed, but it included a surprising twist I didn't see coming, which left a lasting impression.",

However, I felt the mythology could have been more developed; additional insights into the goddess's origins, motivations, and history would have added greater depth to the narrative.",
            "Although the book is labeled a horror novel with sinister elements, I find that classification somewhat misleading. The prologue effectively establishes an eerie, supernatural atmosphere that truly scared me—best read during the day. However, the rest of the story does not align with traditional horror tropes."

While the prologue was gripping, the story took a while to fully capture my attention.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Becca came across as quite toxic in her relationship with Nora, which added an interesting layer to their dynamic. James, on the other hand, seemed underutilized at times, though he appeared to be the only character genuinely willing to help Nora.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  I enjoyed the urban legend of the vengeful goddess and how the backstory unfolded as the characters’ fates were revealed. However, I wished for more depth in the mythology—details about the goddess’s origins, motivations, and history would have enriched the narrative.  \n\n- **Ending and Surprises:**  \n  The ending felt somewhat rushed, but it delivered a surprising twist that I didn’t see coming.

Elements like a school rhyme, a stranger at a sleepover, and ominous late-night texts create a sense of uncertainty that quietly escalates. The unfolding mysteries keep the reader engaged. However, the middle section slows significantly, diminishing the initial creep factor and tension, though the ending offers some redemption. While the beginning skillfully builds suspense, the latter half lacks significant events, such as murders or disappearances, that could maintain that momentum. Although the conclusion provides resolution, the reveal of the underlying mystery diminishes much of the unsettling tension that initially captured the reader’s interest.",

            "This story centers on the mysterious disappearances of four individuals, including Nora’s best friend, Becca, who leaves behind clues linked to an urban legend and a childhood game. While the pacing is slow, it maintains sufficient tension to keep readers engaged, though it lacks moments of high intensity or urgency. The incorporation of rhyme and the way the clues interconnect are skillfully executed, even if the plot itself isn't particularly original. Some elements remain unexplained or unresolved, adding intrigue and offering \"brain food\" for those who appreciate lingering questions. However, readers who favor neatly wrapped-up endings may find this ambiguity unsatisfying.",
            "Nora and Becca are intricately crafted characters, though their flaws make them less than likable. Their complex friendship, marked by loss and unresolved tension, offers a compelling perspective for the story. The supporting cast is unique and authentic, though the large ensemble leaves some characters underdeveloped.",
            "The writing includes some awkward phrasing and odd word choices that occasionally disrupt the flow. The romance subplot feels unnecessary and fails to enhance the story; a different approach to its development could have been more effective. Despite these flaws, the book remains engaging and keeps readers turning the pages.",
            "This book is a slow-burn supernatural thriller set in a small town steeped in urban legends. It evokes a chilling atmosphere, particularly through the haunting rhyme: “Goddess, Goddess, count to one, who will you pick when the day is done?” The tension is palpable, creating a creepy vibe without crossing into nightmare territory, making it ideal for readers who appreciate supernatural thrillers without the intensity of extreme horror."

Three other people from her small town also vanish on the same night. Nora investigates the connection between Becca’s disappearance and the others, uncovering a haunting story about friendship and trauma.\n\n- **Tone and Writing Style:**\n   - Melissa Albert’s writing is masterful, and the tone is perfectly suited for a horror novel. The atmospheric quality enhances the story’s impact.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - The characters are well-written and avoid the common trope of lacking common sense, which is often seen in horror/suspense/fantasy genres. They feel realistic and relatable.\n\n- **Pacing:**\n   - The story moves quickly, but the pacing allows for natural stopping points at the end of each chapter, making it easy to read in intervals.\n\n- **Unresolved Questions (Spoilers):**\n   - **Nora’s Hunger:** Nora’s constant craving for candy is linked to the goddess, but this connection is never explicitly explained.\n   - **The Eyeless Angel:** The angel’s significance is emphasized (it’s even on the book cover), but its role in the story feels unresolved. Nora’s interaction with it and the urban legend surrounding it don’t lead to a clear payoff.\n   - **The Goddess/Entity:** The nature of the goddess remains unclear. Is it Patty, something Ekstrom created, or an entity that has always existed in Palmetto? This ambiguity detracts from the story’s resolution.\n   - **Ekstrom’s Fate:** Ekstrom’s retirement is mentioned, but her ultimate fate and whether she learns the truth about the entity are left unanswered.\n   - **James’ Role:** James feels like an unnecessary character. His presence doesn’t significantly advance the plot, and Ruth could have fulfilled his role without issue.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*The Bad Ones* is a compelling YA Gothic/Horror novel with strong writing, well-crafted characters, and an engaging plot.

            "The twist involving Ms. Ekstrom is skillfully crafted, with subtle clues woven throughout the story. It delivers a satisfying surprise without veering into predictability. The pacing effectively maintains engagement, striking a good balance among mystery, character interactions, and paranormal elements. However, Becca's return seems superfluous to Nora's character development and the resolution of the goddess storyline. Her role primarily serves as an info dump about Nora and the goddess, failing to add significant value to the lore or plot. The explanations offered feel redundant and do not enhance the understanding of the goddess's nature.",

Nora, the protagonist, is both capable and realistically dependent on others, skillfully sidestepping the perfect hero trope. The relationship between James and Nora is thoughtfully developed, steering clear of the toxic or codependent dynamics often found in YA novels. Their connection is natural, adorable, and healthy, complementing rather than overshadowing the main plot.",

            "The prologue is intriguing, but the story takes time to regain its momentum. It’s a slow burn, and I wished Nora had approached her investigation with greater urgency. The stakes would have felt higher if she had been under more pressure to find Becca quickly. While the goddess lore is interesting, it often feels overexplained and redundant, particularly when reiterated by multiple characters. The frequent shifts in POV and time periods can be jarring; although the flashbacks between Nora and Becca add depth to their relationship, the 1960s flashback seems unnecessary and disrupts the narrative flow—this could have been summarized by the teacher character. However, the ending is satisfying, avoiding unnecessary shock-value deaths, and leaves me content with the story.",

            "The story centers on the mysterious disappearance of four people, including Nora’s former best friend, Becca. As Nora delves into the dark history of Palmetto, she uncovers a compelling legend about a goddess and a game that has captivated local girls for decades. The rich lore surrounding the goddess and the game dominates the narrative. I would have appreciated a more ambiguous ending, as the powerful mythos seemed at odds with a definitive conclusion. Additionally, the romance subplot felt unnecessary; the story might have benefited from its removal or, even better, if Nora and Becca had been romantically involved, as I find queer relationships more engaging.",
            "This novel explores the dark underbelly of girlhood and friendship through the all-consuming, co-dependent, and beautifully flawed relationship between Nora and Becca. As Nora reflects on her experiences, the story offers a poignant homage to the messiness of friendships and the complexities of growing up as a young girl.",
            "I would classify this as a YA supernatural thriller. It's more eerie than horrifying, with no gore, making it suitable for those who usually shy away from horror. The atmosphere is tense and foreboding from the outset, sustaining a sinister feel throughout, reminiscent of the suspenseful tone of the *Jaws* theme song."

As the story unfolded slowly with Nora piecing things together, the timely revelations about the three other missing individuals, aside from Becca, kept me intrigued. However, the ending fell flat; it felt rushed and unresolved, particularly concerning Becca’s explanation in the hospital and the lack of closure regarding the toxic friendship.",
            "Nora is a relatable protagonist, but her character arc feels underdeveloped. The narrative hints at her realizing Becca's manipulative nature and the toxic dynamics of their friendship, yet this exploration remains incomplete. By the end, Nora seems to overlook the negative aspects of her relationship with Becca, which is disappointing. Additionally, the story's attempt to justify Becca's harmful behavior through her trauma undermines the seriousness of their friendship's toxicity. Becca's explanation from a hospital bed comes across as rushed and unsatisfying, leaving key emotional developments unexplored.",

However, the ending felt rushed, particularly given the buildup to the climax, and the aftermath was glossed over, resulting in some unclear details. Initially, the romance seemed forced, but I grew to accept it by the end. While I didn’t dislike the love interest, they often felt like an unnecessary addition.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  - Around the halfway point, I wasn't sure if I was fully engaged, but the story picked up significantly afterward, leaving me mostly satisfied.  \n  - The ending felt rushed, especially considering the buildup to the climax. The aftermath was breezed through, leaving some details unclear.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - The story is twisty, blending contemporary elements about friendship and childhood beliefs with horror and thriller aspects.  \n  - The exploration of Nora and Becca's frayed friendship was compelling enough to carry the entire book.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  - The romance initially felt forced into the narrative, but I eventually came around to it by the end.  \n  - The love interest, while not disliked as a character, often felt tacked on.  \n  - The story might have been stronger without the romance, especially since it wasn’t between Nora and Becca, which could have added more complexity and toxicity.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The prose occasionally dipped into overly flowery metaphors that seemed disconnected within the same paragraph, making it a bit confusing at times.  \n  - While not unreadable, the writing style could have been more consistent and less excessive.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author's Other Work:**  \n  - I liked this book more than *Our Crooked Hearts*, though fans of that book will likely enjoy this one too.  \n  - *The Bad Ones* shares similar vibes but executes them better.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Bad Ones* is a twisty, genre-blending novel with a strong focus on friendship and a mix of contemporary and horror elements. While the romance subplot felt unnecessary and the ending was rushed, the exploration of Nora and Becca's relationship was compelling enough to carry the story. The writing style, though occasionally overly flowery, didn’t detract too much from the experience. It’s a solid read, especially for fans of the author’s previous work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story is genuinely eerie and twisty, keeping me as lost and uncertain as the protagonist, Nora. The unpredictable plot adds to its intrigue.

Although Nora and Becca weren't speaking, Becca's last message—an \"I love you\" text—compels Nora to visit her house, only to find Becca missing. The narrative unveils that one of the missing individuals was a teacher with a dark past as a pedophile. \n\nAs Nora investigates, she discovers clues left by Becca, including a butterfly knife and a cherished photo of their goddess, as well as Ben, a lighthearted matchmaker, who processes a roll of photos for her. The goddess game, which the girls learned as kids, serves as a trust exercise to attract the goddess’s attention, even if it means risking their lives.\n\nThe plot thickens with eerie revelations, including an incident from the 80s involving a murder covered up by the principal. As Nora begins to black out, it becomes clear that Becca has been claimed by the goddess. To save her, Nora decides to play the goddess game one last time. Miraculously, Becca intervenes, revealing that during her absence, she wandered through a strange house and, upon nightfall, entered Nora's consciousness, leading to Nora's blackouts and cryptic messages.\n\nThe story concludes on a hopeful note as Becca recovers and Nora finds love with Ben. Ultimately, the book delivers a satisfying resolution that seamlessly ties together its paranormal elements and character arcs.",

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book and how intoxicating it was.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The plot itself was spine-chilling, and I felt I was constantly on the verge of solving the mystery that would explain the sinister disappearances. Once the dark histories came to light and the story reached its conclusion, I can say I was positively satisfied. I had already enjoyed most of the book, and the ending wrapped everything together nicely.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  A few parts bored me somewhat, but I got past these moments easily due to the short chapter length and quickly grew excited again.  \n\n- **Characterization and Relationships:**  \n  Although I didn't resonate with the characters, I was still fascinated with the relationship dynamics (aside from the romance that felt out of place). The book explores how much trust people are willing to put in their best friend, which was intriguing.  \n\n- **Themes and Genre Appeal:**  \n  *The Bad Ones* deals with friendships that can be toxic to a certain degree, buried secrets revolving around the supernatural, and when playing pretend becomes more real. If you’re interested in supernatural mystery/thrillers or the dark complexities of friendship, *The Bad Ones* is worth checking out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Bad Ones* was a captivating read with a spine-chilling plot and satisfying conclusion.

The narrative centers on the mysterious overnight disappearance of four individuals from a small town, including Nora's best friend, Becca.

The narrative highlights the persistence of goodness in a world filled with challenges, as seen through Nora's mind-reading abilities. Similar to *The Giver*, the weight of knowledge can feel burdensome when faced with so much negativity. Yet, it ultimately reassures us of the presence of good, echoing the sentiment that “ignorance is an epidemic, malevolence is not.”"

The imagery is great, and while the book is almost 400 pages long, I felt exhausted by around page 150. However, I can’t think of anything that could be edited out, which is a big deal for me. Albert does an excellent job of setting up the scene.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  Albert doesn’t reveal what’s happening to Nora until about three-quarters of the way through the book.

A sequel or follow-up would be great to explore this further.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book does a great job of showing how friendships can be overwhelming, even with a magical element. Albert never explicitly states this, but she effectively demonstrates it. The story also reminds us that, despite the overwhelming amount of bad in the world, there is still good. Nora’s experience, like being a mind reader, highlights this. It’s similar to *The Giver* in that the “Knowing” can be overwhelming because there’s so much that’s bad. But it also reminds us that there is good, as summarized in a quote I recently read: “Ignorance is an epidemic, malevolence is not.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a deep and thought-provoking read. While it was dense and exhausting at times, the imagery, character development, and themes made it worthwhile. I hope there’s a sequel to explore Nora’s future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5-4/5"

            "This 400-page novel often lacks the detail needed to fully develop its story. The romance subplot feels unnecessary, detracting from the narrative rather than enhancing it. Nora’s relationship with her boyfriend, initially introduced by Becca, overshadows the potential exploration of toxic friendships. The ending would have been more impactful had it centered on Nora spending time with her new friends instead. While the premise—four people going missing in one night, with Nora investigating her best friend Becca’s disappearance—promises a compelling exploration of intense youth relationships, it ultimately falls short. Despite its intriguing setup and genuinely creepy moments, the story fails to fully realize its potential.",

            "The romance between James and Nora felt unnecessary and detracted from the story. Men and women can have deep, meaningful friendships without the need for romantic involvement, which would have served the same narrative purpose. The forced inclusion of romance was frustrating, particularly because it could have created a perfect parallel to their respective friendships with Becca.",

The inclusion of romance felt forced and irked me, especially since it could have been a perfect parallel to their respective friendships with Becca.  \n\n- **Prose and Atmosphere:**  \n  The prose was absolutely gorgeous, and the story had an unnerving, dark beauty to it.

            "The story captivates from the very first sentence, drawing me into its intriguing mystery. The pacing of the reveals, particularly the final twist, is expertly crafted and keeps me engaged throughout. The author strikes a perfect balance between magic and horror, with folklore elements seamlessly woven into the missing-persons narrative. Initially, the multiple storylines appear disconnected, but they converge effectively by the end. While the reveals are satisfying, some logistical elements, such as Becca's whereabouts during her disappearance, can be perplexing. Nonetheless, the exploration of toxic friendships and the power of belief adds significant depth to the overall story.",

The exploration of toxic friendships and the power of imagination is executed effectively. However, some side characters, such as the lit mag crew, James (the love interest), and family members Cat and Miranda, feel underdeveloped, which could have added depth to certain scenes. The intense focus on Nora and Becca is justified by their dangerously consuming relationship, exemplified through the Goddess Game.",

If anyone has leads on her grocery lists or post-it reminders, I’m all ears. I would have liked this book even more if I didn’t know the level of creepy, dark, gory, evil-girl, witchy, fairytale, gritty, glamorous magic she’s capable of. But I do, so this felt like a level below her usual standard.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Book:**  \n  I liked some things about this book—evil girls, friendship, and possession were highlights for me.  \n\n- **Weaknesses of the Book:**  \n  However, there were aspects I didn’t enjoy as much, such as the thrown-in romance with a guy who has a bob, the abrupt ending, the eh relationships, and the somewhat inconsistent deus ex machina logic around the creepy, nonsensical magic.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Loyalty to the Author:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I like Melissa Albert’s work at least a little bit. As long as she keeps writing about creepy, evil magic girls, I’ll keep reading.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t quite meet the high expectations set by Melissa Albert’s previous works, it still had enough of her signature dark, magical charm to keep me engaged.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "I read about 75% of the book in a single day, which speaks to its initial engagement. However, my interest waned as the story progressed. It attempted to blend too many genres—thriller, horror, romance, and fantasy—ultimately losing focus. The ending felt abrupt and underdeveloped, leaving many threads unresolved and me with more questions than answers. The resolution of the goddess mystery was particularly disappointing, leading to an unsatisfying conclusion.",
            "I found the dynamic between Becca and Nora engaging and wished there had been more focus on their relationship and less on other elements. The love interest seemed unnecessary, lacking personality and serving only to advance Nora's storyline. His presence detracted from the main plot, and I often tuned out during his scenes. The supporting characters, including Nora's friends and those linked to the mystery, were forgettable, often blending together. I was even confused by Nora's sister when she was mentioned.",
            "I appreciated the rich lore of the goddess game and the school's intriguing history. The mystery and horror elements were captivating; however, the age range felt inconsistent. The characters often lacked the authentic voice and behavior of teenagers, with minimal adult oversight. Nora’s parents, for instance, seemed almost absent, which felt unrealistic given the context of four missing individuals. Additionally, the language used by the teens made them come across as significantly older, detracting from their believability.",

I wanted more of that and less of the other elements.  \n   - The love interest felt entirely unnecessary. He had very little personality and seemed to exist only to push along Nora's storyline. His presence detracted from the main plot, and I found myself tuning out during his scenes.  \n   - The secondary characters (Nora's other friends and people tied to the mystery) were forgettable. I couldn't distinguish between them when they were on-page, and Nora's sister was so forgettable that I was confused when she was mentioned.  \n\n- **Setting and Lore:**  \n   - I enjoyed the lore behind the goddess game and the history of the school. The mystery/horror aspect was intriguing.  \n\n- **Age Appropriateness and Realism:**  \n   - The age range didn’t fit well. The characters didn’t speak or behave like teenagers most of the time.  \n   - There was close to zero adult oversight.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **First Impressions and Tone:**  \n  My first impression was that of a chuckle, as this reads like your typical YA novel with all the high school antics and cliques. Sleepovers, mysterious woods, and teachers or faculty you either hate or find creepy are all present. Teens are portrayed as wanting to individualize while also fitting in.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story begins with Nora searching for Becca, one of four people who go missing simultaneously in one night without a trace. Nora, the protagonist, is estranged from Becca at the time but is determined to uncover what happened. The premise revolves around the \"Goddess Game,\" which feels like a mix of urban legend and true story. It’s a form of pagan magic that seems to grant the power to exact revenge on enemies, which fits the high school setting perfectly, even if it feels a bit petty.\n\n- **Pacing and Clarity:**  \n  I found myself midway through the audiobook before I could fully grasp the story’s placement. The premise was initially confusing, especially since the goddess entity doesn’t surface until the end. However, once awakened, the goddess becomes a central force that must feed, adding a layer of intrigue.\n\n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  The book blends horror and fantasy elements, making it a great listen for the YA crowd. The cover art is striking, and the audiobook format enhances the experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is an engaging mix of YA tropes, mystery, and supernatural elements. While the premise can be confusing at first, the story builds momentum and delivers a satisfying blend of horror and fantasy. It’s a great pick for YA readers who enjoy a touch of the eerie and mysterious.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.00 ⭐⭐⭐⭐"

            "The story follows Eleanor, a high school student whose best friend Becca goes missing alongside a teacher and two classmates. This event prompts Eleanor to investigate their disappearances, leading her to uncover clues and revisit childhood memories, including a mysterious Goddess game they once played. As the plot weaves between past and present, strange occurrences and vivid dreams introduce a mystical layer to the mystery. A key question arises: why is Becca, who seemingly did nothing wrong, among the missing when others had wronged someone?\n\nThe story begins strong, with an intriguing setup and a compelling mystery. However, it loses momentum over time. The pacing slows considerably, and the plot becomes convoluted, with too many elements vying for attention. The book feels overly long, and trimming certain subplots or details could have resulted in a tighter narrative.",
            "Eleanor emerges as a determined and inquisitive protagonist, motivated by unresolved issues from her last argument with Becca and a desire to uncover the truth. Flashbacks and clues shed light on Becca's character, illustrating her struggles with her stepmother and her secretive tendencies. Meanwhile, James, a mysterious figure who provides clues related to Becca, becomes Eleanor's ally in her pursuit; however, his character lacks depth and feels somewhat unrealistic.",
            "The author employs vivid and unconventional descriptions, such as “his words were seaworthy” and “he had the look of someone who peeled his rib cage back to let me see his beating heart.” While imaginative, these metaphors can be jarring and disrupt the reading flow. Additionally, the narrative feels overly lengthy and tends to drag, particularly in the latter half, making it challenging to maintain interest.",
            "The first half of the book is engaging, featuring a captivating mystery and intriguing character dynamics. However, the latter half loses momentum, resulting in disappointment. The book's length and certain stylistic choices hindered full immersion in the story."

Nora takes it upon herself to find Becca, uncovering clues that suggest their childhood \"Goddess game\" might be more than just a game. The last half of the book was my favorite, with lots of twists and turns that ramped up the mystery and horror, making it a page-turner. However, the pacing felt uneven, especially with the frequent and oddly timed shifts between past and present.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nora is the primary perspective for most of the book, and we spend a lot of time in her head. While her determination is compelling, her questionable decisions became grating at times. Another perspective is introduced toward the end, but I wish it had been intertwined more from the start to add depth and balance.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  The horror elements in *The Bad Ones* are very light, which might appeal to those who prefer less graphic horror. However, the supernatural aspects of the story lack logical explanations, which could frustrate analytical readers like me. While I understand that logical inconsistencies are common in horror, they were particularly noticeable here.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing style wasn’t my favorite. It often felt choppy, both within and between scenes, which contributed to the uneven pacing. The shifts between timelines were also executed at odd moments, disrupting the flow of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, *The Bad Ones* is a fun read for fans of YA horror who don’t mind a slow start and unexplained supernatural elements.

The central question is whether the gang can break the curse and make it back home. The premise reminded me of the book *Direwood*, as both involve teenagers being transported to another reality and fighting to return.

YA novels, especially those with horror elements, might not resonate with me as much as they would with younger readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the novel had potential, the execution fell flat for me. The characters lacked depth, the horror elements felt unconvincing, and the story failed to fully engage me. However, this could be due to my age and personal preferences, so younger readers might enjoy it more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While it was atmospheric and strange, I didn’t find it super suspenseful. The ending and reveal felt rushed, and I would have appreciated more explanation about how the lore of the goddess worked, particularly during the reveal.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The toxic friendship between Nora and Becca was developed very well. Nora’s journey to uncover the truth about Becca’s disappearance, along with her strange dreams and losses of time, added depth to her character.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Lore:**  \n  The lore of the goddess was intriguing and worked well to drive the story. The goddess game, which evolved from an innocent childhood activity to something more dangerous, added a unique and eerie element to the narrative.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Genre Suitability:**  \n  This is a great read for younger audiences or those looking for a lighter horror or thriller. It lacks gore and is very light on romance, making it suitable for readers who prefer less intense content.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Work:**  \n  While I loved *Our Crooked Hearts*, this book didn’t quite hit the same mark for me. It shares the same dark atmosphere and mystery elements but felt less engaging overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis YA thriller offers an interesting mix of occult vibes, atmospheric storytelling, and a well-developed toxic friendship. While the slow pacing and rushed ending detracted from the suspense, the lore and eerie tone make it a solid choice for younger readers or those seeking a lighter horror experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The novel is marketed as \"horror,\" but I would classify it more as \"Dark Fantasy.\" It has a dark and mysterious tone but doesn't feel particularly scary, making it suitable for readers who enjoy paranormal themes without the intensity of traditional horror.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story revolves around Nora, whose best friend Becca disappears along with three others in a small town. Nora embarks on a quest to uncover the truth, following clues left by Becca. As she delves deeper, she begins experiencing inexplicable events that mirror Becca's experiences before her disappearance. The plot is intriguing and keeps the reader engaged until the end, with themes of revenge, friendship, and ancient goddesses woven throughout.\n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**  \n  The book is fast-paced and easy to read, written in a straightforward style. The mystery surrounding the disappearances and the supernatural elements maintain a high level of intrigue, making it hard to put down.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  While the premise and buildup were strong, I found the ending disappointing. It felt like it detracted from the overall quality of the story and left me wanting more.\n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The novel includes well-executed LGBTQ+ representation, which added depth and inclusivity to the narrative. This aspect was a highlight for me and earned the book extra points.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a compelling dark fantasy novel with an engaging mystery and a unique premise. While the ending fell short for me, the strong representation and intriguing plot make it a worthwhile read, especially for those who enjoy paranormal stories without the intensity of horror.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall: 3.5/5 (with an extra 0.5 for LGBTQ+ representation)."

The mystery surrounding the disappearances and the goddess game had potential but could have been explored more thoroughly.

The romantic tension added little value and could have been entirely omitted without consequence. \n\nOn a positive note, the ending offered a surprising twist that effectively tied the story together.

            "The relationship between Nora and James was captivating, particularly the way Becca subtly influenced James to consider Nora as a romantic interest. I found myself pondering how much Nora shared with James about her 'possession' and her behavior during those episodes. While their slow dance at Sloan's house seemed to mark the beginning of their relationship, it wasn’t the story's main focus. I suspected midway through that Nora was the one committing the murders, not Becca, despite her being possessed by both Becca and the 'goddess.' The ongoing mystery of Nora waking up with unexplained ash on her coat, along with bruises and scrapes, kept me engaged. The narrative weaves in vague consequences and significant criminal elements.",

A standout moment was Ruth's responsible choice to call Nora's parents after she noticed Nora's bruise and saw her run off after drinking.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  - The novel is a weird, small-town American Gothic type of story.  \n  - It is gory, cruel, and consistently spooky throughout.  \n  - The disturbing content gave me unsettling dreams.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  - I figured out halfway through that Nora was the one killing people, not Becca, though Nora was being possessed by both Becca and the 'goddess.'  \n  - The mystery of Nora waking up with unexplained ash on her coat and bruises/scrapes kept me intrigued.  \n  - The story involves vague punishments and a lot of crime.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Development:**  \n  - I appreciated the exploration of friendships, especially how they evolve from childhood to adulthood.  \n  - The impact of trauma and grief on these relationships was well-portrayed.  \n  - Ruth's responsible action of calling Nora's parents when Nora showed her bruise and ran off after drinking was a standout moment.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  - The relationship between Nora and James was intriguing, especially how Becca planted the idea in James's head that Nora was the one he should date.  \n  - I wondered how much Nora revealed to James about her 'possession' and her actions during those trances.  \n  - The slow dance at Sloan's house might have been the start of their relationship, but it was never the focus of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was a gripping and eerie read, though not something I would typically choose. It effectively blended elements of horror, mystery, and character-driven drama, with a strong focus on the psychological effects of trauma and grief. While the gory and cruel aspects were unsettling, the exploration of relationships and the small-town Gothic atmosphere made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The final chapters left me feeling confused, leading me to revisit the first two chapters for clarity. The twist that Nora kidnapped the victims while possessed by the demon felt forced and unconvincing. Subsequent twists, like Becca being alive and escaping the demon's mind prison, seemed excessive and poorly executed. Additionally, the portrayal of demonic possession and the demon's abilities, including its power to open portals, appeared inconsistent and illogical. Becca’s unexplained supernatural healing and the sudden growth of teeth after her escape added to the confusion. Furthermore, the demon’s inability to control Nora, despite its supposed power, diminished its credibility as a threat.",
            "Becca's transformation into a mass killer and her dysfunctional friendship with Nora present a disturbing dynamic that is hard to reconcile. Their relationship is marked by violence, co-dependency, and toxicity, making it challenging to sympathize with either character. In contrast, Rita Elkstom and Patty's tragic love story is far more compelling than the bond between Nora and Becca. Becca's decision to assume Rita's role as a Vengeance Goddess/Demon, targeting innocent people, raises significant ethical questions about her morality. The portrayal of characters like Kurt, Chloe, and Tate as flawed yet somewhat redeemable provides a stark contrast to Becca's grim choices. Ultimately, Rita Elkstom’s motivations and regrets come across as more nuanced, rendering her a more intriguing character."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the novel had intriguing elements, such as Rita Elkstom's backstory and the initial setup of demonic possession, the plot became overly convoluted and riddled with inconsistencies. The characters' choices and relationships were often hard to empathize with, and the constant twists felt contrived. The unresolved questions and illogical supernatural elements detracted from the overall experience, making the story less satisfying upon reflection.",

This distinct atmosphere lingered long after I finished reading. While the lore surrounding the goddess, the high school mysteries, and the investigation captivated me, certain elements felt underdeveloped—particularly the goddess's sweet tooth and Miss Ekstrom's choice of Becca, which were never fully explained.

This is a recurring issue for me, as I keep picking up YA books and being let down when they don’t resonate with me as they once did.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - The setting was one of the strongest aspects of the book.

Nora, the main character, didn’t resonate with me as much; I found her boring at times. James, on the other hand, was a standout character, though the forced romance between him and Nora felt unnecessary and added little to the story.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**\n   - The use of alternating perspectives—first-person for Nora’s chapters and third-person for the objective recounting of past events—was intriguing but occasionally confusing. I appreciated the insight into events the protagonist didn’t know, but I wish the author had stuck to third-person narration throughout.\n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**\n   - The lore surrounding the goddess, the high school mysteries, and the investigation were fascinating, though some elements felt underdeveloped. For example, the goddess’s craving for sweets and Miss Ekstrom’s choice of Becca were never fully explained.

            "The story's pacing felt excessively slow, which made it challenging to stay engaged. I kept anticipating a shift, but it never came, leading to numerous unnecessary scenes. Although the short chapters provided some relief, I still struggled to push through. I found the protagonist's decision to continue attending school puzzling, especially given their deteriorating mental state and the mystery surrounding their missing best friend. This moment pulled me out of the narrative. The plot centers on four disappearances in one night, linked to a goddess game that seemingly filters out \"bad\" characters based on an ambiguous moral standard set by the goddess. Unfortunately, this left me with many unanswered questions. The ending also felt unsatisfying, as too many loose threads remained unresolved.",

However, I enjoyed Melissa Albert’s Hazelwood duology, so I decided to give this young adult horror novel a try. I figured it wouldn’t be too scary, and it really wasn’t.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n   - Albert does an amazing job building atmosphere. She infuses scenes that would otherwise be normal high school settings with \"edges,\" \"mist,\" and other elements that make you feel like you’re right there in the scene. I could vividly picture the creepy high school and felt immersed in it.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story unfolded way too slowly for my taste. I kept thinking it would pick up, but the pacing remained consistently slow, with lots of unnecessary scenes. While the short chapters helped, I struggled to get through them. I wanted the story to move faster and reach the conclusion sooner.  \n\n- **Character Decisions and Logic:**  \n   - When you’re losing control of your mental faculties and your best friend may be possessing you (while also missing), why would you keep going to school? This decision didn’t make much sense to me and took me out of the story at times.  \n\n- **Mystery and Resolution:**  \n   - The plot revolves around four people going missing in one night, tied to the \"goddess game,\" which seems to eliminate \"the bad ones\" with \"darkness\" in their character. However, the definition of \"bad ones\" feels internalized to the goddess, leaving me with many unanswered questions about the whys and whats. The ending wasn’t particularly satisfying, and I felt there were too many loose threads.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n   - Despite the pacing issues, the atmospheric writing was exceptional. Albert truly nailed the creepy, immersive vibe, which kept me engaged even when the story dragged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a decent plot and excelled in creating a vivid, atmospheric setting, the slow pacing, unsatisfying resolution, and some illogical character decisions detracted from my overall enjoyment.

However, the pacing picks up significantly in the final third, capturing my attention until the end. I wish the earlier sections had matched this level of excitement and faster tempo. Ultimately, the ending redeemed the book for me, fully embracing the supernatural elements introduced earlier.

These themes brought depth to the story, and I liked the way the author presented them to readers.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were well-developed with nuanced personalities and the ability to communicate effectively. It was refreshing to see a story that didn’t rely heavily on the misunderstanding trope.  \n\n- **Descriptive Writing:**  \n  The descriptions were vibrant and eerie, really ramping things up for the readers.  \n\n- **Supernatural Elements and World-Building:**  \n  The ending left me wanting more. There wasn’t enough development of the supernatural elements that had been hinted at throughout the story. The explanations were not as satisfying as I had hoped, and I wish the myth and legend had been given as much depth as the rest of the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  While I was glad for a more positive resolution of the events at the end, I did feel slightly cheated by how conveniently things were wrapped up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the story for its mature themes, well-developed characters, and vivid descriptions. However, the underdeveloped supernatural elements and the overly convenient ending left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

While not all of them worked for me, I could see what the author was trying to do and appreciated the story for what it was.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the read. Despite some pacing issues early on and a few twists that didn’t fully land for me, the book was engaging, creepy, and well-crafted.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 - 4 Stars"

While the idea was great, the story would have benefited from being shorter and more focused.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

I’m sure SHE knows what’s going on, but I certainly don’t.  \n\n- **Satisfaction with Explanations:**  \n  Maybe I literalize too much, but I wasn’t necessarily satisfied by some of the explanations here. I NEVER enjoy a third-act exposition dump.  \n\n- **Imagery and Themes:**  \n  The imagery was very powerful, and I always like stories about how the worlds little/teen girls create are actually super messed up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Melissa Albert’s creativity and unique take on horror fairy tales and mythology are impressive, the pacing and clarity of the plot often falter in the final act. The powerful imagery and exploration of dark, imaginative worlds created by young girls are highlights, but the reliance on exposition dumps and unsatisfying explanations detracts from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Although the central mystery of Nora searching for her missing best friend, Becca, is compelling, many subplots felt irrelevant. Nora's occasional identity crises and her unexplained visions were underdeveloped and didn’t significantly enhance the narrative. The reveal concerning Rita's past and the dark force posing as Patty was well-executed and added depth to the story. However, the ending ultimately fell flat, failing to provide a satisfying resolution to the buildup.",

The dynamic between Nora and Becca, along with the backstory of Rita and Patty, was far more compelling and deserved greater emphasis.",
            "The exploration of themes such as grief, revenge, and the consequences of engaging with dark forces is intriguing. The \"goddess game\" and its associated sacrifices enhance the story’s complexity, but these elements could benefit from a more cohesive integration into the narrative."

I found myself bored for more than half of the book, which detracted from the overall experience.\n\n- **Plot Development and Relevance:**  \n  While the central mystery—Nora trying to uncover what happened to her missing best friend, Becca—was intriguing, many events in the story felt irrelevant. For example, Nora’s occasional feelings of not being herself and her ability to see things she shouldn’t know were underdeveloped and didn’t contribute meaningfully to the plot.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The inclusion of a random love interest felt forced and unnecessary. Not every story needs a romantic subplot, and this one would have been stronger without it. The relationship between Nora and Becca, as well as the backstory of Rita and Patty, were more compelling and deserved more focus.\n\n- **Climax and Resolution:**  \n  The big reveal involving Rita’s past and the dark force masquerading as Patty was well-executed and added depth to the story. However, the ending fell flat and was disappointing, failing to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the buildup.\n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The exploration of themes like grief, revenge, and the consequences of tampering with dark forces was interesting. The “goddess game” and the sacrifices tied to it added a layer of intrigue, but these elements could have been more tightly woven into the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a promising start and some compelling ideas, it suffered from uneven pacing, irrelevant subplots, and an unsatisfying ending.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n   - The book is primarily a romance novel, which I don’t enjoy.  \n   - The tone feels overwrought and overly wordy, making it difficult for me to connect with the story.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Themes (Self-Harm):**  \n   - The main character engages in frequent self-harm, including restricted food and sleep, cutting, substance abuse, and multiple attempts at self-drowning.  \n   - I find the detailed portrayal of self-harm excessive and uncomfortable, especially in a YA novel.  \n   - I don’t believe the inclusion of these themes serves a meaningful purpose in the story.  \n\n- **Characterization and Dialogue:**  \n   - The teenage characters don’t sound like teenagers; they come across as jaded middle-aged adults, which feels unrealistic and disconnected.  \n\n- **Plot and Logic (Supernatural Elements):**  \n   - The supernatural elements in the story lack proper development and logical consistency, making them feel underdeveloped and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n   - The conclusion, where everything is resolved by the main character kissing a boy, feels problematic and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Bad Ones* didn’t resonate with me due to its focus on romance, excessive and uncomfortable portrayal of self-harm, unrealistic characterization, underdeveloped supernatural elements, and a problematic ending. I would recommend exploring other, better-written books instead.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2/5 stars."

            "The book's alternation between past and present feels disjointed, resulting in a slow pacing that detracts from the story. The plot meanders, only gaining momentum near the conclusion. It may have been more effective to begin a week prior to the disappearances, incorporating interactions with the goddess before delving into the mystery. Alternatively, starting with Becca's perspective and weaving in occult chapters early on, followed by Nora's investigation, could have enhanced the narrative flow. Unfortunately, the execution of this intriguing premise falls flat, leading to a lackluster reading experience. The overall slow pacing and unclear direction hindered engagement until the very end.",

Nora's realization of her codependency with Becca is significant, but it feels largely irrelevant given their inherently toxic, enmeshed relationship. Additionally, the romance subplot appears out of place and contributes little to the overall narrative.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Tone and Content:**  \n  The book was too dark for my taste, especially considering it's marketed as a Young Adult (YA) novel. I found the content disturbing and felt it was inappropriate for the intended audience.  \n  After reading the last couple of chapters, I concluded that the story is \"really fucked up,\" which further solidified my discomfort with its tone and themes.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I enjoyed the writing itself, as it was engaging and well-crafted. However, the dark subject matter overshadowed my appreciation for the author's skill.\n\n- **Editing and Quality:**  \n  I initially hoped the book underwent significant editing before publication, as I felt it could have been improved. This concern was based on my initial impression before finishing the story.\n\n- **Engagement and Interest:**  \n  Despite not finishing the book in its entirety, I found it interesting enough to flip through the last 40 percent. The story held my attention, even if the content was unsettling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the writing was enjoyable, the book's dark and disturbing content made it unsuitable for a YA audience, in my opinion. My initial hope for extensive editing was not enough to offset my discomfort with the story's tone and themes. Ultimately, I found the book too unsettling to fully appreciate.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1 star."

            "The relationship between Nora and the goddess was overly detailed and ultimately felt unnecessary, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story. I found Madison's character intriguing and wished for more insight into her backstory. Additionally, Nora's unexplained obsession with sugary treats felt odd, leaving me curious about its significance.",

            "The plot begins with an intriguing setup involving the occult and the mysterious disappearance of four individuals, but it loses momentum as the story unfolds. The abrupt shift toward exploring the challenges faced by lesbians in the 1950s feels disjointed and detracts from the initial suspense. This change in focus diminished my interest, leading me to stop listening.",
            "The characters, especially the two main girls, feel underdeveloped. Their engagement with the occult lacks meaningful consequences, and their relationship dynamics are superficial. The revelation that one character is a lesbian while the other is not adds little depth, becoming the central focus without sufficient buildup.",
            "The novel grapples with its genre and purpose, blending elements of horror, mystery, and coming-of-age without fully committing to any. While the initial disappearance of four individuals hints at a compelling mystery, the narrative lacks suspense or depth. Instead, it shifts to the drifting friendship of two girls and their personal growth, which feels disjointed from the earlier setup. The exploration of the struggles faced by homosexuals in the 1950s is heavy-handed and unconvincing, particularly with the portrayal of a strawman principal who is a former nun, which undermines the story's authenticity. Overall, the narrative feels forced and disconnected from its earlier themes of the occult and mystery."
