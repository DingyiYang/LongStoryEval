            "This story is heavy and complex, making it a challenging read that demands your full attention. However, the effort is greatly rewarded. The world is intricately crafted, and even as I thought I understood it, I was surprised by its depth. The narrative introduces exciting developments as Deka and her friends journey to the edge of the world, unveiling a new realm. I was initially worried that a few months had passed since reading *The Merciless Ones*, the second book, and that I might struggle to remember key plot points. Fortunately, the author skillfully provided a seamless recap that refreshed my memory perfectly.",
            "I admire Deka's courage throughout the story. The dynamic between the main character and their love interest is delightful, evoking strong emotions. The Found Family aspect shines brightly in this book, as the tight-knit group faces challenges in the gripping final scenes, making their bond even more impactful.",
            "This story presents a beautifully imagined world that deserves more than just the confines of three books. The protagonist and her friends embark on an exciting journey to the edge of the world, uncovering an entirely new realm filled with intriguing developments. It’s truly a shame not to see more of this captivating universe.",
            "I'm leaving this story an emotional wreck, unprepared for its conclusion. The author expertly weaves emotional depth throughout the series, and in this installment, I found my heart especially entwined with Deka's journey. It was a true roller coaster for both her and me. One of the most impactful scenes takes place when they return to Keita's family home—be ready with your tissues. That moment was profoundly moving and felt incredibly authentic."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Eternal Ones* is a deeply emotional and complex conclusion to the author's *Deathless* series. The intricate world-building, rich character relationships, and powerful emotional moments make it a standout read. While the story is heavy and demands focus, the payoff is immense. The recap provided by the author ensures continuity, and the found family dynamic shines brightly in this final installment. I express a strong desire for a prequel, highlighting my attachment to the beautifully crafted world and characters.",

In each one, I always felt for Deka, but in this one in particular, my heart was with her. It was a roller coaster, for her and for me.\"  \n   - \"One of the most powerful scenes in this book, IMO, involves them returning to Keita's family home. Y'all, you better have your tissues ready. There was something so moving and believable about that scene for me.\"  \n\n- **Complexity and Depth of the Story**  \n   - \"This is heavy and a bit complicated; it's not an easy read by any stretch. You need to be focused and paying attention at all times, but if you do, it pays off in spades.\"  \n   - \"The world is complex. You are being dropped into a fully-formed, beautifully-developed world, and while I may have thought I knew everything about it by this point, I was wrong.\"  \n   - \"We had some great new developments here, with Deka and her friends traveling to the edge of the world and discovering a whole new realm.\"  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships**  \n   - \"I respect her [Deka's] courage throughout this series.\"  \n   - \"I also love her best friend, Britta so, so much.

She provided a perfect, natural-feeling recap that helped to jog my memory so well.\"  \n\n- **Suggestions for Future Works**  \n   - \"That's why I'm proposing a prequel following Deka's Mom and White Hands. Forna, if you're out there, we need this.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Eternal Ones* is a deeply emotional and complex conclusion to Namina Forna's *Deathless* series.

            "The romance unfolds at a realistic pace, avoiding any artificial urgency that might inflate its significance. While this authenticity may appeal to some, it could disappoint readers seeking a more dramatic romantic arc. Additionally, several plot points come across as overly convenient, with discoveries, allies, and power dynamics aligning too neatly. This ease undermines the stakes and tension of the story. Overall, the pacing struggles to accommodate the abundance of revelations and developments, resulting in limited opportunities for deeper exploration or character growth.",
            "Deka, the protagonist, begins her journey as an angry and hurt character, often lashing out. However, her growth feels abrupt, with other characters shifting their attitudes and accepting her changes too quickly, which comes across as forced and unrealistic. The exploration of shared suffering and emotional depth is handled in a heavy-handed manner, lacking the nuanced development present in earlier books. On a positive note, the novel excels in its casual inclusion of diversity and its courage in addressing difficult, often overlooked societal issues, aligning with the commendable evolution of YA literature.",
            "The novel presents a vividly crafted world where the division between male Idugu and female Gilded Ones has plunged Otera into chaos. A key strength of the story lies in its critique of oppressive systems, particularly patriarchy and power-hoarding. It highlights how those in power exploit the promise of shared authority to secure obedience from others."

        "conclusion": "The novel offers a compelling critique of oppressive systems and a richly imagined world, but it struggles with rushed character development, convenient plot points, and uneven pacing.

Deka's journey included numerous detours that felt unnecessary, providing minimal challenges or character development.",

Deka, the main character, experiences little growth; she begins as weak and angry, but quickly reverts to a static state with unclear motivations. Moments of tenderness or challenge are few, and the core team contributes minimally. While previous installments allowed secondary characters to shine, this entry falls short in that regard, leaving their contributions wanting.",
            "Book One presented a fresh perspective in a crowded genre, while Book Two cleverly expanded and subverted expectations. However, Book Three introduced new elements that felt more distracting than enriching. The expansion of deities, creatures, and powers was intriguing but ultimately underdeveloped. Additionally, the magic system lacks clarity, with Deka's abilities exhibiting puzzling limitations and her friends' powers rarely being utilized."

While the vision for the story was evident, the execution could have been more refined. The lack of emotional depth, character development, and a coherent magic system detracted from the overall experience. Despite these issues, the trilogy as a whole is impressive, and the book still holds some fond memories.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Overall Satisfaction:**\n   - The book was a letdown, especially after waiting since finishing the first two in 2022.\n   - The ending felt overly convenient and lacked emotional depth.\n   - The final installment lacked the strong, diverse narrative present in the previous books.\n   - The reading slump might have influenced the low scoring, but the book was still disappointing.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - The series has too many characters, making it hard to expect much development for peripheral characters.\n   - Deka, the main character, doesn't undergo much of an arc; she starts weak and angry, snaps out of it, and remains static throughout.\n   - There are few moments of tenderness or challenge for Deka, and her motivations are unclear.\n   - No other characters go through significant transformations; the core team is always present but contributes minimally.\n   - In previous books, secondary characters had moments to shine, but this was lacking in this installment.\n\n- **Setting:**\n   - Book One offered a unique perspective in a saturated genre, and Book Two expanded and subverted expectations.\n   - Book Three introduced new elements that didn't play a central role, making them more distracting than enriching.\n   - The expansion of deities, creatures/species, and new powers was cool but underdeveloped.\n   - The magic system remains unclear, with Deka's powers having weird limitations and her friends' powers seldom coming into play.\n\n- **Plot:**\n   - The story felt convenient, with a repetitive pattern of long expositions, external interruptions, action, and convenient exits.\n   - Many plot points didn't feel consequential to the core mission.\n   - A significant portion of the book is dedicated to building an army for a war that is barely depicted.\n   - Many stops on Deka's journey felt superfluous, offering little in terms of challenging feats or character development.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the book had its moments but fell short of expectations, especially as the final installment of a trilogy. While the vision for the story was evident, the execution could have been more refined. The lack of emotional depth, character development, and a coherent magic system detracted from the overall experience. Despite these issues, the trilogy as a whole is impressive, and the book still holds some fond memories.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

It felt different from the other two, possibly because I read it much later, whereas I read the first two back-to-back. This gap made me feel a bit lost.  \n\n- **Recap and Accessibility:**  \n   - I appreciated the recap of the first two books at the start, which helped me dive into this one from page one. However, the complexity of the fantasy world made it hard to remember the meanings of many words. A glossary with characters and terms would have greatly improved my understanding and enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - The characters were the highlight of this book for me. I loved the duo of Deka and Keita, and their relationship was portrayed positively and realistically. The slow development of their romance was expertly done, avoiding forced tropes and allowing their love to grow naturally.  \n   - While the side characters were interesting, there were too many names introduced, and without a glossary or clear explanations, I struggled to remember their significance or connection to Deka. Britta stood out, but the others felt underdeveloped or forgettable.  \n\n- **Story Execution and Pacing:**  \n   - The story was handled well overall, especially for a YA book tackling themes of god-like structures and existential questions. However, the pacing felt slow at times, with too many new elements introduced to tie up loose ends. By this point in the trilogy, I expected to have a solid grasp of the politics and world-building, but it felt overwhelming.  \n\n- **Series Completion and Future Expectations:**  \n   - Despite its flaws, this book is a must-read to complete the trilogy. The first book remains my favorite, but I’m excited to see what Namina Forna writes next—I need more of her work!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t quite live up to the first two in the series for me, it still delivered strong character development and a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.

Both Deka and Keita received narrative closure that I found satisfying.  \n\n- **Conflict and Intensity:**  \n  The conflict in this installment felt more muted in its intensity compared to previous books. While some characters received their just comeuppance, others became collateral damage in the crossfire.  \n\n- **Series Conclusion:**  \n  This was a strong ending to the Deathless series, continuing Deka's journey from enslavement and oppression to a fierce future. I'm glad I finished the trilogy and am interested to see what Namina Forna writes next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Eternal Ones provides a satisfying conclusion to the Deathless series, with its standout world-building and strong character arcs. While the conflict felt less intense than in earlier books, the narrative closure for key characters and the introduction of compelling new figures like Queen Io made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book is a fantastic conclusion to the trilogy, following Deka's journey to achieve divinity and confront the corrupted gods of Otera. The central theme revolves around her struggle to balance the sacrifice of her humanity with her relationships. The narrative and world-building expanded significantly, showcasing Deka's transformation from a pawn to a leader. One of the highlights was the exploration of the world beyond Otera, which opened up limitless possibilities. Deka’s choices at the ending were refreshing, though discussing them would involve spoilers.

The book is cohesive and well-structured, with each act perfectly proportioned—nothing felt overextended or rushed. This made for a smooth and enjoyable reading experience, and I finished it in just 48 hours.",
            "In this book, Keita's character development was notably enhanced. His backstory was expanded, adding depth and allowing him to stand independently from Deka, a flaw present in *The Merciless Ones*. He no longer seemed to compete with Britta for Deka’s attention and became a more enjoyable character in his own right. Deka also continued to evolve, and I appreciated her inner struggles as she navigated her journey, remaining relatable even while facing her impending ascension to godhood.",
            "The exploration of gender, a central theme in the first two books, feels largely absent in *The Eternal Ones*. While the earlier installments examined male and female power dynamics, the significance of binary and non-binary identities, and the importance of identity through characters such as the alaki, the Gilded Ones, the Idugu, and White Hands, *The Eternal Ones* seems to cut these discussions short, almost erasing them. As someone who navigated their gender identity in their 20s, I found this disappointing. Such conversations are essential, especially in a narrative that initially placed such strong emphasis on the female experience.",

It holds a unique position in the YA fantasy genre, particularly benefiting its target audience by helping girls of color feel seen.

As the chapters unfolded, the intensity escalated, leaving me on the edge of my seat, eager to see how events would unfold. There were moments when I felt like “covering my eyes” due to the bleak situations Deka and her friends faced. The only reason I deducted a star is the ending.

Reuniting with Deka, her friends, and family was exhilarating, and the story maintained its intensity and excitement from the outset. I particularly enjoyed the development of Ixa and the introduction of Queen Ayo, especially the captivating ebiki scenes, which were my favorites. Deka’s evolution as both a person and a deity was compelling; as she navigated new revelations, she faced fresh obstacles but had the right allies to support her. However, I found Deka frustrating at times; she often appeared grumpy, entitled, and unkind to her friends, despite their unwavering support.

            "The books often featured excessive violence, vividly portrayed yet sometimes unnecessary. In the third installment, the pacing was brisk, introducing a wealth of new information in a digestible manner. However, some plot points felt like filler and added little to the overall narrative. The ending felt rushed, with numerous character deaths during the final battle seeming more like a device to heighten the intensity rather than serving a meaningful purpose. Deka's limited involvement in the battle was peculiar, and her eventual ascension to godhood, while observing her friends and the world, felt disconnected from her character development.",
            "I appreciated the beautiful representation of diverse characters in terms of background, skin color, culture, sexual orientation, and pronouns. The introduction of characters using they/them pronouns felt natural and understated, which is a commendable rarity. The story promotes the idea that men, women, and those who identify differently are equals, emphasizing that one person's power does not diminish another's.\n\nIn the first part of the book, I found Deka to be quite tiresome. Her excessive self-pity and dismissive attitude towards others fit the typical YA protagonist mold: overly talented, a literal god destined to save everyone, and narrowly escaping confrontations repeatedly. However, the relationships among characters were beautifully portrayed, with an emphasis on friendship that often overshadowed romantic connections. Additionally, the depiction of strong women was empowering, even as the patriarchal and misogynistic elements of the world were heavily underscored."

        "conclusion": "While the story has many positive and inclusive aspects that I appreciate, such as its diverse representation and strong themes of equality and friendship, I wouldn’t recommend it overall. The excessive violence, filler events, and rushed ending detracted from the story. Additionally, the main character, Deka, was often frustrating, and her transformation into a god felt mismatched. It’s a shame because it had potential, but it didn’t fully deliver.",

It just felt like fodder to undergird the premise that this is an affirming book, without much substance directed that way.  \n\n- **Overall Series Value:**  \n  All that said, I think this whole series is worth a read!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this installment of the series delves deeply into complex themes like divinity, it could have benefited from more grounding elements.

Deka’s mother, still alive, may hold the key to finding the kelai. However, their reunion is not as Deka had hoped. The ending is well-crafted and satisfying, offering closure to the trilogy.

            "The story unfolds rapidly, transitioning swiftly between locations, which sometimes sacrifices depth for the sake of pace. The Great Divinity and the Idugu gods, particularly Okot and Anok, are well-crafted characters, and their conclusions are both fitting and emotionally impactful. While the final battle and Deka's transformation into a goddess are intense, they leave lingering questions about the future of the new deities and the potential for corruption. The conclusion feels rushed, with unresolved plot points, such as the fate of Deka's body and the absence of a clear mechanism to prevent the new deities from falling into corruption. Although the focus on Britta and Li's wedding, along with Adwapa's meeting with a girl who shares her twin's name, provides some emotional closure, it feels insufficient in light of the wider unresolved narratives.",
            "Lamin's character feels underutilized following his departure from Maiwuri, leaving much of his potential unexplored. The theme of friendship is a prominent focus, particularly in the well-crafted relationship between Deka and Keita. Keita emerges as a supportive, non-traditional male character who complements Deka without feeling threatened. Additionally, Deka's mother, a Godsworn to two gods, adds emotional depth to the narrative, though her wraith-like existence remains somewhat underdeveloped.",

It successfully shifts the focus from an oppressive patriarchy to a new, repressive system, tackling themes of overcoming prejudice and reclaiming women's rights.

            "The deaths of certain characters felt unnecessary, particularly since their lives, enriched by Deka’s powers, led to flowers blooming on Eltzi, which felt underwhelming. The romance also seemed misplaced, with Deka and her love interest taking a night off to swim in a lake amidst world-ending stakes. Additionally, I found Deka's power level confusing after her transformation. If everything is interconnected, why does she suddenly surpass the golden ones and the Indugu, given that she originates from the same group that created them? The explanation of her being the instrument of the Beings’ wishes felt inconsistent with the theme of unity. However, I appreciated the description of Deka’s transformation and the portrayal of the Being. Ultimately, the ending wrapped up most character arcs satisfactorily, providing a gratifying conclusion.",
            "I found Deka’s recurring theme of self-pity and isolation frustrating, especially as it persisted throughout all three books. It seemed she should have realized sooner that she wasn’t truly alone and could rely on others. This slow development made the beginning of the story drag, as her desire for escapism lingered. Additionally, Keita’s character felt regressive; he became more closed off and emotionally distant, which felt inconsistent given the surrounding events and his relationship with Deka.",
            "Initially, I found the writing style, particularly the dialogue, somewhat grating—especially Britta's speech patterns (e.g., \"ye,\" \"ol\"). This may have been influenced by my recent read, which featured more sophisticated vocabulary. However, I ultimately appreciated the shift in language and style during the final chapters, as it beautifully mirrored the story’s evolution."

It didn’t disappoint, and I would recommend it as a light-hearted series.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  At the start, I was annoyed by the writing style, particularly the dialogue scenes, especially Britta’s way of speaking (e.g., \"ye,\" \"ol,\" etc.). This might be because the last book I read was heavy on sophisticated vocabulary. However, I appreciated the change in language and style in the last couple of chapters, which aligned with the story’s transformation.  \n\n- **Character Development (Deka):**  \n  I found Deka’s recurring theme of \"woe is me, I am all powerful and utterly alone\" frustrating, especially since it repeated across three books. It felt like she should have realized earlier that she wasn’t alone and could rely on others. This made the start of the book feel slow, as her desire for escapism and self-pity dragged on.  \n\n- **World-Building (Eliki and Lore):**  \n  I would have liked to learn more about the Eliki—why they are so powerful and why everyone fears them. Additionally, I was confused about the deaths in the final chapters. Since it had been established in previous books that characters don’t die easily, these deaths felt less impactful. I also questioned why Kelwa and Asha didn’t transform into deathshriekers like others, and why their deaths were final (perhaps due to blue blood vs. golden shell lore?).  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The deaths of certain characters felt unnecessary, especially since their lives, which were enhanced by Deka’s powers, resulted in flowers forming on Eltzi. This seemed underwhelming. The romance also felt out of place, with moments like taking a night off to soak in a lake despite the world-ending stakes.  \n\n- **Character Development (Keita):**  \n  Keita’s character felt like it regressed, becoming more closed off and emotionally distant. While I understood the justification, it felt odd given everything else happening and his relationship with Deka.  \n\n- **Power Dynamics and Logic:**  \n  I was confused about Deka’s power level after her transformation. If everything is connected and one, why is she suddenly more powerful than the golden ones and the Indugu, despite being part of the same group that created them? The explanation that she’s the instrument of the Beings’ wishes felt inconsistent with the theme of unity.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  I liked the Being and the description of Deka’s transformation. The ending tied up most character arcs nicely and provided a satisfying conclusion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this review highlights several criticisms, I genuinely enjoyed the book.

            "The main plot points were well-crafted, but the story tended to meander between them. The inclusion of excessive conflicts for the group to face often felt like unnecessary padding.",
            "In this installment, Deka, the protagonist, comes across as particularly irritating, exhibiting intensified teen anger, angst, and unnecessary drama that feels more like character regression than growth. However, the slow, casual development of Deka and Keita's relationship is commendable, conveying a meaningful message for YA readers. Meanwhile, Britta's Scottish accent feels forced and becomes tiresome, especially as her dialogue increases. Ixa continues to be a standout character, and the representation of LGBTQ relationships, including non-binary and gender-neutral characters, is both seamless and well-executed.",

The beginning, however, felt overwhelming, relying heavily on exposition rather than immersive storytelling, which came across as an info dump.

My main concern is that the middle of the book felt excessively lengthy.",

This series has been a four-year journey for me, and though I lost details in between books (not a big re-reader), I found myself so attached to these characters.\"  \n   - \"In essence, this series is a love letter not just to young girls and women, but to humanity. You are forced to face not only the horrors of being mortal but the absolute joys of it as well.\"  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - \"The writing itself is simplistic (in line with what YA should be), and I (as an adult) have a pretty good grasp on the way YA plotlines are shaped, so nothing was surprising to me here.\"  \n   - \"I wished that the search for Deka's kelai was not dragged out so much, but I enjoy when YA authors write in moments of joy for characters amidst life-altering events and battles.\"  \n   - \"My only complaint is that the middle of the book dragged far too long.\"  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n   - \"It's sometimes hard to remember that these characters are children, especially when the premise circles them becoming omniscient gods.\"  \n   - \"This series is a love letter not just to young girls and women, but to humanity. You are forced to face not only the horrors of being mortal but the absolute joys of it as well.\"  \n\n- **Satisfaction with the Resolution:**  \n   - \"I was very satisfied with this resolution in general.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe *Deathless* trilogy concludes with *The Eternal Ones*, delivering a heartfelt and emotionally resonant finale. While the writing style is straightforward and the pacing occasionally drags, the series excels in its exploration of humanity, mortality, and joy. The emotional attachment to the characters and the satisfying resolution make this a memorable read, despite some minor pacing issues.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars"

This constant complaining makes her an irksome character, diverging from her previously admirable traits.",

In retrospect, much of the suffering from earlier books seemed unnecessary, as new revelations suggested it could have been easily avoided.",

Despite these flaws, I remain a fan of Namina Forna’s work and look forward to her future books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The Eternal Ones serves as a fantastic conclusion to the series. Just like the first book, it excels in storytelling, and it effectively ties up all loose ends from previous installments. I found the ending particularly satisfying—a beautiful conclusion that aligns perfectly with the storyline. While the beginning was a bit slow, once I fully engaged with the book, the pace picked up significantly. The urgency of events essential for Deka’s success created a sense of rapid progression, enhancing the overall reading experience.",
            "Britta and Deka share a remarkable friendship in this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed their journey together. Both characters experience strong arcs, with Deka being the primary focus. I also adored Ixa—his charm is truly delightful.",

It maintained the depth and excellence of the first book, tied up loose ends, and delivered strong character arcs, particularly for Deka. While the pacing had its ups and downs, the expanded world-building and emotional payoff made it a rewarding read.",

Following her painful confrontation with them in the previous installment, her emotional turmoil is palpable. To stop the gods from annihilating the world, she must trace the origin of her divinity – a daunting task.

            "I enjoyed this series, but I'm relieved to finish with the final book.",
            "The action often reads more like a checklist than vivid descriptions. The books would benefit from more detail and less repetition. I found the first book to be the strongest, while the second and third fell short, as Deka's voice and the writing lost their potency. The battle scenes grew tiresome, feeling like the same event replayed in different settings. Additionally, Deka's recurring struggles with self-worth, loneliness, and her need for constant reassurance from friends became monotonous.",
            "This story effectively highlights the themes of forgiveness, sacrifice, and the defining nature of our mistakes through Deka's relationship with her parents. I appreciate how the author portrays Deka and her companions as they forge new alliances and friendships with diverse races throughout their journey. The theme of universal oneness, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all beings, resonates deeply. It reminds me of Plato's theory of split-apart humans, where the division of singular gods into different genders results in power struggles and strife. The narrative invites readers to ponder humanity's complex relationship with supreme beings, exploring our admiration, anger, and the influence these entities exert over us."
        ],
        "conclusion": "I enjoyed the story overall, but the later parts did not maintain the same strength as the beginning. The repetitive battle scenes, muted relationships, and lack of detailed descriptions detracted from the experience. However, the philosophical themes, such as forgiveness, unity, and the nature of power, provided depth and food for thought. The story could have been more impactful with tighter editing and richer descriptions.",

            "The characters often exhibited inconsistency, especially Deka. She frequently asserted her resolve to not let her emotions control her, only to succumb to them moments later. This lack of follow-through diminished her character development, making it feel superficial. I would have preferred a more authentic exploration of her emotional struggles rather than her repeatedly falling into the same patterns. This inconsistency also affected the dynamics between characters, as their sudden shifts in emotions or tolerance for one another lacked clear explanations, resulting in a jarring and awkward experience.",

Because you don’t know what you’re losing, let me tell you. This series is amazingly good! And this last book? Perfection. The Eternal Ones was the final installment this series deserved, and I couldn’t be more grateful for it.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Themes:**  \n  Namina wrote such a brutal and ruthless world and, at the same time, such a kind and loving dream for it. I loved the mythology and the idea behind it, and I loved how unapologetically feminist the story is. The worldbuilding is compelling and unique.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Impact:**  \n  These characters grew on me, and watching them—this family born of hate and prejudice—fight against all odds for a world that mistreated them was so hard, yet I was so proud of all of them. Deka and the crew will always have a special place in my heart. I cried, I smiled, because this was the perfect ending for them, and I’m still overwhelmed by it.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  This last book was full of pain on so many levels. Once again, there were a lot of twists, fights to the death, and unexpected discoveries. This isn’t for the faint of heart, at all. I was so hooked through all of it that I couldn’t believe when it ended. And what an end!  \n\n- **Recommendation and Personal Connection:**  \n  Please, please, read this series. You will not regret it, I swear it. I know I will never forget it. And I will definitely read everything by Namina Forna.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Eternal Ones is a perfect conclusion to an incredible series. It delivers a brutal yet hopeful world, unapologetically feminist themes, and deeply compelling characters. The emotional journey, combined with the twists and turns of the plot, left me overwhelmed and deeply satisfied. This series is a must-read, and I will cherish it forever.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It incorporates classic fantasy elements like sisterhood, quests, found family, animal companions, gods, magic, and mythical creatures. At its core, the narrative is a coming-of-age tale that emphasizes the power of choice in shaping one's identity.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I didn’t *love* Forna’s writing style in the first book, but I disliked it even more here. It felt very clumsy in places, almost as if a 15-year-old had written certain passages. There was a lot of repetition, with the same phrases or sentences being used in quick succession. Additionally, much of the writing came across as ‘fake profound,’ where the author seemed to be trying to make the work sound deep and poignant, but it just felt forced and cheesy.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  There was so much going on in this book—so many characters, concepts, objects, and settings. While this is common in fantasy, it felt overwhelming at times. The wider plot was intriguing and interesting enough, but the ending seemed rather vague. For example, if balance has been restored, why does Adwapa need to run a fighting school? Also, it’s unclear whether Deka, Keita, and the others are still physical beings (they hold hands) even though they are now ‘all and one.’ There were a lot of loose ends that weren’t quite resolved.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I liked the characters, and they were one of the stronger aspects of the book. However, their development felt overshadowed by the overly complex plot and writing issues.  \n\n- **Series Progression:**  \n  I’m a fan of the trilogy, but I felt the power, plot, and writing style went downhill with each book. While I’m glad I stuck it out to read the whole trilogy, in hindsight, you could probably just read the first book as a standalone.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I’m glad I finished the book and the trilogy, but the series declined in quality with each installment. The writing style became more cumbersome, the plot felt overly complex, and the ending left too many unanswered questions. While the characters and overarching plot were intriguing, the execution fell short of expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Despite her training and history as a formidable fighter, she often resorts to calling for help instead of taking action, leading to a disconnect in her character.

The ending was particularly satisfying and felt like a fitting conclusion to the series.  \n\n- **Character Development (Deka):**  \n  Deka, the main character, was a bit of a letdown for me. While she’s going through tough times at the beginning of the book, her lack of action during attacks was frustrating. Despite being taught to fight and being a badass in previous books, she often just yells for help instead of taking action. This inconsistency in her character was hard to accept.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The other characters remained consistent and lovable. We get to know them more deeply, and they play a crucial role in helping Deka navigate her challenges. Ixa, in particular, was as cute as ever, and we learn a lot more about him, which was a highlight.  \n\n- **Series Conclusion:**  \n  Overall, this was a good way to end the series. If you’ve enjoyed the previous books, you’ll likely appreciate the third and final installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book serves as a satisfying conclusion to the series, with strong world-building, a well-executed plot, and a fitting ending.

By the end, Deka's transformation into a God introduces a whimsical tone to her dialogue that feels out of character and somewhat jarring.",

Despite these shortcomings, the novel’s themes and emotional depth make it a worthwhile read, and I believe it has the potential to thrive in other formats, such as an animated series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up to 4 stars."

            "The introduction of additional gods seemed forced and underdeveloped, lacking sufficient time to explore their roles or the new land.

            "This narrative pulsates with urgency as Deka races against time, drawing me into her battle against impending death and destruction. The moral and emotional conflicts create a compelling tension that propels the story forward. At its core, the tale follows Deka, a formidable woman who uncovers the truth about the Gilded Ones, who have exploited her and others to maintain their control.

            "Deka’s physical and mental struggles are at the heart of the story. Despite being surrounded by friends, she grapples with profound loneliness as she faces the ultimate sacrifice to challenge the gods. The bond between Deka and Britta is a highlight of the trilogy, embodying themes of sisterhood and unwavering love. Additionally, Keita’s backstory is further explored, enhancing his connection to Deka. This trilogy is particularly significant for giving a voice to Black women, especially young Black women, in a literary landscape often dominated by white authors and characters. *The Eternal Ones* serves as a powerful conclusion, leaving messages that will resonate deeply with its audience.",
            "The author crafts an immersive journey into a West-African inspired ancient world, vividly engaging readers. However, the plot occasionally feels disjointed, and certain plot points come across as overly convenient in their resolutions.",
            "The story redefines sisterhood, featuring female protagonists who challenge traditions and cultural expectations to emerge as fierce warriors. The introduction of non-binary characters and the theme of gender fluidity is both refreshing and significant, especially within YA fiction. While the first two books delved deeply into gender and power dynamics, I would have appreciated a more thorough exploration of these themes in *The Eternal Ones*."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Eternal Ones* is a compelling and fitting end to *The Gilded Ones* trilogy, offering powerful messages, rich character development, and meaningful representation. While the plot occasionally feels disjointed, the immersive world-building and exploration of themes like sisterhood and gender fluidity make it a must-read. This work is a vital addition to YA fiction, particularly for its celebration of black women’s voices.",

While this works in real life as people grow and expand their knowledge, when the rules of the book universe keep changing every few chapters, and everything before is a “lie,” it’s hard to follow. I had to fight hard to keep how everything works straight in my mind.  \n\n- **Pacing and Clarity:**  \n  I think some of Deka’s learning should’ve been simplified just to make it easier to follow along.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the character arcs and their resolutions, but the frequent shifts in the world’s rules and Deka’s understanding made it challenging to stay engaged.

The central theme of \"the gods you believe in aren’t real\" was repeated so many times that it became tiresome. It felt like the same idea was being recycled without adding depth or progression.  \n\n- **Introduction of New Concepts:**  \n  The latter half of the book introduced several new concepts, but they were often explained away abruptly with lines like, “how could I not have realized this before?!” This made the revelations feel sudden and unearned, rather than well-developed or integrated into the story.  \n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  While I loved the first two books in the series, this one fell short of my expectations. My attachment to the earlier books was the only thing that kept me motivated to finish this one.  \n\n- **Satisfaction with Series Conclusion:**  \n  I’m glad to have finished the series, but I’m equally relieved that there won’t be another book. This installment didn’t live up to the quality of its predecessors, and I’m content to leave the series as it is.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a disappointing conclusion to a series I initially enjoyed. The repetitive plot and rushed introduction of new concepts detracted from the overall experience. While I’m glad to have completed the series, I’m also relieved that it has come to an end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 ⭐️"

There was too much to accomplish in this book, which made the story feel overwhelming and less cohesive.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Books:**  \n  The first book in the series was my favorite. In contrast, this last book was a struggle to finish, even though I was determined to see it through.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While I love the overall story, this particular installment didn’t meet my expectations. Some parts might have been 3 stars, but overall, I feel 2 stars is appropriate.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my love for the series, this final book fell short in terms of immersion, plot execution, and overall enjoyment. While I appreciated the overarching story, the convoluted plot and lack of emotional investment made it a challenging read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (with some parts potentially being 3 stars)."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Series Continuity and Recap:**\n   - I read this book a while after the first two and couldn’t remember much of what had happened. I expected more reminders or a recap, but there wasn’t enough. The story starts abruptly in the middle of action I didn’t recall, which made the beginning rough. There were only a few references to the previous book, so it took time to piece things together.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**\n   - The book felt unnecessarily long. While it starts with action, the pace slows significantly after the first few chapters, making it hard to get through. The repetitive nature of Deka’s inner dialogue—constantly rehashing lessons and thoughts—added to the drag.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Deka’s character development felt rushed and limited. It seemed like she only underwent significant growth right at the end, which made the conclusion feel abrupt. I wish her development had been more gradual and integrated throughout the story.\n\n- **Worldbuilding and Magic System:**\n   - The worldbuilding and magic system were highlights of the series. I found the premise intriguing and compelling, and these elements kept me engaged despite other frustrations.\n\n- **Dialogue and Character Choices:**\n   - The dialogue and character choices often pulled me out of the story. They felt frustrating and annoying, which detracted from my overall enjoyment. I wanted to like the story more, but these aspects made it difficult.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I appreciated the worldbuilding and magic system, the lack of recap, slow pacing, repetitive inner dialogue, and rushed character development made this book a mixed experience. The ending was enjoyable, but the journey to get there felt uneven and frustrating at times.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
