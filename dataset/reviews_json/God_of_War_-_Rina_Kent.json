He‚Äôs much better than his \"psycho father.\"  \n   - The chemistry between Ava and Eli was so compelling that I loved them more than the story itself.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The plot was just okay compared to RK‚Äôs other books, which often have crazier plot twists.  \n   - Despite the plot being average, the emotional depth and character development made up for it.  \n\n- **Series Impact and Nostalgia:**  \n   - The LOG series introduced me to dark romance and the Rinaverse, which has been a transformative reading experience.  \n   - I‚Äôm not ready to let go of the series and the universe yet, but I hope the new era will be just as good, if not better.  \n\n- **Character Rankings and Preferences:**  \n   - Creighton is my favorite RK man, and Eli is now a close second.  \n   - Despite being the biggest Aiden hater, I find his sons breathtaking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its flaws, RK‚Äôs ability to create emotional depth, tension, and compelling characters makes it a standout in her repertoire. Ava and Eli‚Äôs chemistry and development were particularly captivating, even if the plot didn‚Äôt reach the heights of her other works. The LOG series holds immense sentimental value for me, as it introduced me to the Rinaverse and dark romance. I‚Äôm not ready to say goodbye to this universe, but I‚Äôm hopeful for what‚Äôs to come.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- **LOG Series Rating:**  \n  1. God of Malice: 4‚≠ê  \n  2.

It beautifully juxtaposes charming scenes‚Äîlike theater dates, beach outings, and cozy moments reading romance novels‚Äîwith darker, psychotic elements. The plot is filled with unexpected twists, notably Ava's struggles with psychosis and Eli's self-sacrifice. Their marriage of convenience proves anything but easy, steeped in emotional turmoil. The witty banter and dry humor create a reading experience that is simultaneously painful and delightful. Overall, the story strikes a compelling balance between intense and sweet moments, enriched by the appearances of other couples and characters that add depth and enjoyment.",

Witnessing Ava's descent into psychosis is heartbreaking, yet her gratitude for Eli's support adds a poignant touch. While Ava shares Eli's fierce intensity, she also knows how to provoke him in the most frustrating ways. Eli's possessiveness is tempered by his affectionate and selfless nature, creating a dynamic relationship filled with intense, psychotic, and endearing moments. Ariella Nash shines as a standout character‚Äîan undeniably fierce and captivating presence.",

            "I don't understand why there's backlash over Ava being a virgin. Why is this an issue for a female character? It seems there's a double standard at play: when a male character is a virgin, it's acceptable, but the same does not hold for females. Conversely, if a male is not a virgin while the female lead is, it becomes perfectly fine. This inconsistency is frustrating."

Is there a problem if a woman is a virgin? Why is that? It seems like there‚Äôs a double standard‚Äîif a male character isn‚Äôt a virgin, it‚Äôs fine, but if a female character isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs suddenly an issue. Conversely, if a male character is a virgin and the female lead isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs deemed acceptable. This inconsistency is frustrating.  \n- **Societal Expectations and Empowerment:**  \n  As a 23-year-old virgin myself, I want to emphasize that being a virgin is not a disease. Society often pushes the narrative that empowerment comes from having sex, but that‚Äôs not true. True empowerment comes from within, not from any specific act. You should be free to make your own choices without judgment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe review critiques societal double standards regarding virginity, particularly in how female characters like Ava are judged compared to male characters.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - The book consumed me mind, body, and soul.  \n   - I felt every emotion the characters went through, and it was a visceral experience.  \n   - The loving moments had my heart in a vice, and I cried multiple times.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Eli and Ava are complex characters who grow and change throughout the story.  \n   - Ava is feisty and the sunshine to Eli's grumpy demeanor, and their banter is exceptional.  \n   - Their love is next-level, with a depth that feels never-ending.  \n\n- **Storytelling and Themes:**  \n   - The story feels like a love letter to the past, with a full-circle moment that rewrites history.  \n   - The dynamics in this book work better than in previous installments of the Rina universe.  \n   - There‚Äôs a huge mystery surrounding the plot, which adds to the intrigue.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Books:**  \n   - This book has a more \"adult\" tone compared to other \"LOG\" books, reflecting the two-year time jump from *God of Fury*.  \n   - It surpassed *Bran and Nikolai* as my favorite book in the series.  \n\n- **Reader Experience:**  \n   - I found myself sneaking chapters at work because I couldn‚Äôt put it down.  \n   - Going into the story blindly and leaving preconceived notions at the door enhanced the experience.  \n   - The book was worth the years-long wait and exceeded all my expectations.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Closure:**  \n   - The story feels like the perfect way to \"end\" the Rina universe, at least for now.  \n   - It started with a \"King and a Queen\" and ends with one, bringing the series full circle.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an emotional, immersive, and deeply satisfying experience. Eli and Ava‚Äôs love story is beautifully complex, and their growth as characters is compelling. The storytelling, themes, and mystery kept me hooked, and the book surpassed my favorite in the series. It‚Äôs a perfect conclusion to the Rina universe, leaving me fulfilled yet longing for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars (mentioned multiple times throughout the review)."

I was pleasantly surprised by the hero; his mysterious nature kept me guessing, though I still don‚Äôt understand why he stayed away for so long. However, his actions after their marriage were truly commendable. On the downside, Cole Nash was reduced to a one-dimensional character, which was disappointing given his potential in his own story. I'm glad to see Aiden King remains the formidable leader of their friend group, and his relationship with Elsa continues to thrive."

The parents' stories were less trope-filled, more believable, and generally better structured.  \n   - This current series was a fun ride, but it wasn‚Äôt perfect. I‚Äôm a bit sad to see it end.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - I liked Eli so much in this book, and the cameos of his parents made me melt. The whole vibe of the book made me sentimentally subjective.  \n   - The hero pleasantly surprised me. He was a mystery throughout the series, and I still don‚Äôt understand why he stayed away from her for so long. However, his every action after their marriage was chef‚Äôs kiss.  \n   - Cole Nash was turned into a one-dimensional imbecile, which was disappointing since he was supposed to be a good character in his own book.  \n   - I‚Äôm glad that Aiden King is still the HBIC of their little friend group and that his relationship with Elsa is still going strong.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The book was a mix of Aiden & Elsa and Adrian & Lia stories but with a twist. Since these two couples are my favorites from the whole Rinaverse, I didn‚Äôt mind the parallels.  \n   - The Dads chat and guys chat were dull, lacked originality, and only managed to annoy me.  \n\n- **Heroine‚Äôs Portrayal and Mental Health Representation:**  \n   - I have no idea how realistically the heroine‚Äôs mental state was depicted. It was portrayed as a hardship, but it didn‚Äôt make her any less attractive or hinder her quality of life after everything was magically cured in a short period of time.  \n   - I deeply disliked Ava in her university years (all the previous books), so she‚Äôd never be my favorite type of heroine.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws, this book was a sentimental and enjoyable read for me, largely due to my attachment to Eli and the cameos of his parents. While it wasn‚Äôt perfect, the hero‚Äôs actions and the overall vibe of the story made it a 5-star experience for me (though it‚Äôs probably more of a 4).  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars (with the acknowledgment that it‚Äôs likely closer to a 4)."

This emotional conflict is heart-wrenching. Throughout her journey, Eli consistently supports Ava, even making personal sacrifices to ensure her well-being‚Äîremoving alcohol from their environment, distancing himself to avoid triggering her, and taking charge of her guardianship. His actions are profoundly romantic. Cole‚Äôs deep love for his wife and daughters, along with his readiness to protect them at any cost, is beautifully depicted. The bond between Arielle and Ava as sisters shines through, highlighting that they would do anything for each other.",

This was the book I'd been eagerly anticipating for four years, and holding it in my hands was an emotional experience. Having grown up with these characters‚Äîtheir images and moments etched in my mind‚ÄîI felt a profound connection while reading and writing this review.\n\nAva's battle with her illness resonated with me personally, leading to tears as I witnessed her struggle to live and understand herself. Cole's self-doubt as a father to Ava was equally moving. His love for his daughters and wife, and his willingness to do anything to protect them, struck a deep chord in me. I shed many tears for Eli and Ava, but seeing them finally achieve their happy ending brought me immense joy.\n\nI'm someone who feels deeply and forms strong emotional connections, making it hard to let go. This marks the end of an era for me, and I will cherish this book, returning for rereads whenever I can. I adored everything about it‚Äîthe couple, their journey, and the emotional depth.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - I finished this book on the 15th of June at exactly 5:54 AM, and my heart has been stampeded upon. I have burst into tears at random times of the day and find it extremely difficult to pay attention to things in my real life.\n   - This is the book I had been waiting for for at least four years. To even hold this book in my hands was such an emotional experience for me.\n   - I have grown up with these characters. Their pictures, edits, and moments are all stamped in my brain, so I was deeply emotional while reading the book and now while writing this review.\n   - Ava's suffering with her illness was something I connected with on a very personal level, so I was crying while reading her chapters and seeing her struggle to live and understand herself.\n   - Cole questioning himself as a father to Ava was another breaking point for me. Seeing the love he has for his daughters and wife and how he would do anything to protect them was heart-wrenching.\n   - I cried so much for Eli and Ava and have been over the moon to see them get their happy ending.\n   - I feel very deeply and get emotionally connected to things, making it difficult for me to let go. This feels like the end of an era for me.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Ava's struggle with her health, not having a recollection of time, and not being able to trust her own thoughts pushed her to question her importance to her parents, who call her their miracle child. This was heartbreaking.\n   - Eli was there for Ava throughout every step, going so far as to do things that would harm him just to save her. His actions, like getting rid of alcohol, removing himself from her vicinity to not trigger her, and taking control of her guardianship, were deeply romantic.\n   - Cole's love for his daughters and wife, and his willingness to do anything to protect them, was beautifully portrayed.\n   - Arielle and Ava together are the best sisters, and I know Ava would do anything to protect Arielle and vice versa.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - The Nash family scenes were so beautiful and made my heart burst with joy.\n   - The book beautifully portrays the themes of love, sacrifice, and family. Eli's mission to protect and save Ava was executed so beautifully.\n   - The book also explores the cruelty of seeing a loved one suffer, as seen with Silver and Cole watching their miracle child, Ava, suffer.\n\n- **Author's Writing and Previous Works:**\n   - I read Rina Kent for the first time when I read *Deviant King*, and to this day, Aiden and Elsa are my number one couple. I have their quotes, pictures, and edits plastered on my walls, and I will always cherish them.\n   - My love for Aiden and Elsa automatically extends to their children as well. Eli was the best husband ever, and this book was so beautiful.\n\n- **Personal Connection and Reread Value:**\n   - I will greatly cherish this book and will go back for rereads whenever I get time.\n   - I loved this book, the couple, and everything about it. I do not care if this seems like an overreaction to some people.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book had a profound emotional impact on me, and I connected deeply with the characters and their struggles. The themes of love, sacrifice, and family were beautifully portrayed, and the Nash family scenes brought me immense joy. Eli and Ava's story was heart-wrenching yet beautiful, and I am overjoyed to see them get their happy ending. This book marks the end of an era for me, and I will cherish it forever, revisiting it whenever I can.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Emotional Impact: 10/10\n- Character Development: 10/10\n- Plot and Themes: 10/10\n- Author's Writing: 10/10\n- Personal Connection: 10/10\n- Overall Rating: 10/10"

            "I enjoyed the story, but I believe it could have been developed into a duology to delve deeper into Eli and Ava's college years, their marriage, and Eli's darker side. A novella featuring their children would also be a wonderful addition.",
            "I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved Eli and Ava's relationship. Their banter and domestic moments were delightful, showcasing a deep bond of love and support. Ava faced significant challenges, and Eli's unwavering presence during her toughest times was truly moving. He sacrificed his own sleep to be there for her during her episodes and prioritized her well-being, even choosing not to have children to avoid worsening her condition. Though Eli has a cold exterior, his love for Ava runs deep, and he cared for her in essential, albeit tough, ways‚Äîsuch as aiding her in overcoming substance abuse.",
            "I approached this book with little expectation, particularly because I‚Äôm not fond of second-generation stories. Many readers labeled Eli as the worst male main character in RK's works, piquing my curiosity to see for myself. It seemed that much of the criticism stemmed from devoted fans of specific couples who have long harbored animosity toward Eli and Ava, even wishing harm upon them, which I found quite disturbing."

The story could have been expanded into a duology, but overall, it was a satisfying read.",

He refused to sleep to be present during her episodes, respected her boundaries, and prioritized her well-being, even refusing to have children if it would worsen her condition.\n   - Eli was portrayed as cold, but he truly loved Ava deeply and cared for her in ways that were both harsh and necessary, like helping her overcome drug abuse and drinking.\n\n- **Criticism of Other Readers:**\n   - Many readers criticized Ava for being a virgin, even though she had kissed boys and engaged in oral sex, which felt hypocritical.\n   - People were upset that Eli didn‚Äôt take advantage of Ava, which I found refreshing since he respected consent‚Äîsomething other RK MMCs often failed to do.\n   - Some complained that the book didn‚Äôt follow the series‚Äô usual themes, but I was glad it didn‚Äôt include the problematic elements like sexual assault or questionable kinks that were present in earlier books.\n   - Critics called Eli misogynistic, but I found this hypocritical since other beloved RK characters have done far worse, like calling their partners derogatory names.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - I enjoyed the story but felt it could have been a duology to explore more of Eli and Ava‚Äôs college years, their two years of marriage, and Eli‚Äôs darker side.\n   - A novella featuring their kids would be a great addition to the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite my initial lack of expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved Eli and Ava‚Äôs story.

It‚Äôs a story that will live rent-free in my mind for a long time.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  This isn‚Äôt a surface-level dark romance.

The story focuses on the stages of healing rather than just physical intimacy or tension, though it does contain explicit scenes. Their growth and eventual happy ending were deeply satisfying.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author‚Äôs ability to convey such raw emotion and complex themes is remarkable. The narrative is immersive, making it impossible not to feel connected to the characters and their struggles.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a deeply emotional and thought-provoking read that explores heavy themes like mental health and addiction while delivering a powerful love story. It‚Äôs not just a romance but a journey of healing and redemption. I‚Äôm still processing the impact it had on me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The timing of revelations and emotional moments maintains suspense and keeps readers engaged. The ending is satisfying, with a resolution that feels earned and emotionally fulfilling, beautifully concluding the themes of love and resilience.",

            "This book refreshingly breaks free from the repetitive cycle of its predecessors. I appreciated that the characters have moved beyond university life, allowing them to shed the immature pursuits that often define earlier narratives.",
            "The relationship between Eli and Ava is both heart-wrenching and emotional, enriched by the constant fear of Ava‚Äôs illness tearing them apart. Eli‚Äôs unwavering care for Ava, prioritizing her well-being above all else, is truly touching. While some of his actions to save her may be questionable, they are forgivable, rooted in love. Small gestures‚Äîpreparing baths, allowing her to decorate their home, and affectionately calling her ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúbaby‚Äù‚Äîhighlight their deep bond. Eli creates a safe space for Ava, where she feels both free and protected, even distancing himself when her well-being is at stake, demonstrating selflessness. His dedication, evident in moments like staying by her side at the clinic, holding her hand, and reading her favorite clich√© book, is deeply moving.\n\nAva emerges as my favorite protagonist in this literary universe. Despite enduring immense pain, she remains brave and resilient. Even when she struggles with her feelings for Eli, her love for him shines through. Her efforts to learn cooking, her attempts at gardening (even if they fail), and her passion for romantic movies and clich√© books make her endearing. Ava‚Äôs desire to be everything Eli needs, coupled with her fear of being a burden, adds depth to her character. By the end, her decisiveness and determination to fight for what she wants are truly inspiring.",

I feel satisfied with the ending.\n   - It was just sooo raw and unexpected, and twisty. It was e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g.\n   - The end of an era: thank you Rina Kent, for these books I have loved.\n\n- **Character Development (Ava):**\n   - WOW, this was a very good story for her. It suited her personality/character down to a T.\n   - I loved watching her grow, and change, and battle her demons.\n   - She didn‚Äôt change much in terms of her spoilt, little pink barbie self but I wouldn‚Äôt want that, Ava is fucking EPIC as she is.\n   - I loved how she took control of her own destiny like a bad ass, even though she was terrified.\n\n- **Character Development (Eli):**\n   - Eliüî•What an actual god this man is. AN ACTUAL GOD.\n   - The way this man took care of Ava, protected her, fought for her, missed her with his whole being when she left.\n   - He‚Äôs possessive and obsessive about it but c'mon, would we want anything else? NOPE!\n   - This guy is so richly layered, he's a beautiful specimen of man. He is so thoughtful, and caring, and loving towards Ava, and protecting her health.\n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**\n   - The book starts with Ava partying with her rando friends, in a club. Being her cheery, pink, flirty self. Eli is there, he's watching her.\n   - Ava is now Mrs. King. She has amnesia. And the confusion starts from there.\n   - Throughout the book, we get glimpses of Ava in the past, memories that her illness has locked away.\n   - We get scenes where she is in her psychosis, and Eli is helping her. We get snippets from Eli about the past, about the incidents and accidents involving Ava.\n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**\n   - White stars flashed behind my eyes, as I come so hard. - This was written at minimum 4 times in the book, it annoyed me because there are so many other ways to describe the euphoric feeling.\n   - Miscommunication. Every time it fucks me off. I may have been less aware of the annoyance of this particular trope in previous books, or I tolerated it. But not with Eli & Ava. I wanted full disclosure at every opportunity.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Subplots:**\n   - ALSO, the crumbs we had for everyone else üò≠üò≠üò≠üôåüèª NIKO AND BRAN - MY BABIES üíõüíõüíõüôåüèª Cecily and Jeremy üß°üß°üß°üôåüèª Lan and Mia üíôüíôüíôüôåüèª Ari and Remiiiiiiiiiiiiii - ahhhhh üíöüíöüíöüôåüèª Annika and Creigh üíúüíúüíúüôåüèª We have a few snips of Glyn being around but no Killian ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôåüèª Aiden and Elsa / Cole and Silver - RE originals.\n   - LOVED COLE'S POV, ABSOLUTELY FERAL for his interactions with Aiden, you just know those parent POV's hit differently, and the text messages!!! Classic üòÜüí•ü§™üòéüòç\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**\n   - The love: ü•µü•µü•µ\n   - ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fucking nightmare,‚Äù he grunts against my throat. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ruining everything.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù I whimper against his mouth. ‚ÄúYou ruined everything for me, too. I wish we could do a heart switch so you can feel what I do.‚Äù ‚ÄúFuck, Ava.‚Äù\n   - Eli tugs my head back with a fistful of my hair until I‚Äôm slammed by his presence again. ‚ÄúEyes on me when you come for me, baby.‚Äù ‚ÄúMmm, yes, please.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll hurt.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. I trust you.‚Äù God fucking dammit.\n   - ‚ÄúI love you, Eli. I‚Äôve been in love with you since I was a clueless little girl. What started as a naive crush deepened into this uncontrollable love where I‚Äôd do anything for you. Including forgetting about all the pain in the past.‚Äù\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a perfect conclusion to the Legacy of Gods series, delivering a raw, unexpected, and twisty story that deeply satisfied me.

By choosing not to have children to protect Ava's mental health, he further exemplifies his selflessness."

            "The plot twist, while not overly dramatic, effectively illuminates Eli's actions and enriches the story. The vivid portrayal of the characters' emotional pain makes their journey profoundly impactful. Both epilogues, particularly the second, offer satisfying closure. While the absence of Aiden's POV is a noted drawback, the scenes between Aiden and Elsa effectively compensate for it.",
            "Eli and Ava‚Äôs relationship captivates with its blend of banter, possessiveness, and angst, making them unforgettable characters. Ava is sweet and relatable, and her bond with Elsa is genuinely heartwarming. Eli's initially misunderstood actions ultimately resonate, revealing the depth of his love for Ava. The character dynamics among Jerces, Nikobran, Creigh Anni, and Aidenelsa are well-developed and satisfying, with Aidenelsa standing out as exemplary LOG parents, thanks to their unique and endearing dynamic. While Cole is depicted as a good father, his tendency to cling to past grudges feels unnecessary.",

While Eli's behavior and decisions could be frustrating at times, they ultimately made sense, making his perspective compelling and elevating him to my favorite character. \n\nAva embodies a true girl boss‚Äîdirect, fearless, and a master communicator.

I eagerly await the release of this book and am certain it will live up to my high expectations.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars (pre-release rating)."

            "This narrative effectively ties together key plot points and Easter eggs from previous books, addressing some readers' concerns. By considering the broader universe, it becomes clear that the story is cohesive and intentional.

            "Eli, who shares his father Aiden's psychotic tendencies, surprisingly reveals a sweet side, especially in his interactions with his brother, adding depth to his character. Ava, often criticized as annoying or bratty, is far more complex than she appears; she has faced significant physical and mental struggles that evoke genuine sympathy. Eli's love is profound and unique, setting him apart from other characters in the LOG series. His misunderstood nature is striking, especially given the book's exploration of dark themes and toxic masculinity.",
            "The characters' intense obsession with each other, coupled with their fear of loss amid personal struggles, defines them as ultimate soulmates. Their love, while devastating and destructive, ultimately leads to healing. It defies conventional expectations, breaking the mold of typical relationships. As noted, Eli emerges as a silent hero; his love for Ava flourishes through subtle gestures‚Äîunspoken acts of protection and quiet sacrifices."

Eli's nonchalance in response to Ava's defiance, coupled with his moments of vulnerability, made him endearing and added complexity to his character. However, he felt different from earlier portrayals‚Äîmore stern and serious‚Äîwhich made it challenging to connect him with his previous, snarkier self. The progression of Eli and Ava's relationship was beautifully written and heart-fluttering, with Eli's small gestures of love adding emotional depth to their dynamic.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Comparison to Other Works (Deception Trilogy):**  \n   - I was shocked to see people calling this book a copy of Adrian and Lia‚Äôs story because the two are not comparable. Adrian was the primary cause of Lia‚Äôs deteriorating mental state, forcing her into a marriage and trapping her for years. In contrast, Eli never harmed Ava‚Äôs mental state; instead, he tried to help her live a normal life and overcome her psychosis, even if his efforts were misguided. Ava‚Äôs condition and the circumstances of her memory loss (due to her guilt over hurting Eli) are entirely different from Lia‚Äôs situation.  \n\n- **Focus on the Main Couple (Eliava):**  \n   - The book was entirely centered on Eli and Ava, with no room for other couples to outshine them. The intensity and complexity of their relationship made it impossible for any other ship to compete. The story was so deeply focused on their dynamic that it felt unfair to compare them to other couples.  \n\n- **Character Sympathy (Eli‚Äôs Perspective):**  \n   - I felt immense sadness for Eli as the story progressed. All he wanted was for Ava to have a normal life, even though he knew it would ultimately drive them apart. During their two-year marriage (which Ava forgot), he sacrificed his own well-being, losing sleep and doing everything he could to help her condition. Despite knowing she would hate him in the end, he persisted because he genuinely cared for her.  \n\n- **Complexity and Depth of the Relationship:**  \n   - Eliava‚Äôs relationship was far more intense and nuanced than I expected. The layers of their dynamic left me in awe for ten minutes after finishing the book. Their complexity makes them stand out and surpass other fictional couples.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a deeply emotional and complex story centered entirely on Eli and Ava‚Äôs relationship. The comparisons to other works, like the Deception Trilogy, are unfounded, as the circumstances and character dynamics are entirely different.

            "Ava is far more complex than I ever anticipated. In previous books, it was challenging to grasp her character fully. Eli, on the other hand, is the quintessential book husband. He would do anything‚Äîliterally destroy everything and everyone‚Äîfor Ava. Think of him as an Adrian-level hero; he embodies that essence. Is it even possible to describe him as adorable and sweet? Yes, he is, and you simply must read to experience it for yourself. Being kissed by Eli is a beautifully addictive torment‚Äîsweet yet toxic. Their banter had me laughing out loud at times, especially as Ava delights in driving Eli crazy. I thrived off their witty exchanges.

Their interactions during their university years, as well as the two years Ava cannot recall, are largely left to the reader's imagination. I yearn for greater insight from both perspectives, as the story feels incomplete. More depth on Eli and Ava's journey would be greatly appreciated.",
            "Eli and Ava are exceptionally crafted characters. Eli‚Äôs deep devotion, coupled with a hint of madness‚Äîevident in lines like ‚ÄúI almost forget that I‚Äôm married to what‚Äôs societally known as a madwoman‚Äù‚Äîadds intriguing complexity to his persona.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series and Universe Closure**  \n   - I CAN‚ÄôT BELIEVE THIS IS ME SAYING GOODBYE TO THIS SERIES AND THE ENTIRE RINAVERSE. I‚ÄôM SAD. I‚ÄôM TORTURED.  \n   - What a great way to end this universe!  \n   - I love the little crumbs of old characters. The mention of grandpa Jonathan? I giggled. The mention of Teal Astor? I SCREAMED. And all the Royal Elite and Bratva characters.  \n   - Lastly, I want to express my gratitude to Rina Kent for bringing back the OG group chat. It‚Äôs so refreshing to read those texts again, especially a glimpse of Ronan‚Äôs sense of humor.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline**  \n   - If anything, I didn‚Äôt expect the storyline would be like this. It‚Äôs a mixture of Deception Trilogy and Black Knight - only in a few ways. I LOVE it so much.  \n   - This book is my second favorite in the LOG series. The first one is still occupied by *God of Ruin* - sorry, I just have a fixation on Landon and Mia.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ava King)**  \n   - SOOOOOOOO AVA KING. I feel so sorry for her. Despite her friendly, socially butterfly, and bubbly personality, she hides a traumatic experience that costs her mental health.  \n   - I didn‚Äôt expect that Ava‚Äôs background story would be this complex and heavy.  \n\n- **Character Development (Eli King)**  \n   - As for Eli, I must say he‚Äôs the most sane LOG men - tho I know he‚Äôs not THAT sane.  \n   - Businessman Eli? HOLY MOLY. I could feel the atmosphere only by reading the description. I could smell the money from another dimension.  \n   - One thing I love the most about Eli is that he didn‚Äôt hesitate to ask his parents for advice or opinions.  \n   - BUT I do dislike his behavior to Ava in the beginning. He kept saying things to ‚Äúmanipulate‚Äù Ava into believing that she was the burden of her family and whatnot.  \n   - At least he took care of Ava very carefully (even tho also selfishly) and loved her unconditionally.  \n   - The amount of ‚ÄúMrs. King‚Äù GAHHHHHH to have a man like Eli King‚Ä¶ oh, and he‚Äôs a god of dirty talk too, apparently.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics**  \n   - I‚Äôm glad that Miss Rina Kent decided to pair Ava with Eli. At first, I thought it would be Eli gaining advantage of her feelings. Turns out, it wasn‚Äôt that way. The obsession is running very deep in any King men‚Äôs DNA, I suppose.  \n   - The banter was top tier. TRUST ME.  \n\n- **Parental Relationships and POVs**  \n   - One thing I love THEEEEE most about this series is that we got to see the parents‚Äô POV. We got to see how the sparks were still there.  \n   - Cole and Silver‚Äôs story is my top 1 favorite in RES. So reading their now-relationship feels sooooooo calming.  \n   - ‚ÄúThis woman has been my everything since I was eight years old. Over four decades later and she‚Äôs still my safe space just like I‚Äôm hers. She still stirs the hot-blooded need to be with her at all times. People say marriage gets monotonous or dull with time, but that‚Äôs because they never experienced marriage or parenthood the way we did. If anything, it made us stronger and closer.‚Äù  \n\n- **Nostalgia and Emotional Connection**  \n   - FYI, I started my Rinaverse journey last year with Deception Trilogy. Then, at the beginning of this year, I started reading the rest of them - except Reina-Asher‚Äôs and Sebastian-Naomi‚Äôs books. But when I saw the names here, it felt like a long time ago.  \n   - My comfort characters <3  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a perfect conclusion to the Rinaverse, blending complex characters, emotional depth, and nostalgic callbacks to previous stories. Ava and Eli‚Äôs relationship, though rocky at first, evolved into something deeply passionate and caring. The inclusion of parental POVs and the OG group chat added layers of warmth and familiarity. Rina Kent has created a universe that feels like home, and this book was a heartfelt goodbye to it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è  \n- 3/5 üå∂Ô∏è"

            "The plot exceeded my expectations, centering on Ava, who has loved Eli since childhood but comes to hate him after a traumatic incident. Following a drunken accident, she wakes up two years later to discover that Eli is now her husband, with no memory of the intervening years. The storyline was gripping, making it hard to put the book down. However, I struggled to understand the drastic change in Eli's feelings for Ava; his sudden shift from indifference to obsession felt unexplained and unrealistic.",
            "The portrayal of female characters like Lia, Maya, Glyn, and Elsa is frustratingly consistent, depicting them as mentally unstable and reliant on men for emotional rescue. In contrast, male characters are often strong yet psychologically troubled, exhibiting violence while still functioning independently. Adrian's decision to force Lia into pregnancy is particularly disturbing, though his later provision of the morning-after pill offers a minimal gesture of decency. The depiction of parents is overwhelmingly negative, with most being terrible and psychologically unstable, except for Kyle Hunter and Rai. Teal and Ronan stand out as excellent parents, raising Remi, the only healthy, non-toxic character in the story. However, it‚Äôs disappointing that Remi‚Äôs story has not been given its own book.",
            "I was disappointed by the absence of chapters from the mothers' perspectives. Cole's chapter seemed forced and unnecessary. Additionally, the author's portrayal of all parents as terrible and psychologically damaged felt excessive and lacked nuance.",
            "The emotional bond between Eli and Ava was profoundly moving and brought me to tears. However, Eli's feelings felt underdeveloped, making it difficult to fully connect with his character. This lack of depth in his emotional transformation left the story feeling incomplete.",
            "I eagerly anticipate the upcoming books featuring Maya and Ilya, Remi and Ariella, and Gareth with their quirky teacher. The story has set a high standard, and I expect the same quality in these new releases. My favorite remains the first title, followed by the second, third, and fourth, with the last two being my least favorites."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the book was engaging and emotionally impactful, but it fell short in explaining Eli‚Äôs emotional transformation and relied too heavily on repetitive tropes for female characters.

The clever setup initially leads readers to believe that Eli coerced Ava into marriage, only to later unveil his genuine feelings, aligning with Ava's perspective. Their relationship's evolution, including a two-year separation to prevent triggering Ava's episodes, is both poignant and realistic.",

Their unconventional love was portrayed in a meaningful way, with their shared moments‚Äîthough not extravagant‚Äîeffectively capturing the essence of their relationship, especially in light of Ava‚Äôs mental illness. Eli‚Äôs unwavering support for Ava, even after she stabbed him during an episode, highlighted his unconditional love and understanding.

            "In previous LOG books, I found Ava's character unbearable and annoying. However, the character development in this installment is remarkable. She transformed into my favorite female character in the series. Her strength, sarcasm, and refusal to let her psychosis define her truly enriched the story. Although Eli made mistakes along the way, his decisions were rooted in love and concern for Ava's wellbeing. The chemistry between Eli and Ava stands out as my favorite among all the LOG couples.

            "This story features several engaging tropes, including Marriage of Convenience (my favorite), Broody Hero x Sunshine Heroine, Forced Proximity, Amnesia, and Praise Kink. While I anticipated the amnesia element, I envisioned a scenario where Ava works at King Enterprises without knowing Eli. The Marriage of Convenience twist surprised me, and I‚Äôm eager to see how it unfolds. I'm also intrigued by Cole's reaction to Eli and Ava's marriage.",

The hints of their relationship in previous books have kept me engaged, but I‚Äôll be heartbroken if it doesn‚Äôt deliver. I also hope the author avoids repeating past mistakes with the parents‚Äô storylines, as some previous plot points felt unrealistic and frustrating."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Cover Design:**\n   - I don‚Äôt like people on covers, so I have no opinion about the model cover. However, I‚Äôm disappointed with the special cover. I wanted the cello to be featured prominently, but it looks bland compared to other covers in the series. The diamonds bordering the cover feel out of place‚Äîare they supposed to represent a necklace or bracelet? I also disagree with those who prefer the fan-made cover; the butterfly motif feels more connected to Silver, not Ava. The cello was the perfect choice, but it wasn‚Äôt done justice.\n\n- **Blurb and Plot Expectations:**\n   - The blurb hints at a Reina and Asher dynamic, which I don‚Äôt like, so I‚Äôm nervous about the direction of the story. However, I‚Äôm thrilled about the ‚ÄúMrs. King‚Äù detail‚ÄîEli calling Ava ‚ÄúMrs. King‚Äù and Ava referring to Eli as her husband is everything. The fact that they‚Äôve been married for two years is a major highlight for me. I need every page to include ‚ÄúMrs. King.‚Äù\n\n- **Tropes:**\n   - The tropes revealed include Marriage of Convenience (my favorite), Broody Hero x Sunshine Heroine, Forced Proximity, Amnesia, and Praise Kink. I predicted the amnesia trope, though I imagined a different scenario where Ava works at King Enterprises without knowing Eli. The Marriage of Convenience trope shocked me, and I‚Äôm excited to see how it plays out. I‚Äôm also curious about Cole‚Äôs reaction to Eli and Ava‚Äôs marriage.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - I‚Äôm disappointed that Eli isn‚Äôt a virgin, as I wanted Ava to be his first and only. However, I can accept it if Ava isn‚Äôt a virgin either, as I‚Äôm tired of the manwhore x virgin trope. I also wish we were getting Aiden and Elsa‚Äôs POVs, as they started the series and deserve a proper send-off. Additionally, I hope Rina Kent doesn‚Äôt destroy the parents‚Äô characters like she did in previous books.\n\n- **Anticipation and Expectations:**\n   - This is my most anticipated book in the series. I‚Äôve been hooked since the Ruthless Empire epilogue and started Legacy of Gods solely for Eli and Ava. The crumbs of their relationship in previous books have kept me going, but I‚Äôll be devastated if Rina ruins their story. I also hope she doesn‚Äôt repeat the same mistakes with the parents‚Äô storylines, as some past plot points felt unrealistic and frustrating.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I‚Äôm both excited and nervous about this book. The cover and some tropes didn‚Äôt fully meet my expectations, but the ‚ÄúMrs. King‚Äù detail and Marriage of Convenience trope have me hooked. I hope Rina Kent delivers a satisfying conclusion to Eli and Ava‚Äôs story without repeating past mistakes or relying on overused tropes.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

I was surprised to find that I loved Eli and Ava after reading *God of War*. Initially, I didn‚Äôt like their characters, but I now feel a deep connection with them and am ready to defend them. Eli reminded me of Aiden, adding another layer of emotional depth to his character. Ari, insufferable yet chaotic, was a highlight; her stalking tendencies and manipulation of Remington into marrying her were both hilarious and entertaining.",

En general, esta serie ha tenido tramas decepcionantes (salvo GOP), y en este caso, ni siquiera percib√≠ un argumento s√≥lido. \n\nPor otro lado, ver a Aiden y Elsa actuando como verdaderos padres al consolar a Eli me pareci√≥ un cierre significativo. Esperaba un final que reflejara la culminaci√≥n de una serie, especialmente en un universo de 32 libros, pero al menos su historia concluy√≥. Eli y Ava siempre han sido el uno para el otro desde el nacimiento de Ava, y me alegra que hayan superado sus obst√°culos y est√©n viviendo su mejor vida. No entiendo por qu√© se odian tanto, pero me encantan; ¬°que duren!",
            "Me encant√≥ reencontrarme con mi familia y disfrut√© much√≠simo de Ariella en este libro. Cecily, ¬°te amo, te amo y te amo! Me emocion√≥ cuando le cont√≥ a Ava todo lo que Eli hab√≠a hecho por ella. Landon, siendo Landon, es un caos andante que me encanta. La pelea entre Niko y Ari fue algo que no sab√≠a que necesitaba ver hasta que sucedi√≥. Me hubiera gustado ver un poco m√°s de Kill y Glyn, as√≠ como de Jonathan y Levi, pero me alegra saber que est√°n viviendo su mejor vida. Ava Nash King es todo lo que esperaba y m√°s; me encant√≥ que fuera inteligente y se hiciera respetar. Eli, aunque lo niegue, tambi√©n se dio cuenta de esto cuando ella entr√≥ a la universidad.",
            "Ava me sorprendi√≥ por completo; esperaba que su situaci√≥n fuera complicada, pero no a ese nivel. Me alegr√≥ ver c√≥mo mi peque√±a pudo superar sus problemas y, adem√°s, aceptarlos. Estaba ocultando muchas cosas, lo que me rompi√≥ el coraz√≥n, pero al mismo tiempo me reconfort√≥ conocerla mejor. En cuanto a Eli, me encant√≥ su personaje; cumpli√≥ con mis expectativas y m√°s. Su dedicaci√≥n al cuidar de Ava, incluso cuando estaba desmayada, fue conmovedora."

        "conclusion": "This review reflects my deep emotional connection to the characters, particularly Ava and Eli, and my strong appreciation for their development and relationship. While the plot was found lacking in mystery and depth, the reader enjoyed the character dynamics and the closure provided for the series. I also expressed a desire for more detailed backstories and a more impactful ending, but ultimately cherished the journey and the emotional highs and lows I experienced throughout.",

            "While it carries a touch of Adrian and Lia, this story has carved out its own unique place in my heart. The portrayal of psychosis is heart-wrenching, as we witness the protagonist's daily struggle on the brink of collapse due to her episodes. I absolutely love how Eli and Ava find their happily ever after with triplets‚ÄîSeth, Sierra, and Zoey. And of course, the Jeremy-Cecily wedding is a delightful highlight!",
            "In this book, Eli emerges as a different character than in previous LOG installments. He embodies everything a girl could wish for‚Äîsweet, caring, and selfless. He sacrifices his own sleep to watch over Ava during her restless nights, ensuring she is comfortable and free from her episodes. Ava, on the other hand, is a delightful mix of surprises, banter, and fierce determination. I loved how she playfully pushed Eli's buttons throughout the story. Even after her amnesia, she carved out her own space and did everything she could to win Eli's heart.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed every segment of the book, from their witty exchanges to the tender moments they shared, as well as the intense encounters that kept me on the edge of my seat. Eli's thoughtful gestures for Ava‚Äîlike bringing her candy floss, her favorite romance novels, and creating sweet-scented baths‚Äîwere heartwarming. He pampered her with pink gifts upon her return from the hospital, savored her homemade meals, and took her on special outings, including restaurant dates, movies, hiking, and beach trips.\n\nAva matched Eli's intensity, often making him jealous in her own unique and playful way. The support from the LOG family, including Elsa, Aiden, Silver, and Cole, added depth to Eli and Ava's relationship, creating a sweet and loving atmosphere. Cecily stood by Ava as a motherly figure, fulfilling her best friend duties through both banter and challenges. Landon also contributed to their journey in his own understated manner. Aiden, with his humor and unwavering support for Eli and Ava, was a standout character, adding a delightful touch to the story. Overall, this book beautifully captures the growth of their relationship amidst a backdrop of love, friendship, and humor.",
            "I'm truly sobbing right now, and I know I won't get over this book anytime soon. I experienced every emotion imaginable‚Äîlaughing with Eli and Ava, feeling their vibrant energy, and sharing in their joys and sorrows. I cried alongside them, deeply connecting with their pain. Now that the entire LOG Series has come to an end, I find it hard to express how I feel."

        "conclusion": "This book has left an indelible mark on me, evoking a whirlwind of emotions and creating a deep connection with the characters, especially Eli and Ava. The intricate relationship dynamics, the heartfelt moments, and the support from the LOG family made this story unforgettable. The emotional journey, coupled with the well-developed characters and engaging plot, ensures that this book will remain a favorite for a long time.",

Ava and Eli are drawn to each other in a complex cycle of push and pull, often hidden from view, which ultimately exhausts them and those around them.

Initially, Eli's cold and distant demeanor made him difficult to like, but as their story progressed, I grew to understand and appreciate him more.",

            "The plot was expertly crafted, with the elements of the accident, hospital, and amnesia feeling both authentic and chilling. The unexpected ending was a pleasant surprise, showcasing a significant improvement over the author‚Äôs previous works. The story was thrilling and engaging, though at times, Ava's attempts to attract Eli's attention came across as desperate and could have been toned down. I also wished for a deeper exploration of Ava's journey with the cello‚Äîher passion for music, the reasons behind her hiatus, and her path to recovery. Her ambitions felt underdeveloped compared to those of other characters.",
            "The characters in the story were excellently portrayed, each standing out in their own unique way. Bran, Niko, Creigh, Anni, Jeremy, Cecily, and the King brothers (Landon, Aiden, Cole, and Teal) were particularly memorable. Ava Nash was well-developed and felt like a real person, though at times, her dependence on others, especially Cecily, was frustrating. I wished for her to exhibit more independence and seriousness. Eli King‚Äôs relationship with his father exceeded my expectations, and Aiden's support was commendable. However, I felt Eli's character was overly centered on Ava, lacking depth beyond his grumpy, arrogant, and reserved demeanor.",

The epilogues were a highlight, particularly Jeremy and Cecily‚Äôs wedding, which was heartwarming as we saw them as parents to Sierra, Zoey, and Seth. The second epilogue, showcasing a family moment, was equally touching. I believe this shouldn‚Äôt be the final book, as there are still many couples whose stories deserve to be told, such as Gareth and Kayden, Damien and Mio, Remi and Ariella, and Vaughn, the Pakhan‚Äôs son. Additionally, I felt Ronan Astor was underutilized, with only brief mentions and no significant appearances.",
            "Ava met my expectations with her strong personality, though her behavior felt somewhat repetitive, reminiscent of Lia from the *Deception* trilogy and a blend of Elsa. She exuded confident \"bad-bitch\" vibes like Silver, but without the bullying. Eli, on the other hand, surprised me. I initially pegged him as a Landon 2.0, but he revealed deeper emotions than I anticipated. His love for Ava was clear from the beginning, making him stand out among the other characters.",
            "This book profoundly moved me, and I sincerely hope it‚Äôs not the end. I cherished every scene and interaction between the characters, which left me feeling sentimental and deeply connected to them."

Eli and Ava‚Äôs relationship, along with the appearances of other beloved couples, made it a memorable read.

            "This book offers a distinct tone compared to its predecessors. Ava, now navigating her post-college years, reflects on her past through flashbacks. The story opens with her waking up in a hospital, suffering from amnesia and unexpectedly married to her nemesis, Eli. Confused about their marriage and the circumstances surrounding her fall down the stairs, Ava attempts to make Eli miserable in hopes of prompting a divorce. However, she underestimates the intensity of Eli's obsession and possessiveness.",
            "One of the standout elements of the story is Ava‚Äôs character growth. Initially self-destructive, she creates problems for Eli without considering the consequences. However, she matures over time, overcoming her cravings for drugs and alcohol and recognizing the impact of her actions on Eli‚Äôs career. Eli‚Äôs love for Ava is equally compelling; his caretaking and understanding, paired with his appreciation for her inner strength, are truly moving. He prioritizes her well-being and happiness, even as he grapples with his own emotional challenges.",
            "This dark novel explores the intense relationship between two main characters grappling with significant mental health challenges. Their journey is marked by both troubling moments and instances of connection and growth. The book features explicit content, including praise kink, bondage, discipline, and dub con, which may not be suitable for all readers. If you have sensitivities, I recommend reviewing the content warnings, as the story contains numerous potential triggers.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Continuity and Standalone Potential:**  \n   - I‚Äôm sad to have reached the end of this series (for now) and hope for more books in the future.  \n   - I devoured the entire series over the last few months, which is unusual for me, as I typically lose interest after two or three books in a series.  \n   - Each book in the series felt unique while still being tied to the others.  \n   - The author, Kent, wrote these books to work as standalones, and I‚Äôve seen people give five-star reviews to books in the middle without reading the previous ones. However, I believe readers miss out on a lot by skipping earlier books, especially the antagonizing dynamic between Ava and Eli during their college years.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - This book has a different vibe compared to the others in the series. Ava is now in her post-college years, with some flashbacks to her college days.  \n   - The story begins with Ava waking up in a hospital with amnesia, married to her nemesis, Eli. She can‚Äôt understand why she married him or why she fell down the stairs.  \n   - Eli refuses to grant her a divorce, and Ava tries to make him miserable to force his hand. However, she doesn‚Äôt realize the depth of Eli‚Äôs obsession and possessiveness.  \n   - The book explores themes of mental health, with Ava dealing with psychosis and Eli being a psychopath. Their relationship is intense, dark, and often mixed with moments of spice, including elements like praise kink, bondage, discipline, and dub con.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - One of my favorite aspects of the story is Ava‚Äôs character growth. She starts as self-destructive and willing to create problems for Eli without considering the consequences. Over time, she matures, stops craving drugs and alcohol, and begins to see the impact of her actions on Eli‚Äôs career.  \n   - Eli‚Äôs love for Ava is another highlight. His caretaking and understanding, combined with his recognition of her inner strength, are beautiful to witness. He prioritizes her well-being and happiness above his own, even as he struggles with his own emotional limitations.  \n\n- **Tone and Content Warnings:**  \n   - This is a dark book, with both main characters dealing with serious mental health issues. Their relationship is intense and often fraught with dark moments, though these are balanced by moments of connection and growth.  \n   - The book includes explicit content, such as praise kink, bondage, discipline, and dub con, which may not be suitable for all readers.  \n   - I‚Äôm not great at recognizing triggers, so I recommend checking content warnings if you have any sensitivities, as this book has many potential triggers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed Ava and Eli‚Äôs story. While it ranks toward the bottom of my favorites in the series, it‚Äôs still a 4.5-star read for me, which speaks volumes about the quality of the series as a whole.

            "The conflict was resolved in a realistic manner, highlighting her need for self-admission to seek help and acknowledging that she isn't fully healed. While her catastrophic episodes may have diminished, she continues to face struggles. I've been eagerly anticipating a chapter from Cole since the first book. Although I can't say I'm disappointed, I do feel a bit let down that his chapter was short and set during such a bleak moment in the story.",
            "Eli and Ava's relationship is truly unique, and I thoroughly enjoyed their journey throughout the book. I appreciated the hopeful ending, where they are able to have children. Ava's decision to prioritize her mental health and seek admission to a mental institution was a courageous step that added depth to her character. The dynamic between Ava, who struggles to grasp her reality, and Eli, who strives to shield her from its harshness, was compelling. \n\nI also found Remi and Ari's subplot delightful; they were an adorable couple, and I wish we could have explored their story further. The bond between Ari and Ava stood out as well, as it defied the toxic sister trope often seen in similar narratives. Their relationship was heartwarming and refreshing. However, I would have liked to see more banter and additional moments between him and Silver.",
            "I'm still reeling from this book. The sadness of it being over makes me want to cry. The revelations about Eli's actions and Ava's deteriorating mental state left me in tears. Their story is truly heartbreaking. Just thinking about the \"broken glass\" scene brings on the tears again. The emotional impact is profound‚ÄîI'm not okay.",

            "Eli King is truly the best! His care for Ava made the story both painful and beautiful. Despite his busy schedule, he always made time for her, exercising remarkable self-control for her well-being. His tenderness was reserved solely for her, as he protected her from herself, provided a sense of normalcy, and sought to heal her without her even realizing it‚Äîsimply the best!\n\nAva is a beautifully tragic character who faces numerous struggles, yet Eli stands by her side every step of the way. Her strength is inspiring, and she deserves all the happiness in the world. Cecy is the ultimate best friend, and Ari is an adorable little sister. It was heartwarming to see Aiden being a good father to Eli, and we always knew Silver and Cole would make great parents.\n\nEli and Ava's dynamic is filled with humor, and their banter is delightful. While the book features less smut and unfolds as a slow burn, Eli's moments of possessiveness brought butterflies. Their love story is truly beautiful, and I wish it had been expanded into a duet. I want to keep reading about Eli and Ava! Eli's epilogue was particularly heart-wrenching.",
            "As an emotional person, I rarely cry while reading, but this book moved me to tears in its second half. While the first half left my heart heavy, I completely succumbed to my emotions later on. My heart aches for both Eli and Ava; their love is simply beautiful. I'm tearing up just writing this.",
            "The anticipation for this book was intense! After encountering numerous spoilers, I couldn't wait to dive in. I've pre-ordered a signed paperback, but it hasn't shipped yet. Now that I've finally read my most anticipated book, I'm left wondering: how do I move on?"

The anticipation and emotional investment in the story were well worth it, and I am struggling to move on from this incredible journey.",

He took care of Ava so amazingly, it was very painful and beautiful to read. Even though he was very busy, he still took out time for Ava. He controlled himself so much just for her sanity.

            "In this story, Ava's fake marriage, originally intended for her protection, transforms into a genuine love. The emotional climax, marked by the revelation of truths, brought me to tears. The intertwining timelines and cameos from other characters effectively tied everything together, addressing lingering questions about why certain couples remained unmarried. Initially, I struggled to connect with the narrative due to its similarities to other works. However, upon re-reading with an open mind, I gained a deeper appreciation for its richness.",
            "In the first half of the book, I found it difficult to connect with Ava. She appeared bratty, entitled, and dismissive of her friends, which hindered my ability to empathize with her. However, upon reflection, I recognized that her behavior was a coping mechanism; she drinks to numb her feelings and fears losing herself to anxiety and depression. Her unrequited love for Eli added depth to her character. By the end, I truly felt for her struggles and the facade she maintained for others.\n\nEli, the oldest in the friend group at nearly 30, has matured beyond the party scene and embraced responsibilities in the King business. He shares traits with Aiden from RES‚Äîprotective, calculating, and possessive, yet tender and responsive. His unwavering love for Ava, even as she spirals, is heart-wrenching. I admired his patience and held onto the hope that Ava would one day love him without fear.",

Seeing \"THE END\" felt overwhelming, as it signified a farewell to a significant part of my reading life.

            "The complexity of Eli King and Ava Nash is unmatched. I deeply connect with both characters, and while there are some parallels between Ava and Lia, as well as Eli and Aiden, each possesses a distinct personality and narrative. Eli, in particular, resonates with me as the eldest sibling; I relate to his sense of responsibility, the burden of expectations, and the challenge of staying composed when chaos ensues. His portrayal of feeling overwhelmed when things go awry is both relatable and skillfully executed. Killian Carson is another standout character. Though he may be controversial and unlikable to some, I appreciate the depth of his morally ambiguous nature. If Eli reflects my own experiences, Killian embodies my darker side.",

The romance between them is intense and well-developed; despite Eli's past, it's clear that Ava is the one who truly matters to him. Her playful yet meaningful confession about her virginity adds depth to their connection.

            "Ava and Eli's banter and chemistry were exceptional, with Ava pushing back and Eli responding with equal intensity. Their electric sexual chemistry featured some of my favorite spicy scenes, and the palpable passion, hate, and obsession between them were compelling. I appreciated the inclusion of the supporting cast, including Cecily, Anni, Creighton, Landon, and Niko. The brotherly bond between Creighton and Eli stood out, as did the connection between Aiden and Eli, even without Aiden's POV. Cole's perspective was touching, and the group chat moment brought me to tears. The dynamic between Eli and Ava, hinted at in the previous five books, carried over beautifully into their own story, filled with angst and tension. I loved that their relationship developed years after university, adding a layer of mystery and intrigue. Ava's mental health struggles were portrayed with depth, allowing me to empathize with her feelings of being different and burdensome. Eli's profound love and protection for Ava shone through, and I admired how he encouraged her to be herself, even when she didn't recognize it.",

Eli and Ava were simply perfect, embodying a captivating darkness that I found irresistible."

            "The beginning of this book was challenging for me. Ava struggles to remember the last two years of her life and grapples with the reality of marrying someone she never expected to. The initial atmosphere felt unsettling, as if everyone around her was deceiving her, leaving her feeling trapped with Eli. I found this to be a surprisingly heavy read, which I hadn't anticipated.",
            "I have eagerly anticipated Eli's book for quite some time, and it did not disappoint. Eli is the kind of character who effortlessly steals your heart. I admired how every action he took was aimed at protecting her, even when it backfired. When he realized the impact of his methods on her, he stepped back without hesitation, despite the personal cost. Eli truly embodies the dominant, brooding figure I expected.",
            "While the rules surrounding her ex-friends, her abstinence from alcohol, and restrictions on driving or going out alone were intended to protect her, the lack of honesty behind these measures made the experience feel unsettling.",

            "This story evokes a genuine sense of horror and thriller that feels unsettling at first. However, I truly began to enjoy it after the halfway mark, when Eli's emotional barriers started to break down, revealing his care for her in his own unique way. The ending nearly brought me to tears!"

I think we all knew that Eli would be one of those characters who'll end up stealing our hearts, and he really, really did!\n  - I loved how everything he did was to protect her - even if it ended up smacking him in the face - and I love that when he saw just exactly what his methods were doing to her, he stepped back without any hesitation, even if it killed him to do so.\n  - Eli was definitely the dominant, broody man I thought he would be.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n  - I had a hard time with the beginning of this book though, with Ava not being able to recall the last two years of her life and trying to wrap her head around the fact that she married the last person she ever thought she would, it was a rollercoaster.\n  - The whole vibe at the beginning was a little off to me, it felt as if everyone was lying to her, as if she was trapped with Eli and she couldn't get out of this situation.\n  - This was such a heavy read and I wasn't expecting that.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n  - It honestly gave horror/thriller feels that were a little unsettling to begin with.\n  - I really started enjoying the book after the halfway mark, when we got to see Eli's walls crack a little.

Eli quickly became my favorite character in the saga; his willingness to sacrifice his life for Ava speaks volumes about his love for her, surpassing even his father's devotion.

It was a rollercoaster of emotions, filled with frustration, laughter, and heartfelt joy as the characters received their just rewards.",

Ava, far from being an angel, is a sassy, bratty princess who challenges Eli at every turn. Her struggles and strength make her a relatable and lovable character, even if some of her choices seem immature. The dynamic between Eli and Ava is unforgettable, and their story will linger in my mind for years to come.",

The reviewer grew to love both characters deeply, especially Ava, and found Eli's character development compelling.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The banter, chemistry, and tension between Eli and Ava were intense and captivating.

The reviewer appreciated the portrayal of their connection, which left them emotionally invested and in awe.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The novel incorporates several tropes, including amnesia, obsessive/possessive male lead, marriage of convenience, grumpy/sunshine dynamic, praise kink, enemies to lovers, small age gap, and forced proximity. While the amnesia trope is not typically the reviewer's favorite, it was executed exceptionally well here. The story also includes mental illness representation, which adds depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The reviewer was deeply moved by the story, often needing to put the book down to collect themselves due to the strong emotional investment. The mental darkness of the story, though not as physically dark as others in the series, was impactful and haunting.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The reviewer praised Rina's storytelling, describing it as consuming and immersive. They recommend going into the story as blind as possible to fully experience the journey.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  This book brings a close to the Rinaverse for now, leaving the reviewer in shambles and eager to revisit earlier works in the series. They appreciated the opportunity to buddy-read and share emotional reactions with a friend.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply emotional and beautifully broken love story that showcases Rina's exceptional storytelling.

The beginning was confusing, and it wasn't until the middle that I began to grasp what was happening. However, the plot twist and the unfolding events toward the end captivated me, making up for the initial lack of clarity.",

However, Eli's character was disappointing compared to his previous portrayals. While he was a menacing figure in earlier books, this time he appeared as a softened, love-struck version, which didn't quite fit with his established persona. Additionally, the explanation of Eli's love for Ava felt vague and lacked a strong connection for me.",

In comparison to *God of Fury*, it falls short in portraying the couple dynamics, although it does offer updates on the characters' lives 2-4 years later.",

Eli sacrificed everything, including their marriage, to protect Ava. Meanwhile, Ava defied her family by choosing to stay married to him, seizing the opportunity to start anew with Eli.",

To me, it‚Äôs right up there with the Monster Trilogy. The level of maturity RK gave us in this novel hasn‚Äôt been seen in any of the Legacy novels.  \n\n- **Setting and Plot Expectations:**  \n  I think the fandom was expecting the book to take place during university, but I believe focusing on their marriage was a better choice. It wasn‚Äôt a school romance; it was about a marriage, which is hard and not all sunshine and rainbows.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I love that both Eli and Ava grew during their marriage, even if most of their growth happened when they were separated. Eli gave up everything to keep Ava safe, even their marriage. Ava went against her own family by staying married to him because she got to start over with Eli.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Impact:**  \n  It took me several days to finish this because I could feel their pain through the pages, though some interpreted this as boring. I can‚Äôt think of any other characters that suffered so much for their happily ever after (HEA). Well, Kirril and Sasha and Cecilia and Tobias are up there too.  \n\n- **Themes of Love and Obsession:**  \n  The closest MMC to Eli is Niko in regard to their obsession. Eli and Ava‚Äôs obsession with each other, and subsequently their love, made being together the only choice. It sounds clich√©, but marriage really is a choice you make every day.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel stands out in the series for its maturity, emotional depth, and focus on the complexities of marriage.

Adrian and Lia were my first couple from RK, so they hold a special place, even if they‚Äôre not my favorite.  \n\n- **Emotional Closure and Nostalgia:**  \n   - This book deserved 5 stars not because it was perfect, but because it marked the end of an era‚Äîa closure that I couldn‚Äôt ignore.  \n   - I‚Äôm emotionally attached to these characters and can‚Äôt face the reality of their story ending. I even dreamed about Vaughn Morozov‚Äôs book and seeing my precious couples as parents and older.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tropes:**  \n   - Rina Kent‚Äôs writing is engaging, and she excels at creating memorable couples and tropes. However, some aspects of her stories feel less impactful than others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRina Kent‚Äôs books, especially the Monster Trilogy and the Legacy of Gods series, have left a lasting impression on me. While not every aspect of her stories is perfect, the emotional connection I have with her characters and the nostalgia tied to their journeys make her work unforgettable. Her ability to create compelling couples and tropes keeps me coming back for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars ü©∑‚ôæÔ∏è"

The angst was palpable, and I appreciate well-executed miscommunication, which R.K. handled perfectly here. It makes perfect sense for Eliava to conclude this universe that the Kings began. I absolutely loved it!",
            "Eliava met my expectations perfectly. While their time setting and marriage create a different atmosphere, I found it refreshing rather than off-putting. Eli has completely captured my heart; his devotion to Ava is truly endearing. Ava's struggles deeply affected me, especially as they echoed the parents' stories in Re/Deception, which was heartbreaking. I also appreciated Ava's playful banter with Eli‚Äîher sass is delightful! The brat kink aspect really resonated with me. Eliava remind me so much of Adrialia and Aidenelsa; their love is palpable. Eli feels like Aiden 2.0, and I can't get enough!",

I adored the interactions among all the Royal Elite characters and often find myself missing them.

I felt it provided the ideal closure to the series.  \n   - The setting chosen for the ending couldn‚Äôt have been better.  \n   - Unlike the previous books (based on what I‚Äôve seen discussed online), this one felt the most similar in terms of plot to RE, and I absolutely loved that.  \n\n- **Emotional Connection to Characters:**\n   - I adored the book about Silver and Cole, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that I also loved the book about their daughter.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I struggled to connect with the earlier books in the series, the final book exceeded my expectations. It provided a satisfying conclusion, stayed true to the essence of RE, and left me emotionally fulfilled.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This made their relationship more enjoyable and relatable.  \n\n- **Connection to Previous Books (Parents' Stories):**  \n   - Having read the books about the parents before this one helped me understand the characters' behaviors better.  \n   - I appreciated the references to the parents, which added depth and enjoyment to the story.  \n\n- **Continuity and Updates on Previous Couples:**  \n   - It was fun to hear updates about the previous couples, which added a sense of continuity and connection to the series.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - The book was good, but nothing particularly crazy or exciting happened.

            "Initially, I worried this book might lead me into a slump, but it has turned out to be my favorite read of the year. I never expected a dark romance to evoke such strong emotions, yet I feel a deep connection to the characters.",
            "I approached this book with little knowledge of Ava and the ghosts she literally hides in her closet. The chemistry, tension, and angst‚Äîespecially Eli's secret pining‚Äîkept me on the edge of my seat. I found myself swooning at times and giggling during their playful banter. Ava and Eli are truly each other's perfect match, which only deepens my affection for them.",
            "The author's writing flows like a soothing melody, reminiscent of a lullaby or poetry amplified. She deeply understands the emotions readers seek when they pick up her books and has perfected the formula to deliver them.",

This moment was raw and emotional, far more than I anticipated. After finishing the story, I found myself staring at the wall, still processing everything that unfolded. The emotions stirred by their journey, especially this one, are unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced while reading. I absolutely adore Eli and Ava; these characters will forever hold a special place in my heart. I miss them deeply and wish I could erase these books from my memory just to experience them anew."

            "Eli's character truly resonated with me. His unwavering support for Ava, offered without her needing to ask, was heartwarming and exemplified the kind of assistance that everyone grappling with mental health issues deserves. I found myself moved to tears for both Eli and Ava‚Äîthe time they lost, their struggles, and their eventual reunion. Eli's dedication to keeping Ava mentally present and grounded was profoundly touching.",
            "This book moved me to tears three times, overwhelming me with its emotional depth. The story has woven itself into my life, and I find myself constantly thinking about the characters, perhaps to an unhealthy degree. Each time I cried felt cathartic, leaving me with a sense of happiness as I closed the book, though I plan to reread it soon. I deeply empathize with Ava, who grapples with anxiety and depression, much like I do. While my struggles lead me to isolate myself, Ava's push her toward partying and drinking, offering a realistic portrayal of how mental health affects individuals differently. Her experiences, particularly the moments when she feels lost in a \"black hole\" and struggles to recall what happened, resonated with me profoundly. I, too, have faced similar episodes of losing touch with reality, and this book made me feel understood, as if someone finally recognized my battles."

The portrayal of mental health struggles, particularly through Ava‚Äôs character, felt deeply relatable and validating. Eli‚Äôs unwavering support for Ava was heartwarming and inspiring. The story not only provided an escape but also helped me feel more connected to reality. I absolutely loved it and will cherish it forever.",

The climax occurs when Ava regains her memories and threatens divorce, prompting a temporary separation.

The epilogue reveals their happy family life with triplets‚Äîtwo girls and a boy‚Äîalong with a dog and a cat, fulfilling Ava‚Äôs dreams.",
            "The spice level is rated /5. The story features a virgin heroine, Ava Nash/King, who, despite her inexperience, engages in various intimate acts, including oral sex, edging, hair pulling, rough sex, anal play, and bondage, without condom use. The hero, Eli King, is possessive but reveals his softer side only when Ava shows distress. Both characters remained celibate during their separation. Ava grapples with mental health challenges, such as suicidal tendencies, fugue states, sleepwalking, and occasional violence. Their relationship is characterized by bickering, sexual tension, and a push-pull dynamic, with Ava often provoking Eli to elicit a reaction.",
            "This novel weaves together several compelling tropes, including a J/P hero, complex characters, a marriage of convenience, blackmail, dark romance, mental health struggles, suspense, a sociopathic hero, and a six-year age gap. The story culminates in a Happily Ever After (HEA) ending, with the couple welcoming triplets. However, readers should be aware of potential triggers, including attempted suicide, murder, violence, gore, attempted sexual assault, and references to child abuse."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a rollercoaster of emotions, blending dark romance, suspense, and mental health struggles. The dynamic between Eli and Ava is intense, with moments of sweetness amidst the chaos. While the story could have explored more of the pregnancy and Eli‚Äôs overbearing nature during that time, the ending provides a satisfying HEA with the addition of triplets and pets.",

Despite some ethical and narrative concerns, the story is gripping and emotionally impactful, leaving a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 üåü üåü üåü üåü üåü"

            "This story completely surprised me; it was nothing like I expected, and it playfully poked fun at our theories. I do feel a bit disappointed about the age gap, as I had hoped Eli and Ava would share all their first experiences like Silver and Cole. However, Eli and Ava are far from perfect. Eli's obsession with Ava and the way he pursued her were significant red flags that triggered her mental health issues. Yet, he learned from his mistakes. Although communication isn't his strong suit‚Äîseriously, Eli?‚ÄîI can empathize with him; he was afraid of ruining his second chance with Ava after the amnesia incident. He stumbled, but he grew. As for Ava, she was quite the brat at times! I understand her struggles with memory loss and the secrets surrounding her, but her recklessness was frustrating, especially since it happened so often.",
            "Ava King, also known as Mrs. King, my beautiful goddess, holds a special place in my heart. I love her deeply! Initially, I thought Eli was the main cause of her alcohol addiction, but the story revealed deeper issues. I admired her character growth, especially when she stood up for herself against Eli. \n\nEli King, the enigmatic figure often referred to as the God of War, is a character I‚Äôm proud of. He truly deserves the King and Steel empire and, most importantly, Ava's love. While he exhibited some serious stalker tendencies and possessiveness over Ava, it added an intriguing layer to his character that I found compelling.\n\nThe Chamber of Gossip group chat, featuring Sam‚ÄîEli's ex-nanny and therapist‚Äîand Leo, known as Henderson, Eli's assistant, were standout elements for me. They provided Ava with much-needed support in their own unique ways. \n\nI also want to give an honorary mention to the Nash family‚Äîmy favorite! SilverCole will always hold a special place in my heart as my favorite couple.",

While the amnesia trope feels repetitive, the depth of Eli and Ava‚Äôs relationship and the dark, intricate plot make it a compelling read. The emotional impact of the series ending is bittersweet, leaving readers longing for more stories from this universe.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.5/5"

The hype surrounding this book is well-deserved, even if some readers had overly high expectations.",

            "The book would have benefited from being written as a duet, given its lengthy plot and the intricate dynamics between Eli and Ava, which left several questions unresolved. While some aspects of the plot were predictable due to spoilers, the overall progression remained engaging. Certain elements felt repetitive, echoing themes from the author's earlier works, such as the Deception Trilogy, Kingdom Duet, and Truth & Lies Duet. This mirroring of parental characters and storylines may seem redundant, but it also offers a sense of continuity for long-time readers.",
            "Eli stands out as one of the author's top three male leads, thanks to his unwavering dedication to Ava and his selflessness, which make him a compelling protagonist. Ava, unexpectedly deep, grapples with mental health struggles that add significant layers to her character, establishing her as one of the strongest female leads in the author's universe. The supporting characters, including Vaughn Morozov, Cecily, Remi, Ariella, Aiden, and Elsa, enrich the narrative, though some could have benefited from further development. \n\nAt the heart of the story is Eli and Ava's relationship, marked by Eli's patience and devotion, creating a dynamic that is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. The friendship between Ava and Cecily is a standout element, showcasing a strong and supportive bond. Meanwhile, the side couple, Remi and Ariella, offers a fun and endearing contrast to the main romance. Aiden and Elsa's roles as parents add depth to the story, though more interactions with Eli would have enhanced their presence.",

The narrative would have been enhanced by incorporating more flashbacks to provide deeper insight into Eli and Ava's past, especially their university days and their relationship prior to Ava's amnesia.",

I‚Äôve grown attached to all the characters over the years, and this was a fitting, albeit emotional, conclusion.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The push-and-pull dynamic between Eli and Ava was a highlight. Their story, featuring amnesia and a marriage of convenience, was fun and engaging. The enemies-to-lovers trope was executed well, with plenty of pining and tension. The spicy scenes were off the charts, adding depth to their relationship.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  Rina tried something different for this concluding novel, which I appreciated. The mental health storyline was well done and distinct from similar themes in *Vow of Deception*. It was written thoughtfully and added emotional weight to the story.  \n\n- **Series Conclusion and Future Hopes:**  \n  While the ending was satisfying, I wish there could be a legacy series or an epilogue, similar to *The Royal Elite*, to explore the characters‚Äô futures further. I‚Äôd love to see them with their kids and marriages, giving a glimpse into their lives beyond this series.  \n\n- **Series Ranking:**  \n  My final ranking for the series is:  \n  1. *God of Wrath*  \n  2. *God of Malice*  \n  3. *God of War*  \n  4. *God of Fury*  \n  5. *God of Pain*  \n  6. *God of Ruin*  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a thrilling and emotional conclusion to the Rina-verse. The dynamic between Eli and Ava, the spicy scenes, and the well-handled mental health storyline made it a standout. While I‚Äôm sad to see the series end, I hope for a future legacy series to revisit these beloved characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific numerical rating was mentioned in the review."

            "The plot twist linking murder to the characters' marriage didn't resonate with me; while the build-up was impressive, the revelation fell flat. However, Jeremy's revelation that Eli visited Ava every night was a surprising twist. Additionally, the polo ball scene, though small, was a poignant moment that brought me to tears of joy.",
            "Ava is a character beautifully crafted by Taylor Swift, and I found myself wanting to hug her throughout the book. Eli's dedication to Ava, especially his nightly visits, was truly heart-wrenching. Their banter was delightful and kept me smiling, making their dynamic a standout aspect of the story. I also loved the glimpses into other couples' lives, particularly the LOG couples; seeing their journeys a few years later was a real treat. Jerececy's moments brought me to tears, and I wished for more of Landon-Mia and Killian-Glyndon. Landon‚Äôs humor and unpredictability provided much-needed comic relief, while Cole‚Äôs disdain for Eli, Aiden, and Remi was hilarious, especially his nickname for Aiden: ‚Äúthe twat‚Äôs twatty father.‚Äù",

            "The author fell short with both the plot and writing. The story felt disjointed and failed to fulfill the promise of Eli and Ava‚Äôs journey. While the wedding subplot was initially off-putting, it ultimately reflected Eli‚Äôs obsessive and sociopathic tendencies, as his extreme actions stemmed from a desire to protect Ava. However, the book left many key questions unanswered, including the events at Remi‚Äôs party, the bike scene from *God of Wrath*, and Eli‚Äôs memory loss before age six. Additionally, the lack of chess scenes was disappointing.",
            "In much of the book, I struggled to connect with Eli and Ava, as they felt different from the characters I cherished in the *Ruthless Empire* epilogue. However, by Chapter 32, I finally recognized the Eli and Ava I remembered. Despite their questionable actions, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to dislike them. Rereading parts of Aiden‚Äôs trilogy helped clarify their motivations. Eli, embodying his father's traits, is arguably the best man, even with his sociopathic tendencies. His actions, while extreme, were driven by a deep commitment to Ava‚Äôs safety and well-being. Ava, a kind and self-aware individual, consistently prioritized others over herself. Her mental struggles and self-destructive tendencies were heartbreaking, yet her love for Eli and her family shone through.\n\n**Ariella:** I‚Äôve adored her since Aiden referred to her as a ‚Äúmini Cole,‚Äù but in this book, she fell short of that description. Her treatment of Ava post-amnesia was disappointing and lacked empathy. \n\n**Landon:** While I usually appreciate his drama-stirring nature, he came off as overly annoying here. His reckless actions, such as providing Ava with incomplete information, showed a disregard for her mental state. \n\n**Cecily:** I‚Äôve never liked Jeremy, and Cecily‚Äôs failure to advocate for Ava was infuriating. As a psychology student, she should have recognized the harm in enabling Ava‚Äôs self-destructive behavior. \n\n**Creighton:** I love his bond with Eli, but his treatment of Ava was unnecessarily harsh, especially considering her amnesia. \n\nEli and Ava‚Äôs relationship is complex and rooted in unconditional love. Despite their struggles, they are perfect for each other. Eli‚Äôs sacrifices and patience with Ava are unparalleled. Comparing Eli to Adrian is unfair; Eli never took advantage of Ava, even refusing to consummate their marriage until she was ready."

The explanation about Eli kissing Ava as a child felt unnecessary and detracted from the story.\n   - The book‚Äôs execution was poor, and the characters deserved better. The pain Eli and Ava endured felt excessive, and their happy ending, while satisfying, was overshadowed by the book‚Äôs flaws.\n\n- **Fan Reactions and Comparisons:**\n   - The selective outrage from fans of other couples (e.g., Jeremy-Cecily, Brandon-Niko) was hypocritical. Eli‚Äôs actions, though extreme, were driven by love and protection, unlike other characters who took advantage of their partners.\n   - The book‚Äôs focus on fan service (e.g., Jeremy-Cecily crumbs) detracted from the main story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile Eli and Ava‚Äôs love story is compelling and their happy ending is well-deserved, the book‚Äôs execution fell short.

            "Eli King is a deeply devoted and self-sacrificing character who prioritizes his wife's well-being above all else, often at the expense of his own health, career, and comfort. His actions‚Äîsuch as banning alcohol, memorizing her letters, and steering clear of triggers‚Äîdemonstrate his profound understanding of her struggles. While his love is obsessive and protective, he is willing to go to extreme lengths, including resorting to violence, to ensure her safety and happiness. Their relationship is complex; Eli's unconditional love is not always reciprocated. He respects her boundaries, refraining from physical intimacy when she cannot consent, and avoids coddling her to prevent further deterioration of her mental state. Despite her disdain for him, he remains unwavering in his devotion, even taking on the role of \"her villain\" to help maintain her sense of normalcy.",
            "The comparison of his character to literary figures such as Mr. Darcy and King George adds a poetic depth to the narrative.",
            "Eli's gestures‚Äîgetting a tattoo, purchasing her favorite pink items and cellos, and keeping her watch‚Äîsymbolize his deep love and connection to her. His decision to avoid undressing in front of her to prevent triggering her with his scar further highlights his sensitivity and care.",
            "The narrative is emotionally charged, culminating in Eli‚Äôs powerful monologue that encapsulates his intense love and obsession. The story leaves a lasting impression, seamlessly blending romance, tragedy, and devotion in a raw and profound manner."

        "conclusion": "The novel presents a deeply moving and complex portrayal of love, sacrifice, and obsession through the character of Eli King. His unwavering devotion to his wife, despite her struggles and lack of reciprocation, is both admirable and unsettling. The story‚Äôs exploration of mental health, unconditional love, and the lengths one will go to protect their loved one makes it a compelling and emotionally impactful read.",

I admired how Eli remained by Ava's side, even in her unawareness, tending to her needs‚Äîwashing, bathing, and reading to her while she slept. Their relationship was central to the narrative, marked by genuine care rather than abuse, which is often seen in similar stories.

I particularly disliked how he blamed Cecily for Ava's spoiled behavior, especially since Cecily was the one who kept Ava alive and cared for her the most. However, I loved witnessing Eli's transformation as he revealed his true feelings for Ava, even if he initially hid them, believing he was a trigger for her. Their endearing habit of calling each other ‚Äúmy wife‚Äù and ‚Äúmy husband‚Äù in their perspectives was delightful. I found myself relating to Ava throughout her story, and Eli's humorous remark about needing to see a doctor for his obsession with her was both iconic and goofy.\n\nEli and Aiden King share such a hilarious similarity, especially in Chapter 23, which had me in stitches. Eli's trauma surrounding food was heartbreaking, while the touching moments between Ava and her aunt Elsa added depth. I loved seeing the party trio‚ÄîLan, Ava, and Remi‚Äîreunited; I crave more of their dynamic. Niko's possessiveness over Bran is always entertaining, and the fact that Levi King survived his past heart attacks caused by Niko, Kills, and Landon is just too funny.\n\nI adore Eli and Ava; their relationship evolved beautifully, and I‚Äôm thrilled to see them mature together. The Jercecy moments were incredibly sweet, nearly bringing me to tears with their happiness. The Nikobran interactions were heartwarming, and seeing Bran genuinely happy is life-affirming. The revelation that Kimmy is Ari‚Äôs godmother and that Ronan‚Äôs child is Remi, whom Ari is obsessed with, is simply iconic. The weddings were adorable, leaving me at peace with all the characters.\n\nChapter 32's discussion about Mia brought me to tears; it was such a heartfelt moment. Finally, Chapter 43, where everyone gathered to celebrate Ava‚Äôs birthday, was beautiful. It was wonderful to witness all the characters grow and find happiness together.",
            "This book had me in tears several times, particularly during the Jercecy moments, the conversation with Mia, and the birthday celebration. Witnessing Eli and Ava's growth and maturity was truly satisfying.",
            "Ari is both funny and iconic‚ÄîI absolutely love her! The irony of Ava‚Äôs godmother being Elsa, especially since Aiden King (Elsa‚Äôs husband) was once Silver‚Äôs ex-fianc√©, is hilarious. Now they‚Äôre best friends, which adds to the humor. It‚Äôs also amusing to see the first generation telling their daughters that their dads weren‚Äôt always great, while the second generation is shocked. I‚Äôm just sitting here thinking, ‚ÄúYeah, I know!‚Äù"
        ],
        "conclusion": "I absolutely loved this book. Despite some initial reservations about Eli, his character development and the evolution of his relationship with Ava were beautifully done. The emotional moments, humor, and relationships between the characters made this book unforgettable. While the marriage plot felt a bit forced, the overall journey of Eli and Ava, along with the growth of all the characters, left me feeling at peace and deeply satisfied.",

I found myself understanding Ava a lot in her book and seeing myself in her sometimes.\n   - Eli repeatedly saying he should probably go see a doctor for his obsession with Ava is iconic and goofy. I love it.\n   - Eli and Aiden King are so similar; it‚Äôs hilarious.

            "The book did not meet my expectations for Eli and Ava's story. I was hoping for more intensity and chaos, particularly from Eli King. I wanted to see his darker side and the intricate game he was playing with Ava, but the narrative felt incomplete. The rationale behind Eli and Ava's marriage seemed overly simplistic, lacking the complexity I anticipated from his character. However, Ava's storyline stood out for me. She remained true to herself, scheming and provoking Eli, which I appreciated. Her emotional journey was poignant, especially when she entrusted her heart to the wrong person.",
            "The author crafted incredibly compelling characters, each winning a piece of my heart. The book shifted my perspective, making me love the villains more than the princes. I enjoyed exploring each character's journey and appreciated the glimpses into their parents' lives, which brought me joy. I was particularly thrilled to see more of Ronan, Aiden, and Cole, especially their dynamic as fathers navigating their children's lives. A brief scene with Niko and Ariella, though short, filled me with happiness. Eli's character surprised me; he was more sweet and attentive than dark and manipulative. While I missed the elaborate schemes I had anticipated, I admired Eli's dedication and sacrifice for Ava. The intensity of his love for her and his efforts to keep her grounded were touching and enhanced the story. The romantic tension and eventual resolution between Eli and Ava were beautiful, even if they didn't fully align with my initial expectations.",

Even after finishing *GoWar*, they continue to occupy my thoughts, sparking countless scenarios for their future. Ava is perfection‚Äîmy all-time favorite heroine, an icon and a legend. Eli exceeded all my expectations; I‚Äôve dreamed of seeing him as a husband ever since that adorable, determined kid kissed Ava for the first time. He truly embodies a king‚Äîpossessive, relentless, and fiercely dedicated to getting what he wants, which has always been Ava. Their relationships with friends only deepen my affection for them. Ava and Cecy represent true friendship, while Eli and Creigh are the ultimate brother duo. I love these characters so much that I find myself in tears just thinking about them.",

            "I loved the appearances of previous characters and couples, especially Creigh, Anni, Cecy, and Jeremy. Every moment with Jeremy and Nikolai thrilled me. The deep exploration of Ava and Cecy's friendship was beautiful; despite the distance, Cecy consistently stayed connected with Ava, and Jeremy ensured she never felt alone. Ava's character arc was remarkable‚Äîstarting off as someone you might dislike, she ultimately becomes someone you can't help but love. She's iconic, determined, and a master of manifestation, just like her sister.\n\nAri truly stole the spotlight for me. Though her appearances were limited, her well-written character made every scene she was in unforgettable. Unlike the other couples, she is uniquely obsessed with Remi, making her an icon and a legend. Eli King's unexpected transformation was amazing; seeing him cry for Ava revealed a softer side to his character, showcasing him as a devoted husband and father. Aiden's protective nature, especially in defending Eli, was heartwarming‚Äîhe's a fantastic father figure.\n\nCole's lingering resentment over Silver's first waltz and fake engagement added a humorous and memorable touch. Landon, on the other hand, is superior to everyone‚Äîhe's the smartest and a true mastermind. Every time he appears, it elevates the chapter. I adore him; he's chaotic yet always eager to help.",
            "I appreciated how the book tied up loose ends and provided deeper insights into the lives of previous characters, offering a satisfying conclusion. However, I still crave more‚Äîparticularly a story centered on Ari and Remi, or details about the weddings, especially Bran and Niko‚Äôs. I‚Äôm also curious to know if Lan and Mia, as well as Jeremy and Cecy, had children.",

Every action Eli takes is driven by his desire to protect Ava, even if it means lying to her or dealing with the consequences.

            "Eli, initially portrayed as a cold and unfeeling character focused solely on his wife, reveals a surprising depth of emotion in this installment, surpassing all previous men in the Legacy of Gods series. Ava is a well-crafted character whose suffering and reliance on others, particularly Cecily, are central to the narrative. Landon's character development is subtly hinted at, and his relationship with Ava is explored thoughtfully without excessive emphasis. While Cecily's role is significant, her frequent video calls could have been minimized. The bond between Creighton and Eli is endearing, and viewing the story through Eli's perspective adds warmth to the overall narrative.",

            "Ava transcends the typical \"dumb blonde\" stereotype; she is a richly layered character grappling with mental health issues and insecurities that add significant depth. Her relationship with her sister, Ari, is heartwarming and refreshing, a dynamic we haven't seen in previous books. Eli is undeniably intense, bordering on psychotic, yet I found his character compelling. While his actions, such as stabbing someone‚Äôs hand, didn‚Äôt faze me, I questioned his choice to tie Ava up and force her to get sober. His rejection of Ava at her 17th birthday party puzzled me, but he redeemed himself by memorizing her heartfelt letter, which was incredibly sweet. I enjoyed the chemistry between Ari and Remi, though I wish they had their own book. Eli and Cole's evolving friendship was another highlight; their similarities create a complex bond filled with unspoken affection.

She‚Äôs deeply layered, with mental health struggles and insecurities that add incredible depth to her character. I also loved seeing her relationship with her sister, Ari, which was wholesome and something we hadn‚Äôt seen in previous books.\n\n- **Character Development (Eli):**\n   - Eli is undeniably intense, even borderline psychotic, but I loved him for it. His actions, like stabbing someone‚Äôs hand, didn‚Äôt bother me, though I questioned his decision to tie Ava up and force her to get sober. I also didn‚Äôt understand why he rejected Ava at her 17th birthday party, but he redeemed himself by memorizing the letter she wrote him, which was incredibly sweet.\n\n- **Relationship Dynamics (Ava and Eli):**\n   - Ava and Eli are my absolute favorite couple! Their enemies-to-lovers dynamic was captivating, even though they‚Äôre no longer in college. One of the most emotional moments was when Ava realized Eli never took his shirt off in front of her because he didn‚Äôt want her to see the scar she left him or be triggered by his face. It showed how deeply he cared for her. I also adored how Ava always defended Eli, even when she hated him. Eli‚Äôs jealousy, possessiveness, and obsession were intense but added to his charm.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Relationships:**\n   - I loved seeing Ari and Remi together, though I‚Äôm disappointed they don‚Äôt get their own book. Eli and Cole‚Äôs evolving relationship was also a highlight‚Äîthey‚Äôre so similar, which is probably why they get along. Their friendship is complex but secretly full of love. I do wish we could‚Äôve seen more of the other couples, though‚ÄîI missed them!\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The triplets‚Äô arrival felt sudden. One moment, Ava was open to having three kids, and the next, they had triplets. It was a bit jarring, and I still can‚Äôt picture Eli and Ava as parents‚Äîthey feel so young in my mind.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was everything I hoped for and more. The characters were complex, the relationships were deeply emotional, and the story kept me hooked from start to finish. Despite a few minor pacing issues, it was a perfect read for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n5/5 stars."

            "Eli and Ava's story is refreshingly realistic, devoid of fairy tale clich√©s, which I truly appreciate. Eli's unwavering devotion to Ava, even when she didn't reciprocate his feelings, is both absurd and endearing. He recognized her strength and never treated her with pity, becoming her steadfast support. The moment Eli declared, \"Eli loves me,\" after years of waiting, was incredibly poignant.\n\nTheir love story unfolded over seven tumultuous years, filled with ups and downs. I particularly liked that Eli wasn't infatuated with Ava since childhood, as their six-year age difference would have made that uncomfortable. One memorable moment was when Eli allowed Ava to accidentally stab him, responding with, \"It's fine, it's an accident,\" showcasing his patience and understanding.\n\nEven during their divorce, Eli's commitment shone through as he reflected, \"Since she waited years for me to come around, I can do the same. As long as it takes.\" Additionally, the playful banter between Eli and Cole added a humorous touch, with Cole's pettiness providing comic relief. Only Ava could match Eli's Tin Man vibe, making their dynamic all the more entertaining.",
            "Your heart has gradually come to life, and it‚Äôs entirely yours to shape as you wish. I am grateful for your patience, unwavering support, and for treating me with such normalcy. Thank you for gifting me this beautiful life.",
            "Oh my goodness, I‚Äôm in tears. I‚Äôm heartbroken that this will never happen to me. Ava, I know you‚Äôre struggling, but I can‚Äôt help but feel so sad. I can‚Äôt believe this universe has come to an end."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This novel left a profound emotional impact on me, with its realistic portrayal of love and the deep, unwavering bond between Eli and Ava. Their relationship, filled with sacrifices, patience, and unconditional support, was both heart-wrenching and beautiful. The supporting characters added humor and depth to the story, making it a well-rounded and unforgettable read. Eli, in particular, stands out as a green flag character, embodying loyalty and love in its purest form. This book has left me in tears, but also with a deep appreciation for the complexities of love and relationships.",

Eli‚Äôs caring nature, especially in supporting Ava through her mental health struggles, makes him a remarkable hero, reminiscent of his affectionate father, Aiden. The group dynamics, particularly among the Legacy men and Elite boys, add both depth and humor to the story. I also love the enduring frienemy relationship between Cole and Aiden after 25 years.",

            "Ava is one of my favorite female main characters. The pain and struggle she endures evoke a strong desire to hug her and shield her from the world. Her endearing traits‚Äîlike her love for pink, candy floss, and cheesy books and films‚Äîmake her relatable. Eli, the male main character, stands out for his genuine devotion to Ava. He performs countless acts of kindness for her without seeking recognition, even hiding his good deeds. Unlike many MMCs in the genre, Eli's care for Ava transcends physical attraction; he is willing to let her go if it means ensuring her happiness and safety, demonstrating a selfless love. The relationship between Ava and Eli is beautifully developed, emphasizing emotional connection over physical intimacy. Their love is intense, obsessive, and unconventional, yet profoundly moving. Eli‚Äôs possessiveness and protectiveness evolve into a deep, self-sacrificial love that enriches their bond.",

It's addictive. It's toxic. It's sweetly poisonous.‚Äù  \n     - ‚ÄúYou have already captured my heart, body, and soul, Ava... The lack of you has stripped my world of color and made me realize you‚Äôre my sole light in the darkness.‚Äù  \n     - ‚ÄúHe kisses me like it‚Äôs our first and last. At the same time. He kisses me like he‚Äôll never stop kissing me.‚Äù  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations and became one of my favorites in the series. Ava and Eli‚Äôs relationship was beautifully written, with a perfect balance of emotional depth, character development, and plot progression. Their love story, though unconventional, was deeply moving and unforgettable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating, likely 5/5."

            "Eli is often misunderstood and unfairly criticized by readers. While he lied to his wife and pressured her into marriage, his intentions were rooted in a desire to protect her and aid her recovery from addiction. When Ava asked him to let her go, he respected her boundaries. He concealed the fact that Ava had stabbed him to shield her from Aiden's wrath, demonstrating his commitment to her safety. Eli sacrificed his own mental well-being, staying up to watch over Ava during her episodes and keeping his distance while she was in the psych ward, knowing his presence could trigger her psychosis. His actions, including taking a life to protect her, underscore his unwavering dedication to Ava. Conversely, Ava often faces criticism for her behavior, which stems from her severe psychosis and mental health struggles. Her experiences of dissociation, panic attacks, and suicidal tendencies are frequently misunderstood by readers.",
            "The author clearly indicates that their books are dark and may not be suitable for all readers. As someone who dislikes their work, I recognize that it's better for me to avoid these books rather than leave negative reviews."

It also critiques readers who unfairly judge Ava for her mental health struggles and the author's writing style, emphasizing that her books are intentionally dark and not meant for everyone.",

            "The plot was engaging, though not flawless, and distinguished itself among other lengthy novels. I appreciated that Eli wasn't fixated on Ava since childhood, which helped avoid any awkwardness. The emphasis on character development and relationships, rather than an overabundance of sex scenes, was a refreshing aspect.",
            "Eli's character development was exceptional. Initially frustrating, his growth and the sacrifices he made for Ava were truly remarkable. Ava emerged as a badass character, bravely confronting her fears and savoring every moment, even during tough times. Both Eli and Ava were imperfect yet perfectly complemented each other, embodying resilience and hope in the face of their struggles. Their relationship was beautifully portrayed, with Eli being considerate and supportive, never pressuring Ava, even when she desired more.\n\nThe father-son dynamic between Aiden and Eli was unique and heartwarming, with Aiden offering strict yet supportive guidance. Ava's relationships with Elsa and Cecily were equally precious, highlighting strong bonds and mutual support. The friendships, particularly between Ava and Cecily, along with the camaraderie among characters like Jerces, Remiari, and AidenElsa, were refreshing and uplifting. The inclusion of characters like Silver and Cole, along with the humorous banter between Aiden and Cole, added depth and levity to the story. While I was disappointed by the absence of a Ronan scene, I thoroughly enjoyed the interactions and dynamics among the supporting cast.",

However, the cryptic flashbacks during Ava's episodes left me wanting more clarity. I would have preferred a more complete understanding of the dire situation from the outset, rather than having many details revealed later.",
            "Eli's character has several questionable moments, including disrespectful remarks toward Ava, such as calling her a prostitute, and making murder threats that exacerbate her psychosis. These actions were troubling, especially given his overall character arc. However, Eli also has redeeming qualities, particularly when his sacrifices for Ava come to light. His dedication ultimately won me over, reminding me of Aiden, a character I admire.\n\nAva can be frustrating at times, especially when she behaves brattily or neglects her health by turning to alcohol and drugs instead of taking her medication. Nevertheless, her growth is commendable. I felt proud when she recognized her need for mental health support and reached out to Eli after her healing journey, demonstrating that her resilient spirit remains intact.\n\nIt was delightful to see older characters like Aiden and Cole maintain their humor despite aging. I also appreciated the glimpses of other LOG couples settling down, though I wished for more details about their happy families. Remi and Ariella's relationship felt underdeveloped; the snippets provided weren't enough, and I would love a novella exploring Remi's realization of his love for Ari.\n\nThe romance between Eli and Ava felt inconsistent, with their relationship fluctuating between good and bad until the climax. I would have preferred to see more of Eli's sacrifices during their two-year marriage, rather than just hearing about them from other characters like Cecy. This would have made their romance feel more solid and impactful."

Eli kissed Ava on the day she was born‚Äîtalk about fate! His willingness to wait for her, just as she waited for him, is truly touching. The fact that he remembered Ava's letter from six years ago, word for word, speaks volumes. When Cecily revealed everything Eli did to help Ava with her addiction, it showcased his dedication as a best friend. I also adore Remi and wish he had his own book.

When Ava tipped the bartender thirty thousand dollars and remarked that her husband was \"very generous,\" all I could think was, \"Slay!\" \n\nThere was a moment when Ava was pushing Eli's buttons, and he internally wrestled with the thought, \"I can‚Äôt kill my wife. I cannot lock her up either.\" Then, when Ava went to Remi just to annoy Eli, he picked her up and threw her over his shoulder. She turned to Remi for help, and his response was hilarious: \"I ain‚Äôt seen nothing. Matter of fact, I‚Äôm blind in my left eye and forty-three percent blind in my right eye. I don‚Äôt see much of nothing. Matter of fact, I can‚Äôt even see you, sir.\" \n\nAnother standout moment was when Ava handed Eli the morning-after pill, challenging him to at least have the guts to give it to her himself. He simply handed her the pill, staring her down, and said, \"There. Are we done?\" The audacity was both shocking and amusing. Overall, the humor and tension in these interactions made for an engaging read."

Eli and Ava‚Äôs journey, along with the supporting characters, has been a rollercoaster of emotions, and I am deeply invested in their world.

Ava's bratty antics were often hilarious, especially when she wrecked Eli's favorite car and ignored his advice.

Eli's care for Ava was incredibly touching, particularly when he waited outside her door in the psych ward, reading to her while she slept. Their love story stood out as it transformed from chaos to a profound understanding between them.

            "This book captivated me with its unexpected twists and turns. I found myself shocked and confused at times, particularly with the initial suspicion surrounding an Ava clone. However, the plot unfolded beautifully, and the pacing allowed for an in-depth exploration of the characters' emotions and relationships, making the story both immersive and impactful.",

Her growth, supported by the friendship of Sam and Leo, adds depth to her character and is heartwarming to witness. Sam and Leo play crucial roles in Ava's recovery, providing acceptance and camaraderie that help her regain her sense of self. While Eli's actions can be questionable, they stem from his profound care for Ava, as he prioritizes her well-being‚Äîeven if it means lying or being strict. Ava emerges as a strong, badass protagonist who stands her ground against Eli, despite her reliance on him due to her condition.",

            "The love story between Eli and Ava is the book's standout feature. Their relationship feels authentic and emotionally resonant, particularly in moments like Eli allowing Ava to decorate their home in pink and his declaration of \"Everything Ava wants.\" Eli's recognition that love alone can't heal Ava adds depth to his character. Ava's journey to learn cooking as a gesture of gratitude for Eli is a touching detail, while Eli's care for her‚Äîbathing her and supporting her before and after her hospitalization‚Äîhighlights his devotion.\n\nAri and Remi, the secondary couple, are a favorite, and it's disappointing they won't have their own book. The sibling dynamics, particularly between Ava and Ari and Eli and Creigton, are well-developed and enrich the narrative. Subplots involving Sam and Leo, as well as Cecily and Jeremy's wedding, are enjoyable additions. Eli's relationship with Aiden is another positive aspect of the story. However, Cole's jealousy toward Eli feels tedious and lacks the charm found in other jealous characters like Levi and Xander.

            "Eli and Ava's relationship is both intense and beautifully crafted. Their love story intertwines possessiveness, obsession, and unconditional care. Eli's awakening to his love for Ava, quirks and all‚Äîher fondness for pink, cotton candy, and cheesy books and movies‚Äîwas profoundly moving. The dialogue between them is sharp and emotionally resonant; their playful banter about divorce and Eli's determination to keep Ava showcases their dynamic and enriches their characters.",

Vivid imagery, particularly in moments like Eli touching Ava's cheek and the depth of their eye contact, enhances the emotional connection between the characters and the reader.",
            "This book delves into themes of love, obsession, protection, and healing. Eli's declaration that Ava has captured his heart, body, and soul, along with his willingness to let her go for her safety, highlights the depth of their connection. Central to the narrative is the notion that love can both wound and mend. Ava's recognition that Eli has healed her broken heart through his care further emphasizes this theme.",

I will truly miss the characters, from the Royal Elite kids to their children and the Russian mafia group. The story took me on a rollercoaster of emotions‚Äîsuffering, laughing, crying, and even screaming. Eli King and Ava Nash, the children of my favorite Royal Elite characters, faced the toughest challenges in the saga, but witnessing their happiness and gradual healing brought me immense joy."

            "The plot maintained a strong pace, though some reveals lacked the impact found in *Ruthless Empire Doll Master*. Nevertheless, this did not diminish the overall enjoyment. The chemistry between Ava and Eli developed steadily, even during Eli's emotional shutdowns, keeping the story engaging with their undeniable connection.",

Their mutual possessiveness adds an intriguing intensity to their relationship.

It was heartwarming to see all the couples achieve their happy endings, especially Jer and Cecy, as well as Ari and Remi‚Äîthose moments were thrilling! The mystery deepened significantly, and when everything finally unfolded, I was genuinely shocked. I've learned to always expect the unexpected from these books, as I‚Äôve struggled to decipher any of the plot twists so far.",
            "Eli is a captivating blend of Aiden and Elsa, and I adored that! Initially, I struggled to connect with him, but by the end, his unwavering devotion to Ava completely won me over. Ava was my favorite character; my heart ached for her. She was so much more than the bubbly, social girl the world perceived her to be. Eli truly understood her and fought against his feelings, but Ava challenged him at every turn. Their relationship became an obsession for both, and while I enjoyed their fiery banter, it was their tender moments that truly melted my heart.",
            "The humor in the original group chat was fantastic, and I appreciated the inclusion of Cole's perspective. However, I would have loved to see Elsa or Silver's POV as well. This book exceeded my expectations in every way. Without giving too much away, I can confidently say it will make you fall in love with all the characters!",

In the beginning, I was struggling to like him, to be honest, but by the end, his devotion towards Ava totally won me over!\"  \n\n- **Character Development (Ava):**  \n  \"Ava was my favorite princess; I loved her the most out of all the girls from this series. My heart hurt for her. She was so much more than just a bubbly, social, and mouthy girl as the world saw her.\"  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  \"Eli understood her very well, and he tried so hard to refute his feelings, but Ava challenged him at all turns. They became each other's obsession.

I just wish Elsa or Silver had their own POVs though.\"  \n\n- **Ending and Epilogues:**  \n  \"I loved the ending and the epilogues. Seeing all the couples get their own HEAs was so heartwarming.

By this time, I know that I should always expect the unexpected from Rina's books because I've been unable to decipher any of the plot twists that her books have had so far.\"  \n\n- **Series Closure and Future Hopes:**  \n  \"It makes me feel so sad to arrive at the end of the series because I just can't get enough of all the characters. They were all sources of my comfort. Although Eli & Ava's book was the perfect way to end this series, I can't help but think that Remi & Ari should have their own book in this series too.

            "The story concluded too abruptly, offering little opportunity to witness Eli and Ava in a genuinely happy state together, which felt rushed and disappointing. More flashbacks to their college years, particularly highlighting their initial animosity, would have added depth to their relationship. Additionally, Eli's intriguing yet underexplored life during that time left me wanting more.",
            "Eli's character is profoundly selfless and dedicated, particularly in his care for Ava and her mental health. His actions‚Äîsuch as distancing himself to prevent triggering her and concealing his stab wound‚Äîdemonstrate his unwavering love and devotion. Ava's transformation from an immature, revenge-driven girl to a strong, selfless woman is compelling. Her journey of healing and advocating for her needs, even at great personal cost, is truly admirable. Supporting characters like Cole, Aiden, Remi, and Ariella enrich the narrative with depth and charm. The relationship between Eli and Ava is beautifully depicted, with Eli's obsession and protective instincts standing out. However, I would have appreciated more acknowledgment of his feelings for her during their younger years, even if only subtly. The book suggests that Eli broke Ava's heart, but this moment lacked the emotional impact it could have had.",

            "*God of War* took me by surprise, particularly with Eli's character, who was the least mentioned in previous books. This left me uncertain about what to expect from him. The story kept me engaged with the intriguing mystery surrounding Ava's amnesia, her mental state, and Eli's secrets. While the outcome was unexpected, it ultimately made sense. I anticipated Eli to be as clever and calculating as he had been portrayed before, but I appreciated his thought process and his efforts to protect Ava from her trauma.

However, I wish the other characters from earlier installments had been referenced more, especially since this is the final book in the series.",

            "Eli is a caring and selfless man whose primary focus is Ava's well-being. He supports her through every step of her illness, all while managing two major businesses, never complaining. Eli respects Ava's boundaries, maintaining distance to avoid triggering her, though his intense possessiveness‚Äîsuch as publicly confronting another man‚Äîadds complexity to his character. While he forces Ava into marriage, his actions stem from genuine concern for her mental state. Tender moments, like calling her \"Mrs. King\" and cherishing her confession letter, reveal his deep love.\n\nAva, strong and resilient, possesses an unwavering sense of self-worth. She stands up to Eli, demanding the attention and time she deserves as his wife, and demonstrates remarkable willpower in overcoming her illness. Her ability to forgive Eli and care for him, despite her heartbreak, underscores her compassionate nature. Their relationship, though flawed, is deeply loving and beautifully imperfect. The soft moments, such as Eli's poetic declarations of love, resonate just as powerfully as their passionate encounters. Their journey from a shaky marriage to a profound connection is emotionally compelling.",

            "The story was full of unexpected twists that kept me on the edge of my seat.

            "The plot was both unexpected and skillfully executed, providing a refreshing contrast to another author's disappointing work. The story thoughtfully navigated heavy themes and delicate topics, and I appreciated the time invested in its development.",
            "I found myself deeply sympathetic toward Eli and Ava's struggles, as their emotional journeys were both relatable and well-crafted. Eli, despite his occasional flaws, provided unwavering support for Ava, which was heartwarming and essential for anyone facing challenges. Ava's character was lovable and self-aware, skillfully avoiding the pitfalls of selfishness that could have made her unlikable. Eli stands out as a refreshingly non-misogynistic male lead, and his age (29) made his behavior more tolerable rather than annoying. In contrast, Cole's character felt stunted and frustrating, particularly in his adult, parental role, which was surprising given how much I enjoyed him in his own book.",
            "The dialogues were generally natural, though Cole's felt stilted and inconsistent with his character. However, the book effectively captured the unhinged obsession trope, which I thoroughly enjoyed.",

            "Ava has become my favorite LOG girl, exceeding all my expectations. Eli's character development was a pleasant surprise; I wasn't initially a fan of Creighton or Landon, but Eli's transformation from a cold, unfeeling man to someone deeply caring and devoted to Ava won me over. His unwavering support for Ava, even at her lowest, was incredibly moving and resonated with me emotionally. Their love story, though messy, felt deeply relatable and gave me hope for finding someone who would stand by me during tough times. The emotional depth of their relationship, particularly Eli's despair after Ava requested a divorce, was heart-wrenching and solidified my affection for their story. The inclusion of other couples, like Jercecy‚Äôs wedding, and the parents added richness to the narrative. Ariella and Remi emerged as my favorite side characters, and I‚Äôm captivated by their story, even the smallest glimpses of it. I particularly related to Ava as a girl in her early 20s who has struggled with mental illness throughout her life.",
            "As the older sister to a more stable younger sibling, I deeply resonated with Ava's feelings of inadequacy and her belief that her family would be better off without her. The portrayal of mental health struggles in Ava's character made me feel seen and understood in an unexpected way. I'm saddened that the story has come to an end, as I will miss these beloved characters. The universe crafted by this author will always hold a special place in my heart.",

            "Eli is introduced as a mirror to Aiden, fixating on Ava from birth and declaring they would marry. However, it‚Äôs disappointing that he initially seems indifferent toward her, leading their relationship into a cycle of mutual sabotage. Despite this, the chemistry between Eli and Ava is undeniable, and their friends recognize it too. Like other male characters in the series, Eli makes misguided choices with good intentions, making it difficult to fault him. \n\nI appreciated the increased focus on Jeremy & Cecily, Creighton & Anni, and Lan & Mia. While Niko & Bran received plenty of mention, their appearances were less frequent than I had hoped, as were those of Kil & Glyn. The parents' cameos were fantastic, and I was pleased to see Remi & Ari find their happy ending. \n\nEli's commitment to protecting Ava, even through questionable methods, reveals the depth of his love. His efforts to prioritize her mental and physical health, eliminate triggers for her episodes, and support her in every way underscore his devotion. While he may not surpass Killian or Nikolai, there‚Äôs no doubt about his deep love for her.",

            "The book opens with a two-year gap, featuring Ava waking up with amnesia, which immediately drew me in. It delves into Ava‚Äôs mental illness, a facet not previously highlighted in her character, but this choice feels intentional. The exploration of mental health alongside the ‚ÄúTill death do us part‚Äù theme in marriage is both compelling and emotional. The ending is beautifully crafted, providing a satisfying resolution to all the relationships. While reading the earlier books isn‚Äôt essential, it certainly enriches the emotional impact of the conclusion.",
            "While many readers have expressed negative opinions about Eli's character, it's important to recognize that male main characters (MMCs) are often portrayed as possessive and flawed. The story is designed to evoke initial dislike for Eli, and I certainly found him unlikable at first. However, as the narrative unfolds, we gain insight into Eli's behavior and his treatment of Ava, which ultimately adds depth to his character.",
            "The author took a refreshing approach in this final book, which I truly appreciated. The inclusion of snippets and cameos featuring Ava and Eli from previous installments added both continuity and depth to the story.",

The ending was satisfying, and the closure of the series was bittersweet. I'm sad to see it end but excited for Garth‚Äôs story in 2025.",

            "Ava is a beautifully crafted character whom I adored from the start. Her depth and range of emotions‚Äîspanning happiness, sadness, and anxiety‚Äîmade her relatable and engaging. She embodies loyalty, beauty, humor, bravery, and strength, with her mental resilience, especially at the book's conclusion, being particularly inspiring. Ava imparted valuable lessons, and I hold her in high regard.\n\nEli is equally commendable, consistently prioritizing Ava and supporting her in every way. While some may criticize his choice not to take her to a help center after her amnesia, I believe he made the right decision by introducing her to a normal life and fostering a sense of safety. This approach ultimately empowered Ava to seek help on her own. Although Eli's actions could be frustrating at times‚Äîsuch as his delayed confession of feelings‚Äîthey were understandable and well-intentioned. I found his character deeply moving from the beginning.\n\nTogether, Ava and Eli offer contrasting perspectives, particularly regarding the suggestion that Ava should have been taken to a help center.

            "While I'm disappointed that Vaugh didn't receive his own story and that this journey is coming to a close, I'm eagerly anticipating Gareth's upcoming release.",
            "**Review:**\n\nI absolutely adore Jeremy and Cecily; their relationship is profoundly emotional and impactful. Niko and Bran, my first MM romance, hold a special place in my heart, and their story was beautifully crafted. Initially, I found Lan unlikable, but his significant character growth, especially in how he changed for his partner, was impressive. Mia is another character I love unconditionally. \n\nKill and Glyn's relationship began on a rocky note (the first chapter was tough, but I chose to overlook it), yet I admire how Kill prioritized Glyn and how their dynamic evolved. Eli and Ava's relationship was toxic at first, but their intense love for each other shone through; Eli genuinely wanted to be the best husband for Ava, and I stand by that. \n\nAnni and Creighton were cute, but their story felt less prominent compared to others, and I only remember a few details about them. Remi and Ari's dynamic was hilarious, and I loved how Remi pursued her desires and succeeded. Kyle and Niko's relationship and interactions were a highlight for me, while even the small moments with Adrian and Lia were meaningful, as they hold a special place in my heart. \n\nThe parents' chapters were particularly entertaining, especially the fathers. Levi's disdain for Kill, Xan calling Jer a lizard, Cole and Aiden's ongoing bickering, and Ronan reveling in the chaos were all memorable moments. I wish there had been more about Kirill and Sasha, and I'm eagerly anticipating Damian's book. A children's book featuring Knox and Anastasia would have been a delightful addition, though I can't recall if one exists.",
            "This dark romance embraces its gritty, intense tone, and I appreciate that it doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of its narrative. Its refusal to conform to a typical happy ending is what makes it truly compelling."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this work delivered a mix of intense emotions, complex relationships, and memorable characters. While some couples stood out more than others, each story brought something unique to the table. The humor, especially from the parents, added a delightful layer to the story. Despite a few missed opportunities (like Vaugh‚Äôs book or more about Kirill and Sasha), I thoroughly enjoyed the journey and am excited for what‚Äôs next.",

Eli's unique approach involves avoiding physical intimacy for two years, prioritizing Ava's mental health over his own desires.

Eli, the brooding and possessive hero, captivated me despite his controversial methods in handling Ava‚Äôs situation. I believe he acted with her best interests at heart, protecting her without infantilizing her. His bold actions following her amnesia ultimately led to positive outcomes. The group chat scenes were consistently hilarious, and Cole‚Äôs longstanding animosity toward Eli, rooted in the *Royal Elite Series*, added depth to their dynamic.

The author promised that *God of War* would defy our expectations, and they certainly delivered‚Äîwhat an unexpected and thrilling read!",
            "Eli and Ava exceeded all my expectations. I adore them both wholeheartedly; they will always be my top favorites. EliAva holds a special place in my heart as my beloved characters and parents. I also want to give a shoutout to Remi and Ari‚Äîthey're simply perfect! I can't wait for their story to be told.",
            "Watching the other LOG couples get engaged, married, and travel together filled me with joy; they truly deserve this happiness. With the Rinaverse now officially concluding, it feels like they've taken a significant piece of my heart with them.",
            "I have never experienced such a whirlwind of emotions while reading a book as I did with *God of War*. I screamed, gushed, cried, and laughed‚Äîall in the span of a few hours. \n\nAfter immersing myself in this story, I find it hard to move on. The last 24 hours have left me utterly in love with the characters, and I can't shake the feeling of loss already. It's the end of an era, and I know I'll have countless sleepless nights ahead, missing them dearly.\n\nI approached this book with no expectations, having been disappointed too many times before. This time, I kept my hopes in check, and to my surprise, the author truly exceeded my expectations. Also, who do I need to pray to for a man like Eli King? I'm getting desperate!"

Ava has long harbored feelings for Eli, but he only begins to notice her during their college years. The narrative delves into themes of mystery and mental health, particularly focusing on Ava's battle with psychosis. It features a morally ambiguous antihero in Eli, whose obsession with Ava adds depth to the all-consuming plot.",
            "Ava demonstrates remarkable strength in facing her struggles, though at times she comes across as a spoiled brat, making it difficult for me to fully connect with her. Eli, on the other hand, is a morally complex character; while he is obsessed with Ava, he isn't as terrible as others portray him. I found myself slightly disappointed by Eli, as I had hoped for greater depth in his character. The romance is intense, with themes of possessiveness and obsession at its core. However, the virgin trope‚ÄîAva being a virgin while Eli has had multiple partners‚Äîfeels clich√©d and outdated. Interestingly, despite his past relationships, Eli remains abstinent after marrying Ava, which adds a layer of commitment to their bond.",

The heartwarming epilogue provides a satisfying conclusion to the story."

Ava has always loved Eli, but due to their age gap, Eli only notices her during their university years.  \n   - The plot includes mystery and mental health themes, particularly Ava‚Äôs struggle with psychosis.  \n   - The story is described as all-consuming, with a morally gray antihero (Eli) who is obsessed with Ava.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Ava is portrayed as strong for enduring her struggles, though she sometimes comes off as a spoiled brat, which I didn‚Äôt fully connect with.  \n   - Eli is a morally complex character, obsessed with Ava but not as awful as others make him out to be.  \n   - I felt slightly let down by Eli‚Äôs character, as I expected more depth from him.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n   - The romance is intense, with Eli‚Äôs possessiveness and obsession being central themes.  \n   - The virgin trope (Ava being a virgin while Eli sleeps around) felt overused and outdated.  \n   - Despite Eli‚Äôs past relationships, he remains abstinent after marrying Ava, which adds a layer of commitment to their relationship.  \n\n- **Mental Health Representation:**  \n   - Ava‚Äôs struggle with psychosis is a significant part of the story, but the resolution at the end felt too perfect and not entirely accurate.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n   - The book includes themes of possessiveness, obsession, and stalking, which are central to the dynamic between Ava and Eli.  \n   - There‚Äôs OM (other man) drama, where Ava tries to provoke Eli, and OW (other woman) drama, involving Eli‚Äôs past relationships.  \n   - The epilogue was heartwarming and added a satisfying conclusion to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I genuinely enjoyed the book and would consider reading it again.  \n   - Despite some flaws, such as the overused virgin trope and the unrealistic resolution of Ava‚Äôs mental health struggles, the story was engaging and emotionally compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating and intense romance with complex characters and a morally gray antihero. While some aspects, like the representation of mental health and certain tropes, could have been handled better, the story‚Äôs emotional depth and the satisfying epilogue made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.5 (rounded up to 5)  \n- Spice Level: üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è/5  \n- Romance: üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§/5"

            "The primary critique is the absence of scenes featuring the entire group together, which feels like a missed opportunity. An epilogue, akin to the one created for *Royal Elite*, would be a valuable addition to address this.",
            "Eli and Ava share a tragically beautiful love that feels both genuine and believable. Eli‚Äôs unwavering care for Ava is a cornerstone of their relationship; he consistently prioritizes her well-being and happiness, even amid conflicts. While his decisions aren't always perfect, his sincere efforts are driven by love. The evolution of Eli and Ava‚Äôs personalities over the five-year gap is realistic, reflecting the trauma they endured, which understandably dims their humor and lightheartedness. Both characters are complex, which may lead some readers to misunderstand or dislike them. Their individual development is compelling, though I would have liked more background on Eli. He is, without a doubt, the standout character in the story, showcasing remarkable depth."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This novel is a deeply emotional and complex exploration of love, trauma, and growth. While some readers may struggle to connect with the characters or their evolution, I found Eli and Ava‚Äôs relationship to be profoundly moving and well-crafted. The only notable flaw is the limited group dynamics, but an epilogue could easily resolve this. Overall, it‚Äôs a story I will passionately defend and cherish.",

            "Eli King is an exceptional character‚Äîhe's quickly become one of my favorite book husbands! I love the marriage of convenience trope, and Eli's unwavering dedication to caring for his woman, even when it means protecting her from herself, makes him truly unforgettable. He rivals Adrian Volkov from the *Deception Trilogy*. It was delightful to see Cole Nash as the protective, fiery dad, while Silver retained her feisty spirit. The dynamic between Elsa and Aiden, still deeply in love while navigating parenthood, was heartwarming. The rivalry between the original Elite Men, Aiden and Cole, added humor and tension, with their banter being particularly entertaining. Cole's fierce protectiveness over his daughters was the icing on the cake!",
            "Reading this book was a bittersweet experience, signaling the end of a unique universe. It's remarkable to see how much has been accomplished through these stories. While it's sad to say goodbye, I'm eager to revisit her other works, whether they feature a bully college romance or a darker mafia theme.",

            "Eli's portrayal in this book surprised me, diverging from my expectations based on the first five installments, yet I found myself falling for him as a character in a way I hadn't anticipated. Ava, while somewhat immature, reflects the typical behavior of many young adults aged 18-23. As a wealthy daddy's girl navigating college life, it's understandable that she might not always act with maturity. Both Eli and Ava are strong-willed and driven, which naturally leads to a push-pull dynamic in their relationship.",

It triggered something in me and even though it destroyed me, it will forever live rent-free in my head.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - How Eli was portrayed in the book was certainly not what I was necessarily expecting, based on books 1-5, but I also fell in love with him as a character. A very hard fall I wasn‚Äôt totally expecting.  \n   - Ava is a bit immature? Sure, but what 18-23-year-old newly adult isn‚Äôt? Of course, a wealthy daddy‚Äôs girl who also has multiple other things going on is not going to be the most adult-acting, mature lady, once given a bit of free range going to college (or Uni, as referred to in this book).  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n   - Eli is a challenge. Ava is a challenge. Both are stubborn and motivated in their own ways‚Äîof course, they are going to have a push-pull relationship with that personality dynamic.  \n\n- **Series Comparison:**  \n   - This book, the 6th in the series, was definitely very different from the first 5, which I personally enjoyed. However, I think I would have loved it either way.  \n\n- **Writing and Plot Development:**  \n   - The dynamics, build-up, and development of both characters and plot were beautifully written and done so well.  \n\n- **Reader Reactions and Recommendations:**  \n   - I buddy-read this book with 2 of my really good friends and book buddies, and the 2 of them had vastly different reactions to this book than I did. Which is one thing I LOVE about reading books and the array of books out there. Not everyone is going to agree, think the same, have the same reactions/thoughts, or like a book‚Äîpersonally, I love that.  \n   - I loved this whole series and definitely recommend it if you are into dark romance.  \n   - I feel like people had very strong thoughts on this book, and I want to hear them all!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an emotional rollercoaster that left a lasting impression on me. While it differed from the previous books in the series, I found it deeply moving and beautifully written. The character development, relationship dynamics, and plot progression were all executed exceptionally well.

            "I wished for Ava to confront her grandmother‚Äôs legacy more directly, but the acknowledgment was adequate considering the other plot elements.",
            "One of my main concerns with the storyline is that the men struggle to express their love for their partners. Despite the sociopathic traits prevalent in the King family, they ultimately fall deeply in love and become devoted husbands, which feels inconsistent. However, Ava's character development was a highlight for me. While I found her somewhat annoying in previous books, her mental health journey and exploration of psychosis were compelling and well-executed.",
            "The timeline inconsistency between the parents' and kids' stories, both set in the same decade, was a minor issue. For instance, Astrid listening to Imagine Dragons while her son DMs on Instagram \"20+ years\" later felt implausible. However, this did not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the story.",
            "Cole and Silver‚Äôs story was my favorite from the parents‚Äô generation, so it was fascinating to see how psychosis was inherited by Ava, the granddaughter of the antagonist from the previous book. I appreciated the theme of generational healing in Ava and Eli‚Äôs love story, especially as both had grandmothers who struggled with psychosis.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Context and Reading Experience:**  \n   - I binged the Rina Kent universe in its entirety at the beginning of this year, starting with the LoG series and then reading all the books in order. This book was the last one I read, and I had to wait for its release. I sat on it for a month because it‚Äôs supposed to be the final book in this universe, and I didn‚Äôt want it to end.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - One of my main issues with the Legacy of Gods series is that the men never seem able to say they love their partners. The sociopath trait is heavy in the King family, yet they all end up falling deeply in love and becoming fantastic husbands despite their broodiness.  \n   - Ava‚Äôs character development stood out to me in this book. I found her a little annoying in previous books, but her mental health journey and the exploration of psychosis were extremely interesting.  \n\n- **Themes and Generational Connections:**  \n   - Cole and Silver‚Äôs story was my favorite from the parents‚Äô generation, so seeing how psychosis was inherited by Ava, whose grandmother was the antagonist in the parents‚Äô book, was fascinating.  \n   - I appreciated the generational healing theme through Ava and Eli‚Äôs love story, as both had grandmothers with psychosis. Elsa opening up to Eli about her mother‚Äôs psychosis added depth to their connection.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n   - My only wish was that Ava had a more direct reckoning with her grandmother‚Äôs legacy, but the acknowledgment was sufficient given the other plot focuses.  \n\n- **World-Building and Timeline Consistency:**  \n   - The timeline inconsistency between the parents‚Äô and kids‚Äô stories being set in the same decade was a minor issue. For example, Astrid listening to Imagine Dragons and her son DMing on Instagram ‚Äú20+‚Äù years later felt a bit implausible but didn‚Äôt detract from the overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book ended up being my favorite in the series. The deep dive into Ava‚Äôs mental health journey, the exploration of psychosis, and the generational healing themes made it stand out. Despite some minor timeline inconsistencies, the story was compelling and emotionally satisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Additionally, key moments, such as Eli discovering the letter and his emotions following Ava's confession, could have been explored in greater depth.",

In contrast, Eli is a more likable character; his cold demeanor paired with a hidden care for Ava adds depth to his persona. However, the relationship between Ava and Eli lacks essential elements of a dark romance, resulting in gaps and unanswered questions.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Context and Reading Order:**  \n   - Reading the previous books in the LOG series enhances the experience of this book, as it provides background knowledge about characters and plot details.  \n   - While the books are marketed as standalone, reading them in order significantly improves the reading experience.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The plot is described as \"unhinged\" and covers heavy themes, particularly Ava's struggles with mental illness and severe psychosis.  \n   - The non-linear structure (jumping between time periods) hindered the pacing and made the story feel dull at times. A chronological order might have worked better.  \n   - The story could have benefited from exploring certain key moments in more depth, such as Eli finding the letter or his feelings after Ava's confession.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Ava is portrayed as spoiled, shallow, and selfish, making it difficult to empathize with her throughout the series.  \n   - Eli, on the other hand, is a likable character, with his cold demeanor and hidden care for Ava making him more compelling.  \n   - The relationship between Ava and Eli lacked some key ingredients for a \"dark romance,\" leaving gaps and unanswered questions.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n   - Rina's writing occasionally includes made-up words, incorrect prepositions, and grammar issues, which can be distracting. However, the reviewer notes improvement over time.  \n   - The story would have benefited from showing rather than telling certain events, such as Eli's growing attachment to Ava over the years.  \n\n- **Reader's Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - The reviewer had high expectations for the book but found the direction of the plot unexpected and, at times, exhausting.  \n   - The second read improved the experience, leading to a higher rating, as the emotional depth of Eli's character became more apparent.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Books in the Series:**  \n   - This book is not the \"steamiest\" of the LOG series, and the reviewer expresses a preference for Eli over Jeremy due to his complex personality.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its strengths, particularly in Eli's character and the exploration of heavy themes, it falls short in terms of pacing, character empathy, and narrative structure. The non-linear timeline and lack of depth in certain key moments detract from the overall experience. However, a second read improved the reviewer's appreciation for the story, particularly Eli's emotional journey.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Initial rating: Lower (not specified).  \n- Improved rating after second read: Higher (not specified)."

His deep care for Ava drives him to prioritize her well-being, and while he sometimes appears distant, his actions are rooted in valid concerns about her health. Some may label him toxic, but his motivations add significant depth to his character. Ava, on the other hand, is an exceptional female main character who perfectly complements Eli. Strong and resilient, she represents everything he lacks and is truly the best thing that ever happened to him. The dynamic between Eli and Ava is remarkable; he makes her feel like a normal person, and their love story is both intense and heartfelt.

            "Eli and Ava's relationship is intense, steeped in a complicated history. While the truth behind their animosity is revealed, I found it somewhat underwhelming and expected a more compelling explanation. Eli's handling of the accident and its aftermath felt flawed, and I disagreed with his approach. His relationship with his father is equally complex; they share many similarities that affect their bond. The moments when Eli seeks his father's advice or when Aiden reflects on Eli post-breakup are particularly poignant. The friendships, especially between Cole and Aiden, are beautifully depicted. Their bond is intricate yet unbreakable, and experiencing their relationship through their children's perspectives adds significant depth.",

            "The story had several aspects that felt inconsistent and frustrating. For instance, when Ava was 17 and confessed her love for Eli, he dismissed her as \"irrelevant,\" yet he later retrieved her confession letter from the trash and remembered it by heart. This contradiction raises the question: was he lying about her being irrelevant? Before their marriage, Eli was obsessed with Ava but still engaged in affairs while preventing her from doing the same. Once married, he treated her with indifference, exacerbating her feelings of worthlessness. Although his behavior could be attributed to psychopathic tendencies, it remained frustrating to witness. The epilogue reveals that they had triplets, which seems unrealistic and unfulfilling for someone with mental health issues. Overall, these elements detracted from the story's coherence and emotional impact.",

Eli has become my favorite male protagonist; despite his hurtful words, he redeems himself through his actions, sacrifices, and genuine care for Ava.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Impact and Engagement:**  \n   - I loved the rollercoaster of emotions that this book made me feel, more than any other in the series.  \n   - Their relationship went through the hardest trials compared to the other couples, and they pulled through, making it the most beautiful love story from the *Legacy of Gods* series.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Eli and Ava‚Äôs relationship was entirely different from the others in the series.  \n   - Eli is now my favorite male main character (MMC) of the series. Despite saying hurtful things to Ava, he redeemed himself through his actions, sacrifices, and care for her.  \n   - There was a big buildup around Eli and Ava throughout the series, and I was really looking forward to finally reading their story.  \n\n- **Plot Consistency and Logic:**  \n   - Some aspects of the story didn‚Äôt make much sense or annoyed me. For example, when Ava was 17 and confessed her love for Eli, he called her irrelevant but still picked up her confession letter from the trash and knew it by heart years later. Was he lying about her being irrelevant?  \n   - Before getting married, Eli was already obsessed with Ava but still slept around while blocking her from doing the same.  \n   - During their marriage, Eli treated Ava with indifference, which only made her feel worse. While this can be explained by his psychopathic tendencies, it still felt frustrating.  \n   - In the epilogue, they had triplets. For someone with mental health issues, having three children at once doesn‚Äôt seem like a realistic or happy ending.  \n\n- **Author‚Äôs Delivery and Writing:**  \n   - I think RK delivered in this book, but there were a few inconsistencies and frustrating moments that detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some inconsistencies and frustrating moments, this book was a standout in the *Legacy of Gods* series for its emotional depth, complex characters, and the beautiful yet challenging love story between Eli and Ava. Their relationship, though flawed, felt the most compelling and rewarding to read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- *God of Malice* - 4.25  \n- *God of Pain* - 3.75  \n- *God of Wrath* - 4.5  \n- *God of Ruin* - 3  \n- *God of Fury* - 2.5  \n- *God of War* - 4.75"

The outrageous twists, such as the main character losing her memories‚Äîechoing elements from Aiden King's work‚Äîand sharing the same psychosis as Cole's murderous mother, were delightfully absurd. I particularly enjoyed the revelation that Eli is capable of love, a stark contrast to his father, Aiden King.",

I was delighted that the story bypassed the typical university setting; instead, Eli sweeps her away in a thrilling manner reminiscent of Creigh and Anni's story.",

While Ava herself feels somewhat lackluster, her witty banter with Eli brings her to life. Cole Nash, as the protective figure, could benefit from easing up and allowing Eli to be the man for Ava. The chemistry between Eli and Ava is intense and passionate, highlighted by moments like Eli tugging at Ava's hair and calling her beautiful. The theme of women unintentionally harming their partners‚Äîsuch as Eli getting stabbed and Cray Cray getting shot‚Äîadds a humorous twist to the narrative.",

While some plot elements felt a bit uneven, the intense romantic dynamics, passionate characters, and dramatic moments made it a memorable read.

            "Since Ava and Eli were already married, the absence of a proposal in the epilogue was more than compensated by the arrival of TRIPLETS! Watching them embrace parenthood was heartwarming, and it left me eager to see the other characters' children in future books. Ava's memory loss added an intriguing layer of suspense as she navigated her life, with some scenes keeping me on the edge of my seat as we both uncovered the truth together.",
            "Ava and Eli share a compelling and eye-opening relationship that feels like a second chance, despite their already married status. Ava's psychosis is portrayed with sensitivity, and Eli's care for her adds depth to their bond. Despite his struggles with love, Eli demonstrates it in various ways. Their mutual affection is evident in their self-sacrifice and the small gestures, such as Ava cooking for Eli when he struggles with eating due to trauma, and Eli allowing Ava to plan their dates. These moments are both touching and endearing.",
            "I'm truly saddened that this marks the end of the series. It has been an incredible journey, and I've loved every book. \"God of Fury\" left me with a bit of a book hangover, making it hard to dive into \"God of War\" at first, but ultimately, it was an excellent read!",

The love and care they both have for each other shows in their self-sacrifice and the little things like Ava cooking for Eli when he doesn't like to eat due to trauma, and Eli letting Ava plan dates for them is so adorable.\n\n- **Plot and Suspense:**\n   - Her loss of memory added suspense throughout the story as she rebuilds her life.\n   - Some of these scenes had me on the edge of my seat because, along with Ava, we didn't know what was really going on.\n   - I got very scared at the end when Ava gets all her memories back and felt so bad for Eli that he had to go through that again, but him visiting her every night raised the expectations even more.\n\n- **Ending and Future Hopes:**\n   - Since they were already married, there wasn't a proposal Epilogue, but we got something arguably better...TRIPLETS!!!\n   - Seeing Ava and Eli as parents was so heartwarming, and it makes me want to see everyone else's kids in future books.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a fitting and emotional conclusion to the Legacy of God's series.

            "Set four years after *God of Fury*, the story follows 23-year-old Ava as she awakens in a hospital, only to discover she is married to Eli King, the man she despises, and has been for two years. Determined to understand why she would marry the person who broke her heart at seventeen, Ava embarks on a quest for answers, but Eli remains frustratingly evasive.",
            "In *Ruthless Empire*, Ava, typically seen as the bubbly, fun friend, is revealed to be grappling with deep-seated issues inherited from her grandmother. Eli King emerges as my favorite psycho, demonstrating an extraordinary level of devotion to Ava, as highlighted in his poignant quote: *There was a day when I thought I'd get this obsession out of my system and move on with my life, but I only managed to get so attached to my wife that nausea fills my throat at the thought of losing her.* \n\nArielle's obsession with Remi adds a humorous touch, while Landon continues to be a favorite for his comedic charm. Cole, my favorite petty king, delivers a memorable line: *That would be possible if Aiden hadn't stolen Silver's first waltz from me. Or if the fact that he was her first fianc√©, even if it was fake, didn't exist. And no, I still haven't forgotten about that, and I never will.* This perfectly encapsulates his character. When Cole claims he wants all of Silver's firsts, he truly means it.",

The prior books in the Legacy of Gods series alluded to something between Eli and Ava, and finally, we get answers.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**\n   - The story takes place after university, about four years after *God of Fury*. A 23-year-old Ava wakes up in a hospital to find she‚Äôs married to Eli King, the man she hates, and has been for two years. She sets out to uncover why she would marry someone who broke her heart when she was seventeen. Eli, however, isn‚Äôt forthcoming with answers.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Ava, who has always been portrayed as the bubbly, fun friend, is revealed to be battling her own demons since childhood, seemingly inherited from her grandmother in *Ruthless Empire*.\n   - Eli King has taken the #1 spot as my favorite \"psycho\" in the Legacy of Gods series. His actions and sacrifices for Ava are above and beyond. A standout quote: *\"There was a day when I thought I'd get this obsession out of my system and move on with my life, but I only managed to get so attached to my wife that nausea fills my throat at the thought of losing her.\"*\n\n- **Side Characters:**\n   - Arielle: Her obsession with Remi is hilarious.\n   - Landon: Still hilarious and a favorite.\n   - Cole: My favorite petty king.

When Cole said he wanted all of Silver's firsts, he meant it.\n\n- **Series Conclusion and Easter Eggs:**\n   - This book serves as a very satisfying end to the Legacy of Gods series. If you pay close attention, there are a lot of Easter eggs connecting to the Rinaverse.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book lived up to my high expectations, delivering a compelling story with deep character development, emotional depth, and satisfying closure to the series.

            "The first half of the book is emotionally intense, filled with suspense as Ava‚Äîand the readers‚Äîremain unaware of the true nature of her condition. The revelation is devastating, and the tension builds as the threat of her breaking down looms. The resolution, where Ava recalls everything and decides to seek treatment, is both satisfying and well-crafted. The epilogue offers a fulfilling conclusion not only for Ava and Eli but also for the other couples, enriching the narrative with depth and continuity.",
            "Ava is initially seen as a social butterfly, but her cheerful facade hides deep-seated issues, bordering on madness. Eli, while also troubled, acts out of genuine concern for Ava's well-being, even if his methods are sometimes questionable. As the story progresses, Ava matures, learns to choose her battles wisely, and ultimately makes the empowering decision to leave and seek treatment. The evolution of Ava and Eli's relationship is significant; by the epilogue, they have built trust and developed a loving, baggage-free bond. Vance stands out as a particularly detestable character, whose manipulation of Ava creates major conflict. Eli's choice to distance Ava from her toxic friends proves justified, and it is gratifying to see her thrive without them.",

            "ELI KING truly embodies the title of \"King.\" He exceeded my expectations and captivated me on every page. His willingness to sacrifice everything after Ava fell into a coma left a lasting impression on me. His protective nature, taking Ava away from her 'friends' and accepting the blame for being controlling, all while being deeply in love with her, made him utterly perfect. \n\nWhile Ava maintained her charming yet mean girl persona throughout the book, it was endearing to see Eli lose control and surrender to the whirlwind that is Ava King. However, I still feel a bit sore about his decision-making without consulting me‚Äînot even once! \n\nI also loved the cameos from the second generation. We were treated to Cole's scheming antics and Aiden's self-righteous narcissism, which added an extra layer of enjoyment to the story.",

While there were some similarities, it stood on its own.  \n\n- **Series Comparison and Ranking:**  \n   - *God of War* is now my third favorite in the *Legacy of Gods* series, after *God of Fury* (first) and *God of Ruin* (second).  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n   - I‚Äôm sad to see this world come to an end (for now), but I‚Äôm excited for what the author has planned next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an emotional rollercoaster that kept me engaged from start to finish. The characters, especially Eli and Ava, were complex and compelling, and the story felt fresh and original within the series. While it ranks third in my personal ranking of the *Legacy of Gods* series, it left a lasting impact, and I‚Äôm eagerly looking forward to the author‚Äôs future projects.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

She confronts the reality that life after university brings change, prompting her to recognize her past mistakes and the importance of facing her problems rather than shutting herself off. I appreciated Eli's unwavering support for Ava, even if it sometimes came at the expense of his own well-being. His selflessness, while painful to witness, only deepened my affection for him.",

It felt like a copy-paste of her other books, but that didn‚Äôt bother me. Ever since I read the epilogue of *RE*, I wanted to read Eli and Ava‚Äôs story, and it was even better than I expected. They completely won my heart.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Personally, I feel this book wasn‚Äôt just about the couple; it was more about Ava discovering a new version of the world around her and also discovering herself. She had to face the reality that they were no longer in university and that things change. Ava had to realize what she had been doing wrong and understand that she shouldn‚Äôt shut herself off from her problems‚Äîthere was more out there for her.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  Reading about Eli supporting her every step of the way (even if it was probably in the wrong way) was something I really enjoyed. It hurt me that he focused so much on her that he neglected himself, but that only made me love him even more.  \n\n- **Plot and Story Development:**  \n  Without a doubt, I‚Äôd say this is Rina‚Äôs best book for me. It had good development for our main characters, and I appreciated the cameos from previous couples. Did I feel like it was enough? Honestly, no. I feel like their story had the potential for more than one book, just like how I felt with Cole and Silver. But still, I‚Äôm not complaining.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book had a strong emotional impact on me. Ava‚Äôs journey of self-discovery and Eli‚Äôs unwavering support, despite his own struggles, made me deeply invested in their story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a standout for me among Rina‚Äôs works. It beautifully balances character growth, emotional depth, and relationship dynamics, though I wish it had been longer to explore their story even further.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n10/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è (I need to reread it right now!)"

Eli's devotion to Ava shines through as he goes to great lengths to support her, even if his methods are sometimes questionable.

I also appreciated the exploration of Creigh and Eli's relationship, particularly how Eli becomes a soft-hearted \"cinnamon roll\" around his brother, openly expressing his love for him. Landon remains a delightful troublemaker, and the inclusion of characters from previous books adds depth and nostalgia.

Ariella and Remi share such precious moments; I was completely taken aback when Ava caught them kissing‚ÄîI actually screamed! Aiden King is insufferable, and Creighton is just okay, but I really love Brandon; he feels like the most relatable character among the Kings. Loving Eli is a bittersweet experience due to his flaws, yet I can't help myself. I was genuinely surprised by Ava's psychosis, but it was handled beautifully. With the support of those around her and her growing self-confidence, she was able to progress and embrace who she is.",

With everyone‚Äôs support and her self-confidence, she was able to progress and accept herself.  \n   - Ava suffered so much, and I just wanted to hug her all the time.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Emotional Impact:**\n   - Eli never apologized for his actions and only explained his reasons, but Ava forgave him, so I did too.  \n   - The two epilogues are beautiful, but the second one is even more so because Ava and Eli suffered so much and deserved to be happy.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Their Roles:**\n   - I hate Aiden King, Creighton is whatever to me, and I love Brandon‚Äîhe‚Äôs the closest to a normal person among the Kings.  \n   - Loving Eli makes me suffer because of his flaws, but I can‚Äôt help it.  \n\n- **Author‚Äôs Writing and Future Hopes:**\n   - Rina is so cruel for giving us crumbs about Ariella and Remi. I‚Äôm not losing hope that Rina will write their book someday.  \n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is incredible! The relationships, emotional depth, and plot twists kept me hooked. Ava and Eli‚Äôs journey, along with the supporting characters, made this story unforgettable. The epilogues were a perfect ending, especially for Ava and Eli, who deserved happiness after all their suffering. I‚Äôm obsessed with this book and the characters, and I‚Äôm holding out hope for more stories from this world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**\nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - I've loved Eli since the beginning and throughout every book in the Rinaverse. Just when I thought I couldn't love him more, *God of War* happened.\n   - Ava was a sweetheart to everyone but Eli, which added a unique dynamic to their relationship.\n   - Ariella was a delightful surprise; she‚Äôs sweet yet crazy, and I feel like she‚Äôs the female version of Nikolai. She‚Äôs so funny and brought a lot of energy to the story.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**\n   - The love, passion, and banter between Eli and Ava were amazing. At first, I thought Eli was a menace, but then I realized Ava was just as much of a match for him.\n   - Eli‚Äôs love for Ava was pure, caring, and possessive, and his sacrifices for her health were deeply moving.\n   - Their love story is by far my favorite, and they hold a very special place in my heart.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The book was bittersweet and heartbreaking, yet so pure in its portrayal of love and devotion.\n   - I didn‚Äôt think anyone could top Nikolai in my eyes, but I realized I love Eli and Nikolai for different reasons. While I love Nikolai for his devotion and craziness, I love Eli for his caring and loving side.\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**\n   - Even Sam and Henderson were team Ava, which added a fun layer to the story.\n   - The inclusion of R√©mi and Ariella was a huge surprise and added depth to the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a beautiful culmination of Eli and Ava‚Äôs story, filled with love, passion, and heartbreak. The characters, especially Eli and Ava, were incredibly well-developed, and their dynamic was both intense and endearing. The supporting characters, like Ariella, added humor and depth, making this story unforgettable. It‚Äôs my favorite love story in the Rinaverse so far.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Eli holds a special place in my heart for how he cared for Ava and believed in her when no one else did. While I enjoyed the book, it isn't my absolute favorite. Killian's story comes close, but Jeremy remains my top choice, with Niko and Bran also holding a special significance for me.",

Ava was so much more than what we readers had thought initially, and I loved it. I love this girl.  \n\n- **Character Development (Eli):**  \n   - We had certain set pre-judgments for Eli, but he came out different in certain forms.

I wish we had had more scenes of these two brothers; I would have loved to see more of them, but the ones we got were so heartwarming for me.  \n\n- **Rivalry and Resolution (Aiden & Cole):**  \n   - The eternal rivalry of Aiden & Cole made me nostalgic, but in the end, Cole did sort of accept Eli as his son-in-law.  \n\n- **Standout Character (Ariella Nash):**  \n   - Ariella Nash stole the show. I was grasping for the crumbs that we got of Ariella and Remi, but she ultimately did make Remi hers.  \n\n- **Endearing Moments and Epilogue:**  \n   - There were so many endearing moments throughout the book from all the characters, but the epilogue was the most beautiful one.

This book feels like it should have been a trilogy: the first focusing on their university years, the second exploring the challenges of psychosis and amnesia care, and the third revealing the truths and leading to a happy ending.

Ava stands out as one of the strongest female protagonists I've encountered. Despite her struggle with psychosis, which she conceals from everyone except her immediate family and best friend, her journey is both heartbreaking and compelling. Eli King is everything I anticipated; as a psychopath, he remains true to form, yet his caring side for Ava is even more endearing than I imagined. Together, they are a perfect match. Their captivating push-and-pull dynamic and the palpable tension between them kept me engaged throughout. Eli's marriage to Ava and the way he cares for her reveal a surprising and heartwarming depth to his character.",

I had assumed her history with Eli was different, even speculating that he might have broken her heart. However, I overlooked the fact that he is older, which made a romantic relationship unlikely. I appreciated Eli's intention to spare Ava from suffering in a situation she didn't want, but it was clear that his approach didn't work. The ending, where they waited for her to heal before pursuing a serious relationship, resonated with me. It became evident that they had loved each other all along, but Eli's fear of causing Ava more pain held him back. Overall, I really liked Eli. And can we talk about Ari and Remi's relationship? I adore them and hope the author writes a book about them someday!",

Ava's journey of self-improvement through therapy, both for herself and for Eli (her Tin Man), was profoundly moving and inspiring. Eli King exudes an irresistible aura that sends chills down my spine. His complexity, including moments where he threatens Ava (albeit unintentionally), adds significant depth to his character. The love story between Eli and Ava is so heartwarming that it feels almost sweet enough to give me diabetes. Their relationship evolves beautifully, and I found myself loving Eli more with each chapter. The author's portrayal of male characters, especially Eli, is captivating. I initially thought Jeremy was my favorite, but Eli has surpassed him, leaving me adoring all of the author's characters.",

We learned things about Ava that I did not see coming. Eli was not a surprise‚Äîhe always came off as the very calculated, silent, and cold type with no heart. However, he in fact has one of the biggest hearts of all.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Internal Struggles:**  \n  Ava really put on a show for all her family and friends, and most did not know her internal struggles were off the charts.

I will miss these characters but am looking forward to her new series, which she just announced.  \n\n- **Reading Order and Context:**  \n  If you started with the LOG series, I would suggest going back and reading *Royal Elite*, where it all began. I think reading the parents‚Äô books first made the banter between them so much better in the LOG series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a fantastic addition to Rina‚Äôs collection and provides a satisfying conclusion to the LOG series and the Rinaverse.

She deserves the best.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Eli and Ava‚Äôs relationship evolved into something mature and beautiful, which I didn‚Äôt expect to love as much as I did.  \n   - While NikoBran remains my favorite couple, EliAva surprised me with their depth and growth.  \n   - I appreciated seeing the other couples in the story, especially Landon, who appeared frequently (which I loved).  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Engagement:**  \n   - The first half of the book felt slow and confusing to me. I didn‚Äôt like Eli initially and wanted Ava to run from him.  \n   - However, as the story progressed, I became more invested in their journey and the emotional payoff was worth it.  \n\n- **Series Closure and Future Expectations:**  \n   - This book marks the end of an era, and I‚Äôm grateful for the journey it provided.  \n   - I have a feeling we‚Äôll get an epilogue novella, so I‚Äôm not too bothered by the lack of more NikoBran and LandonMia moments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn‚Äôt love everything about this book, it exceeded my expectations in many ways. The emotional depth of Eli and Ava‚Äôs relationship, the mature portrayal of their love, and the closure it provided to the Rinaverse made it a memorable read. Despite some pacing issues early on, the story ultimately won me over, and I felt it deserved more than four stars.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- The reviewer implies a rating higher than four stars, though no specific score is mentioned."

            "Ava's character in previous books didn't leave a strong impression, so I had low expectations for her in this one. However, her story turned out to be heartbreaking and reminiscent of Alicia's. I felt that, had it ended happily, Ava's journey could have mirrored that of Jonathan and Alicia. I also didn't expect much from Eli, given his limited presence in earlier installments. While he initially came off as cold, I appreciated his maturity and how he treated Ava. His composure stood in stark contrast to Aiden's behavior in his own books, likely due to Eli's older age. The dynamic between Ava and Eli was the highlight of this story, and it certainly delivered. Their interactions were captivating and added significant depth to the narrative.",

            "Eli and Ava are deeply compelling characters whose relationship is both intense and memorable. Eli's transformation from coldness to warmth around Ava is beautifully depicted. His sacrifices, like reducing visits home to avoid triggering her and enduring sleep deprivation for her sake, reveal his profound love and care. Similarly, Ava's resilience shines through as she strives to be strong for both herself and Eli, even during her time in a mental hospital. Their unconventional love story‚Äîbetween a sociopath and a mentally unstable person‚Äîis filled with both love and angst. Eli's fierce protectiveness, exemplified by his violent reaction to a derogatory comment about Ava, underscores the depth of his feelings. Together, their emotionally charged relationship stands out as a unique exploration of love.",

It was so nice to see that in the end and for her to recognize it.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ava):**  \n  The first half of the book sucked me in, and the banter started off so good. However, during the middle, I wanted the childish instigations that Ava would do to stop. I know she was trying to push Eli to feel things, but at certain times, I just wanted to say, ‚ÄúGive it up, sis.‚Äù  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics and Spice:**  \n  THE SPICE. A man who loves begging?

            "The book opens with Ava in the hospital, unable to remember the past two years, including her marriage to Eli. The first half kept me as bewildered as Ava, compelling me to read on to uncover how and why they ended up together. The pacing was engaging, and the story felt refreshingly distinct from previous installments, perfectly complementing Ava and Eli‚Äôs journey.",
            "I‚Äôve been eagerly anticipating Ava and Eli‚Äôs story since *God of Malice*, and it did not disappoint. They embody the quintessential enemies-to-lovers dynamic, making their journey compelling. Eli‚Äôs possessiveness over Ava is palpable; he proudly claims her as his wife at every opportunity. Despite Ava‚Äôs memory loss and the challenges it brings, Eli remains steadfast, never wavering in his devotion, even when she tests his patience. Their love is profound and unwavering, clearly rooted in a deep connection.",
            "The story's emotional depth is compelling. Eli maintains his distance from Ava to prevent triggering her episodes, yet she gradually draws closer to him. Their intense and heartfelt relationship makes their love story truly unforgettable."

The first half of the book kept me just as confused as Ava, and I couldn‚Äôt stop reading because I needed to know how and why they ended up married. The pacing was engaging, and the story felt very different from the other five books in the series, but it worked perfectly for Ava and Eli‚Äôs journey.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The emotional depth of the story was compelling. Eli keeps his distance from Ava to avoid triggering her episodes, but Ava gradually gets closer to him. Their relationship is intense and heartfelt, making their love story unforgettable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a fitting yet bittersweet conclusion to the Legacy of Gods series.

However, her story broke me, and Eli‚Äôs reaction to it was equally impactful.  \n   - Eli was EVERYTHING‚Äîthe lengths he went to for Ava were insane.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n   - Their banter was amazing, and so was their chemistry.  \n   - I appreciated that it wasn‚Äôt an insta-love type of relationship, even though it was set up to seem that way.  \n\n- **Side Characters and Setting:**  \n   - I really enjoyed the side characters in this story (Leo and Sam).  \n   - This was the first book in the series where I felt that way about the side characters.  \n   - It was nice to see the setting expand beyond the parents‚Äô homes or the college.  \n\n- **Series Conclusion:**  \n   - This was a great way to end the series!  \n   - I‚Äôm now trying to figure out my favorite couples, and it‚Äôs SO HARD!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a fantastic conclusion to the series, offering a refreshing deviation from the usual dynamics, compelling character development for Ava and Eli, and engaging side characters. The romantic tension and chemistry between the main characters were well-executed, avoiding the pitfalls of insta-love. The expanded setting and strong side characters added depth to the story, making it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Favorite Couples Ranking:  \n  1. Nikolai and Brandon  \n  2. Jeremy and Cecily  \n  3. Eli and Ava  \n  4. Killian and Glyn  \n  5. Landon and Mia  \n  6. Creighton and Annika"

He truly wanted to save her, make her better, and was even willing to sacrifice their relationship and let her go if that‚Äôs what she needed. He was ready to give up everything for her without expecting anything in return. Yet, he still embodied the obsessed, possessive, and anti-feminist traits I expect and love from Rina Kent‚Äôs male characters.  \n\n- **Series Conclusion:**  \n  Overall, this was a great end to the series!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial skepticism, the book exceeded my expectations. The characters, especially Ava and Eli, were well-developed, and the use of the amnesia trope added a fresh dynamic to their relationship. The story tied up the series beautifully, leaving me satisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Ava's mental health struggles were depicted in a way that resonated deeply with me. While some may label her a \"spoiled brat,\" her confusion about reality made her character relatable and sympathetic. Ariella's moments brought a delightful, humorous contrast to the story; she's a total menace, and I adored their dynamic. Remi will certainly have his hands full managing her antics.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The Rina Kent universe has a profound emotional hold on me. I found myself crying during intense moments, such as when Eli was deeply involved with Ava. Despite the emotional turmoil, the story still managed to evoke a strong physical reaction, leaving me both moved and captivated.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ava‚Äôs growth throughout the story was remarkable, and I felt proud of how she handled her internal conflicts. Eli King, on the other hand, was an incredibly compelling character‚Äîhot, morally grey, and deeply devoted to his partner. His physical descriptions alone were enough to leave me \"hot and bothered.\"  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship between Eli and Ava was precious and beautifully portrayed. I particularly love how morally grey characters like Eli, who believe they are incapable of love, end up doing the most for their partners. This dynamic is something I always enjoy and live for in stories.  \n\n- **World-Building and Connections:**  \n  The brief appearance of someone connected to Cole and Silver‚Äôs past added an intriguing layer to the story. It reinforced my love for the interconnected characters in the Rina Kent universe. I‚Äôm also excited about the potential for future stories, such as Remi and Ari‚Äôs, if they are part of the author‚Äôs plans.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel left a lasting impression on me, blending emotional depth, compelling character development, and a richly interconnected universe. Eli and Ava‚Äôs story was both heart-wrenching and captivating, and I eagerly anticipate more from this world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, this book completely surprised me. I LOVED it. It was so different from what I expected, and it blew all my expectations away.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Eli‚Äôs love for Ava was so profound and touching. It reminded me of Adrian and Lia‚Äôs book, which made me overly emotional. The way Eli prioritized Ava‚Äôs happiness and well-being above everything else, no matter the consequences, was truly heartwarming.  \n\n- **Pacing and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The last 15% of the book had me losing my mind. At 88%, I was so on edge that I had to get up and do a lap around my living room. The emotional intensity was incredible.  \n\n- **Connection to the Series/Universe:**  \n  This being the last book in the universe after 34 books is overwhelming. I might just pretend it‚Äôs not true and hope that by the time I‚Äôm sick of rereading all her books, the author will have circled back and decided to continue the series.  \n\n- **Parallels and Themes:**  \n  I can‚Äôt get over the parallels to the *Vow of Deception* Trilogy. The way the story tied back to those themes added depth and resonance to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations in every way. The amnesia trope was executed brilliantly, the characters were deeply compelling, and the emotional impact was intense.

However, as the story unfolds, his profound devotion to Ava becomes evident, making him a standout character for me. He evokes a modern-day Darcy, but with a dark romantic twist. His love is subtle yet deeply layered. Ava, on the other hand, is far more complex than she appears at first glance. As her layers are gradually revealed, her story becomes hauntingly tragic. I empathized with her as she navigated her mental illness, and I felt the weight of her self-destructive coping mechanisms.",

Eli and Ava remain compelling characters, though their relationship evolves differently here. Despite a slightly rushed ending, the book was enjoyable overall, earning a 5-star rating, though the spice level was more moderate.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall: 5/5 üåü  \n- Spice: 2.5-3/5 üå∂"

I expected it to start from the beginning of their relationship, but instead, it begins with her waking up two years later and discovering she was married to Eli.  \n  - Despite this unconventional approach, I loved how the story gradually reveals how their relationship developed during those two years, especially how Eli stayed by her side while she battled her illness and how they fell in love.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I really enjoyed seeing Eli's dedication and love for her during her illness, which added depth to his character.  \n  - The ending, where they are happy with their three children, was satisfying and heartwarming.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  - The story kept me emotionally invested, especially as their love story unfolded and they overcame challenges together.  \n  - The final scene, where Eli meets Ava in the hospital and kisses her, was particularly touching and memorable.  \n\n- **Connection to Other Stories:**  \n  - Reading their story made me curious about Silver and Cole's story, which I am now reading and enjoying.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I absolutely loved this story and highly recommend it. The characters are amazing, and the way their journey is portrayed is captivating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully crafted story with a unique narrative structure, well-developed characters, and a deeply emotional journey. It kept me engaged from start to finish, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a heartfelt and satisfying read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a very high rating, likely 5/5."

            "Eli King quickly became my favorite character, surpassing all expectations. His profound love and care for Ava shone through as he sought to see her not as the mentally ill girl, but as a normal person. Eli's emotional depth, exemplified by his tears for Ava and the lengths he went to for her, made him truly unforgettable.",
            "This book profoundly affected me, particularly when Ava, who struggles with psychosis, envisions Helen as an older woman, only to realize it‚Äôs a figment of her imagination. The scene where she breaks down in Eli's arms is truly heartbreaking. Ava's mental health challenges are depicted with emotional depth, making her a remarkably sweet and kind character."

Eli King‚Äôs character development and his relationship with Ava were highlights, leaving a lasting impact. The story was heartbreaking yet beautiful, and it solidified this as the best book.",

The portrayal of mental health was handled with care and strength, and the story left me longing for more adventures in this world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

While he claims he can't love anyone, his actions consistently prove otherwise.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ava):**  \n  Ava's character is beautifully written, showcasing her struggles with psychosis and her deep love for Eli. Her confusion and erratic behavior are portrayed in a way that makes her feel real and relatable.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The love story between Eli and Ava is both heartbreaking and beautiful.

It added depth and continuity to the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Desire for More:**  \n  I wish we had seen more of Eli throughout the series, but this didn‚Äôt affect my overall rating. I hope the author revisits this series in the future, as I‚Äôm going to miss these characters dearly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEli and Ava's story is a masterfully crafted, emotionally charged narrative that left a lasting impact.

If I could bottle up my feelings from this book and the entire series really, I would.  \n\n- **Character Evaluation (Ava):**  \n   - From a reviewer standpoint, I will say that Ava is annoying, and it drives me crazy.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n   - One thing that bothered me about this book is that the resolution at the end, his admission, came too fast and too easy for me. In general, it took too long for it to happen, but as far as the conversation that was happening, I felt like that emotional drop occurred without an appropriate amount of buildup for those confessions. That part felt rushed to me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author Appreciation:**  \n   - Otherwise, as always, another 5-star from me for my number one author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the emotional conclusion of Eli‚Äôs story was bittersweet and deeply moving, the pacing of the resolution felt rushed, and Ava‚Äôs character was frustrating. Despite these critiques, the book remains a 5-star read for me, solidifying my admiration for the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 5 stars."

It connected with me on a personal level, and I felt the characters' pain and struggles intensely.  \n  - The emotional depth of the story made me suffer in a way that was both heartbreaking and beautiful.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Ava is an incredible character who deserves everything. I just wanted her suffering to end.  \n  - Eli, despite being stubborn and frustrating, is impossible to hate because his intentions were always to protect and do what was best for Ava.  \n  - Aiden King, as a character, evoked mixed feelings‚ÄîI sometimes disliked him, but he is undeniably compelling and well-written.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The story goes beyond a typical romance; it‚Äôs exceptionally well-crafted and engaging.  \n  - The dynamics between the characters, especially Ava and Eli, are complex and deeply moving.  \n\n- **Desire for More Content:**  \n  - I strongly demand a book about Ariella and Remi‚Äîtheir potential story is something the world needs.  \n  - It‚Äôs heartbreaking that this is the last book with these characters, as I‚Äôve grown to love them despite their flaws.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterpiece that goes beyond romance, delivering an emotionally charged and deeply engaging story. The characters, especially Ava and Eli, are beautifully written, and their journey left a lasting impact on me. While it‚Äôs bittersweet to say goodbye to these characters, I‚Äôm left craving more stories from this world, particularly about Ariella and Remi. Aiden King‚Äôs writing never disappoints, and this book is a testament to his talent.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5‚≠ê (5 stars)"

            "The book's pacing is expertly managed, utilizing flashbacks and revelations that maintain engagement throughout. However, some readers might be disappointed by the absence of certain scenes from the characters' university years, which were hinted at in earlier installments. The dual timelines and gradual revelations enhance both the suspense and emotional depth of the narrative. Initially, the premise is nerve-wracking, particularly with the revelation that Eli and Ava were never actually together during their university years; instead, their relationship revolved around a tumultuous dynamic of sabotaging each other's romantic prospects. Set after university, the story unfolds with Ava grappling with amnesia following an accident, resulting in a complex and layered narrative.",
            "Ava's character is intricately developed, showcasing her lifelong struggles with mental illnesses, including psychosis, dissociative states, and fugue states. Her family grapples with how to support her through these challenges. Eli, on the other hand, emerges as a deeply protective figure, whose obsession with Ava leads him to sacrifice his own well-being for her safety. Despite his seemingly cold demeanor, his actions stem from a profound love. \n\nThe relationship between Eli and Ava is complex and fraught with tension. Eli's initial rejection of Ava in their youth sets the stage for their tumultuous bond. Even after marriage, Ava's amnesia and mental health issues create significant barriers to their intimacy. The twist that Ava's perceived infidelity was actually a memory of being with Eli adds further complexity to their connection. Initially, their physical relationship lacks emotional depth, but it becomes evident that Eli's motivations are rooted in his deep affection for her.\n\nSupporting characters like Cole, Cecily, and others enrich the narrative, providing moments of levity and camaraderie through their interactions and group chats. Subplots involving couples such as Jeremy and Cecily, Niko and Bran, and Ari and Remi add layers to the story and offer a satisfying sense of closure for fans of the series.",
            "This book explores themes of mental illness, sacrifice, and obsessive love. Eli's willingness to kill for Ava underscores the extreme lengths he will go to protect her.",

While I enjoyed Eli and Ava, their romance would have benefited from more flashbacks to their past, providing deeper insight into their journey and making their relationship more poignant.

            "The story is rich in mystery, particularly surrounding Ava's lost memories and her surprising marriage to Eli. The marriage of convenience trope is intricately woven with secrets that maintain an air of suspense. While the integration of past and present timelines is well-executed, the dynamics of the past relationships are less engaging than those in the present.",

In contrast, Eli is cold and controlling, yet Ava disrupts his life, forcing him to confront emotions he never thought he could feel. Their dynamic is explosive, characterized by a constant push and pull that makes their relationship both frustrating and compelling. The romantic development between Eli and Ava is skillfully crafted, particularly in the present timeline, with the angst and emotional depth of their connection rooted in underlying secrets that are eventually revealed. Landon, a beloved character, consistently brings humor and charm to the story. The friendship between Ava and Cecily is touching, adding further depth to Ava‚Äôs character. However, other characters like Remi and Ariella deserved more attention, as their hinted potential stories were left unexplored.",
            "This book profoundly resonated with me, particularly through the intense possessiveness and obsession between Eli and Ava.

While the resolution involves themes of blackmail and deception reminiscent of the Deception trilogy, the plot twist ultimately feels disappointing and anti-climactic.",
            "In this story, Ava is a party girl grappling with her troubled past, and her character arc is explored in depth. Eli, the possessive son of Aiden, surprises readers with his complexity. Their romance is beautifully crafted, showcasing Eli's infatuation with his forbidden love. The sibling relationship between Eli and Creigh stands out as one of the story's highlights, adding significant depth to Eli's character. Similarly, the bond between Ava and her sister Ari is commendable.\n\nThe romance between Ava and Eli is central to the narrative, with Eli playing a crucial role in Ava's healing journey. Other romantic relationships, such as Jeremy and Cecily's wedding, as well as Ava and Eli's own nuptials, are also featured, alongside a glimpse of NikoBran's wedding. Parent-child dynamics are explored through various relationships, including Eli's connections with Aiden and Elsa, and Silver's relationship with Ava.

The Rinaverse appears to be concluded for now, with the author hinting at a future return solely to the mafia world, including the Bratva, Cosa Nostra, and Yakuza.",

I genuinely enjoyed it, though it wasn't without its flaws. I found myself deeply invested in the characters and eager to uncover their pasts. The epilogue was adorable, leaving me wishing for a longer book filled with sweet moments between Eli and Ava, along with more flashbacks to when Eli first developed feelings for her.",
            "I appreciated that this book centered on its main characters, a focus that some others lack. After reading it, I feel guilty for disliking Ava in the previous book; now I just want to protect her and give her a big hug. She's my favorite female protagonist, and her struggles resonate deeply with me. Eli, on the other hand, reminded me of a tamer version of Aiden‚Äîsort of. I was surprised by his role as a caregiver/guardian, but I ended up loving him. He was possessive and mysterious, and while he did one thing I disliked, I felt his intentions were generally good, even if his methods were questionable. The romance was a slow burn, filled with witty banter and playful bickering. While it may not be overly explicit, I appreciated that Eli respected Ava's mental health and didn‚Äôt rush their relationship. If you're looking for a smutty read, this isn't it, but there are some steamy moments. I also enjoyed the parent cameos and would have loved more from Aiden and Elsa, but I was satisfied with what I got.",

If you are looking for smutty books like the rest of the series this is not the one.\"\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - \"I enjoyed being out of the college setting and just being in the rich socialite world that Ava seemed to be in.\"\n\n- **Mental Health Representation:**\n   - \"I think the mental health aspect in this book was interesting I didn't always like the way they went about care and treatment but I also think it's nuanced and that sometimes guardians of individuals with severe mental health issues do what they think is best for the situation they have.\"\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Cameos:**\n   - \"I loved the parent cameos and I wanted more Aiden Elsa ones but I'm happy with what I got.\"\n\n- **Ending and Epilogue:**\n   - \"The epilogue was so cute I wanted a bigger book with just soft Eli Ava moments and more flashbacks to when Eli started liking her.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this was a good read with a strong plot and well-developed characters. The romance was a slow burn with good banter, and the mental health aspect added depth, though it was sometimes handled in a way that wasn't entirely satisfying. The setting was enjoyable, and the cameos from previous characters were a nice touch. The epilogue was particularly charming, leaving me wanting more of Eli and Ava's softer moments.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.25/5"

            "The mystery of Ava's memory loss and Eli's attempts to salvage their marriage added depth and kept me engaged. The story felt more like a standalone, featuring minimal appearances from other characters and lacking an emotional resolution involving the parents.",
            "Ava has loved Eli since childhood, but their relationship becomes complicated after her confession at 17 is rejected. Eli's possessiveness prevents other boys from getting close to Ava, while she sabotages his relationships with other women. The story takes a dramatic turn when Ava wakes up in the hospital with no memory of the past two years, only to discover she‚Äôs married to Eli. Initially, I thought I wouldn‚Äôt like Eli due to his resemblance to Aiden King, but he surprised me‚Äîhe's hot, wealthy, and a caring husband, exceeding my expectations. Over time, Ava also grew on me. I have a soft spot for broken and stubborn female characters, and she embodies that perfectly.",

However, I wished the story had explored the toxic past in greater depth; a prequel novella focusing on that era would be a fantastic addition. The novel effectively employs the amnesia trope and a marriage of convenience, both of which I found engaging. The glimpses into the intense and intriguing two years that Ava had forgotten were captivating, and I would have loved to see more of that toxicity examined. Overall, the story feels like a worthy continuation, especially without unnecessary elements like club rivalries or running in the woods.",

I think I enjoyed this one as much as I did because of the similarities to *Vow of Deception*. The established world Rina has built is a major draw for me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ava was just so childish, and Eli barely had a personality. Their back-and-forth interactions got really redundant, which was a bit frustrating.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Rina‚Äôs writing is great and full of dialogue, which I love. It keeps the story engaging and dynamic.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some issues with the characters, I still really enjoyed this book. I have no doubt we‚Äôll be back in this world sooner rather than later.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a rollercoaster of emotions, and while I had some issues with the characters, the familiar world and engaging writing style made it an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75‚≠êÔ∏è"

            "The book surpassed my expectations with its plot development. However, I found the rationale behind Ava and Eli's marriage‚Äîher fear that his obsession might lead to violence‚Äîunconvincing.",
            "I appreciated how Eli cared for Ava‚Äôs garden in her absence, echoing Landon‚Äôs actions. His defense of Ava, even at the risk of his own reputation, was a memorable highlight. The nickname ‚ÄúMrs. King‚Äù and the baby storyline were simple yet impactful. Ava emerges as one of the strongest characters in the narrative universe. However, the romance between Eli and Ava didn‚Äôt resonate with me. While I admire the characters individually, their connection felt weak. Eli‚Äôs understanding of Ava seemed superficial, and she appeared overly forgiving. Their relationship issues were more serious than those of other couples, and the resolution felt insufficient.",

Heartwarming cameos from other couples and parents enhance the emotional depth. Watching Jeremy's journey from birth to his wedding was especially moving, as he is my all-time favorite character and book boyfriend."

I suspect her rising popularity on platforms like TikTok, which introduced her work to a broader and more sensitive audience, influenced the characters' development. This shift didn't align with what many fans, myself included, had anticipated. I was disappointed that Eli lacked the darker, more ruthless depth hinted at in previous books, a similar issue I noticed with Landon in *God of Ruin*.

While it stayed true to her style, it didn‚Äôt surpass my hopes for this story.\n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**\n   - I felt there was immense potential for a darker, more complex dynamic between Eli and Ava, especially since their interactions had been building since *God of Malice* (and even earlier in the *Royal Elite* epilogue). However, it seemed like something held the author back from fully exploring this. I suspect her growing popularity on platforms like TikTok, which brought her work to a broader and more sensitive audience, influenced the direction of the characters‚Äô relationship.

A similar issue occurred with Landon in *God of Ruin*. Additionally, the revelation about Ava‚Äôs health felt abrupt, as there had been no prior hints.\n\n- **Writing Style and Engagement:**\n   - Rina‚Äôs ability to hook readers from the first chapter and her dynamic writing style remain unmatched. However, this installment lacked the emotional intensity, angst, and twisted morality I had hoped for. The story felt too easy to read, missing the darker, more gripping elements that define her earlier works.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The time jump could have been handled more delicately, with the use of flashbacks to fill in the gaps. Instead, the lack of flashbacks robbed us of years of interactions and the push-and-pull dynamic between Eli and Ava that had been building over the previous five books.\n\n- **Series Consistency and Evolution:**\n   - The shift in tone between the earlier *Legacy of Gods* books and the last two is noticeable. While I support Rina exploring a sweeter, less aggressive style of dark romance, I wish she had saved this approach for a new series and kept *Legacy of Gods* consistent with its original tone.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**\n   - *God of Wrath* remains the crown jewel of the series, embodying the twisted, dark brilliance that Rina is known for. It stands alongside the *Deception* trilogy, which (*wink wink*) features a female protagonist with mental health struggles similar to Ava‚Äôs but explored in a far more compelling way.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *God of War* maintained Rina‚Äôs signature writing style and ability to engage readers, it fell short of the darker, more intense narrative I had hoped for. The shift in tone and lack of depth in character development left me wanting more.

Their story unfolded in a way that was both unexpected and captivating, filled with complexity and mystery. Ava surprised me; having only received surface-level information about her in previous books, I found myself deeply empathizing with her. She truly has a heart of gold. Eli shone brightly in the final 15% of the story. I loved the dynamic between the two; their interactions were incredibly entertaining.

Her journey of self-acceptance and dealing with mental instability is portrayed realistically and is a highlight of the book.\n   - Eli is portrayed differently than in previous books, showing a more caring and unorthodox side, especially in his relationship with Ava. His dynamic with his father, Aiden, is also well-developed and adds depth to his character.\n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**\n   - The amnesia trope, which is typically disliked by the reviewer, is handled well and avoids being cringy or annoying. It serves a clear purpose in the story.\n   - The theme of mental health is addressed more openly and realistically compared to other characters in the series.\n\n- **Character Comparisons:**\n   - Ava is compared to Annika, another character in the series, with the reviewer finding Ava more interesting and less annoying.\n   - Ari is criticized for being annoying and somewhat pathetic, similar to the reviewer's issues with Annika.\n\n- **Plot Elements:**\n   - The book includes a cheating subplot, which the reviewer initially found off-putting but advises readers to continue as it is later explained and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the reviewer enjoyed the book, appreciating its focus on character development and the realistic portrayal of mental health struggles. However, they acknowledge that some readers might not enjoy the personality-driven narrative or certain character portrayals. The book stands out in the series for its unique setting, timeline, and depth of character exploration.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 4.5 stars\n\n**Series Ranking:**\n- God of Fury\n- God of Wrath\n- God of Ruin\n- God of War\n- God of Malice\n- God of Pain\n\nThis is the reviewer's opinion, and they encourage readers to form their own."

Far from being a \"blonde bimbo party girl,\" she grapples with mental health issues, feeling overwhelmed by self-imposed pressures and seeking escapism through harmful means. Her journey is central to the narrative, tracing her transformation from an arranged marriage through amnesia to rediscovering herself as Eli‚Äôs wife. This raw and realistic arc highlights the challenges of growing up in a loving family while facing personal struggles.\n\nThe supporting cast and themes of found family are standout elements, featuring updates on beloved characters from the Legacy of Gods series. Fans of JerCes and NikoBran will enjoy the appearances of Ava‚Äôs best friend and other cherished pairings. The sibling dynamics, particularly between Ava and Ari, as well as Eli and Creigh, evoke a sense of nostalgia reminiscent of the earlier Royal Elite School world. Parents and in-laws also play significant roles, contributing tender, humorous, and sometimes petty interactions, including iconic moments between Aiden and Cole."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Development (Eli King):**  \n   - Eli King was a surprise, living up to high expectations as Aiden King‚Äôs son and the last of the King siblings to tell his story.  \n   - He embodies classic King traits: controlled, cold, and impersonal, yet possessive, jealous, and romantic when it comes to someone he wants.  \n   - His love story with Ava doesn‚Äôt start as an obsession but evolves naturally, allowing readers to witness him fall in love, open his heart, and romance her.  \n   - Some readers may love him, while others may not, but he deserves a chance to show who he is without preconceived notions.\n\n- **Character Development (Ava Nash):**  \n   - Ava Nash is a mix of her parents‚Äô best traits‚Äîstrong, beautiful, and complex. She‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúblonde bimbo party girl‚Äù but a deeply layered character.  \n   - She struggles with mental health issues, drowning under self-imposed pressure and seeking escapism through harmful mechanisms.  \n   - Her arc is central to the story, exploring her transformation from the arranged marriage, through amnesia, and into rediscovering herself as Eli‚Äôs wife.  \n   - Her journey is raw and realistic, reflecting the struggles of being raised in a loving family yet facing personal challenges.\n\n- **Plot and Subplot:**  \n   - The marriage-of-convenience premise is compelling, allowing Eli to showcase his possessive nature and providing Ava a safe space to grow and heal.  \n   - A subplot mystery connects the reasons for their marriage and Ava‚Äôs amnesia, building tension and intrigue throughout the story.  \n   - However, the resolution of this subplot felt weak and lacked the mind-blowing twist typical of Rina Kent‚Äôs storytelling.  \n   - Despite this, the overall plot direction was enjoyable and served as a fitting premise for Eli and Ava‚Äôs relationship.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Found Family:**  \n   - The background cast and found family elements are a highlight, with updates on beloved LOG (Legacy of Gods) characters and their lives.  \n   - Fans of JerCes and NikoBran will appreciate the scenes featuring Ava‚Äôs bestie and other beloved pairings.  \n   - Sibling dynamics, particularly Ava & Ari and Eli & Creigh, are heartwarming and nostalgic, reminiscent of the earlier RES (Royal Elite School) world.  \n   - Parents and in-laws also play significant roles, with tender, hilarious, and petty interactions (including iconic Aiden x Cole moments).\n\n- **Author‚Äôs Vision and Series Conclusion:**  \n   - The book was highly anticipated, and Rina Kent faced the challenge of satisfying diverse reader expectations.  \n   - While some character choices may disappoint certain readers, the author stayed true to her vision, delivering a beautiful story for Eli and Ava.  \n   - The book serves as an epic goodbye to the Rinaverse, offering one last look at the families readers have grown to love.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt and complex conclusion to the Rinaverse, focusing on Eli King and Ava Nash‚Äôs love story while addressing mental health struggles, family dynamics, and unresolved mysteries.

            "The marriage of convenience trope was underdeveloped and poorly executed, which was disappointing. Additionally, the plot felt familiar and lacked uniqueness compared to other works in the genre.",
            "I was eager to explore Eli and Ava's story, given their history from *Ruthless Empire*. However, their connection lacked the depth of other couples, like Xan/Kim or Cole/Silver. Ava is a vibrant, outgoing character grappling with worsening psychosis, which she copes with through partying, alcohol, and drugs. While her mental health struggles added complexity to her character, they also made her journey quite heartbreaking. Eli's arrogance and emotional distance made it difficult for me to connect with him. His cold indifference toward Ava, despite his reasons, seemed to contribute to her decline. It wasn't until near the end of the book that I finally sensed a genuine connection between them.",
            "The author's captivating writing style kept me engrossed, often finishing her books in a single sitting. Her talent for crafting dark, emotional narratives is unmatched. As a fan of dark romance, I highly recommend this collection; it has been a thrilling journey, leaving me feeling a bit empty now that it's over. I'm eagerly anticipating her upcoming work. While I usually don't favor the childhood friends/crush trope, the author typically handles it well. Unfortunately, in this instance, it fell short of my expectations.",
            "Ava's unrequited love for Eli and her battle with self-worth stemming from her mental health struggles were profoundly moving. Her anguish was palpable, particularly when Eli rejected her and remained distant. His eventual recognition of his feelings for Ava and his readiness to do anything for her introduced a compelling intensity to the narrative, though it also veered into darker, unhealthy portrayals of love."

If you loved Adrian and Lia, you‚Äôll likely root for Eli and Ava too. It felt like a return to Kent‚Äôs darker take on romance, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The tension and angst pulled me right in, making it easy to fall into the story. However, I felt like Rina Kent took her foot off the pedal when explaining how the marriage came to be in the flashbacks.  \n\n- **Originality and Repetition:**  \n  Much of the book felt a bit rinse-and-repeat from her other stories. That said, if you‚Äôre picking up her work for the first time, this is one of the better books in the series.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - **Landon:** I found Landon to be an annoying and silly character who was written too seriously. Trying to take these psychotic nepo kids seriously while they attend a British art school has always been a challenge, but Landon was particularly grating.  \n  - **Ari:** Ari‚Äôs stalker tendencies were fun and added an interesting layer to the story.  \n  - **Remi:** Remi‚Äôs character leveled out well, though the ‚ÄúLordship‚Äù thing felt overdone and could have been left out.  \n  - **Cole:** Cole was my favorite part of the book.  \n  - **Elsa and Aiden:** The scene where Elsa and Aiden bust into Eli‚Äôs bedroom when he‚Äôs heartbroken was cute and memorable.  \n\n- **Author‚Äôs Style and Appeal:**  \n  Rina Kent is like my book version of Britney Spears.

There‚Äôs some problematic and uncomfortable stuff in her work, but I still enjoy it.  \n\n- **Themes and Triggers:**  \n  The book explores dark themes and includes potential triggers such as:  \n  - Barbie vs. sociopath dynamics  \n  - Amnesia  \n  - Non-negotiated kink  \n  - Gaslighting  \n  - Toxic relationships  \n  - Blackmailing  \n  - Mental illness as a central plot point  \n  - Controlling behavior (MMCSA‚Äînot between the main characters and not fully accomplished)  \n  - Murder and gore  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its flaws, including repetitive elements and some annoying characters, it was still an engaging read with memorable moments and a return to Kent‚Äôs darker romance style.

However, the familiarity didn't lead to disappointment, possibly because I had no prior expectations.\n- **Characters:** The characters, Eli and Ava, made a significant difference for me. Unlike Adrian and Lia, whom I disliked, I found myself not hating Eli and Ava, which greatly improved my overall experience with the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the plot felt familiar and uninspired, the characters of Eli and Ava stood out and made the novel more enjoyable for me. Their presence elevated the story, making it a better read than I initially anticipated.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

I found Aiden, Eli's father, to be more compelling than Eli himself. Cole, on the other hand, received even more love from me this time around. Additionally, the dynamics between Adrian, Lia, and Cecy were a touching revelation, especially discovering that Adrian and Lia have feelings for Cecy.",

I don't want to, leave me alone.\" The inclusion of familiar characters and the wedding chapter featuring Jer and Cecy added significant emotional depth. I especially loved the moments with Remi and Ariella, and I appreciate that Rina included the chapter on Jer and Cecy's wedding."

While the author hinted at an epilogue, the overarching story is concluded.\n   - I have mixed emotions: gratitude for the journey and the OTT (over-the-top) possessive male characters, but also a selfish desire for more stories.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**\n   - Eli has always been a standout character since his introduction in the *Royal Elite* epilogue. His protective nature toward Ava, even as a child, made him intriguing.\n   - Ava, however, was a disappointment.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n   - I didn‚Äôt expect the outcome, tropes, or the dynamic between Eli and Eva. It was completely different from what I had in mind, which should be a good thing.  \n   - Rina Kent followed her usual checklist, and she marked everything as \"done,\" which was both familiar and satisfying.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n   - Eli was a big surprise for me, and I was fully invested in his character.  \n   - Remi referencing the \"matter of fact I'm blind in my left eye\" meme was a fun touch.  \n   - Jeremy saved the day, as usual, which I always appreciate.  \n   - Aiden ending up with two crazy, murderous daughters-in-law felt well-deserved and added an interesting layer to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Nostalgia:**  \n   - The book being the last in the series brought a lot of pain and nostalgic feelings, which I anticipated even before starting.  \n   - I‚Äôm kind of sad because it feels like the end of an era.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Quotes:**  \n   - The dialogue was sharp and memorable, with quotes like:  \n     - \"And yet you ended up marrying the person you hate the most. The irony. The horror. The reality, Mrs. King.\"  \n     - \"The moment you think you're in a competition with your wife, you've already lost, son.\"  \n     - \"She looks like my own fuckin' angel. Broken wings and all.\"  \n     - \"She might have been the one who experienced issues with alcoholism, but my addiction to her is far worse. The only difference is that I don‚Äôt wish to ever become sober.\"  \n\n- **Humor and Wit:**  \n   - The humor was on point, with lines like:  \n     - \"Oh, look at that. It's the day we give each other pills. We should make an anniversary out of it.\"  \n     - \"What's yours is mine. What's mine is also mine.\"  \n\n- **Series Ranking and Personal Preferences:**  \n   - I‚Äôm trying hard not to rank the Legacy of Gods men, but Nikolay exists, so it‚Äôs tough. Eli, however, was a standout for me.  \n\n- **Additional Elements:**  \n   - The \"God of War\" Spotify playlist mentioned in the postscript was a fantastic touch and added to the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a mix of surprises, nostalgia, and emotional depth. While it didn‚Äôt fully align with my expectations, it delivered in ways I didn‚Äôt anticipate. The characters, especially Eli, stood out, and the sharp, witty dialogue kept me engaged. It‚Äôs bittersweet to see the series end, but it was a fitting conclusion to an era.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.33/5"

            "This narrative features quirky yet well-developed characters. I occasionally question Eli's classification as a psychopath, as he displays more emotions than I would expect from such a character‚Äîthough this may stem from my limited understanding. Ava‚Äôs perspective on life is encapsulated in two powerful sentences:  \n*My parents taught me to hit back twice as hard and never back down. So I'll die on this hill, please and thank you.*  \nI wonder if Eli shares a similar outlook, albeit with a more psychopathic twist. The dynamic between Ava and her friend Remi, as they discuss Eli, underscores Ava‚Äôs boldness and Eli‚Äôs intimidating presence:  \n*Don't be a wuss. Why are you scared of him?  \nI'm not scared of him. I just value my life.*",
            "Ava's personality shines through her bold actions and choices. For instance, she confidently dons a daring black mini skirt that barely covers her backside, paired with a revealing deep V-neck pink top and knee-high pink boots. Armed with pettiness, rage, and a flair for drama, she heads to King Enterprises. The banter between Eli and Ava is sharp and entertaining, exemplified in their playful exchange: \n\n*‚ÄúIs this the part where I get on my knees and beg?‚Äù  \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that won‚Äôt cut it.‚Äù  \n‚ÄúHow about if I send you flowers and a box of chocolates?‚Äù  \n‚ÄúUnoriginal. Try harder.‚Äù  \n‚ÄúIf I cry into my pillow?‚Äù  \n‚ÄúOnly if I get to witness it personally.‚Äù  \n‚ÄúSo I have a shot. Fantastic.‚Äù* \n\nThis dialogue captures their dynamic perfectly, making for an engaging read."

I sometimes question the label of \"psychopath\" for Eli, as there seem to be more emotions involved than I would expect from such a character. This might just be my limited understanding, though.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Humor:**  \n  The banter between Eli and Ava is sharp and entertaining. For example:  \n  *\"Is this the part where I get on my knees and beg?\"  \n  \"I'm afraid that won't cut it.\"  \n  \"How about if I send you flowers and a box of chocolates?\"  \n  \"Unoriginal. Try harder.\"  \n  \"If I cry into my pillow?\"  \n  \"Only if I get to witness it personally.\"  \n  \"So I have a shot. Fantastic.\"*  \n\n- **Character Perspectives and Attitudes:**  \n  Ava‚Äôs outlook on life is summed up perfectly in two sentences:  \n  *\"My parents taught me to hit back twice as hard and never back down. So I'll die on this hill, please and thank you.\"*  \n  I wonder if this also reflects Eli‚Äôs perspective, though his version might have a more psychopathic twist.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension:**  \n  Ava‚Äôs not-so-subtle crush on Eli shines through in moments like:  \n  *\"It's tragically unfair that the devil looks mouthwateringly tempting. No wonder people sell their souls. I'm dangerously close to offering mine up for pennies.\"*  \n  And:  \n  *\"That afternoon, Eli invites me to watch him be a sex God. Sorry, I meant play polo.\"*  \n\n- **Personality and Style:**  \n  Ava‚Äôs personality is vividly captured in her actions and choices, such as:  \n  *\"That afternoon, I change into the raciest, most revealing black mini skirt I own that barely covers my arse and pair it with a deep V-neck pink top that reveals a generous portion of my breasts. Just to be extra, I finish the outfit with knee-high pink boots. Then I head to King Enterprises, armed with pettiness, rage, and my husband's least favourite theatric ‚Äì drama.\"*  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The dynamic between Ava and her friend Remi, as they discuss Eli, highlights both Ava‚Äôs boldness and Eli‚Äôs intimidating nature:  \n  *\"Don't be a wuss. Why are you scared of him?\"  \n  \"I'm not scared of him. I just value my life.\"*  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book series continues to captivate me with its eccentric characters, witty dialogue, and engaging dynamics.

            "I have always adored Ava; her sweetness and humor never failed to make me laugh, especially when she defied Eli's expectations. Learning about her condition deeply affected me. Ava's strength in the face of trauma is inspiring, and it broke my heart when she expressed feeling like a burden to her parents, who certainly don‚Äôt see her that way. I admired her decision to take control of her situation and grow stronger‚Äîit was truly beautiful to witness.\n\nInitially, I struggled to engage with the story because I found Eli's treatment of Ava perplexing, and Ava's visions led me to suspect Eli had harmed her. However, the truth was far more complex. I was shocked to discover the reason Eli avoids eating in public, which added depth to his character. I appreciated how unwaveringly supportive Eli was of Ava, and his eventual admission of love for her was utterly heartwarming.",
            "The ending was adorable, and I absolutely love them together! It was heartwarming to see everyone else as well; I cherish all the characters! I'm currently in tears over how it‚Äôs all come to an end."

        "conclusion": "This book was an emotional rollercoaster, filled with heartwarming moments, strong character development, and beautiful relationships. Ava‚Äôs strength and Eli‚Äôs unwavering support were highlights, and the friendships and family dynamics added depth and humor. The ending was satisfying and bittersweet, leaving me emotional about it coming to an end.",

She‚Äôs so strong, and I can‚Äôt even imagine what it would be like to not remember things due to trauma.  \n   - It broke my heart whenever she said that she is a burden to her parents because they don‚Äôt believe that at all.  \n   - I loved how Ava decided to make her own choice to better her condition and became stronger after that, which was so beautiful to see!  \n\n- **Character Development (Eli):**  \n   - It took me a little bit to get into this book because I thought Eli was crazy for how he treated Ava and the visions that Ava had, which made me believe that Eli did something bad to Ava, but that wasn‚Äôt true.  \n   - It broke my heart finding out why Eli doesn‚Äôt eat at public places unless he‚Äôs at home; I was shocked by it.  \n   - I loved how Eli was there for Ava no matter what, which I really appreciated.  \n   - It was amazing to see Eli admit his love for Ava, which was so cute!  \n\n- **Relationships (Ava and Others):**  \n   - I love seeing Ava‚Äôs relationship with Ari, her younger sister, and it was so funny how obsessed Ari is with Remi.  \n   - I love Ava and Cecily‚Äôs friendship; it‚Äôs so cute, and I just love them!  \n   - Ava and Anni‚Äôs friendship is so cute as well; I love them both too!  \n\n- **Plot and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The ending was so cute; I love them together!  \n   - I loved seeing everyone else from this series; it was so cute since I love them all!  \n   - I‚Äôm sobbing my eyes out currently about how the series is over.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an emotional rollercoaster, filled with heartwarming moments, strong character development, and beautiful relationships.

I‚Äôm really going to miss them now that this chapter has come to an end. I do wish Eli had grovelled a bit more; given everything that happened, I expected more from him. At times, he even scared me, which is unusual for the author‚Äôs male characters, as I usually love them. I also enjoyed the glimpses of Ari and Remi; it‚Äôs a shame we won‚Äôt get a book about them, as they seem hilariously perfect together.",

While I still loved this book, it didn‚Äôt quite meet the same level as *God of Fury*.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Group Chemistry:**  \n  I adore this friend group so much. The time jump was a great addition because it allowed us to see how everyone else is doing. Bran and Niko, Kill and Glyn‚Äîmy absolute babies! I‚Äôm going to miss them so much now that this is the end for this group.\n\n- **Personal Connection to the Series:**  \n  Unlike a lot of other readers, I‚Äôve only read this series by Rina Kent, so while this isn‚Äôt the end of her work for me, it‚Äôs the end for this group, and I‚Äôm really sad about it. I adore them so much.\n\n- **Character Development and Groveling:**  \n  I really wish there was a bit more groveling on Eli‚Äôs behalf. Considering everything that happened, I just wanted *something* more from him. He also scared me at times, which made me not his biggest fan‚Äîsomething that never happens for me with Rina Kent‚Äôs male characters.\n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  I didn‚Äôt expect this book to be so heavy and dark, but Rina really went there.

It makes me really sad that we‚Äôll never get a book about them because they seem hilariously perfect together.\n\n- **Future Reading Plans:**  \n  Now I need to go back to *God of Pain* and continue my reread.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a heartfelt and emotional conclusion to the series, though it didn‚Äôt quite surpass *God of Fury* for me.

The main reason is that I didn't like Eli... at all. I was kind of indifferent to him throughout the series and thought my opinion might change when he became a main character, but unfortunately, it didn't.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book, particularly Ava's character and the engaging mystery. However, my inability to connect with Eli detracted from my overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

This book focuses on Eli King, the son of the protagonists from the first three books in the *Total Elite* series (which I didn‚Äôt enjoy). Despite not liking the earlier books, I had some expectations for this one.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The story revolves around Ava Nash, a young woman who lives a party-centric lifestyle, often drunk rather than sober. After an accident at one of these parties, she wakes up to discover she has been married to Eli King for two years‚Äîthe man who once broke her heart. The plot raises intriguing questions: Why did she marry someone she hates? What happened after the accident? How did she end up with amnesia two years later?\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - Eli King is a standout character for me. He embodies what I expect from a dark romance protagonist: morally gray, involved in dark situations, yet treating his romantic interest like a queen. Despite the challenges, Eli does everything for Ava‚Äôs well-being, even though their relationship is tumultuous.\n   - Ava Nash is a beautifully written character. Her struggles with psychosis and her fear of not being able to control her illness or have children due to her condition made me empathize deeply with her.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**\n   - The romance between Eli and Ava is intense and organic. While there are a few +18 scenes, they are limited, which I appreciated given Ava‚Äôs mental state and inability to give proper consent. The true intimacy lies in their emotional connection‚Äîsimple gestures like a smile or a joke convey their love more powerfully than physical moments.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**\n   - The book explores themes of mental health, trauma, and unconditional love. Ava‚Äôs journey with psychosis and her fears about her future added depth to the story, making it emotionally impactful. The dark yet tender relationship between Eli and Ava made this one of my favorite dark romance novels.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*God of War* by Rina Kent is a compelling dark romance that exceeded my expectations.

While I understand their intentions to protect her, it ultimately exacerbated the situation. I had anticipated a different story, one that could have been a perfect hate-to-love narrative. However, it seemed the author overlooked the subtle moments between Eli and Ava from previous books and instead crafted an entirely new storyline.",

However, the second half of the book was spectacular, delivering the drama, tension, unacknowledged love, and emotional moments that brought me to tears.

I am deeply grateful to Rina for creating the Royal Elite series and the Legacy of Gods, which have been a significant part of my life.\n   - It‚Äôs hard to accept that this is the final chapter of such a long and beloved universe. While I understand that Rina may want to explore new creative paths, it‚Äôs still difficult to say goodbye to these characters.\n\n- **Anticipation and Expectations:**\n   - EliAva was the most anticipated book for me since I read the epilogue of Royal Elite. I had high hopes for it, expecting it to be my favorite of this generation and to completely blow me away.\n   - Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt fully meet my expectations. The first day of reading was particularly challenging because the story reminded me too much of the AdrianLia books, which I didn‚Äôt enjoy as much as Rina‚Äôs other works.\n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**\n   - The plot stressed me out and made me uncomfortable at times, especially the way everyone kept Ava in the dark. While I understand it was to protect her, I felt it worsened the situation.\n   - I imagined the book would be different from what it turned out to be. It had the potential to be the perfect hate-to-love story, but it felt like Rina forgot the small glimpses of Eli and Ava‚Äôs relationship that were shown in previous books and created an entirely new story instead.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - As a couple, I love Eli and Ava, but their storyline didn‚Äôt resonate with me as much as I had hoped. The amnesia theme was interesting, but I wish it had been executed differently.\n   - The second half of the book, however, was spectacular. It delivered everything I wanted‚Äîdrama, tension, unacknowledged love, and emotional moments that brought me to tears. I connected deeply with Ava in some aspects, and Eli reminded me a lot of his father, which I loved.\n\n- **Nostalgia and Legacy:**\n   - I adored the appearances of all the parents from the original series. It made me want to revisit the Royal Elite series and relive those moments. I feel like nothing will ever compare to the original characters, but their children have also found a place in my heart.\n   - It‚Äôs going to be incredibly hard to accept that this world has come to an end and that there won‚Äôt be any more appearances of these beloved characters in Rina‚Äôs future books.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile EliAva didn‚Äôt fully meet my high expectations, the second half of the book redeemed it with its emotional depth, drama, and tension. I have a deep love for Eli and Ava as a couple, even if their book isn‚Äôt my favorite. The nostalgia brought by the appearances of the original characters made me appreciate the legacy of this universe even more. Saying goodbye to this world is bittersweet, but I‚Äôm grateful for the years of happiness it brought me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Initially, I would have given this book a 3, but the second half elevated it significantly. Overall, it‚Äôs a solid read for fans of the series, even if it doesn‚Äôt surpass the original Royal Elite books."

It didn‚Äôt meet my expectations initially.\n\n- **Turning Point and Final Impressions:**\n   - The last 40% of the book completely redeemed it. It was everything I wanted and more. The amnesia trope, which I didn‚Äôt expect to love, worked perfectly and made sense.\n   - The marriage of convenience trope was executed amazingly. Eli calling Ava \"Mrs. King\" or \"wife\" was a highlight for me.\n   - The emotional buildup in the last 15% was intense, and it made me cry despite Rina Kent‚Äôs assurance that it wouldn‚Äôt be as emotional as *God of Fury*.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**\n   - I was initially afraid Eli wouldn‚Äôt live up to my expectations as a full-blown sociopath, but he won me over with scenes like the restaurant moment.\n   - While I loved the book and the storyline, I didn‚Äôt connect with Eli and Ava as much as I did with other couples in the series, like Landon and Mia or Niko and Bran.\n\n- **Series Comparison:**\n   - *God of War* is not the best book in the series; *God of Fury* holds that title for me.

Look at my wife again and I‚Äôll gouge your eyes out.\" (This scene made me gasp.)\n   - \"I drop my forehead to hers and allow myself to mourn my wife one final time.\" (This made me sob.)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *God of War* didn‚Äôt fully meet my expectations in the first half, the last 40% made up for it with its emotional depth, clever use of tropes, and memorable moments. It‚Äôs not my favorite in the *Legacy of Gods* series, but it‚Äôs still a strong addition that I enjoyed overall.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- *God of War*: 4.25 stars\n- Series ranking provided in the review."

            "In the first half of the novel, I found myself yearning for more. While I won‚Äôt claim everything was perfect, I sensed a gap in the relationship between Eli and Ava. The plot grew increasingly heavy without a clear direction, and I struggled to connect with it. However, as the story progressed, I began to understand‚Äîthough it was a painful realization.",
            "Ava Nash shines brightly as the beloved social butterfly we‚Äôve come to know since the first book. Radiant, curious, and fearless, she embodies joy and love in its purest form. In contrast, Ava King has endured profound suffering‚Äîfrom others and herself. She is the one who never truly rises again, haunted by a mind filled with memories‚Äîsome real, some imagined‚Äîand conflicting emotions toward her tormentor, who is also her only source of support. As one character aptly notes at the beginning of the novel, being Eli King these days is far from advantageous. He is the one who remains, who breaks, who inflicts pain, who remains silent, who hopes, who lies, and who protects. He silently weeps for a love he can never fully attain.\n\nAiden King emerges as the true protagonist of his universe, embodying the unconditional support that showcases the most significant character development. The secondary characters serve a darker purpose, often appearing to bring chaos. As for Remi and Ava, I don‚Äôt believe they warrant their own book, so I‚Äôm content with their roles. Cole Nash? I‚Äôll choose to overlook him for my peace of mind, as he has unconsciously dropped at least five spots in my ranking, while Aiden has risen by ten.",

I imagined it, of course, without projecting too many expectations, but nothing could have resembled *God of War* as I have now read it.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n   - Unlike *God of Fury*, the relationship between Eli and Ava King is drastically less dark than the author‚Äôs other novels. However, the themes explored are still deeply impactful.  \n\n- **Characterization of Ava King:**  \n   - Ava Nash is the sunshine we‚Äôve come to know and love since the first book. She‚Äôs a social butterfly, radiant, curious, and fearless, exuding joy and love in its broadest sense.  \n   - Ava King‚Ä¶ she has suffered too much. From everything. From everyone. Especially from herself. She is the one who never truly got back up. Her mind is full of memories‚Äîsome real, some not‚Äîand conflicting emotions toward the person who is both her tormentor and her only support.  \n\n- **Characterization of Eli King:**  \n   - As one character aptly says at the beginning of the novel: let‚Äôs just say these days, it‚Äôs not very advantageous to be Eli King. He is the one who stays, the one who breaks, the one who breaks others, the one who says nothing, the one who hopes, holds back, lies, and protects. He is the one who cries silently and without tears for a love he never fully obtains.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - During the first half of the novel, I waited for more. I won‚Äôt lie and say everything was perfect. I felt like something was missing in the relationship between Eli and Ava, the plot kept getting heavier without finding its direction, and I didn‚Äôt feel *that thing*. But then I understood. It was painful, but I understood.  \n\n- **Secondary Characters and Their Impact:**  \n   - Aiden King is truly the protagonist of the Rinaverse he believes himself to be. His unconditional support for his son? The best character development by far. üëë  \n   - The appearances of the secondary characters? They‚Äôre here to kill people. ü§ß  \n   - Remi and Ava‚Äîhonestly, I‚Äôm not one of those people who think they deserve their own book, so I‚Äôm satisfied with what I got. ü•π  \n   - Cole Nash‚Ä¶ I choose to turn a blind eye for my peace of mind.

            "The first half of the story was quite confusing, leaving me wondering what was happening. At that point, I would have rated it 3 to 3.5 stars. The narrative could have been more concise, as the author repeatedly emphasized the main character's thoughts on how strange it would be if another character had feelings for her in their youth. It‚Äôs unfortunate that the author felt the need to clarify this so often, likely in response to her toxic fandom's fixation on the idea of Eli's childhood infatuation with Ava.",
            "I adored every instance when Eli referred to Ava as Mrs. King‚Äîit never failed to make me smile. Both Eli and Ava truly deserve so much more. Eli has secured a spot on my top boyfriend list, alongside all the King men. Ava is remarkable, incredibly strong, and worthy of the world; if I could, I would give her everything. I also found Eli's resemblance to his father endearing.",
            "I became more engaged in the latter half of the book, ultimately raising my rating to 4 stars. The emotional depth of Ava's flashbacks and Eli's struggles moved me to tears during the final 50%. I won't spoil the details, but their journeys are truly impactful.",

Specifically, I‚Äôm desperate for Ariella and Remi‚Äôs story, Gareth and Professor Lockwood‚Äôs story, and more of Niko and Bran.  \n   - This series cannot end here‚ÄîI need novellas to keep exploring these characters and their world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a slow and confusing start, this book turned out to be a gripping and surprising read. Eli and Ava‚Äôs unconventional romance, combined with unexpected twists and memorable moments, made it a standout in the series. However, the constant need for more stories from this universe highlights how invested I am in these characters and their world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the enthusiasm and praise suggest a high rating, likely 4.5/5 or 5/5."

            "While I found some of Eli's actions, particularly his threats toward Mia, off-putting, I don't believe he is inherently bad. I appreciated his relationship with Creigh, showcasing his care for his younger brother. Although his dynamic with Aiden felt a bit distant at times, they quickly reverted to their familiar father-son rapport. Eli embodies a younger version of Aiden and Jonathan, minus the spankings and hand necklaces. Ava, whom I've always liked, shines even brighter in this book. Her struggles with mental health and her journey toward healing were both poignant and satisfying. I was shocked to learn about her near-alcoholism and past drug use‚ÄîRK really surprised me this time. \n\nI enjoyed the glimpses of Landon and Mia, Creigh and Anni, Remi and Ariella, and Niko and Bran, but I missed the presence of Jonathan and Aurora, Eli's grandparents; their absence was disappointing. Additionally, the lack of any mention of Ethan and Agnus was frustrating. I feel shortchanged regarding Remi and Ariella; their interactions were so promising, and Ariella's mix of annoyance and humor, paired with Remi's comedic charm, left me wanting more.",
            "This book was hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing at Cole's outrageous attempts to \"murder\" Eli, from chasing him with a golf club to nearly drowning him in the pool and even hiring people to beat him up. Landon's mischievous antics had me in stitches as well; his troublemaker behavior never gets old."

Eli takes great care of Ava.  \n   - The fact that he doesn‚Äôt treat her like a porcelain doll but like a normal person is a great indication of his care.  \n   - Eli was desperate every time he thought she was fading away.

I felt like a mother watching her child grow up (I‚ÄôM DYING üò≠).\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**\n   - The scene where Ava changes clothes felt out of place‚Äîlike, in what century are you, Eli?\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**\n   - I missed the crumbs of the other characters. It‚Äôs literally the last book in the series; they deserved to appear more, right? I felt they were left out too much.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - I‚Äôm so sad to say goodbye to this universe; they‚Äôll be sorely missed :((((((((.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this book was a mix of joy and frustration for me. While I loved the unexpected twists and emotional moments, some character behaviors and the lack of focus on supporting characters left me wanting more. Despite its flaws, it was a bittersweet farewell to a beloved series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

He feels more like the villain in his own story, and his refusal to confront his emotions exacerbates Ava‚Äôs mental health struggles. \n\nAva Nash: Ava‚Äôs battle with mental illness, along with her drug and alcohol abuse, is heart-wrenching. While I empathized with her, her character arc failed to fully engage me. Her virginity felt hypocritical, especially given her previous comments about Cecily being a prude. The marriage of convenience trope is present, but Eli‚Äôs controlling behavior‚Äîsuch as constantly asking Ava to change her clothes‚Äîwas off-putting rather than romantic. The enemies-to-lovers dynamic felt underdeveloped, and Eli‚Äôs past obsession with Ava, hinted at in *Royal Elite*, contradicts this narrative, adding to the confusion. \n\nThe supporting characters, particularly Remi and Ariella, provided my favorite moments with their sweet and entertaining dynamic. Cole Nash emerged as a remarkable father figure, and I appreciated the glimpses of Jer & Ces and Cray & Annika.",

Her last memory is of a car accident, and now she finds herself two years in the future, married to a man she believes she despises‚ÄîEli King, a sociopathic CEO of two major corporations (King & Steel). Despite her aversion, Ava fought with her beloved parents to marry him, leaving her utterly confused.\n\nEli initially appears controlled, attempting to manage his chaotic world, but Ava's presence challenges that facade. Their relationship is explosive, rooted in a history of playful rivalry that began in university, where they sabotaged each other's romantic interests. As the story unfolds, we learn about the complexities of their marriage, the truth behind Ava's memory loss, and the reasons for their union.\n\nThis book embodies the \"she fell first, he fell harder\" trope, delivering a captivating exploration of love, memory, and the unexpected twists of fate.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Anticipation and Expectations:**\n   - I have been waiting for Ava and Eli's book since the Royal Elite epilogue. Admittedly, I thought at that time their story would be a lot different from what God of War actually was, but nevertheless, they were worth the wait.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Ava King (N√©e Nash) wakes up to a new reality, one she had never imagined. Her last memory is being involved in a car accident, and now she's two years into the future, married to a man she swears she hates but apparently fought with her amazing parents to marry. Nothing makes sense, least of all her husband.\n   - Eli King, the resident sociopath and CEO of not one but two big corporations (King & Steel), is now a husband to a wife with no memories of being married. He's very controlled at the start, or at least trying to control his world, but Ava challenges that. Over the course of the book, he becomes unhinged, not just in thoughts but also in actions (which I love).\n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**\n   - Ava and Eli have an explosive relationship, from the moment they started messing with each other at university by getting rid of each other's romantic interests to their current relationship as husband and wife. Over the course of the book, we find out what's really going on with Ava, the relationship between Ava and Eli in the past two years, as well as the reasons why they got married. This book definitely falls under the \"she fell first, he fell harder\" trope.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Tropes:**\n   - I really enjoyed reading Ava and Eli's story! All the tropes in God of War are my catnip, but I went into this a bit apprehensive because high expectations sometimes just end up in the gutter. I'm very happy that this wasn't the case for God of War.\n\n- **What I Loved:**\n   - Ava, I just adored her! She has been struggling from a very young age with her diagnosis, which has made her insecure about her entire existence because she feels her parents' lives would have been great without her. This is nonsense because her parents adore her, and Cole instead blames himself.\n   - Eli trying his best for Ava, regardless of the fact that she hates him, doesn't remember their years together, or what happens when she goes into fugue stages, was just very touching. In the two years of their marriage, he really made his wife and their marriage his whole personality, which I loved.\n   - I loved their banter! It's just fun to read. Ava literally aggravating Eli on purpose with no thoughts to the consequences was also *chef's kiss*!\n\n- **Criticism and Suggestions:**\n   - What not 5 stars? I really wish Rina had either made God of War into a duology or at least given us some more chapters/extended epilogue. A duology would have been great because perhaps we could have some more younger and university sabotaging scenes and, more importantly, the first two years of their marriage. Plus, more chapters because after Ava and Eli get back together, it's the end, so it would have been great to see more of them together and happy, and then the epilogue. I'm nitpicking, but that's because I really enjoyed this one and didn't want my time with them to end.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I had a great time reading God of War! Even if you haven't read any previous books by the author or this series, I personally think it would be fine to read as a standalone because other couples have cameos, but the book is really focused on them.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 4.5 stars"

The mystery surrounding Eli and Ava's relationship was particularly compelling, driving me to unravel what transpired between them. The narrative's structure, beginning with Aiden and concluding with his son Eli, added depth and continuity to the story.",
            "Ava and Eli's dynamic captivated me from the start, with their tension and banter being nothing short of immaculate. Every scene between them was a delightful mix of humor and entertainment. Ava's fierce pushback against Eli, who took it all in stride, made their relationship incredibly compelling. Eli's unwavering support and protective nature shone through, as he expressed his love through actions rather than words. \n\nAva's vibrant personality lit up every room, making those around her feel at ease. However, her struggles with feeling like a burden to her parents and friends were truly heartbreaking. Eli's possessiveness and willingness to sacrifice for Ava revealed his depth as a character. \n\nThe friendship between Ava and Cecily was heartwarming, and their interactions were a joy to witness. Group scenes, especially at Ava and Eli's wedding, radiated warmth and joy, and I loved seeing all the characters together. The subtle hints of Jer and Cecy's relationship added an emotional touch, while Cole and Silver's appearances were delightful, particularly Cole's humorous attempts to keep Eli away from Ava.

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the dynamic between Ava and Eli. Ava's playful antics brought me genuine delight and had me laughing throughout. It was fascinating to realize that the flirtation and chemistry between them in previous books stemmed from an intense, unhealthy crush. I noticed some critics labeling Eli as toxic, similar to other male characters in the series. However, I believe many readers expected the same level of toxicity as in her other works and were disappointed. Those who criticize Eli while praising *God of Malice* should reconsider their standards and understanding of consent.",
            "Reading this book filled me with a mix of happiness and sadness. I loved it so much that I devoured 300 pages in one afternoon, but I hesitated over the final 100 pages, reluctant to see it end even as I was eager to discover the conclusion. I laughed, cried, and experienced countless fangirl moments. The ending resonated with me, reinforcing the importance of appreciating the authors' creations and stepping back from our own imagined narratives. While it's natural to critique and envision alternative outcomes, I've come to understand that this passion for criticism is part of the reading experience. Ultimately, these books have also highlighted the need for many of us to seek therapy."

The characters, especially Ava and Eli, were captivating, and the focus on mental health added depth to the story. While some readers criticized Eli‚Äôs toxicity, I believe each character and story is unique. This work has taught me to appreciate the author‚Äôs vision and reflect on my own expectations. It‚Äôs bittersweet to see this universe pause, but I‚Äôm grateful for the journey.",

Happy because I loved it, and sad because it ended.  \n   - I read 300 pages in one afternoon, and for the remaining 100 pages, I held back because I didn‚Äôt want it to end, yet I was eager to finish and find out what happened.  \n   - I laughed a lot, cried, and had many fangirl moments.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n   - I adored the dynamic between Ava and Eli. Ava‚Äôs childish antics surprisingly delighted me, and I laughed so much because of them.  \n   - I loved realizing that the flirtation and chemistry between Ava and Eli in the previous books was actually an intense, unhealthy crush they had on each other.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - I appreciated how the plot revolved around Ava‚Äôs mental health. It added depth and made the story more meaningful.  \n\n- **Criticism and Defense of the Characters:**  \n   - I noticed many hypocritical critics condemning Eli‚Äôs behavior, calling him toxic like all of Rina‚Äôs male characters. However, I think some readers expected the same level of toxicity as in other books and were disappointed.  \n   - Those who criticize Eli but favor *God of Malice* need to reevaluate their standards and understanding of consent.  \n\n- **Series Closure and Reflection:**  \n   - I liked how this series concluded. These books have taught me to enjoy what the authors create and to step back from the stories we imagine in our heads.  \n   - While we have the right to critique and imagine how things could have been better, criticizing books is our passion, and that‚Äôs okay.  \n   - These books have also made me realize that many of us need therapy.  \n\n- **Personal Favorites and Sentiment:**  \n   - This is my second favorite book in the *Legacy* series, with Niko and Bran being my absolute favorites.  \n   - It breaks my heart that this universe is on pause, especially after reading the last conversation of the Horsemen group.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an emotional rollercoaster that I thoroughly enjoyed. The characters, especially Ava and Eli, were captivating, and the focus on mental health added depth to the story.

The pacing is uneven, prioritizing current events over the past, which is essential for grasping their relationship. While the amnesia plotline is intriguing, it is not explored as deeply as in the author's previous works.",

Their backstories, encompassing both childhood and adulthood, were only briefly mentioned, leaving readers wanting more. The narrative would have benefited from being divided into multiple parts to fully explore their relationship.",

Eli's respectful treatment of Ava, particularly his choice to care for her personally and refrain from pressuring her, is commendable. However, the inclusion of other couples detracts from the central focus on Eli and Ava.",

Both characters endure significant pain and suffering, and I genuinely felt for them.

Ava, one of the main characters, struggles with depression, which felt inconsistent with her portrayal in previous books. However, the dynamic between Eli and Ava was enjoyable, particularly their banter, and Ava‚Äôs assertiveness was commendable. There was disappointment regarding Ava being a virgin once again and the inclusion of certain explicit scenes.

Landon was a favorite, and readers wished for more of his presence in the story, while Cecy was highlighted as the favorite female character.",

            "I had been eagerly anticipating EliAva's book since the SilverCole epilogue, and it did not disappoint. EliAva exceeded my expectations, and I adore them both. Eli captured my heart from his first appearance; I was surprised by his depth and the lengths he went to for Ava. Speaking of Ava, she is truly the \"IT\" girl, and my heart goes out to her‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt deserve everything she went through. Their banter and antics kept me completely engaged, and they perfectly complement each other's quirks.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects was Remiarie‚Äôs antics‚Äîshe is such a delightful menace! I found myself completely enamored with her and her hilarious shenanigans with Remi. That boy better watch out! \n\nAs for SilverCole, their happiness with their families was heartwarming. Their bond remains strong, and their connection with their children is simply amazing. Cole truly shone in this story, especially as the father-in-law who actively tried to protect his daughter from a potential suitor. I also enjoyed the playful rivalry between him and Aiden; even after 30+ years, their banter is still entertaining. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved Aiden and Elsa in this installment‚Äîthey are fantastic parents. I even found myself intrigued by Jeremy, who finally got his happily ever after. Watching him grow into the man he is today was rewarding. \n\nNiko and Bran‚Äôs marriage was another highlight for me. Even with their limited time on the page, they made a significant impact, especially during that memorable scene where Niko clashed with Ari. I also appreciated Ava and Cecy‚Äôs friendship; they are each other‚Äôs support system, and Cecy‚Äôs help during Ava‚Äôs recovery was touching. \n\nLastly, Landon was surprisingly entertaining, providing plenty of laughs with his antics. He was much more enjoyable here than in his own book. Overall, this story was a delightful read that left me wanting more!",
            "I can hardly believe the Rinaverse has come to an end. It‚Äôs been a remarkable and sometimes tumultuous four-year journey, and I‚Äôve cherished every moment. I will truly miss the RES world, but at least I have the mafiaverse to look forward to."

I anticipated more revelations, such as Ava recalling something crucial or Eli providing insights into past events, but ultimately, nothing shocking was revealed.",
            "I adore both main characters, Eli and Ava. Eli's unwavering admiration for Ava's beauty is truly endearing, and his sacrifices for her are both heartbreaking and sweet, revealing a depth of feeling beneath his seemingly unfeeling exterior. The dynamic between Remi and Ari is another highlight; their relationship's progress is thrilling, and Ari's confidence and fierce nature make her a standout character. I would love to see the author write a book centered on Remi and Ari, as they are such an intriguing couple, even without trauma or mental illness as a central theme.",
            "This book offers a refreshing departure from the typical college romance by exploring the dynamics of married life, making for an engaging change.",
            "While Eli's struggles are alluded to, I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of his feelings, particularly during the two years Ava was losing herself. This could have added significant emotional depth and angst to the story. A more thorough examination of Eli's perspective, akin to the portrayal of Kirill's grief over Sasha's death in another book, would have made the narrative more impactful."

My ranking for the series is as follows:  \n     1. *God of Ruin*  \n     2. *God of Malice*  \n     3. *God of Fury*  \n     4. *God of Wrath*  \n     5. *God of Pain*  \n     6. *God of War*  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n   - I enjoyed Lan‚Äôs appearance in the book, as he‚Äôs my favorite character in the series. However, I wish there had been more focus on the other characters and a proper epilogue to tie up their stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments, it fell short of my expectations. The character development, particularly for Eli, didn‚Äôt meet the intensity I was hoping for, and the plot felt rushed and underwhelming. Despite this, there were still some memorable quotes and scenes that I enjoyed. Overall, this is my least favorite book in the *Legacy of Gods* series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"

            "Eli and Ava's tension in the first book was among the strongest I've encountered, and their teasing had fans buzzing with excitement. Unfortunately, this sequel fell short of expectations. Ava Nash, once a vibrant character, disappointed me here. While she promised revenge, she mostly squandered Eli's money and crashed his car, coming off as a spoiled brat. Aside from exposing Gemma, which I appreciated, she didn't assert herself much. Her character lacked the sass and strength of her parents, Silver and Cole. \n\nEli, who was intriguing in previous installments, also let me down. He slut-shamed Ava and dismissed her, though he did show some improvement by the end. Their relationship felt lackluster, despite a few cute moments and enjoyable banter. Ava's attempts to annoy Eli by seducing him were entertaining, and I was relieved that the author preserved her relationship with Ari, which I really liked. \n\nEli and Cray remained the cutest sibling duo, and the dynamics among the King brothers were intact. However, Glyndon's absence during Ava's darkest moments further diminished my view of her character. On a positive note, Annika and Cecy were supportive friends, and Ari stood out with his humor and threats directed at half the cast, including Nikolai."

Niko/Bran  \n     2. Cecily/Jeremy  \n     3. Ava/Levi  \n     4. Mia/Landon  \n     5. Anni/Creighton  \n     6. Glyn/Killian  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments, particularly with Ava‚Äôs character development, it fell short of my expectations. Eli‚Äôs character and the missed opportunities in their relationship dynamics left me disappointed. Overall, the series has been inconsistent, with only one standout story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars"

While I appreciated the book, it was a challenging read that left me feeling unsettled compared to the other Log books. The amnesia trope reminded me of some of the author‚Äôs previous works; although it‚Äôs not my favorite, I trusted her to handle it well. However, the first half of the book felt confusing, and the tension between the characters didn‚Äôt resonate with me. I expected emotional depth, but instead, Eli seemed solely focused on possessing Ava, while she struggled to understand her situation.",

For the first 80% of the book, I found his interactions with Ava off-putting, particularly his excessive possessiveness. While I could understand his behavior to some extent, it often crossed the line, such as when he forbade her from touching her friends. I only began to like Eli near the end, at the 95% mark, but it was too little, too late to redeem the book for me. My main issue seems to stem from the author‚Äôs writing style; I noticed a tendency to repeat certain dynamics between couples, which I hadn‚Äôt found bothersome before but became quite apparent in this story.",

Overall, the storyline felt disjointed and lacking the chaos and depth I anticipated, especially in comparison to *Ruthless Empire*. Ava's illness appeared abruptly, with no prior mention in earlier books, which was frustrating. Additionally, certain plot points, such as Ava's encounter with Eli's mother, were introduced but never fully explored, leaving unsatisfying loose ends.",
            "Eli King emerged as my favorite character, and I thoroughly enjoyed his scenes. His possessiveness and obsession with Ava were compelling, though at times, his love felt unhealthy. Ava, despite being 23, often came across as immature and cringeworthy, making the noticeable age gap with Eli hard to overlook. Aiden was a supportive father, and I appreciated Adrian's affection for Cecily. Cecy, Jeremy, Elsa, and Silver were also standout characters, though I wished NikoBran and JerCecy had more screen time. Unfortunately, the chemistry between Eli and Ava felt lacking, and even the intimate scenes fell flat and felt uncomfortable.",

The found family theme in this universe is something I‚Äôll forever cherish.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  Finishing the Rina Kent universe left me feeling emotional and nostalgic. I started this universe last year, and now, a year later, I‚Äôve completed the final book. While I‚Äôm sad it‚Äôs over and wish there were more stories (especially one for Remi), I‚Äôll always hold these characters close to my heart.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I didn‚Äôt love the book, but I didn‚Äôt hate it either. It had its moments, and I enjoyed certain aspects, like the characters and the initial mystery. However, it didn‚Äôt fully meet my expectations, and it‚Äôs not a favorite in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong start and memorable characters, it struggled to maintain its momentum and left me wanting more by the end. I appreciated the connections to the broader Rina Kent universe and the found family theme, but overall, it didn‚Äôt fully deliver on its potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5‚≠êÔ∏è"

The book's blatant double standards and misogyny were particularly striking. Eli's supposed obsession with Ava since college felt misleading, especially since the narrative suggests he slept with other women after she enrolled at university.

Her relationship with her parents, especially her father Cole, was poignant yet unresolved, creating emotional gaps in her story. Ava's happy ending felt rushed and unconvincing, as her underlying issues were merely glossed over rather than truly resolved. Eli's character presented problems, including instances of slut-shaming and controlling behavior that went unaddressed and unapologized for. While there were moments that showcased his care for Ava, his character arc felt underdeveloped.",

            "The forced marriage plot feels contrived, as Eli's justification for marrying Ava‚Äîto silence her as a witness‚Äîdoesn't align with his family's capacity to cover up crimes. Additionally, the dark moment involving Creighton and Eli's rejection of Ava at her 17th birthday party adds complexity but also raises concerns about the appropriateness of their relationship dynamics.",

Eli's alarming threats of violence, including contemplating breaking Ava's neck and threatening Mia Sokolov, reveal his abusive and controlling nature. The only redeeming aspect of Eli is his relationship with his brother, Creighton, who genuinely cares for and supports Ava during her darkest moments.

His constant derogatory remarks about Ava, such as calling her a \"prostitute\" and a \"stripper,\" are offensive and demeaning.  \n   - He blames Cecily for Ava's mental health struggles, despite Cecily being a supportive figure in Ava's life.  \n   - His threats of violence, such as contemplating breaking Ava's neck or threatening Mia Sokolov, are alarming and paint him as an abusive and controlling individual.  \n   - The only redeeming quality is his relationship with his brother, Creighton, where he shows genuine care and support.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics (Eli and Ava):**  \n   - Their relationship is toxic and forced. Eli manipulates Ava into marrying him after killing Oliver, claiming she is a liability, which feels unnecessary given his family's power and influence.  \n   - Eli's possessiveness and threats, such as promising to kidnap and kill Ava if she chooses to leave him, highlight the abusive nature of their marriage.  \n   - Ava's mental health deteriorates further due to Eli's behavior, leading her to contemplate suicide and seek a divorce.  \n\n- **Plot and Logic:**  \n   - The forced marriage plot feels contrived. Eli's reasoning for marrying Ava (to silence her as a witness) doesn't align with his family's ability to cover up crimes easily.  \n   - The dark moment involving Creighton and Eli's rejection of Ava at her 17th birthday party adds complexity but also raises questions about the appropriateness of their relationship dynamics.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n   - Creighton is a standout character, showing genuine care and support for Ava during her darkest moments.  \n   - Cecily is portrayed as a nurturing figure, contrasting sharply with Eli's toxic behavior.  \n   - Mia Sokolov is an innocent character who becomes a target of Eli's threats, further emphasizing his antagonistic nature.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The novel explores themes of abuse, manipulation, and mental health struggles, but Eli's character overshadows any potential for redemption or growth.  \n   - Ava's suffering and the lack of justice for her character evoke strong emotions of frustration and sympathy from the reader.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents a deeply flawed and toxic protagonist in Eli King, whose abusive behavior and misogynistic attitudes overshadow any redeeming qualities.

Their two-year marriage was barely explored, leaving a significant gap in their story. Overall, the book felt like a lackluster sendoff, with even the enjoyable character interactions failing to elicit much reaction. The conclusion was unsatisfying, and while moments like KG backpacking, Cranni's cuteness, and Lan and Mia's surprising longevity were enjoyable, they couldn't redeem the overall disappointment. The Tuscany wedding for JC and NB was a sweet touch, but it ultimately fell short of compensating for the book's flaws.",
            "Ava's character is primarily defined by her relationship with Eli, lacking depth beyond being his love interest. During their marriage, she is isolated from friends and family, leading to her unhappiness. Eli himself is unlikable and dull; his obsession with Ava feels superficial, and his derogatory comments about her clothing and behavior make him come across as more of a loser than a compelling character.\n\nThe dynamics within the Kings family are disappointing. Despite being the author's favorites, they never share a scene together, unlike the Sokolov/Carsons family, whose relationships are both genuine and relatable in their dysfunction. The mafia side relationships, such as Niko and Jer's friendship and the Heathens' strong bond, are far more engaging and well-developed than those of the main characters. While Eli and Aiden's relationship falls flat, others like Jer and Adrian, Niko and Kyle, and Bran and Levi shine as strong father-son duos. \n\nRemi and Ari's relationship is confusing and unsatisfying, feeling one-sided with Remi consistently pushing Ari away. Nash's obsession with women is portrayed negatively, which is off-putting. In contrast, JC and NB's relationship is filled with love and warmth, highlighting the stark difference between Ava's fear and misery in her marriage to Eli. \n\nNiko and Bran's relationship stands out, showcasing mutual obsession and possessiveness, with tender moments like Niko resting his chin on Bran's shoulder adding depth. Overall, the Sokolov/Carsons family emerges as a more cohesive and engaging unit compared to the Kings. Side characters like Cecy and Jer share a strong, supportive bond, with Jer always by Cecy's side, while Xander and Adrian's friendly dynamic offers a refreshing contrast, likely influenced by Cecy."

Instead, it feels like a rehash of her other books, blending elements from \"Cole x Silver,\" \"Reina x Asher,\" and \"Lia x Adrian.\"  \n   - The obsession between Eli and Ava, built up in previous books, feels inconsistent and poorly executed.  \n\n- **Themes and Double Standards:**  \n   - The double standard of Ava being a virgin while Eli is \"ran through\" is highlighted as a recurring and problematic theme in the author's work.  \n   - The reviewer criticizes the author's apparent \"weird kink\" for virginity, suggesting it undermines the story's credibility and appeal.  \n\n- **Author's Writing Style and Consistency:**  \n   - Rina Kent is criticized for her inability to create strong, compelling female characters, with the series being mockingly referred to as \"Legacies of virgins.\"  \n   - The reviewer expresses disappointment with the author's repetitive and predictable storytelling, despite lowered expectations.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - The book failed to meet even the reviewer's low expectations, leaving them disappointed and uninterested in reading more of the author's works (except for potential stories involving Gareth and Kayden).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe review expresses significant dissatisfaction with the novel, citing poor character development, lack of originality, and problematic themes. The reviewer finds the story repetitive, the characters uninteresting, and the author's writing style disappointing. While they acknowledge the author's previous buildup of certain relationships, they feel the execution fell flat, leading to a decision to avoid future works by Rina Kent.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "Eli is an incredibly dull character, lacking any real personality. His misogynistic tendencies and constant claims of being dark, twisted, and special only serve to make him more uninteresting. Ava, initially promising in her quest for revenge, ultimately becomes a doormat, fixating on Eli and spending money rather than taking decisive action. The chemistry between Eli and Ava is nonexistent; their relationship is purely based on sexual attraction, failing to develop into a meaningful or believable connection. The male characters are similarly one-dimensional, lacking individuality and depth, which renders the story repetitive and unengaging.",

            "The main characters, Eli and Ava, are poorly developed. Ava's behavior at 17, where she throws herself at Eli only to be harshly rejected, feels cringe-worthy. Eli's consistent insults, including comparing her to a prostitute, create a toxic dynamic rather than a romantic one, leaving their relationship lacking depth and failing to evoke empathy or interest. The story is somewhat redeemed by the appearances of other couples, particularly Ariella and Remi, who add depth and intrigue. Their presence starkly contrasts with the main couple's lack of chemistry and development.",

            "The romance between Eli and Ava feels unconvincing and repetitive, rooted in unhealthy dynamics. Eli refers to Ava as his property, and she seems to derive pleasure from being spanked. Additionally, the suicide threat scene detracts from any semblance of genuine romance.",
            "The book lacks originality, drawing heavily from the author's previous works, especially the Adrianlia trilogy. The reliance on the amnesia trope and the overused enemies-to-lovers dynamic feels stale, with some lines appearing to be directly lifted from earlier texts. Overall, the plot lacks freshness and fails to stand on its own."

Their lack of chemistry rendered their relationship dull and unconvincing. In contrast, Remi and Ari emerged as the standout characters, bringing more engagement to the story than the main couple. Overall, the chemistry between Ava and Eli was nonexistent, and the low spice level earned a disappointing -5 rating.",
