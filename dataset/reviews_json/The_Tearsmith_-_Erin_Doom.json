            "The plot suffers from disjointedness and a lack of clear direction until the final chapters. The story unfolds as a series of disconnected and questionable episodes, including the protagonist bullying another character, physically assaulting others, and engaging in inappropriate behavior without realizing it. Additionally, the resolution feels unrealistic, as one character miraculously awakens from a coma caused by a rare brain disease solely because another character reads him fairy tales.",
            "**Nica:** A naive, childlike figure with a traumatic past from an orphanage, Nica’s character came across as insufferable to me. Her interests seem limited to bandages on her fingers, insects, and her stepbrother's black eyes. \n\n**Rigel:** Depicted as a stalker-like and obsessive individual suffering from a rare brain disease, he strikes me as akin to a psychopath. His defining characteristics appear to be his piano skills and his fixation on Nica.\n\n**Secondary Characters:** Most of the secondary characters feel underdeveloped and lack purpose, with the exception of Adeline, who is the only one I found tolerable. The adoptive parents, the school bully, and the two sapphic friends seem wasted opportunities, as their storylines are abruptly abandoned, further emphasizing the overall lack of depth in the narrative.",
            "The writing style comes off as overly artificial and pretentious, akin to poetry awkwardly forced into prose. The dialogue is particularly problematic, with characters speaking in ways that feel unnatural and disconnected from reality.",
            "The setting of the story is underdeveloped; although it is set in Michigan, it lacks descriptive details that truly anchor it to the location. In fact, it could easily take place in the Po Valley without significant changes. Additionally, the use of outdated button phones by the characters detracts from the story's realism, further undermining its believability.",
            "I am frustrated with the Italian authors' approach to the bully romance genre; if they can't execute it well, they shouldn't attempt it at all. This novel is a poorly crafted retelling of *Little Red Riding Hood*, marred by questionable scenes and unnecessarily convoluted writing.",
            "The novel *La leggenda del fabbricante di lacrime* has been plagiarized by Daniele Conserva in his story collection *Il bosco dei violini e altre storie*. It's surprising that some fans dismiss the striking similarities as mere coincidence.\n\nMoreover, the author of *La leggenda del fabbricante di lacrime* has faced backlash for her previous behavior, which includes intimidating Wattpad users with legal threats over stories that shared vague similarities with her own work."

The reviewer finds her character insufferable, with her only interests being bandages on her fingers, insects, and her stepbrother's black eyes.\n   - **Rigel:** Portrayed as a stalker-like, obsessive character with a rare brain disease. The reviewer compares him to a psychopath, noting that his only defining traits are his piano skills and his obsession with Nica.\n   - **Secondary Characters:** The reviewer finds most secondary characters useless, with the exception of Adeline, who is the only tolerable character. They criticize the lack of depth and purpose in the other characters, including the adoptive parents, the school bully, and the two sapphic friends whose storyline is abruptly abandoned.\n\n- **Treatment of Sensitive Topics:**\n   - The reviewer criticizes the superficial and insensitive handling of child abuse, which is used as a mere plot device to justify the characters' personalities.\n   - They also mention the inclusion of a sapphic relationship that is poorly developed and lacks sensitivity, serving only as a backdrop to the main story.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**\n   - The setting is described as poorly developed, with the story taking place in Michigan but lacking any meaningful descriptions that ground it in that location. The reviewer notes that the story could just as easily be set in the Po Valley for all the difference it makes.\n   - They also criticize the unrealistic elements, such as the characters using outdated phones with buttons, which adds to the overall lack of believability.\n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**\n   - The reviewer finds the writing style overly artificial and pretentious, comparing it to the author having \"vomited\" questionable poetry into prose.\n   - The dialogue is described as the worst part of the book, with characters speaking in a way that feels unnatural and disconnected from reality.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Cohesion:**\n   - The plot is criticized for being disjointed and lacking a clear direction until the final chapters. The reviewer describes the story as a series of disconnected and questionable episodes, such as the protagonist bullying Nica, physically assaulting others, and engaging in inappropriate behavior while she is unaware.\n   - They also mention the unrealistic resolution, where Rigel miraculously recovers from a coma despite his rare brain disease, simply because Nica reads him fairy tales.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reviewer finds the novel to be a poorly executed, disjointed story with shallow characters, insensitive handling of serious topics, and an overly artificial writing style.

            "I found the characters in the novel to be absurd and unrealistic. Nica, in particular, was the most irritating aspect of the story. Her incessant mental monologues were tedious and would translate poorly to film. Moreover, her struggle to communicate clearly was frustrating. Rigel was somewhat more bearable; he mostly kept to himself but occasionally exacerbated the situation by telling Nica to stay away from him. The adoptive parents felt like mere plot devices—forgotten and underdeveloped as the story progressed. Although I found Norman, a minor character, intriguing, I wished for more details about his name and profession. Many TikTok comments criticized the toxic nature of the book's relationship, but I didn't find it particularly offensive; rather, it simply failed to engage me. Ultimately, it was Nica's behavior that truly tested my patience, not Rigel's.",
            "I found this book to be incredibly dull. The pacing was excessively slow, and throughout its 400 pages, nothing of significance occurred. When action finally did take place, it all happened at once, leaving no time for proper development. The story could have benefited from being 300 pages shorter, which might have made it more tolerable."

The constant emphasis on fianchi (hips) and delicatezza (delicacy) quickly becomes tedious. Initially, I approached the story without reading the synopsis, driven by curiosity; however, I later did so out of concern. I mistakenly believed it would be a paranormal tale, but that was not the case. I'm still perplexed about the relevance of the Fabbricante di Lacrime (Maker of Tears) to the main characters, Nica and Rigel.",

Initially, Rigel threatens and mistreats Nica, instilling fear in her as they begin living together. Over the course of nearly 400 pages, their relationship evolves into a passionate romance, with Rigel's mistreatment framed as a sign of love. This troubling dynamic equates fear with affection and undermines the progress of feminist themes. Nica, portrayed as overly delicate—bandaged from rescuing every living creature—contradictorily consumes meat.

            "The central conflict centers on a forbidden attraction and the male lead's internal struggle with his feelings, ultimately prompting him to leave the family to avoid complications. However, the plot often feels contrived, with many issues that could have been easily resolved through straightforward communication, like discussing their feelings with their guardian. The repeated emphasis on their shared brokenness and the notion that they are \"made for each other\" comes across as forced and unconvincing.",
            "The protagonist is small, naive, and childlike, while the male lead is rugged, broken, and morally ambiguous, though he tends more toward cruelty than moral complexity. Their relationship is fraught with problems, as the male lead exhibits abusive behaviors—yelling, intimidation, and physical aggression. Adding to the discomfort, their sibling-like dynamic (having been adopted by the same family) complicates their feelings, especially since they develop an attraction before the adoption is finalized. His contradictory actions, like intentionally getting adopted into the same family, further muddle the narrative and highlight the confusion surrounding his abusive tendencies.",
            "The book suffers from excessive repetition, frequently bringing up the concepts of \"tearsmith,\" the male lead's appearance (dark eyes and raven hair), and the protagonist's past (bandaids on her fingers). The heavy reliance on metaphors results in dialogue and descriptions that are often confusing and lacking clarity. It feels as though the author is filling space rather than meaningfully developing the story, leading to a work that could have been significantly shorter without these repetitive elements and unnecessary metaphors. This indulgence in reiteration negatively impacts the pacing, causing the story to drag."

The repetitive elements—such as Rigel’s black eyes, the wolf, the moth, and the term “maliardo”—are both frustrating and nauseating. The excessive use of adjectives, particularly “maliardo” (which appears 43 times in the first 10 pages), along with the constant emphasis on “delicacy,” becomes unbearable.",

Many chapters felt stagnant, as Nica repeatedly highlighted Rigel's attractiveness and danger, contributing little to the overall narrative. At around 300 pages, the book feels unnecessarily lengthy, with sections that could have been trimmed. The repetitive nature of the writing, with numerous paragraphs rephrasing the same ideas through metaphors and comparisons, made for a tedious reading experience.",

He is both terrifying and charming, yet his predatory nature feels inconsistent with his age and background, rendering him an unrealistic and problematic character. The romance between Nica and Rigel is toxic, marked by abuse, emotional dependency, and unhealthy justifications for Rigel's violent behavior. The notion that two broken individuals are meant for each other is deeply flawed and conveys a troubling message about relationships.",

The first half is bogged down by repetitive dialogue, featuring phrases like \"Don't touch me,\" \"Stay away from me,\" and \"You're the tear-maker.\" While the secondary characters show promise, their development falls short. The book suffers from excessive length and poor editing, with drawn-out chapters and mental monologues that contribute little to the overall narrative. The author would benefit from stronger editorial guidance to streamline and enhance the story.",

However, the book's length—670 pages—feels excessive, with much of the content being repetitive and lacking substance. Many readers have reported skipping entire chapters, suggesting that the story could have been effectively condensed to around 270 pages.",
            "The book romanticizes mental illness, particularly Rigel's sociopathy, presenting it as alluring while overlooking its serious implications. The author's misuse of astronomical references and confusion between fables and fairy tales is both frustrating and inaccurate. Additionally, the portrayal of teenage behavior feels exaggerated and troubling, indicating a disconnect from the realities of modern adolescence."

I started reading with excessively high expectations and the best intentions, genuinely wanting to appreciate the work of emerging author Erin Doom.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Point of View (POV):**\n   - The story alternates between the perspectives of the two protagonists, Nica and Rigel. However, the POV shifts are inconsistent and poorly executed. Nica’s chapters are written in first person, while Rigel’s are in third person, creating a jarring and unjustified stylistic choice. Rigel’s thoughts appear randomly, sometimes multiple times within the same chapter, without any logical flow.\n\n- **Themes and Treatment of Sensitive Topics:**\n   - The book introduces heavy themes such as trauma, mental health, and LGBTQ+ representation, but they are handled poorly. These topics are either glossed over, treated superficially, or used as plot devices without proper exploration. The portrayal of mental health issues, obsessive behavior, and violence is particularly problematic and lacks depth.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - The story revolves around the love affair between Nica and Rigel, but their relationship is overshadowed by Rigel’s disturbing obsession, which is portrayed as dramatic and unsettling. The supporting characters are underdeveloped and feel like caricatures, contributing little to the narrative.\n\n- **Writing Style and Language:**\n   - The excessive use of ellipses throughout the book is distracting and unnecessary, especially in dialogues.

The inclusion of quotes from famous authors like Shakespeare, Neruda, and Balzac, interspersed with quotes from Erin Doom herself, feels pretentious and inconsistent.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**\n   - The plot is stretched thin, with significant gaps and a lack of meaningful progression.

It centers on Nica and Rigel, adopted siblings living together, whose relationship is both complex and intriguing. Rigel initially bullies Nica but also secretly protects her, adding depth to their dynamic. The book tackles heavy themes such as abuse in the orphanage, trauma, and forbidden romance, and it navigates these topics in a way that I found mostly satisfying. However, the ending felt rushed, featuring an unnecessary revelation about Rigel’s past that could have been introduced earlier. While some readers felt the book was overly long and filled with filler, I personally enjoyed the focus on internal reflections and past memories. That said, the repetition of certain metaphors and scenes did make some parts feel drawn out.",

Rigel, a dark and brooding figure, loves Nica but grapples with his feelings, leading to a troubling combination of bullying and protective behavior. The adoptive parents are a standout aspect of the story, particularly the endearing father. The slow-burn romance between Nica and Rigel is well-executed, showcasing strong chemistry. However, there are uncomfortable moments where Rigel disregards Nica’s attempts to set boundaries, especially concerning their age (17). The relationship leans heavily on cliché tropes, with Nica depicted as the delicate butterfly and Rigel as the dark, controlling wolf.",
            "The author employs a plethora of metaphors, which I typically appreciate, but their excessive use leads to repetition that dilutes the writing’s impact. Throughout the book, I noticed recurring phrases and paragraphs that detracted from the overall experience. While the internal monologues add depth to the characters, they also dominate the narrative. The story includes many Wattpad clichés from 2016; however, they're integrated in a way that didn’t induce cringing, and I even found some enjoyable. On the other hand, Nica's infantilization—particularly Rigel's continuous emphasis on her fragility and childlike features—felt unnecessary and off-putting."

While I expected to dislike it, I found myself enjoying certain aspects, such as the slow-burn romance and the depth of the characters’ internal struggles. However, the overuse of metaphors, repetitive writing, and problematic elements in the romance detracted from my overall enjoyment. The ending felt rushed and included an unnecessary twist, but the adoptive parents were a delightful addition. Despite its flaws, the book had moments that I genuinely appreciated.",

Their relationship is complex, with Rigel initially bullying Nica but also secretly protecting her.\n   - The book deals with heavy themes like abuse in the orphanage, trauma, and forbidden romance, but handles them in a way that didn’t completely displease me.\n   - The ending felt rushed and included an unnecessary revelation about Rigel’s past, which could have been introduced earlier.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The author uses a lot of metaphors, which I generally enjoy, but they are overused to the point of becoming repetitive.\n   - There are repeated phrases and paragraphs throughout the book, which diminished the impact of the writing.\n   - The internal monologues and reflections are well-done and add depth to the characters, though they dominate much of the book.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Nica is portrayed as a fragile, sweet, and overly forgiving character, which became frustrating as she constantly needed saving by Rigel.\n   - Rigel is depicted as a dark, brooding character who loves Nica but struggles with his feelings, leading to a mix of bullying and protection.\n   - The adoptive parents are a highlight, with the father being particularly endearing.\n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**\n   - The slow-burn romance between Nica and Rigel is well-executed, with good chemistry between the characters.\n   - However, there are problematic scenes where Rigel ignores Nica’s attempts to stop certain advances, which felt uncomfortable, especially given their age (17).\n   - The relationship is heavily clichéd, with Nica as the fragile butterfly and Rigel as the dark, controlling wolf.\n\n- **Clichés and Tropes:**\n   - The book is filled with Wattpad-like clichés from 2016, but they are incorporated in a way that didn’t make me cringe, and I even enjoyed some of them.\n   - The infantilization of Nica, with Rigel constantly highlighting her fragility and childlike features, was off-putting and felt unnecessary.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**\n   - Some readers found the book unnecessarily long with too much filler, but I didn’t feel that way.

His similarities to characters from other novels suggest a lack of originality. \n\n**Secondary Characters:** Most secondary characters are underdeveloped and unmemorable, including the adoptive parents, two lesbian characters, a school bully, and a love interest who reveals himself to be abusive.

Calling it trash would be a compliment.  \n  - It’s another example of the rule that \"trash sells more.\"  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  - The plot is nonexistent.  \n  - The story is repetitive and lacks depth.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The protagonist, Nica, is insipid, unintelligent, and lacks personality. She’s beautiful but doesn’t know how to embody it, reminiscent of Bella from *Twilight*.  \n  - Rigel, the male lead, is a dark, sarcastic, and obsessive alpha male. He’s portrayed as a borderline abusive and unstable character, which is problematic.  \n  - The dynamic between Nica and Rigel is unhealthy, with Nica being afraid of him. This promotes a toxic relationship, which is concerning, especially when people on TikTok romanticize Rigel.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  - The butterfly on the cover, which many seem to like, appears to be a blatant copy of the butterflies associated with Hua Cheng from *Heaven Official’s Blessing*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a disappointing read, with a weak plot, poorly developed characters, and a problematic portrayal of relationships. The repetitive narrative and lack of originality make it difficult to appreciate. Additionally, the cover design raises questions about plagiarism. Overall, it’s a book that fails to deliver on multiple levels.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I approached this book without reading the synopsis, but eventually did so out of curiosity. Initially, I believed I was diving into a paranormal story, but that wasn’t the case. I'm still unclear about the connection between the Fabbricante di Lacrime (Maker of Tears) and the two main characters, Nica and Rigel.",
            "Nica and Rigel, two orphaned teenagers, find themselves adopted together despite having never spoken before in their shared orphanage. Their first encounter sets a troubling tone when Rigel threatens and mistreats Nica, instilling fear as they prepare to live together. However, after nearly 400 pages, their relationship inexplicably transforms into a passionate romance, with the narrative suggesting that Rigel's mistreatment is a twisted expression of love. Nica's fear becomes conflated with love, while Rigel perceives her as insignificant yet claims to love her for it. Nica, portrayed as excessively delicate, continually saves animals despite being bitten, even as she consumes meat herself.",
            "The book appears to have bypassed proper editing, resulting in a lack of polish. Repetitive phrases, such as \"delicatezza\" or \"delicacy,\" are used excessively in an attempt to elevate the prose, but this only detracts from the reading experience. Even the spicy scenes are hindered by Nica’s overthinking and omniscient narration, which feels overly delicate.",

        "conclusion": "This book was a frustrating read for me, to the point where I abandoned it after Chapter 36. The characters’ dynamics are problematic, the writing is repetitive and poorly edited, and the attempt at creating a profound narrative falls flat. Even the trashy elements, which could have been entertaining, fail to deliver.",

Honestly, I thought it was a paranormal story, but it turned out not to be.  \n   - I still don’t understand what the \"Fabbricante di Lacrime\" (Maker of Tears) has to do with the two main characters, Nica and Rigel.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n   - Nica and Rigel are orphaned teenagers who are essentially adopted together. Despite growing up in the same orphanage, they never spoke to each other.  \n   - Rigel threatens and mistreats Nica at their first encounter, and she feels afraid when she learns they’ll be living together.  \n   - They fall madly in love after about 400 pages, with the justification that Rigel mistreats her because he loves her.  \n   - Nica’s fear is portrayed as love, and Rigel considers her insignificant but loves her for it.  \n   - Nica is depicted as overly delicate, constantly saving animals and getting bitten, yet she still eats meat.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Editing:**  \n   - The book feels like it never went through proper editing. If it did, it wasn’t done well.  \n   - There are endless repetitions of phrases (e.g., \"delicatezza\" or \"delicacy\") to give the book a sense of high literature, which only makes it worse.  \n   - Even the spicy scenes are bogged down by Nica’s overthinking and omniscient narration, which is described as \"delicate.\"  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n   - The book is filled with trashy elements, but even the trash isn’t enjoyable.  \n   - The narrative tries too hard to be profound, but it comes off as pretentious and repetitive.  \n\n- **Specific Elements and Criticisms:**  \n   - The book is full of unnecessary details, like constant mentions of \"fianchi\" (hips) and \"delicatezza.\"  \n   - Rigel is repeatedly described as \"maliardo\" (bewitching), which becomes tiresome.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a frustrating read for me, to the point where I abandoned it after Chapter 36.

The movie is far superior to the book.  \n   - The movie condenses the plot and relationships effectively, while the book fails to deliver the same dynamic.  \n   - The main characters, Rigel and Nica, are portrayed differently in the book compared to the movie. Rigel in the book comes off as immature, while in the movie, he is a mature bad boy. Nica in the book is overly naive and ridiculous, unlike her more balanced portrayal in the movie.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n   - The relationship between Rigel and Nica in the book is poorly developed and lacks the depth seen in the movie.  \n   - Their interactions with other characters are also significantly different and less compelling in the book.  \n\n- **Plot Execution and Pacing:**  \n   - The book's plot is tedious and unnecessarily long, spanning over 500 pages.  \n   - The pacing is frustrating, making it difficult to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Personal Experience and Expectations:**  \n   - I continued reading the book in hopes of experiencing something similar to the movie but was deeply disappointed.  \n   - Watching the movie first saved me from fully hating the story, as the movie's execution, star cast, and soundtracks are exceptional.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Rating:**  \n   - The book was a letdown, but I gave it 2 stars instead of abandoning it entirely because of my love for the movie.  \n   - I am obsessed with the movie's cast and its execution, which made me appreciate the story despite the book's flaws.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book is a significant disappointment compared to the movie, with poorly developed characters, a tedious plot, and frustrating pacing. However, my love for the movie's execution and cast prevented me from completely dismissing the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2/5 stars."

While the plot is engaging, the pacing is uneven—the beginning is sluggish, and the conclusion feels rushed. The author should address these pacing issues for a more balanced reading experience.",
            "The author skillfully delves into character development, fostering a strong attachment before delivering emotional punches, a technique reminiscent of classic literature.

Their exceptional use of metaphors, symbols, and literary devices enriches the narrative, while delicate and subtle phrases evoke strong emotional responses. This book stands out as one of the most beautiful and profound works I have ever encountered.",

The emotional depth and connection to the characters are striking, showcasing the author’s remarkable ability to evoke such strong feelings. This intense experience is a testament to both the book's power and the author’s skill.",

It left a lasting impression on me; I found myself underlining nearly every page and reflecting deeply on its messages.",

            "The plot is convoluted, featuring unnecessary drama and a failure to resolve conflicts logically (for instance, the characters could have solved their issues by simply communicating with their guardian). Additionally, the pacing suffers due to repetitive elements and excessive metaphors, making the story feel longer than it actually is.",
            "The protagonist is portrayed as small, naive, and childlike, while the male lead presents a stark contrast with his rough, broken, and morally ambiguous demeanor—leaning more towards cruelty. Their relationship is deeply problematic, dominated by his abusive behavior, which includes yelling and physical intimidation. The sibling-like bond they share, stemming from being adopted by the same family, adds an uncomfortable layer to their dynamic, especially since they have feelings for each other prior to their adoption being finalized.\n\nThe male lead's character is marked by contradictions; he desires to be part of the protagonist’s family yet distances himself, claiming he loves her too much to remain close. Despite his backstory filled with abandonment issues and a struggle to comprehend love, his abusive actions are inexcusable. The narrative frames the protagonist's tolerance of his cruelty as a sign that she is \"messed up\" and therefore suited for him, which is both troubling and lacking in depth. While both characters perceive the world as antagonistic, their conflicts often feel exaggerated and self-imposed.",
            "The book suffers from excessive repetition, frequently reiterating the “tearsmith” concept, the male lead’s dark eyes and raven hair, and the protagonist’s orphanage background. The overabundance of metaphors muddles the dialogue and descriptions, undermining the story’s clarity and emotional resonance. Overall, the writing feels padded, suggesting the author prioritized word count over crafting a cohesive narrative."

        "conclusion": "The novel suffers from poorly developed characters, an uncomfortable and abusive relationship dynamic, excessive repetition, and a writing style that relies too heavily on confusing metaphors. The plot lacks coherence and logical resolution, making it a frustrating and unsatisfying read. Despite its flaws, I persevered, though I ultimately found no enjoyment in the experience.",

Many chapters lack meaningful events, instead fixating on Nica's repeated descriptions of Rigel's allure and danger.

The romantic dynamic between Nica and Rigel is toxic, marked by emotional dependency and abuse, conveying a troubling message that trauma somehow makes them ideal partners.",

However, the romance itself lacks depth, as the main characters have minimal interaction for the first half of the book, featuring repetitive and clichéd dialogue. While the secondary characters are decent, they ultimately fall short. The pacing drags, with lengthy chapters and an overreliance on metaphors and transitional scenes. Additionally, the mental monologues are overly long and lack descriptive nuance, making them tedious.",

It could have been effectively condensed into a shorter narrative without sacrificing its essence. The effort to prolong the story feels forced and unnecessary.

Additionally, Rigel’s thoughts intrude erratically, sometimes appearing multiple times within the same chapter, disrupting the narrative flow.",

I started reading with excessively high expectations and the best intentions, genuinely wanting to appreciate the work of emerging author Erin Doom.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Point of View (POV):**\n   - The story alternates between the perspectives of the two protagonists, Nica and Rigel. However, the POV shifts are inconsistent and poorly executed. Nica’s chapters are written in first person, while Rigel’s are in third person, creating a jarring and unjustified stylistic choice. Rigel’s thoughts appear randomly, sometimes multiple times within the same chapter, without any logical flow.\n\n- **Themes and Treatment of Sensitive Topics:**\n   - The book introduces heavy themes such as trauma, mental health, and LGBTQ+ representation, but they are handled poorly. These topics are either glossed over, treated superficially, or used as plot devices without proper exploration. The portrayal of mental health issues, obsessive behavior, and violence is particularly problematic and lacks depth.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - The story revolves around the love affair between Nica and Rigel, but their relationship is overshadowed by Rigel’s obsessive and unsettling behavior. The supporting characters are underdeveloped and feel like caricatures, with minimal impact on the plot.\n\n- **Writing Style and Literary Choices:**\n   - The excessive use of ellipses throughout the book is distracting and unnecessary, especially in dialogues. The repetitive and redundant thoughts, particularly the constant comparison of Rigel to a wolf, become tiresome. The inclusion of quotes from famous authors like Shakespeare, Neruda, and Balzac, interspersed with the author’s own quotes, feels pretentious and inconsistent.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**\n   - The plot is stretched thin, with significant gaps and a lack of meaningful progression. The story could have been condensed into a much shorter narrative without losing its essence. The attempt to prolong the story feels forced and unnecessary.\n\n- **Overall Execution and Impact:**\n   - The book fails to deliver on its potential. The introduction of serious themes is undermined by their superficial treatment, and the narrative structure is confusing and poorly executed. The story lacks depth, coherence, and emotional resonance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book fell far short of my expectations. Despite its promising premise and the author’s attempt to tackle important themes, the execution was deeply flawed.

            "The story opens with a charming original fable crafted by the author, which adds a distinctive touch to the narrative. It tackles heavy themes such as abuse in an orphanage and forbidden romance, navigating these subjects more skillfully than I anticipated. While the plot is sprinkled with 2016 Wattpad clichés, they are integrated in a way that feels refreshing rather than cringy, with some proving to be quite enjoyable. \n\nThough the book has been criticized for its length and repetitive metaphors, I found it engaging. The internal reflections and past memories kept my interest alive. However, the ending left me frustrated. Just as the story seemed poised for a happy conclusion, a revelation about Rigel sleeping with his best friend to cope with Nica was introduced, which felt unnecessary and poorly timed.",
            "In this story, Nica is a fragile and sensitive protagonist who suffers from mistreatment and constantly seeks rescue. While I empathize with her love for animals and her traumatic background, her frequent forgiveness and lack of agency are frustrating. Rigel, the male lead, is a dark, brooding figure who loves Nica but expresses his affection through bullying and possessiveness. Their dynamic follows the overplayed fragile butterfly and dark wolf trope. \n\nThe adoptive parents stand out as a heartwarming addition, bringing tenderness to the narrative. The slow-burn romance between Nica and Rigel is well-developed and their chemistry feels authentic. However, their relationship raises concerns. Rigel’s unsettling behavior—especially in instances where Nica asks him to stop and he doesn’t—creates discomfort, particularly given their age (17). Furthermore, Rigel's constant infantilization of Nica, emphasizing her fragility and childlike features, is off-putting and sends a troubling message.",

Her traumatic past as an abused child in an orphanage is addressed only superficially. **Rigel:** The male lead is portrayed as a psychopathic stalker, defined solely by his obsession with Nica. His rare brain disease is a weak and clichéd excuse for his troubling behavior, making his character unconvincing. **Secondary Characters:** Most secondary characters feel irrelevant and underdeveloped. The adoptive parents, the school bully, and the LGBTQ+ figures are all poorly integrated into the narrative. The lone exception is Adeline, Nica’s friend from the orphanage, who, while slightly more engaging, adds minimal intrigue to the plot.",

The only tolerable character is Adeline, Nica's friend from the orphanage, who adds minimal intrigue to the plot.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n   - The setting is criticized for being vague and irrelevant. Despite being set in Michigan, the descriptions are so lacking that the story could take place anywhere.  \n   - The reviewer notes that the unrealistic elements, such as outdated technology (phones with buttons) and sociopathic behavior from the characters, make the story feel disconnected from reality.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**  \n   - The writing style is described as overly artificial and pretentious, as if the author tried to force poetic language into prose.  \n   - The dialogue is particularly criticized for being unnatural and contributing to the overall lack of realism in the story.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Cohesion:**  \n   - The plot is described as disjointed and lacking a clear direction until the final chapters.  \n   - The reviewer highlights several problematic and nonsensical scenes, such as Rigel bullying Nica as a child, his obsessive behavior, and the unrealistic resolution involving a coma and a rare brain disease.  \n   - The abuse themes are criticized for being used as a superficial plot device rather than being explored with sensitivity or depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reviewer expresses deep disappointment with the novel, describing it as a poorly executed, disjointed story with underdeveloped characters, insensitive handling of serious themes, and an overly artificial writing style. They regret the time spent reading it and believe the author's previous work was far superior.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1⭐️ (Originally rated 3 stars, but changed to 1 star after further reflection.)"

Initially, I expected a paranormal narrative, but it turned out to be quite different. I still find myself puzzled about how the Fabbricante di Lacrime (Maker of Tears) relates to the two main characters, Nica and Rigel.",
            "Nica and Rigel, two orphaned teenagers, are unexpectedly paired together after growing up in the same orphanage without ever speaking. Their first encounter is marked by Rigel's threats and mistreatment, leaving Nica fearful about their new living arrangement. However, after about 400 pages, their relationship transforms into a passionate romance, suggesting that Rigel's abuse is a misguided expression of love. This portrayal undermines years of feminist progress, implying that mistreatment equates to affection. Nica, characterized as overly delicate with bandaged fingers from rescuing animals, presents a contradiction by still consuming meat. Overall, the narrative raises troubling questions about love and abuse.",
            "This book appears to have bypassed proper editing, resulting in a tedious reading experience. The endless repetitions, particularly the emphasis on Nica’s delicacy, detract from what could have been a more engaging narrative. Even the spicy scenes are weighed down by her overthinking and the omniscient narration, which fixates excessively on her hips. While the book contains elements meant to be risqué, they ultimately fail to entertain. The repetitive phrases, such as Rigel being referred to as maliardo (enchanting) far too often, contribute to the overall dissatisfaction, making the highbrow attempts feel out of place."

However, he continuously distances himself and treats her poorly. The central conflict stems from their failure to communicate openly, resulting in unnecessary drama and unresolved tension. Ultimately, the resolution feels unsatisfying; the male lead leaves to avoid being adopted, leaving us questioning his true motivations.",

Their quasi-sibling bond, stemming from being adopted by the same family, adds an uncomfortable dimension to their connection, further complicated by romantic and physical attraction. While the male lead’s abusive behavior is presented as rooted in his abandonment issues, this does not excuse his actions or create a compelling character.

The narrative suffered from repetitive descriptions, filler chapters, and excessive reminders of past events that felt unnecessary in a full-length novel. The recurring scenes, metaphors, and character depictions rendered the story heavy and redundant. Plot inconsistencies were also present; for instance, Nica is caught by Rigel with an apartment, yet in the next chapter, she inexplicably has gifts for it. The unclear timeline further muddled the setting and era of the story. Additionally, the abrupt shift in the meaning of \"fabbricante di lacrime\" (maker of tears) felt poorly executed. Overall, the story was lengthy, repetitive, and lacked realism in both dialogue and events. The relentless drama without meaningful progression made for a frustrating and tiresome reading experience.",

            "The narration posed a significant issue. While a few phrases resonated with me, most of the time it felt as though I was reading the thoughts of a woman from another era rather than a 17-year-old girl. The author seemed more intent on maintaining a poetic and overly elaborate tone instead of exploring the mind of a teenager who had just left an orphanage and was adjusting to a new school and adoptive parents. The 5% of the book narrated by Rigel in the third person was slightly better, but even those sections felt repetitive, often reiterating what Nica had already conveyed. \n\nThe plot had potential but was squandered by unnecessary drama. For instance, the bridge scene dragged on, making Nica’s attempts to wake Rigel tedious to read. Additionally, the revelation in the final chapter about Rigel sleeping with Nica’s best friend felt completely unnecessary. There were entire chapters where nothing progressed, with Nica simply reiterating Rigel's attractiveness and danger every time they crossed paths.",
            "Rigel is both terrifying and charming, embodying a masculine confidence that suggests a natural predator. However, this portrayal clashes with his identity as a 17-year-old boy grappling with deep traumas. His violent tendencies, attributed to a rare illness causing severe headaches, raise concerns. Nica and her adoptive parents' unquestioning acceptance of his behavior sends a troubling message. The romance in the story is toxic, rife with abuse, and promotes the notion that two broken individuals are ideal for each other solely because they share trauma.",
            "The dialogue in the story is nearly absent. While Rigel is inherently reserved, Nica compensates by seemingly reading his mind, repeatedly likening him to a solitary, reckless wolf. These constant comparisons—pertaining to his eyes, laugh, and even his self-description—grow increasingly absurd and overused. The narrative could have benefitted from being 300 pages shorter, as many paragraphs reiterate the same concepts using different words and metaphors, leading to a tedious reading experience. Overall, the excessive comparisons and overly poetic descriptions detract from the story’s impact.",
            "The book's message is troubling, romanticizing a toxic relationship marked by abuse, emotional dependency, and unhealthy dynamics. It is not a tale of romance, but rather one that glorifies a deeply flawed and harmful bond.",
            "I chose to read the book due to the upcoming movie adaptation in April and the intriguing trailer. Initially, the story captured my interest, but it soon became tedious, making me consider abandoning it. Nevertheless, I persevered through all 38 chapters and the epilogue, although I did skip a few paragraphs toward the end as my patience wore thin."
        ],
        "conclusion": "In summary, this book is not what I expected. It’s overly repetitive, with a tedious narrative, underdeveloped dialogue, and a plot that squanders its potential with unnecessary drama. The portrayal of the relationship between Nica and Rigel is deeply problematic, promoting a toxic and abusive dynamic. If you choose to read it, be aware that it’s not a romantic story but rather a depiction of an unhealthy and emotionally dependent relationship.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Initial Expectations and Engagement:**\n   - I decided to read the book because of the upcoming movie adaptation in April and the intriguing trailer. The story started off well, but as I progressed, it became increasingly tedious, to the point where I considered abandoning it. I didn’t, though—I read all 38 chapters plus the epilogue, though I admit I skipped some paragraphs in the ending because I couldn’t take it anymore.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**\n   - The book could easily have been 300 pages shorter. There were dozens of paragraphs that repeated the same ideas with different words, metaphors, and comparisons, which made the reading experience very tedious. The excessive use of comparisons and overly poetic descriptions became tiresome.\n\n- **Narration and Perspective:**\n   - The narration was a major issue. While there were a few phrases I liked, most of the time it felt like I was reading the thoughts of a woman from another era, not a 17-year-old girl. The author seemed more focused on maintaining a poetic and overly elaborate tone rather than delving into the mind of a teenager who had just left an orphanage and was navigating a new school environment and adoptive parents. The 5% of the book narrated by Rigel in the third person was slightly better, but even those parts were repetitive, often reiterating what Nica had already explained.\n\n- **Dialogue:**\n   - The dialogue was almost nonexistent. Rigel wasn’t a communicative character, but Nica seemed to read his mind, drawing conclusions about him every few pages, often comparing him to a \"lone and reckless wolf.\" The constant references to Rigel being a wolf—his eyes, his laugh, even his own self-description—became absurd and overused.\n\n- **Plot and Drama:**\n   - The plot had potential but was wasted with unnecessary drama. The bridge scene, for example, felt dragged out, with Nica’s attempts to \"wake him up\" becoming unbearable to read. The revelation in the last chapter about Rigel sleeping with Nica’s best friend was completely unnecessary. There were entire chapters where nothing happened, just Nica reiterating how attractive and dangerous Rigel was every time she encountered him.\n\n- **Characterization of Rigel:**\n   - Rigel was portrayed as terrifying yet charming, exuding a masculine confidence that made him seem like a natural predator. However, this characterization didn’t align with him being a 17-year-old boy with deep traumas. His violent tendencies, justified by a rare illness causing headaches, were problematic. The fact that Nica and her adoptive parents accepted his behavior without question sent a troubling message. The romance in the book was toxic, filled with abuse, and promoted the idea that two broken people are perfect for each other simply because they share trauma.\n\n- **Overall Message and Themes:**\n   - The book’s message is concerning, as it romanticizes a toxic relationship filled with abuse, emotional dependency, and unhealthy dynamics. It’s not a romantic story but rather one that glorifies a deeply flawed and harmful relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn summary, this book is not what I expected. It’s overly repetitive, with a tedious narrative, underdeveloped dialogue, and a plot that squanders its potential with unnecessary drama. The portrayal of the relationship between Nica and Rigel is deeply problematic, promoting a toxic and abusive dynamic.

            "This story follows a familiar Mary Sue and Bad Boy romance trope, though it is better crafted than many in the genre. Unfortunately, the chemistry between the main characters feels unconvincing, as they hardly interact during the first half of the book. While the secondary characters show promise, their development ultimately falls flat. The narrative is overly lengthy, burdened by unnecessary internal monologues and transitional chapters, which disrupt the pacing. As a result, the lack of meaningful dialogue and excessive introspection detracts from the overall experience.",
            "In the story, Nica's constant insistence on being different from other girls grows tiresome over time. Meanwhile, the male lead, Rigel (also known as Piede), is depicted as a sociopath, a portrayal that romanticizes troubling behavior. Additionally, the secondary love interest is reduced to a one-dimensional psychopath, which comes off as a lazy and poorly developed characterization.",
            "The author stands out as one of the rare talents from Wattpad, showcasing genuine writing skill. However, the book is lengthy and repetitive, prompting many readers to skip entire chapters. It could have been more effectively condensed to around 270 pages, as much of the content feels like cosmic nothingness.",
            "The book romanticizes mental illness, which is both frustrating and misleading. Additionally, numerous incorrect astronomical references undermine the story's credibility. It appears that the author and editors do not understand the distinction between favole (fables) and fiabe (fairy tales).",
            "Despite its flaws, the book retains an undeniable charm that contributes to its popularity. The snail scene stands out as particularly memorable, though it veers into cringe-worthy territory."

The romanticization of mental illness, incorrect references, and poor pacing detract from what could have been a more compelling story. The secondary characters show potential but are ultimately underdeveloped. Despite its flaws, the book has garnered attention, though it doesn't fully deserve its success. I wouldn't read another book by this author, but the snail scene will remain unforgettable.",

The narrative could have been significantly condensed without losing its essence. Additionally, there are substantial plot holes and a lack of depth in exploring the introduced themes, which makes the story feel superficial and underdeveloped. The alternating points of view are confusing and inconsistent; for 12 chapters (149 pages), we are immersed in Nica's first-person perspective, only to abruptly shift to Rigel's third-person viewpoint in the 13th chapter. This stylistic choice feels arbitrary and poorly justified, as Rigel's thoughts appear sporadically and without a logical pattern, disrupting the narrative flow.",
            "Rigel's character is both obsessive and unsettling, exhibiting a dramatic and often disturbing fixation on Nica. However, this dynamic feels problematic and underdeveloped. The supporting characters lack depth, coming across as mere caricatures with little impact on the narrative; for instance, Norman only speaks a handful of times throughout the book.",

I started reading with excessively high expectations and the best intentions, genuinely wanting to appreciate the work of emerging author Erin Doom.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Point of View:**\n   - The story alternates points of view in a confusing and inconsistent manner. For 12 chapters (149 pages), we follow Nica's thoughts in the first person, and then suddenly, in the 13th chapter, we are plunged into Rigel's mind, written in the third person.

It tackles heavy themes such as abuse in an orphanage, trauma, and forbidden romance, and while it navigates these topics thoughtfully, I felt the ending was rushed and poorly timed. The revelation about Rigel sleeping with his best friend to forget Nica could have been introduced earlier, which would have added depth to the narrative.",
            "Nica is a character I both admire and find frustrating. I relate to her passion for animals and her desire to help others, but her consistent portrayal as fragile and in need of rescue becomes tiresome. Rigel is a complex character, embodying a mix of love and frustration toward Nica. His protective instincts and internal struggles are well-executed, yet his teenage actions can be problematic at times. The adoptive parents are a highlight, particularly the father, who is endearing. I appreciated the slow-burning romance between Nica and Rigel; however, their dynamic often feels unbalanced, with Nica depicted as a delicate butterfly and Rigel as a dominant wolf. Some intimate moments raise concerns about consent, which is uncomfortable, especially considering their age (17). While their chemistry is well-developed, the repeated emphasis on Nica’s vulnerability and Rigel’s control becomes monotonous.",
            "The author employs metaphors extensively, with frequent appearances every few pages. While I appreciate metaphors, their overuse became overwhelming. The book also suffers from repetition, with certain phrases and paragraphs appearing multiple times, which diluted their impact. However, the internal monologues and reflections were well-crafted and added depth to the characters, even if the constant reiteration of themes made the story feel drawn out.\n\nAlthough the book is riddled with Wattpad-style clichés from 2016, they were integrated in a way that felt surprisingly enjoyable rather than cringe-worthy. The \"bully romance\" trope is prevalent, with Rigel bullying Nica in childhood and their relationship evolving into a complex mix of antipathy and attraction as adults. However, Rigel's infantilization of Nica—constantly emphasizing her fragility, small size, and \"childlike\" features—was off-putting and unnecessary.\n\nDespite its length and filler content, particularly due to the excessive metaphors and repetitiveness, I found the story engaging. The focus on internal reflections and past memories kept my interest, though a more concise approach could have enhanced the narrative."

However, their dynamic often felt unbalanced, with Nica being portrayed as a fragile butterfly and Rigel as the dark, controlling wolf.\n   - There are moments in their relationship, especially during intimate scenes, where consent is questionable, which was uncomfortable to read, particularly given their age (17).\n   - The chemistry between the characters is well-developed, but the constant emphasis on Nica’s fragility and Rigel’s dominance became repetitive.\n\n- **Clichés and Tropes:**\n   - The book is filled with Wattpad-style clichés from 2016, but they were incorporated in a way that didn’t feel overly cringe-worthy. Some were even enjoyable.\n   - The “bully romance” trope is present, with Rigel bullying Nica as children and their relationship evolving into one of antipathy and attraction as adults.\n   - The infantilization of Nica, with Rigel constantly highlighting her fragility, small size, and “childlike” features, was off-putting and felt unnecessary.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**\n   - The book is long and contains a lot of filler, particularly due to the overuse of metaphors and repetitive themes.\n   - Despite the length, I didn’t find it boring. The focus on internal reflections and past memories kept me engaged, though it could have been more concise.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the book was a mixed experience for me. While I expected to dislike it, there were moments I genuinely enjoyed, particularly the slow-burn romance and the depth of the characters’ internal struggles. However, the excessive use of metaphors, repetitive themes, and problematic aspects of the relationship detracted from the overall experience. The ending felt rushed and poorly executed, leaving me frustrated. Despite its flaws, the book had its merits, and I didn’t completely dislike it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3/5 ★★★☆☆"

Nica dreams of adoption, and complications arise when a family considers adopting both her and Rigel, who share a mutual dislike.

Additionally, the absence of a strong central storyline raises concerns about whether the book was adequately edited before publication.",

To me, he lacks depth, reduced to a mere psychopath driven by his fixation on Nica and his piano skills. **Secondary Characters:** Most secondary characters feel underdeveloped and largely irrelevant; however, Adeline stands out as the only tolerable one. The adoptive parents, a school bully, and a potential abuser contribute little to the overall narrative.",

I still find myself puzzled about the connection between the Fabbricante di Lacrime and the two main characters, but perhaps that’s a question for future readers to ponder.",
            "In this story, Nica and Rigel are two orphaned teenagers who are taken in together, despite never having communicated during their time in the same orphanage. Rigel initially intimidates and mistreats Nica, leaving her understandably frightened at the thought of living with him. However, after an extensive 400 pages, they suddenly fall deeply in love, with the narrative suggesting that Rigel’s mistreatment stems from his affection for her. Nica's fear is recast as love, and Rigel, who deems her unimportant, paradoxically finds that quality endearing. This portrayal undermines decades of feminist progress, implying that abuse can be a form of affection. Nica is depicted as fragile, often bandaging her fingers from rescuing animals that bite her, yet she continues to consume meat, presenting a curious contradiction.",
            "The book feels poorly edited, if at all. It suffers from excessive repetition, particularly with phrases like \"Nica’s delicacy,\" which attempts to elevate the prose but ultimately detracts from it. Even the spicy scenes are weighed down by Nica’s overthinking and an omniscient narration that fixates on her hips—yes, hips. While the book contains trashy elements, it fails to deliver any enjoyment. It tries too hard to be something it’s not, resulting in a chaotic reading experience."

The repetitive phrases, poor editing, and contradictory themes made it hard to enjoy. Even the attempt at creating a romantic or dramatic atmosphere fell flat.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Genre Expectations:**  \n   - I went into this book without reading the synopsis, but I eventually did because I was a bit scared. Honestly, I thought it was a paranormal story, but it turns out it wasn’t. I still don’t understand what the \"Fabbricante di Lacrime\" has to do with the two main characters, but I’ll leave that question for future generations.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Nica and Rigel are two orphaned teenagers who are essentially adopted together. Despite growing up in the same orphanage, they never spoke to each other. In fact, Rigel threatens and mistreats Nica at the first opportunity, and she is understandably scared when she finds out they’ll be living together.  \n   - However, after about 400 pages, they fall madly in love because, apparently, Rigel mistreats her BECAUSE he loves her. Her fear isn’t real fear—it’s love.  \n   - Rigel considers Nica insignificant, yet he loves her for that too. It feels like years of feminism undone, as if being mistreated is just a sign of love.  \n   - Nica is portrayed as overly delicate, with bandages on her fingers because she’s constantly saving animals by letting them bite her. Yet, she still eats meat, which feels contradictory.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Editing:**  \n   - The book feels like it never went through proper editing. If it did, it wasn’t done well. It’s full of repetitions and phrases repeated endlessly (like Nica’s \"delicacy\") to give it an air of high literature, which only makes things worse.  \n   - Even the spicy scenes are bogged down by Nica’s overthinking and omniscient narration (always emphasizing her delicacy) and an excessive focus on hips. Yes, hips.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n   - The book is filled with trashy elements, but even the trash isn’t enjoyable. It tries too hard to be something it’s not, and the result is a mess.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a struggle to get through, and I ultimately abandoned it after chapter 36. The characters, their relationship, and the writing style were all frustrating. The repetitive phrases, poor editing, and contradictory themes made it hard to enjoy. Even the attempt at creating a romantic or dramatic atmosphere fell flat.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While the story attempts to present their relationship as forbidden and dramatic, it ultimately lacks depth and logical progression.",

At times, the writing feels like filler, suggesting the author may have prioritized word count over coherent storytelling.

The relationship between the protagonists feels forced and uncomfortable, and the plot lacks logical progression. The reader found the experience frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying, making it one of the worst books they’ve ever read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is provided, but the review strongly implies a very low score, likely 1/5 or 2/5 at best."

            "The plot suffers from inconsistencies, notably when Nica is caught by Rigel with an apartment, only to be seen holding gifts for that same apartment in the next chapter. Such discrepancies disrupt the story's flow and realism. Additionally, the unclear timeline complicates the understanding of the setting and context. The abrupt shift in the meaning of \"fabbricante di lacrime\" (maker of tears) between Nica and Rigel feels jarring and poorly executed.",
            "The characters Nica and Rigel lack depth and growth. Their toxic relationship is steeped in unnecessary drama, casting Rigel as a stereotypical bad boy and Nica as someone with a savior complex. Their conversations feel unrealistic, dominated by metaphors and lacking genuine emotional connection until the very end. Overall, the characterization is superficial, highlighting only a few traits—Rigel's thorny nature and Nica's delicacy—without delving into other dimensions of their personalities.",
            "The book is in dire need of substantial editing. Originating from Wattpad, where chapters are serialized, the author relied on repetitive character descriptions and filler chapters to maintain reader engagement. However, in a full-length novel, this repetition becomes tedious and unnecessary. Phrases like “è la delicatezza” and constant reiteration of descriptions weighed down the narrative, rendering it heavy and monotonous. Since the book is intended to be read in one sitting rather than in installments, frequent reminders of previous events are redundant. Additionally, the excessive use of metaphors in both dialogue and descriptions disrupts the natural flow of the story. While the author's vocabulary is commendable, the use of archaic or overly complex words such as “tremebondo” and “maliardo” further complicates the reading experience without adding value."

            "The plot is unnecessarily stretched, primarily focusing on the repetitive interactions between the two main characters. The narrative could have been condensed into a shorter book without losing its essence. Significant plot holes and a lack of meaningful development render the story shallow and incomplete. The story alternates between the perspectives of the protagonists, Nica and Rigel, but the point-of-view shifts are inconsistent and poorly executed. Nica’s chapters (12 in total, spanning 149 pages) are written in first person, while Rigel’s perspective abruptly appears in the 13th chapter in third person. This stylistic choice feels unjustified, and Rigel’s thoughts are scattered throughout the book, sometimes appearing multiple times within the same chapter without a logical pattern. This inconsistency disrupts the narrative flow and is ultimately frustrating.",
            "Rigel's character is both obsessive and unsettling, marked by a dramatic—and at times disturbing—fixation on Nica. Unfortunately, this dynamic lacks the depth it deserves, as Rigel's behavior is often romanticized rather than critically examined. The supporting characters also feel underdeveloped, resembling caricatures. For instance, Norman's minimal dialogue throughout the book reduces him and others to mere props rather than integral parts of the narrative.",
            "One of the most irritating aspects of the writing is the excessive use of ellipses (…). They appear throughout the book—from the prologue to the epilogue—in dialogues and thoughts, often feeling unnecessary. Additionally, the repetitive comparisons of Rigel to a wolf become tiresome and nearly unbearable by the end. While the inclusion of quotes from renowned authors like Shakespeare, Pablo Neruda, and Honoré de Balzac at the beginnings of chapters adds depth, the occasional quotes from Erin Doom herself feel pretentious and inconsistent, undermining their impact.",
            "The story centers on the romantic relationship between the two protagonists, with trauma used merely as a plot device to enhance the narrative. Unfortunately, the exploration of this theme is insufficient. While the book touches on serious issues like LGBTQ+ representation, trauma, violence, obsessive behavior, and harassment, these topics are either poorly executed or entirely overlooked. The psychological introspection lacks depth, and sensitive subjects are treated superficially and dismissively. Additionally, the portrayal of mental health issues and professionals is problematic and often ridiculed, which is both disappointing and offensive.",

I started reading with excessively high expectations and the best intentions, genuinely wanting to appreciate the work of emerging author Erin Doom.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Point of View (POV):**\n   - The story alternates between the perspectives of the two protagonists, Nica and Rigel. However, the POV shifts are inconsistent and poorly executed. Nica’s chapters (12 in total, 149 pages) are written in first person, while Rigel’s perspective suddenly appears in the 13th chapter and is written in third person.

This lack of consistency in POV usage is frustrating and disrupts the narrative flow.\n\n- **Themes and Treatment of Sensitive Topics:**\n   - The story revolves around the love affair between the two protagonists, with trauma serving as a mere plot device to make the narrative more interesting. Unfortunately, these themes are not adequately addressed or explored.\n   - The book introduces serious topics such as LGBTQ+ representation, trauma, violence, obsessive behavior, and harassment, but they are either poorly handled or completely ignored. The psychological introspection is shallow, and the treatment of these delicate subjects is superficial and dismissive.\n   - The portrayal of mental health issues and professional figures is problematic and often ridiculed, which is disappointing and offensive.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - Rigel’s character is portrayed as obsessive and unsettling, with a dramatic and at times disturbing fixation on Nica. This dynamic is not explored with the depth it deserves, and his behavior is often romanticized rather than critically examined.\n   - The supporting characters are underdeveloped and feel like caricatures. For example, Norman speaks only a few times throughout the entire book, making him and others feel like mere props rather than integral parts of the story.\n\n- **Writing Style and Literary Devices:**\n   - The excessive use of ellipses (…) is one of the most irritating aspects of the writing.

            "The story opens with a unique fable crafted by the author, which I always appreciate in literature. The novel tackles weighty themes such as abuse in an orphanage, trauma, and forbidden romance, and I found its handling of these subjects largely satisfying. The plot weaves in numerous internal reflections and flashbacks, which I found engaging rather than tedious. \n\nHowever, the ending felt rushed and poorly timed, particularly with the late revelation about the male protagonist’s indiscretion with his best friend to forget the female lead. Some readers have criticized the novel for being overly long and filled with filler content, but I didn’t share that sentiment. While the pacing is slow, focusing heavily on introspection and memories, I found this approach effective and enjoyable.",
            "**Nica:** I relate to her in some ways, particularly her love for animals and her traumatic past. However, her character feels overly clichéd—fragile, sweet, and perpetually in need of rescue—which became frustrating. **Rigel:** He is a complex character who simultaneously loves and resents Nica, protecting her in secret while bullying her as a child. Their chemistry is well-developed, but some of his actions are problematic. **Adoptive Parents:** I adored the adoptive parents, especially the tender and endearing father. The romance unfolds as a slow burn, which I appreciated, but it falls into the bully romance trope, with Rigel's past bullying and controlling behavior as an adult. Additionally, there are explicit sexual scenes involving teenage characters, some of which depict Nica attempting to resist while Rigel ignores her, making those moments uncomfortable and inappropriate. Overall, the dynamic between Nica and Rigel is heavily clichéd, with Nica as the fragile butterfly and Rigel as the dark, predatory wolf.",
            "The author employs numerous metaphors, which I usually appreciate; however, their overuse leads to repetition that diminishes their impact. Certain phrases and paragraphs recur throughout the book, becoming tiresome. While the internal monologues and metaphors are profound and well-crafted, their constant repetition ultimately undermines their effectiveness.",
            "The book features familiar Wattpad tropes from 2016, yet they are woven together in a way that's surprisingly enjoyable rather than cringe-worthy. However, I found the infantilization of the female protagonist and the focus on her fragility and innocence to be off-putting. While the themes of trauma, abuse, and forbidden romance are explored with some depth, the execution often feels repetitive and overdone."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I didn’t dislike the book as much as I expected to. While it has its flaws—such as overused metaphors, repetitive content, and problematic romantic dynamics—there were moments I genuinely enjoyed. The adoptive parents were a highlight, and the slow-burn romance, though clichéd, had its merits. However, the rushed ending and certain uncomfortable scenes detracted from my overall enjoyment.",

The potential for a rich narrative involving their adoptive family is overlooked. Rigel’s possessive and aggressive behavior makes him an unlikable male interest, feeling clichéd and lacking originality. Meanwhile, Nica frustrates as she continually justifies Rigel’s toxic actions and sacrifices her own well-being for him.

His defining traits are reduced to his piano skills and an unhealthy obsession with Nica. **Secondary Characters:** Most secondary characters feel unnecessary, including the adoptive parents, two lesbian characters, the school bully, and a potential love interest who ultimately reveals himself as an abuser.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Originality and Plagiarism Concerns:**\n   - The reviewer mentions that the novel \"La leggenda del fabbricante di lacrime\" was plagiarized by Daniele Conserva in his collection of stories \"Il bosco dei violini e altre storie.\" They find it ridiculous that fans of the author, Erin Doom, try to dismiss this as a coincidence.\n   - The reviewer also criticizes Erin Doom's past behavior, including legal threats and intimidation towards Wattpad users who had elements in their stories vaguely similar to hers.\n\n- **Genre and Theme Execution:**\n   - The reviewer expresses frustration with the Italian authors' handling of the \"bully romance\" genre, stating that if they can't write it well, they shouldn't write it at all.\n   - They criticize the novel for being a poorly executed retelling of \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" filled with questionable scenes and overly convoluted writing.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - **Nica:** Described as a naive, childlike character with a traumatic past of abuse in an orphanage. The reviewer finds her character insufferable, with her only interests being bandages on her fingers, insects, and her stepbrother's black eyes.\n   - **Rigel:** Portrayed as a stalker-like, obsessive character with a rare brain disease. The reviewer compares him to a psychopath, noting that his only defining traits are his piano skills and his obsession with Nica.\n   - **Secondary Characters:** The reviewer finds most secondary characters useless, including the adoptive parents, two lesbian characters, the school bully, and a potential love interest who turns out to be an abuser. The only tolerable character is Adeline, Nica's friend from the orphanage.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**\n   - The setting is criticized for being poorly described and irrelevant. The story is set in Michigan, but the reviewer feels it could just as well be set in the Po Valley due to the lack of vivid descriptions.\n   - The reviewer notes that the story feels completely detached from reality, with characters behaving like sociopaths and using outdated technology.\n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**\n   - The reviewer finds the writing style overly artificial, as if the author had \"vomited questionable poetry into prose.\"\n   - The dialogue is described as the worst part of the book, with characters speaking in an unrealistic and disjointed manner.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot is criticized for being disjointed and lacking a central narrative. The reviewer describes the book as a \"brick\" filled with disconnected and questionable episodes.\n   - Specific plot points, such as Rigel bullying Nica, entering her room while she sleeps, and their fall from a cliff, are highlighted as particularly absurd.\n\n- **Sensitivity and Handling of Serious Themes:**\n   - The reviewer feels that the treatment of serious themes like child abuse is superficial and used merely as a plot device to justify the characters' personalities.\n   - They also criticize the inclusion of LGBTQ+ themes, which are introduced briefly and then abandoned without proper sensitivity or development.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reviewer finds the novel to be a poorly executed, disjointed story with unlikable characters, a lack of meaningful setting, and an overly artificial writing style. They express regret for the time spent reading it and believe the book fails to deliver on its promises of being a compelling bully romance or a meaningful retelling of a fairy tale.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 1⭐️ (Originally rated 3 stars, but changed to 1 star after further reflection.)"

            "The characters in the novel felt absurd and unrealistic, with Nica standing out as the most frustrating aspect. Her incessant mental monologues were tedious and would likely translate into a dismal film. Communication was another hurdle for her, which was equally exasperating. Rigel was somewhat more bearable; he generally kept to himself, though his arbitrary comments instructing Nica to stay away didn’t help the situation. Norman, a minor character, piqued my interest, but I would have liked to learn more about him, such as his name and profession. While many on TikTok have labeled the relationship as toxic, I found it unremarkable and somewhat dull. The dynamic between Nica and Rigel wasn't the worst portrayal of a relationship, but it certainly wasn't the best either.",
            "I found this book to be quite dull. The pacing was slow, and for 400 pages, little of significance occurs. Then, everything happens at once, leaving no time to fully engage with any of the events. It could have benefited from being 300 pages shorter, which might have made it more tolerable."

            "I approached this book without reading the synopsis, initially feeling apprehensive as I suspected it might be a paranormal tale. However, it wasn't, which left me somewhat puzzled about the relevance of the Fabbricante di Lacrime (Maker of Tears) to the two main characters, Nica and Rigel.",
            "Nica and Rigel are orphaned teenagers who are effectively adopted together, yet they never converse during their upbringing in the same orphanage. Upon their first meeting, Rigel threatens and mistreats Nica, leaving her frightened at the prospect of living with him. After 400 pages, they inexplicably fall madly in love, with the story suggesting that Rigel's mistreatment stems from his affection—an unsettling interpretation that equates fear with love. Rigel views Nica as insignificant but claims to love her for it, which feels regressive in terms of feminist representation. Nica is portrayed as overly delicate, constantly bandaged from rescuing animals, yet she continues to eat meat, a contradiction that undermines her character. While Rigel is depicted as MALIARDO (enchanting), his toxic and abusive behavior raises serious concerns about their relationship dynamics.",
            "The book appears to have missed the mark in terms of proper editing, as the execution is quite lacking. Repetitive phrases, such as \"delicatezza\" and \"delicacy,\" are intended to lend it a literary quality, but they instead contribute to a decline in overall readability. Additionally, even the spicy scenes are weighed down by Nica's excessive introspection and an omniscient narration that feels out of place.",

However, its poetic language distinguishes it from typical romance novels. Themes of love, loss, and resilience are handled with remarkable sensitivity, showcasing the transformative power of love and the idea that individuals can serve as beacons of light during dark times. The story reveals layers of complexity and literary devices that may not be immediately obvious, making it surprising that younger readers, particularly 14-year-olds, are connecting with such a nuanced work. The depth of the narrative and the richness of the prose invite thoughtful reading and reflection."

The writing feels like it touches the soul, making it a memorable read.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**\n   - While marketed as a dark romance, the book doesn’t fully fit that label. It’s more accurately described as a “he falls first” story with romantic clichés, but the poetic language sets it apart from typical romance novels.\n   - Themes of love, loss, and resilience are explored with great sensitivity. The story emphasizes the strength of love and the idea that people can be someone’s light in the darkest times.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The book delivers a powerful emotional punch, leaving the reader in tears. The connection to the characters and the poignant moments in their lives create a deeply moving experience.\n   - Specific passages, like the one quoted, are heart-wrenching and beautifully crafted, showcasing the author’s ability to evoke strong emotions.\n\n- **Audience and Complexity:**\n   - The book is more complex than it appears, with layers of meaning and literary devices that may not be immediately apparent. It’s surprising that younger readers, like 14-year-olds, are engaging with such a nuanced work.\n   - The depth of the narrative and the richness of the writing make it a book that requires thoughtful reading and reflection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*El fabricante de lágrimas* is a beautifully written, emotionally charged novel that delves deeply into its characters and themes. Despite some pacing issues, the poetic language, profound dialogues, and emotional depth make it a standout read. It’s a story that lingers in the heart, celebrating love, resilience, and the connections that define us.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n5.0⭐"

            "The plot centers on a forbidden attraction, culminating in Rigel’s decision to leave his family to prevent further complications. However, the pacing suffers from repetitive elements, particularly the overuse of metaphors and the \"tearsmith\" concept, which lacks depth. Overall, the story could have benefited from being significantly shorter by eliminating these redundancies.",
            "The female protagonist is depicted as small, naive, and childlike, while the male protagonist, Rigel, presents as rough, broken, and morally ambiguous—ultimately cruel. His abusive behavior, characterized by yelling, grabbing, and demeaning treatment, stands in stark contrast to the female protagonist's romanticized view of him as her \"big bad wolf.\" This troubling dynamic suggests that their mutual dysfunction somehow makes them destined for one another. Rigel's decision to get adopted into the same family as the female protagonist intensifies their relationship, allowing his abusive tendencies to manifest within a quasi-sibling context. Their interactions, rife with tension and aggression, are misleadingly portrayed as passion, raising significant concerns about the nature of their bond.",

            "The plot held promise but was ultimately hindered by excessive drama and repetitive scenes. Key moments, such as the bridge incident and Peter's revelation about Rigel, felt contrived and contributed little to the narrative. Many chapters lacked meaningful events, often dwelling on Nica's repetitive descriptions of Rigel's allure and peril.",
            "Rigel is portrayed through an overabundance of wolf metaphors, leading to an absurd and tiresome presentation. While his character is both terrifying and charismatic, the justification for his violent behavior—a rare medical condition—feels inadequate and problematic. The romance between Nica and Rigel is toxic, characterized by abuse, emotional dependency, and unhealthy dynamics. The underlying message that two broken individuals are perfect for one another is deeply flawed and conveys a troubling perspective.",
            "The dialogue in the story is sparse and underdeveloped, with Nica frequently making assumptions about Rigel's thoughts without clear communication, which feels unrealistic. Additionally, the book's length is excessive; approximately 300 pages could have been trimmed. The narrative tends to be repetitive, reiterating the same ideas and metaphors, which makes for a tedious reading experience.",
            "I picked up the book in anticipation of the upcoming movie in April, drawn in by a promising trailer. Initially, the story captivated me, but as I continued reading, I found it increasingly challenging to stay engaged, to the point where I nearly set it aside."

While the romance adheres to the familiar Mary Sue and Bad Boy trope, it is executed with more skill than usual. However, the pacing is sluggish, causing the plot to drag on unnecessarily.",

Their dialogue in the first half of the book is repetitive and formulaic, while Nicandalf’s insistence on being \"different from other girls\" becomes tiresome. Although the secondary characters have potential, their development is equally disappointing. The introduction of a second love interest as a psychopath feels like a lazy narrative choice, lacking depth and characterization.",
            "The author is a standout talent from the Sperling/Salani catalog, showcasing genuine writing ability. However, the book suffers from its length and heavy content, as well as a tendency toward repetition and overly verbose language. The excessive use of metaphors and lengthy transitional chapters can make for a tedious read; many readers have even admitted to skipping entire chapters, a practice I now empathize with.",
            "The book romanticizes mental illness by depicting Rigel as a sociopath, a portrayal that is both inaccurate and unappealing. Additionally, the astronomical references are incorrect, reflecting a lack of research that is frustrating for those knowledgeable in the field. Furthermore, the misunderstanding of the distinction between favole (fables) and fiabe (fairy tales) is a significant oversight.",

This incoherence in narrative structure is frustrating and poorly executed.",

            "The story opens with an original fable crafted by the author, which I found delightful. I appreciate when writers create their own legends. The book tackles heavy themes such as abuse in an orphanage, trauma, and forbidden romance, but it navigates these topics in a way that exceeded my initial expectations. While the plot features several clichés reminiscent of 2016 Wattpad stories, they were integrated in a manner that didn’t make me cringe; some were even enjoyable. \n\nHowever, the book is unnecessarily lengthy, filled with filler content, particularly due to excessive metaphors and repetitive phrases. Despite this, I didn’t find it boring, as I appreciated the internal reflections and flashbacks. The ending, however, was frustrating. Just as the story seemed to reach a happy conclusion, the author revealed that Rigel had slept with his best friend to forget Nica. This twist felt unnecessary and poorly timed, as it could have been introduced earlier in the narrative.",
            "Nica, the protagonist, is a fragile and sensitive character who endures constant mistreatment and desperately needs saving. While I appreciated her love for animals and the depth of her traumatic past, her continual forgiveness and inability to assert herself became frustrating. Rigel, the male lead, is a brooding figure who loves Nica but expresses it through bullying and protectiveness. Their relationship follows the clichéd fragile butterfly and dark wolf dynamic, which feels overused. \n\nThe adoptive parents are a highlight of the story, especially the shy and endearing father. I appreciated the slow-burn romance between Nica and Rigel; however, it is fraught with issues, particularly in scenes where Nica attempts to resist Rigel's advances, only for him to ignore her boundaries. This dynamic feels uncomfortable, especially considering their age—only 17. While the character chemistry is well-developed, the persistent focus on Nica’s fragility and Rigel’s dominance became tiresome.",

While the internal monologues and reflections are skillfully penned and enrich the story, the recurring themes ultimately weaken their effectiveness."

While it has its flaws—such as excessive metaphors, repetitive themes, and problematic romantic dynamics—there were moments I genuinely enjoyed. The adoptive parents were a standout, and the slow-burn romance had its merits. However, the ending left a sour taste, and the constant infantilization of Nica was off-putting.",

While it has its flaws—such as excessive metaphors, repetitive themes, and problematic romantic dynamics—there were moments I genuinely enjoyed. The adoptive parents were a standout, and the slow-burn romance had its merits. However, the ending left a sour taste, and the constant infantilization of Nica was off-putting.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3/5 ★★★☆☆"

            "The story employs two distinct perspectives, often separated by an asterisk mid-page, which creates a chaotic reading experience and disrupts the narrative flow. The abrupt shifts between first-person and third-person narration feel jarring and illogical, further hindering the already weak pacing of the story.",
            "Nica and Rigel, the protagonists, are orphans burdened by traumatic pasts, but their backstories and relationships lack depth. The adoptive family, which could have added complexity to the narrative, is insufficiently explored. Rigel comes across as possessive and aggressive, yet he is framed as Nica's love interest, making it difficult to empathize with him. Nica’s character is equally frustrating; she repeatedly justifies Rigel’s toxic behavior and prioritizes his needs over her own well-being. The romance is clichéd and feels reminiscent of poorly crafted fanfiction, lacking both depth and emotional resonance.",
            "The writing, though overly pompous, remains grammatically sound, preventing it from being a total failure. The book could have benefited from some serious editing, as many chapters feel repetitive and contribute little to the overall narrative. This lack of conciseness detracts from the reading experience and causes the story to drag.",
            "The book addresses themes such as child abuse, but unfortunately, these are handled superficially and disrespectfully, which is both disappointing and infuriating. Additionally, the portrayal of bullying and toxic relationships lacks depth, resulting in a shallow representation."

        "conclusion": "While the book had potential, it ultimately falls short due to its chaotic narrative structure, underdeveloped characters, and poorly handled themes. The romance is clichéd and frustrating, and the story suffers from excessive length and repetitiveness. The only redeeming quality is the writing style, which, though overly elaborate, avoids grammatical errors.",
