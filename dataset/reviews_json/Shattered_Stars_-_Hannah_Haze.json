Her reactions to bullying feel underwhelming and lack depth, making her seem immature for her age of 20.

The slow pacing led to boredom, compelling me to skim pages just to reach the conclusion.

            "I absolutely love these characters. Spencer, Tristan, Azlan, Stone, Renzo, and Blackwaters are all compelling and well-developed. Spencer, on the front lines, undergoes a transformation into a werebeast during battle. Tristan is grappling with his issues but manages to combine magic with Spencer, surviving a near-fatal blow. Azlan is fantastic‚Äîhe buys her clothes, recognizes Spencer might be her fated mate, and is determined to pursue her. \n\nStone provides both emotional support and some steamy moments, teaching her magic control while acknowledging Tristan as her Fated. Renzo plays a pivotal role, killing Marcus when he defeated her in battle, although I remain skeptical of Marcus's death since there‚Äôs no body. He also transports her and Pip to her old house, proving he would do anything for her. Meanwhile, Blackwaters is aware of Spencer's connection, and the FMC grapples with heartbreak over Tristan. She still lacks her cloaking necklace and has disturbing visions of fires and battles involving dragons.",

            "I initially thought this series was a trilogy, so discovering it‚Äôs unfinished with a major cliffhanger is quite frustrating. After two and a half books, I appreciate the direction, but this installment felt padded with filler. The final chapters, however, were a standout. While I don't mind a lengthy story, I worry about it becoming predictable and repetitive if the pacing isn‚Äôt addressed. The plot remains ambiguous: Who are the true antagonists? Is it the westerners, the chancellor, or Tristan‚Äôs father? Are the conflicts rooted in the republican system, magic, or sociopolitical issues? I expected more clarity on these points.\n\nSeveral tropes, such as the seer, crimson magic, the locket, Rhianna‚Äôs family, her powers, and her aunt, feel underdeveloped. These elements are currently too vague to be compelling, but I hope they‚Äôre explored more deeply in the next installment.",
            "Rhianna's character stagnates, often lamenting her ignorance and perceived uselessness without demonstrating any meaningful growth. Her continued lack of knowledge about the world, her magic, and self-defense makes her appear more unintelligent than helpless.\n\nWhile Tristian and Spencer gain some depth, their relationship with Rhianna feels underdeveloped. Although she's willing to forgive them, I believe they need to show more contrition and better explain their actions.\n\nBarone, with his erratic behavior, adds little value to the harem dynamic, and I hope he evolves into a more nuanced character beyond his instability.\n\nIn contrast, Azlan and Stone are excellent; I genuinely enjoy their characters and their bond with Rhianna. However, I'm concerned that the group may become overly protective, hindering her ability to learn self-defense and assert her independence."

The portrayal of other female characters is unrealistic, as only Winnie treats her with kindness. \n\nThe male characters are underwhelming. Azlan is likable but lacks depth, while Stone is difficult to connect with due to the professor/student dynamic, though this relationship adds some complexity. The other three male characters receive insufficient development and fail to show meaningful growth or respect for Rhianna.

Tristan makes some effort but undermines himself by acknowledging his poor treatment of Rhianna. Spencer avoids his bond, and the assassin is forgettable due to minimal development.",

Rhi faces relentless bullying from Summer, who escalates her harassment after Rhi retaliates by using red magic when Summer steals her mother's locket. This locket turns out to be a cloaking charm rather than a love potion for Spencer and Tristan, heightening the tension.

Renzo, in particular, has completely captured my heart. He‚Äôs psychotic, masochistic, and absolutely unhinged, and I fall more in love with him every time we get his POV. With three mates down and two to go, I‚Äôm rooting for Tristan to pull through, especially since Rhi is struggling so much without him. I‚Äôm also eager to see how everyone reacts once they discover who all her mates are, especially the assassin‚Äîthat‚Äôs bound to be a shock.  \n\n- **Romantic and Steamy Scenes:**  \n  The romantic and steamy moments in the book are incredibly satisfying. The double POV scene was particularly intense, and I‚Äôm even more excited for the potential of steamy scenes involving three or more characters. Let the steamy times begin!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivers an epic cliffhanger, intense character dynamics, and satisfying romantic moments. The plot is building toward a chaotic and thrilling climax, and I‚Äôm fully invested in the characters and their relationships.

There are two sets of friends and an ‚Äúadorable psychopath‚Äù who don‚Äôt get along, which adds to the complexity.  \n\n- **Plot and Mood:**  \n  The mood of the story remains consistent even after the protagonist realizes her mates. The plot doesn‚Äôt become overly simplistic or predictable. The suspense aspect is thrilling and keeps the reader engaged.  \n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Scenes:**  \n  While there are intimate scenes, they occur at unconventional times, as is typical for this genre. However, these scenes don‚Äôt dominate the plot, which is a refreshing change.  \n\n- **Cliffhanger and Series Engagement:**  \n  The cliffhanger at the end of the third book is so compelling that it made me reconsider taking a break before diving into the last two books of the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis series is one of my favorite reverse harem (RH) stories. The narration, character development, and complex relationships make it a standout. The suspenseful plot and consistent mood keep the story engaging, and the cliffhanger ensures I‚Äôll likely continue reading the series without a break.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the spice has improved, it still falls short compared to other smut I‚Äôve read. The mystery surrounding the FMC‚Äôs identity and her inconsistent powers add intrigue but could be better executed. Despite these flaws, I remain invested in the series and eagerly anticipate the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

For me to enjoy the story, the bully must fully stop their behavior, give in, and grovel heavily to the MC. If this doesn‚Äôt happen, my interest in the book plummets, and I usually don‚Äôt finish it.  \n\n- **Character Development and Redemption:**  \n  In this book, I started to see some of the mates begin to change and show signs of redemption. While I typically prefer more immediate and extensive groveling, I understand that this is a 5-book series, so the slower progression makes sense.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  One thing I absolutely love about this book is the magic system. There‚Äôs a spell or magical solution for everything, including the intimate scenes, which usually require a lot more preparation (if you know, you know).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I have mixed feelings about bully romances, this book managed to keep me engaged with its gradual character redemption and its creative, magical world-building.

This character is smart, insightful, and adds depth to the narrative, making them a much more enjoyable presence compared to the FMC.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The story includes some well-executed romantic spice, which adds a positive element to the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has some redeeming qualities, such as the engaging best friend and a touch of romantic spice, the frustratingly dull-witted FMC and the tedious exploration of her magic significantly detract from the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (primarily for the romantic spice and the best friend character)."

While I enjoyed the previous books in the series, this installment fell short of my expectations, and I am unlikely to continue reading the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The hints about where the story is going in the larger scheme were epic and kept me invested.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Tropes:**  \n  The cute pig sidekick and the supportive best friend (especially in book 2) added depth to the story. The tropes, like fated mates and possessive growly men, were executed perfectly and kept me hooked.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute ride from start to finish. It built beautifully on the foundation of the first two books, delivering epic moments, well-paced storytelling, and deeper character connections. The cliffhanger has me desperate for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

So far, this is a really good series.  \n   - It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve read a good RH (Reverse Harem) paranormal book, which is usually one of my favorite genres, but lately, it‚Äôs been kinda meh.  \n\n- **Character Growth:**  \n   - The character growth has been really good with these guys.  \n   - Thankfully, by the end of this book, these guys have finally gotten their heads out of their butts with how they feel, but they sure have a LOT of groveling to do.  \n\n- **Bully Romance Dynamics:**  \n   - I knew it was a bully romance book, and it sure has been.  \n   - I‚Äôm irritated that Spencer and Tristian are still calling her ‚Äúpig girl‚Äù in their inner monologue. That better stop when they are mated because them still bullying her from here on out will irritate me, whether it‚Äôs to her face or in her mind.  \n   - Stone has dropped all animosity, so I hope they will too.  \n\n- **New Character Introduction (Renzo):**  \n   - I was not happy about Renzo getting thrown into the mix, but you can tell he is embracing the mate pull, even though he‚Äôs still battier than hell.  \n   - It‚Äôs giving Diesel from *Den of Vipers* vibes‚Äîcrazy and obsessed.  \n   - It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see how the other guys react to him joining the fray and how he‚Äôs going to act towards them since he has no ties to them and is completely lacking empathy.  \n\n- **Mystery and Foreshadowing:**  \n   - Something‚Äôs up with that pig. It‚Äôs way too human-like, so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll turn out to be some magical person.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book has been a great addition to the series, with strong character growth and engaging dynamics, though the lingering bullying and introduction of a chaotic new character (Renzo) add complexity. The mystery surrounding the pig also keeps me intrigued.

The engaging storyline and Hannah Haze's skillful multiperspective approach make it hard to put down, with smooth transitions between viewpoints that keep you turning the pages.
