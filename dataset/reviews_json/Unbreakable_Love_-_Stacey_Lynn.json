Their relationship blossoms through clever banter and tender moments as they explore their feelings and future together.",
            "In this touching story, Gavin, a young father who embraced parenthood at just 15 when his daughter Josie was born, has sacrificed typical teenage experiences to protect her. His wariness of relationships stems from a desire to shield Josie from potential heartbreak and from concerns that women may be drawn to him for his family's wealth and fame, particularly given his brothers' status as professional athletes and their expansive ranch. \n\nAs Josie begins to feel the absence of a mother figure and faces teasing at school, she takes it upon herself to find Gavin a wife and herself a mother. Her sights are set on Miss Penny Pesco, her new teacher—young, beautiful, and somewhat naive, with an optimistic view of people that isn't always warranted. Penny, having grown up in poverty and taken on a maternal role for her younger sister due to their mother's neglect, resonates with Josie's longing for family.\n\nThe supportive Kelley family plays a crucial role in helping Gavin raise Josie, and their close-knit, loving dynamic makes readers yearn to be part of their world. This book also overlaps with the timeline of the second installment, enriching the narrative with continuity and depth.",

            "The story follows Gavin, a teenage father raising his daughter Josie with the support of the Kelley family. The small-town, single-dad premise is engaging and full of potential. The introduction of Penny Pesco, Josie’s teacher and neighbor, adds an intriguing dynamic. However, the narrative sometimes lacks depth, particularly in exploring Penny’s backstory and motivations. Additionally, the romance between Gavin and Penny feels rushed, escalating from zero to a hundred in just a week, which strains credibility, especially considering their limited prior relationship experience and the presence of a child.",
            "Gavin is a devoted father who places Josie above all else, even his own needs. While Josie is an endearing character, her behavior and dialogue seem more fitting for a 5-year-old than an 8½-year-old. Penny, a selfless individual who has dedicated her life to caring for others, particularly her younger sister Maise, lacks a fully developed backstory, making it difficult to connect with her. In contrast, Maise shines as a standout side character, bringing depth to the narrative with her protective and supportive nature. The Kelley family is a highlight of the story, embodying endless love and support, making them both relatable and aspirational."

            "Gavin, a grumpy single dad, is fiercely protective of his daughter, and their tender moments together are heartwarming. Initially uninterested in love, his perspective shifts when he meets Penny, his daughter’s new teacher, and he can’t ignore the undeniable attraction. Despite his reluctance, Gavin deserves to find happiness. Penny, a beacon of positivity, has faced her own traumatic past but embraces life fully. I admire her dedication as a caring teacher, always attentive to her students' well-being. The story takes an exciting turn when she discovers that Gavin, the single dad of one of her students, is her new neighbor.",

He is very protective of his daughter, and I loved seeing the little moments between them. While he had no interest in finding love, that all changed when he met his daughter’s new teacher, Penny.

She has a traumatic past but doesn’t let that take away from living her life to the fullest. I love that she was a caring teacher for her students, paying attention to make sure they were all doing okay.
