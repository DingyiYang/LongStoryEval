            "The recent Dory/Cassie books feel somewhat directionless and untethered. While I appreciate the author's style of weaving multiple plotlines, the constant cliffhangers and prolonged story arcs can be frustrating. At times, it seems as if the narrative is being improvised. The last few Cassie novels were intense and controversial; although I didn't dislike certain plot choices—such as a character's rape or death—they ultimately detracted from my enjoyment of the story.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the development of Pritkin and Cassie's partnership, especially the revelation that Pritkin's soul has been split—KC certainly loves a soul split! The concept of Pritkin's incubus adds an intriguing layer to the plot. I was also pleased to see Alphonse make a welcome return, along with a new love interest for him. Æsubrand's unexpected appearance was a delightful surprise as well. I'm consistently impressed by how the author manages to engage me with a host of new characters.",
            "Transporting the story to faerie detracts from the enjoyable world established at Dante’s and causes us to miss out on numerous intriguing characters. However, it appears that the next book will begin on Earth, which is a positive aspect to look forward to."

KC loves a soul split, doesn’t she!  \n   - I do like the idea of Pritkin’s incubus and think it’s a really interesting plot point.  \n   - A reappearance of Alphonse, which was very welcome, and a new love interest for him it seems!  \n\n- **Plot Intensity and Controversial Elements:**  \n   - The last few Cassie novels were very intense and quite controversial.  \n   - While I didn’t hate the decisions made (e.g., Cassie being raped, Cassie dying), it nonetheless made the series less enjoyable to read imo.  \n\n- **Nostalgia and Familiarity:**  \n   - This one felt a little more like the older books in the series.  \n   - Cassie is still Pythia—I think a lot of us were confused about this after the last ending.  \n\n- **Action and Battle Scenes:**  \n   - Lots of quirky battle scenes, which Karen Chance is known for.  \n\n- **New and Returning Characters:**  \n   - Æsubrand’s appearance—unexpected but enjoyed.  \n   - I’m always impressed at how Karen Chance can make me invest in a whole load of new characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I did enjoy this book, especially the return to some of the elements that made the earlier books in the series so engaging.
