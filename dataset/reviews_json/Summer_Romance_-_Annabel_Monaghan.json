Despite being in a different stage of life (a grief-stricken mother of three), her personality, especially her enneagram one traits, resonated deeply with me.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  - The story is sweet and heartwarming, with a unique yet familiar premise. The idea of a chance encounter at a dog park, where Ali‚Äôs dog pees on Ethan‚Äôs shoes, is both humorous and endearing.  \n  - It‚Äôs an age-old story with a fresh twist, making it a perfect summer read.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  - The romance between Ali and Ethan is filled with chemistry, making it feel like an adult romance while still being closed-door, which I personally love.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The writing is engaging and lighthearted, with a tone that balances humor and emotional depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a delightful, sweet, and heartwarming read that perfectly blends humor, romance, and relatable characters. It‚Äôs an ideal summer book with a charming storyline and well-crafted chemistry between the leads.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to @netgalley, @putnambooks, and @annabelmonaghan for the ARC.

            "Ali Morris' life has unraveled since her mother's death two years ago, compounded by her ex-husband's request for a divorce on the one-year anniversary of her loss. Consumed by grief, she struggles to maintain her role as a mother while grappling with her own self-worth. At the start of the book, Ali is clearly depressed, going through the motions to keep her life and children intact. \n\nAs a protagonist, Ali is strong, relatable, and complex‚Äîqualities I appreciated, especially as a mother navigating life post-divorce. It's refreshing to see a character like her as the female lead in a romance, as stories often overlook such perspectives. Ali is caring and headstrong but deeply vulnerable, wrestling with her emotions while fearing loss if she opens her heart again. \n\nHer chance encounter with Ethan at a dog park ignites an unexpected spark. However, Ali is unsure how to start dating again after her failed marriage. I adored Ethan for his gentle, supportive nature as he helps coax Ali out of her shell. His commitment to her children and his transition from a high-profile law firm to public interest work only add to his charm. Despite the focus on Ali‚Äôs journey, the book also thoughtfully explores the toxic pressures Ethan faces in his own life, adding depth to both characters.",
            "In a romance novel, I look for strong characters, palpable tension and chemistry, humor, and engaging banter, but above all, depth and emotion. This book delivered on all fronts! I particularly appreciated its themes of grief and loss. It was evident that the author drew from personal experiences to portray these emotions poignantly, enhancing the authenticity of the story and its characters. I especially loved how Ali's conversations with her mother throughout the narrative helped her gradually heal from the profound ache of loss.",
            "This was the perfect summer romance for me! *Summer Romance* gave me all the best Emily Henry vibes. It‚Äôs an ideal read for the beach, offering a fun escape filled with warmth and sunshine. Not only is it captivating, but it also explores a variety of themes that keep you engaged. I couldn‚Äôt put it down and finished it in a day, highlighting numerous lines along the way. I can‚Äôt wait to revisit this delightful book!"

Yeah, that is my type of guy.  \n   - Ethan was so sweet, and I loved how as much as this book focused on Ali and her issues, it also explored the toxic pressure and tension Ethan experienced in his own life.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - What I look for in a romance book is a strong main character, the typical tension and chemistry between the leads, humor and banter, but most importantly, I want depth and emotion. Annabel delivered all of that in this book!  \n   - I also loved the overarching themes of grief and loss throughout this book.  \n   - I could tell that Annabel herself had experienced the loss of a close loved one by the way that she managed to capture the feelings of death and grief so poignantly.  \n   - I think it made this book and these characters seem so much more real.  \n   - I especially loved how Ali had conversations with her mom throughout the story and slowly healed from the wound of missing someone so much.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Engagement:**  \n   - I binged this book in a day, I highlighted so many lines, and I already am so excited to come back to this book and reread!!  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n   - Thank you so so much to GP Putnam and NetGalley for providing me with this advanced reader's copy in exchange for my honest review!!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a perfect blend of a fun summer romance and a deeply emotional exploration of grief, loss, and self-discovery. With strong character development, heartfelt chemistry, and poignant themes, it‚Äôs a captivating read that I couldn‚Äôt put down and can‚Äôt wait to revisit.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Despite a minor critique about the timing of the romance, the depth of the characters, the swoony love story, and the relatable themes make it a 5-star read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The novel has a beautiful, lazy rhythm, reminiscent of waves coming in and out, evoking the feeling of a summer vacation.  \n   - The pacing mirrors the themes of discovery and healing, creating a serene yet profound reading experience.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n   - The story is a journey of self-discovery, both individually and through the lens of another person.  \n   - It explores healing and finding strength in subtle, non-overt ways.  \n   - The characters‚Äô growth feels like uncovering what‚Äôs already there, rather than building something entirely new.  \n\n- **Use of Tropes:**  \n   - While the book employs familiar romance tropes (e.g., single mom, expiration date, best friend‚Äôs brother), it transcends them, adding layers of complexity and depth.  \n   - The author elevates these tropes to a level that feels fresh and masterful, making them far more than just a blip on the radar of typical romance novels.  \n\n- **Intimacy and Sex Scenes:**  \n   - The sex scenes are not explicit but are deeply meaningful, offering true insight into the intimacy and connection between the characters.  \n   - These scenes serve as a device to show the growth of the relationship and the individuals involved, rather than being included for the sake of being spicy.  \n   - The approach to intimacy is subtle yet effective, making it accessible to readers who may not typically enjoy explicit content.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The author‚Äôs writing is masterful, balancing simplicity with complexity, making the story feel both layered and effortless.  \n   - The ability to take basic tropes and transform them into something extraordinary is a testament to the author‚Äôs skill.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Summer Romance* is a beautifully crafted novel that combines a serene, summery atmosphere with profound themes of self-discovery, healing, and intimacy. The author‚Äôs ability to elevate familiar tropes and create meaningful, non-explicit sex scenes makes this book stand out in the romance genre. It‚Äôs a masterful work that I highly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Five stars. Highly, highly recommend."

            "After reconnecting with a man from high school whom she initially looked down upon, the protagonist discovers both love and her own identity. This character often embodies the \"reformed bad boy\" trope, where a flawed individual transforms solely through love. However, in this story, he is simply someone who, having struggled with his identity in high school and mingled with the wrong crowd, has matured over time. Despite his growth, he remains trapped in the perceptions of those from his hometown. The character development feels realistic and relatable, particularly as I appreciate authors who depict characters navigating their 30s and 40s. Ali, a soon-to-be single mother of three, grapples with her grief and the challenge of rediscovering herself after losing her identity in motherhood and an unfulfilling marriage. Her journey toward balancing authenticity, passion, and self-sacrifice is refreshing, especially in a genre where characters often swing too far in one direction while seeking identity.",

Too often, characters searching for identity end up swinging too far to one side of that pendulum.  \n\n- **Romantic Development and Character Growth:**  \n  - After running into a man from high school (who she didn‚Äôt think too highly of at the time), she both falls in love and remembers who she is.  \n  - In terms of the guy who she didn‚Äôt think too highly of in the beginning, in many books this kind of character is the ‚Äúreformed bad boy‚Äù who chooses to change just because he falls in love. That‚Äôs always a risky choice when it‚Äôs not clear if the maturity will stick. In this case, he‚Äôs just a guy who didn‚Äôt know who he was in high school, floated with the wrong crowd for a bit, and then matured; unfortunately, he ended up stuck in that place where people in your hometown or family members seem to never view you differently.  \n  - The changes the characters made were realistic and relatable to me.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Supporting Characters:**  \n  - The banter was genuinely witty and funny, not just between the two love interests but also among the delightful cast of family and friend side characters.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  - *Summer Romance* doesn‚Äôt come out until June, but I highly recommend adding this to your TBR now!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAnnabel Monaghan‚Äôs *Summer Romance* is a heartfelt and witty novel that delivers relatable characters, realistic growth, and a delightful romantic storyline.

She must have thought, ‚ÄúWhat is the most ridiculous, clich√©d meet-cute I can think of? I know! I‚Äôll have the gal‚Äôs dog pee on the guy‚Äôs foot.‚Äù Yeah, Monaghan, I see your eye wink.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n   - The one other Annabel Monaghan book I‚Äôve read was *Nora Goes Off Script*, which I liked very much. *Summer Romance* is similar in that it has a good dose of chick lit but is balanced well with an older couple romance.  \n\n- **Relatability and Writing Style:**  \n   - That's more relatable to me, but harder to write, I think, especially with the single-person POV.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity and Engagement:**  \n   - There is nothing overly complicated in *Summer Romance*, but more importantly, I was rooting for Ali and Ethan to have their happily ever after (HEA) from their (intentionally) ridiculous meet-cute.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Summer Romance* is a delightful read that cleverly pokes fun at romcom tropes while delivering a relatable and engaging older couple romance.

Unlike many books that focus on characters in their 20s discovering love for the first time, Ali and Ethan are in their late 30s, navigating a unique and often overlooked phase of life‚Äîcaught between youth and age. We need more stories featuring characters at this stage."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Relatability:**  \n   - I was pulled in immediately by the way Ali was grieving the loss of her mother and then her husband asking for a divorce on the one-year anniversary of her mom‚Äôs death.  \n   - This story was so deeply relatable, even if you aren‚Äôt in the throes of divorce. Ali was trying to find her [new] identity in the midst of raising kids, which is something a lot of people can relate to.  \n   - So many books center around characters in their 20s finding love for the first time, but Ali and Ethan are in their late 30s. It‚Äôs just a different phase of life. You‚Äôre not young, but you‚Äôre not old. You‚Äôre in this weird in-between. We don‚Äôt have enough books with characters this age.  \n\n- **Character Development and Journey:**  \n   - I loved reading her hesitant journey to find love again (or you could argue it was the first time) while she also balanced this huge change in her life.  \n\n- **Writing Quality and Pacing:**  \n   - Every interaction, scene, and conversation was perfectly written. I was completely absorbed in this story all day.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Format):**  \n   - The narration was also superb, and I was in a puddle when it all ended.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - This will be a top book for me, maybe even my top summer read (can‚Äôt declare that quite yet‚Ä¶still too much summer left).  \n   - So good. Format: audiobook (Audible - It‚Äôs on sale for a little over $7 right now‚Ä¶well worth the purchase instead of waiting several months on Libby.)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply relatable and emotionally engaging story about grief, identity, and love in a different phase of life. The writing is impeccable, the characters are well-developed, and the audiobook narration is outstanding. It‚Äôs a highly recommended read, especially in audiobook format.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

Their meet-cute at a dog park sets the stage for a charming and engaging romance.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Alice‚Äôs journey of self-discovery, finding her backbone against her ex-husband, and reconnecting with her family is well-portrayed. Ethan‚Äôs long-standing feelings for Alice add depth to his character, though I found it slightly hard to imagine them as a couple, partly because Alice seemed much older than Ethan in my mind.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship between Alice and Ethan builds naturally, and I enjoyed how Alice continued spending time with him even after realizing who he was. However, the age difference and Ethan‚Äôs long-term pining made their dynamic feel a bit uneven at times.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The story is cute and heartwarming, with a balance of romance and personal growth. It‚Äôs not overly romantic, focusing equally on Alice‚Äôs journey of self-discovery. The tone is light and perfect for a summer read.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  Fans of *Just For the Summer* by Carly Fortune will likely enjoy this book, as it shares the ‚Äúbest friend‚Äôs brother‚Äù trope and a similar vibe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful summer read with a charming romance and a strong focus on self-discovery. While I had some reservations about the age dynamic between Alice and Ethan, the story‚Äôs heartwarming tone and relatable characters make it an enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  - The book is a sweet and refreshing contemporary romance novel, akin to a \"jelly donut\" in its delightful and comforting nature.  \n  - It balances its sweetness with \"fiery sprinkles of feminism,\" adding depth and complexity to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  - The novel explores deeper, important topics such as women role-modeling behaviors for their teenage daughters, dealing with the death of a parent at a young age, and the challenges of returning home and feeling infantilized by family despite being in one's 30s.  \n  - It also delves into post-coming-of-age acceptance, focusing on the transition of children into adulthood.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The author skillfully juxtaposes two archetypes of men: one who is not overtly terrible but fails to listen, steamrolls conversations, contributes little to the household, and demands selflessness from female partners while prioritizing himself.  \n  - The other archetype is a man who has lived imperfectly but uses life lessons to grow. He listens, engages, commits, and takes action in his relationships.  \n\n- **Relatability and Personal Connection:**  \n  - I found myself relating deeply to the book, as it resonated with my own experiences and emotions.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - I absolutely loved this book and would highly recommend it to others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis contemporary romance novel is both sweet and thought-provoking, blending lighthearted charm with meaningful feminist themes and complex character dynamics. Its exploration of relatable life challenges and well-developed characters makes it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She has a unique ability to craft lines that instantly evoke emotion, making me tear up multiple times throughout the story.  \n\n- **Relatability of Characters:**  \n  I could relate to Ali so much. Her journey of navigating a divorce from a selfish partner, coping with the loss of her mother, and raising three kids felt incredibly real and heartfelt.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story was deeply emotional. I cried just 2% into the book and was still crying at 98%. The way the author portrays Ali's gradual realization that she had lost herself over time was both poignant and moving.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ali):**  \n  Ali's journey of self-discovery was beautifully written. Watching her slowly find her way back to herself, with the support of Ethan, was inspiring and heartwarming.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ethan):**  \n  I loved Ethan's role in the story. He was supportive and encouraging, cheering Ali on while allowing her the space to find her own path. Their dynamic showed how life can be better when you have someone like the other by your side.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I will recommend this book to everyone. It‚Äôs a must-read, and I urge everyone to add it to their TBR list.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and Penguin Group for providing the ARC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt and emotional journey of self-discovery, love, and resilience. Annabel Monaghan‚Äôs writing is exceptional, and the characters are deeply relatable.

This made her happiness even easier to root for.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  While the book is a swoon-worthy romance, it centers on Ali rediscovering and falling in love with herself, not just falling for a guy. The story also delves into themes of grief and the complicated emotions that come with losing someone you love.

It explores themes like dealing with grief in various forms and navigating the complexities of motherhood, which added emotional weight and relatability to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations by offering a rich, multi-layered story that balanced romance with profound themes of self-discovery, grief, and motherhood. The strong character dynamics and emotional depth made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The promise of a carefree fling didn't quite hold up, as the potential for heartbreak felt more real than expected.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75‚≠êÔ∏è"

Ethan‚Äôs character often came across as performative; his charity work felt more like a device to showcase his kindness than a true reflection of his personality, leaving me less captivated by him than I'd hoped. In contrast, Phyllis, Ali‚Äôs elderly and bookish neighbor, truly shone as a standout character. I adored her and would gladly help her organize her overflowing bookshelves if she ever needed it!",
            "This book resonates strongly, especially for those facing similar life challenges. Although I didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much as others may have, I appreciate its appeal and believe it‚Äôs worth a read if the premise intrigues you.",
            "This book aligns more with literary fiction than traditional romance, so it's important to manage expectations if you're seeking a typical romance narrative."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Summer Romance* by the author is a relatable story with a predictable plot and a focus on self-discovery. While I didn‚Äôt connect deeply with the romance or Ethan‚Äôs character, Ali‚Äôs journey and the delightful presence of Phyllis made it a worthwhile read. I‚Äôd recommend it to those who enjoy literary fiction with a touch of romance, though it may not satisfy readers looking for a more traditional love story.",

While romance novels often follow a familiar structure, this one was particularly easy to foresee from the first twenty pages. There‚Äôs comfort in knowing things will end happily, but the lack of surprises made it less engaging for me.\n\n- **Genre Expectations:**\n   - The book leaned more toward literary fiction than romance. This might be something to keep in mind if you‚Äôre expecting a traditional romance novel.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Ali, the protagonist, is a single mum dealing with divorce, grief, and raising three lively kids. Her journey of rediscovering her identity was relatable, though I felt her growth was overshadowed by Ethan‚Äôs influence rather than her own strength.\n   - Ethan‚Äôs character felt somewhat performative, especially his charity work, which seemed like a tool to highlight his niceness rather than a genuine part of his personality. I didn‚Äôt warm up to him as much as I‚Äôd hoped.\n\n- **Side Characters:**\n   - Phyllis, Ali‚Äôs elderly, bookish neighbor, was a standout. She was the best side character, and I absolutely adored her. If she ever needs help organizing her overflowing bookshelves, I‚Äôd gladly volunteer!\n\n- **Relatability:**\n   - The book oozes relatability, particularly for those navigating similar life challenges. While I didn‚Äôt love it as much as others might, I recognize its appeal and think it‚Äôs worth trying if the premise interests you.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *Summer Romance* by Annabel Monaghan is a relatable story with a predictable plot and a focus on self-discovery. While I didn‚Äôt connect deeply with the romance or Ethan‚Äôs character, Ali‚Äôs journey and the delightful presence of Phyllis made it a worthwhile read.

Ethan's long-term crush on Ali from high school seemed to be the primary driver of his interest, but Ali's character didn't offer much beyond physical attraction to make their connection believable.  \n   - Ali has clearly changed since high school, and the progression of their relationship felt unconvincing, as it relied heavily on Ethan's past feelings rather than a deeper, present-day connection.  \n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n   - The novel was an easy read, but it didn't leave a strong impression or \"knock my socks off.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel explores meaningful themes of self-discovery and life after divorce, the romance aspect felt underdeveloped, particularly in the portrayal of Ali and Ethan's relationship. The story was enjoyable and easy to follow, but it lacked the depth and emotional impact to make it truly memorable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I only finished it because it was the book club pick for the month.  \n\n- **Relatability:**  \n  The story didn‚Äôt feel relatable to me at all. The relationship problems between the main character and Pete, in particular, didn‚Äôt resonate with me.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ethan/Scooter):**  \n  Ethan/Scooter wasn‚Äôt portrayed as attractive or compelling. Some of his dialogue, like saying, ‚ÄúI remember your entire speech word for word,‚Äù came off as creepy rather than endearing.  \n\n- **Author‚Äôs Note:**  \n  The author‚Äôs note at the end was the part I liked the most. It felt genuine and added a personal touch to the book.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  I thought it was sweet that the main character maintained a relationship with her mom, which added a nice emotional layer to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book failed to captivate me. While the author‚Äôs note and the portrayal of family dynamics were highlights, the lack of relatability, unappealing character development, and overall boredom made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The main character (MC) demonstrates a lack of growth and resilience throughout the story. Despite her intelligence, ambition to return to work, kayaking hobby, and support from friends and children, she remains stagnant. Her only significant change occurs after sustaining a broken back, which feels unrealistic and undermines her potential for genuine internal development. Following a brief breakup with her love interest, she quickly reverts to her old self, indicating a lack of lasting character evolution. Additionally, her relationship with her mother is unhealthy; at 38 years old, she relies heavily on her mother for guidance. The dynamic with her romantic partner, Ethan, feels unbalanced, as he seems overly perfect for her, making his attachment feel implausible. The MC's failure to assert herself or model strength for her children is both frustrating and disappointing.",
            "The book's themes seem outdated, particularly in their failure to recognize contemporary mental health resources like therapy. The main character's journey to self-discovery feels contrived, relying more on external events than on genuine internal growth. Additionally, the author‚Äôs decision to name the MC's children after dogs is jarring and distracting."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book was a disappointing read for me. The main character‚Äôs lack of growth, unhealthy co-dependency, and failure to model strength for her children made the story frustrating and unrelatable. While the book attempts to explore themes of grief and self-discovery, it falls short by relying on unrealistic plot points and outdated approaches to mental health. Ultimately, this story serves as a cautionary tale rather than an inspiring or enjoyable read.",

            "The story struggles with a lack of significant events and progression. Much of the potentially compelling material, like the marital betrayals and the protagonist's mother's death, is already in the past when the book begins. As a result, the plot feels stagnant, resembling more of a bland epilogue than a dynamic narrative.",

Their romance progresses effortlessly, lacking any significant conflicts, as both characters are unrealistically perfect. Additionally, the constant emphasis on the protagonist's valedictorian status feels excessive and redundant.",

This intriguing setup prompted me to buy the book without delving into additional research or reviews."

The lack of plot development, overly idealized characters, and repetitive writing style made it a dull and unengaging read.
