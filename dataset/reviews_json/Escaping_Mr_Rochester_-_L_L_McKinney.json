            "In this reimagining, Jane is portrayed as both cautious and occasionally reckless, giving her a distinct personality that diverges from the classic novel. Rochester, while notably slimy and cruel, lacks depth; villains are often more compelling when they possess redeeming qualities, and here he feels one-dimensional. Bertha's transformation into a Black woman from New Orleans offers a refreshing perspective on her character.",
            "The alternate universe is captivating, but I would have appreciated more detail about its intricacies, such as race relations, the visibility of queer individuals, and the rise of Queen Amelia the Second. At times, the modern language contrasts with the historical setting, leaving certain aspects of the world underexplained.",
            "This novel brilliantly queers and diversifies Jane Eyre, a development I wholeheartedly celebrate. It challenges the original depiction of Rochester as a hero, instead emphasizing Jane's agency and her complex relationship with Bertha.",
            "This novel offers a refreshing, queer, and diverse reimagining of *Jane Eyre* that I find delightful. Set in an alternate history, it features a Black Jane, a queen Bertha on the British throne, and a significantly crueler Rochester. I appreciate the author's willingness to deviate from the original narrative; adaptations often thrive when they aren't bound to the source material. The love story is intriguingly reinterpreted, and side characters are either removed or reimagined—Helen, for instance, is no longer the perfect angel."

While I appreciate the originality and the focus on Jane’s agency, I wish the villain had more depth and the worldbuilding was more detailed. Overall, it’s a satisfying take on the classic, and I’m thrilled to see such creative reimaginings.",

Villains are more interesting when they have some redeeming qualities, and this version feels one-dimensional.  \n   - Bertha is reimagined as a Black woman from New Orleans, which adds a fresh perspective to her character.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n   - The alternate universe is intriguing, but I wish there was more explanation of the world’s details, such as race relations, the visibility of queer people, and how Queen Amelia the Second came to power.  \n   - The language feels modern at times, which contrasts with the historical setting and leaves some aspects of the world unexplained.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n   - The novel excels in queering and diversifying Jane Eyre, which I celebrate.  \n   - It challenges the original’s portrayal of Rochester as a hero and instead focuses on Jane’s agency and her relationship with Bertha.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Escaping Mr. Rochester* is a bold and refreshing adaptation of *Jane Eyre* that reimagines the story with queer and diverse characters.

            "This retelling shines a spotlight on often-overlooked female characters like Bertha and Adele, which I truly appreciate. Adele emerges as a fully realized individual, with her trauma treated with the seriousness it deserves. Bertha's magnificent anger powerfully underscores the historical tendency to dismiss women's rage as madness, particularly when it challenges the patriarchy. Reimagining Jane and Bertha as Black women adds significant depth, especially within the horror-like atmosphere of Thornfield Hall, evoking a sense of Jane as a Black protagonist in a horror narrative as she navigates the chaos around her. \n\nWhile the romance between Jane and Bertha is an intriguing concept, it feels underdeveloped. Their first meeting occurs halfway through the book, and given the story's brevity, their relationship comes across as rushed. Additionally, aging down Mr. Rochester seems inconsistent and unnecessary. Although Jane and Bertha are around 19, Rochester is only a few years older yet is portrayed as Adele's biological father, which creates a logical disconnect. I believe the story would have benefited from embracing Rochester's creepiness as a villain rather than attempting to soften his character.",

The reimagining of Jane and Bertha as Black women adds a fresh and compelling layer to the story.

The romance between Jane and Bertha took too long to develop; since they don’t meet until halfway through the book, their relationship felt rushed and lacked depth until the conclusion.",
            "The age dynamics between Jane and Rochester were perplexing. While Jane states that Rochester is only a few years older than her, his having a ten-year-old child suggests he is around 26 to 28, placing Jane in her early twenties. This inconsistency was quite bothersome.",
            "The story's setting left me confused, as it seemed to oscillate between our world and a *Bridgerton*-like alternate universe with BIPOC characters. Changing Bertha’s origin from the West Indies to New Orleans significantly affected the tone, the nature of her wealth, and the history of the Rochester family. This alteration felt like a shortcut that sidestepped thorough research and ultimately diminished the story's essence."

It’s one of my all-time favorite books, and I’ve even loved retellings like *Jane Steele* by Lyndsay Faye.  \n   - My deep familiarity with the original made it difficult for me to fully appreciate or engage with this retelling.  \n\n- **Characterization and Age Dynamics:**  \n   - The age dynamics between Jane and Rochester were confusing. Jane mentions Rochester is only \"a handful of years\" older, yet he has a ten-year-old child, which would make him around 26-28 and Jane in her early 20s. This inconsistency bothered me.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - I was unclear whether the story is set in our world or a *Bridgerton*-esque alternate world with BIPOC characters.  \n   - Changing Bertha’s origin from the West Indies to New Orleans significantly altered the tone, the source of her wealth, and the history of Rochester’s family. This change felt like a shortcut to avoid research, and it impacted the essence of the story.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n   - The split narration didn’t entirely work for me.

Since they don’t meet until halfway through the book, their dynamic felt rushed and lacked depth until the end.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - The narrator for Bertha’s chapters used a Jamaican accent for Jane’s lines, which pulled me out of the story multiple times.  \n\n- **Positive Aspects:**  \n   - Despite my criticisms, I genuinely liked the reimagined relationship between Jane and Bertha and the way the story brought them together to challenge Rochester’s abuse.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the creative reimagining of *Jane Eyre* and the relationship between Jane and Bertha, my deep familiarity with the original work made it hard to overlook the issues I had with this retelling.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  The novel takes another approach to *Jane Eyre*, portraying Mr. Rochester as the villain and introducing a romantic connection between Bertha and Jane. While the concept is intriguing and offers new ideas, the execution falls short of being convincing or well-written.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship between Bertha and Jane feels underdeveloped, with their connection coming across more as best friends rather than romantic partners. This lack of emotional depth makes the romance unconvincing.  \n\n- **Genre Appropriateness:**  \n  It’s strange that this book was marketed as Young Adult, as it doesn’t seem to fit well within that genre. The tone and themes feel mismatched with typical YA expectations.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  While the book isn’t bad and introduces some fresh ideas, the attempt to reinvent a classic story doesn’t feel necessary or impactful. The execution lacks the depth and polish needed to make the reimagining compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis reimagining of *Jane Eyre* has an interesting premise but struggles with execution, particularly in developing convincing character dynamics and fitting within its marketed genre. While it offers some new ideas, it ultimately doesn’t justify the effort to reinvent the classic story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 Stars"

Additionally, Bertha's abrupt decision to leave the house, only to be captured immediately, seemed illogical and poorly executed.",

            "The story's pacing is excruciatingly slow until the halfway mark, with Jane and Bertha not meeting until then, and Rochester remaining largely absent as a character.

This approach diminishes the straightforward, Gothic, and delightfully absurd essence of *Jane Eyre*, resulting in a rather underwhelming narrative.",

            "For roughly 80% of the story, I found the book to be merely satisfactory—not great. The plot surrounding Rochester felt simplistic and repetitive, leading to a sense of boredom. It took a long time for the two main characters to meet, and some plot points struck me as illogical, such as Bertha's failure to write the letter herself and Jane not clarifying her status at the party. However, the final 10% of the book was significantly more engaging and emotionally resonant, ultimately salvaging my overall experience.",
            "Bertha Mason is truly a wonder, and I felt a deep connection to her character. Although I was slightly disappointed that she was portrayed as an American rather than Caribbean, I understand the rationale behind this choice. However, I found the treatment of race and sexuality to be minimal, which left me wanting a more substantial exploration of these themes, especially considering Bertha's Jamaican origins. The romance only developed in the latter half of the book, but it was well-executed and added significant emotional depth.",

        "conclusion": "Overall, the book was good but not exceptional. While I had high hopes for this queer black reimagining of *Jane Eyre*, it didn't fully meet my expectations, particularly in terms of addressing race and colonialism. However, the latter part of the book, with its unexpected events and emotional depth, significantly improved my experience. Despite my quibbles, I would still recommend this book, as many of my criticisms are subjective.",

Notably absent is a discussion of the abuse's psychological impact, particularly on the child who commits patricide—a significant oversight. The plot centers on three women: a 10-year-old ward, a 23-year-old wife, and a 19-year-old governess, all striving for freedom from their manipulative and violent abuser, Edward. The novel explores themes of emotional neglect, physical abuse, gaslighting, and manipulation, making it a challenging read for those with personal experiences of domestic violence. The climax features the 10-year-old daughter killing her father, yet the narrative fails to adequately address the psychological consequences of this act.",
