            "This book is packed with drama, particularly involving Candi, a former bandmate from the first installment, alongside intricate details about the music industry, touring, and life on the road. At times, the abundance of information felt overwhelming, and I found myself wishing for a greater focus on character motivations rather than minutiae. As the Lillys prepare for their tour and gain popularity, the narrative shifts from Toni, the protagonist of the first book, to Kayla, the group’s drummer. The story delves into Kayla's upbringing under the strict expectations of her perfectionist mother, with music and drumming serving as her escape. On tour, she quickly bonds with Ty, their bus driver, who is also seeking refuge from his own struggles. However, the Lillys' rising fame threatens to upend both Kayla and Ty's lives.",
            "The relationship between Kayla and Ty is a central focus of the story. Their rapid descent into love after just a few interactions over two weeks feels unrealistic; I wished for a deeper, more developed connection before they proclaimed their feelings. However, as the narrative unfolds, they gradually grow on you. Both are quiet, reserved bookworms, and their shared tendency to shy away from reality makes them surprisingly compatible. Ty's endearing relationship with his Pop Pop, who raised him, adds warmth to the story, although his wealth feels somewhat contrived.\n\nBoth characters make frustrating decisions. Kayla's choice to join a band while being shocked by the realities of fame comes across as implausible. Meanwhile, Ty, though more likable, also avoids confronting his issues and could have improved his life years earlier. Their lack of foresight and reluctance to confront their challenges occasionally strained credibility.\n\nOn a positive note, the portrayal of a rock band led by diverse women is one of the book's standout features. I became invested in each member of the Lillys, and the representation felt both meaningful and refreshing.",
            "I received an ARC of *Girls with Bad Reputations* and was unaware it was part of a series. While I read the first book, I found it merely acceptable. With low expectations for the sequel, I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy it more than the first. However, it still didn’t become a favorite of mine."

I read the first book but didn’t love it—it was just fine. Going into this one, I had low expectations, but I ended up liking the second book a bit more than the first. Still, it wasn’t an all-time favorite.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  In this book, the Lillys are preparing to go on tour and gaining more popularity with each stop. While the first book focused on Toni, this one features Kayla, the group’s drummer. The story explores her life growing up under the control of her perfection-demanding mother, with music and drumming as her escape. On tour, she forms a fast friendship with Ty, their bus driver, who is also escaping his own life. However, the Lillys’ rising fame threatens to disrupt both Kayla and Ty’s lives.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Kayla and Ty’s relationship is a central focus. They fall head over heels for each other after only a couple of interactions over two weeks, which felt unrealistic. I wish their connection had been deeper and more developed before they declared their love. That said, they do grow on you as the story progresses. They’re both quiet, reserved bookworms, and their shared tendency to avoid reality makes them oddly suited for each other. Ty’s relationship with his Pop Pop, who raised him, is adorable, though his wealth feels a bit too convenient.  \n\n- **Character Motivations and Plausibility:**  \n  Both Kayla and Ty make frustrating choices. Kayla joins a band but seems shocked by the idea of fame and publicity, which feels unrealistic. Ty, while more likable, also avoids facing reality and could have improved his life years earlier. Their lack of foresight and refusal to confront their situations were hard to believe at times.  \n\n- **Pacing and Overload of Details:**  \n  There’s a lot going on in this book—drama with Candi, a former bandmate from the first book, and numerous details about the music industry, touring, and life on the road. At times, it felt overwhelming, and I wished the story had focused more on character motivations and less on these minute details.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The emphasis on a rock band fronted by diverse women is fantastic and one of the book’s strongest aspects. I liked each member of the Lillys enough to get drawn into the story, and the representation felt meaningful and refreshing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed *Girls with Bad Reputations* more than the first book in the series, but it wasn’t without its flaws.

            "The story is rich with themes, including band dynamics, Kayla's identity struggles, and Ty's personal journey. While these elements provide depth, they sometimes overshadow the romance. Improved pacing would have allowed for deeper romantic development and a more thorough exploration of Kayla's family issues.",
            "Kayla and Ty are intricate characters with compelling backstories. Kayla grapples with her secret identity as the inspiration for Little Miss Yolanda and her mother’s overpowering influence, while Ty faces the fallout from false accusations and his loyalty to his grandfather. Ty stands out as a charming, kilt-wearing, bisexual, and demisexual character, and his experiences resonate more deeply than Kayla’s. The dual POV format allows for individual and collective character growth, although Kayla’s family drama could benefit from more exploration. \n\nThe slow-burn romance is refreshingly rooted in authenticity and consent, which I appreciated. Kayla and Ty’s connection, fueled by their shared love of literature and alt-rock music, enhances the believability of their relationship.

The way Xio built the rock band world was fun and immersive.  \n  - The pacing was excellent; despite being close to 450 pages, it didn’t feel long and moved quickly.  \n  - I loved how the death of Kayla’s brother shaped her adulthood and how her growth with her parents was portrayed.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Kayla’s growth, especially in her relationship with her parents, was compelling. I was frustrated with her mother but glad they had a long-overdue conversation by the end.  \n  - Ty’s character was deeply relatable. His struggles in college and his quiet determination to keep his head above water made him endearing. His relationship with his grandfather was heartwarming.  \n  - The dynamics between Kayla and the other band members were well-developed, and I appreciated seeing more of their personalities compared to the first book.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  - Kayla and Ty’s relationship was sweet and natural. I loved how they bonded over reading and books, opening up to each other throughout the story.  \n  - The forced proximity of the tour bus created a perfect setting for their connection to grow.  \n\n- **Narration and Audio Experience:**  \n  - The audiobook narration by Tyla Collier and Benjamin Charles was outstanding. Benjamin perfectly captured the grandfather Van, and Tyla seamlessly transitioned between different female voices.  \n\n- **World-Building and Series Potential:**  \n  - The rock band world was vividly crafted, and I’m excited to see more of Kayla and Ty in future books.  \n  - The appearances of Seb and Toni added to the anticipation for the series’ continuation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute delight! The characters were well-developed, the pacing was perfect, and the romance between Kayla and Ty was heartwarming. The audiobook narration elevated the experience, and I’m eagerly looking forward to the next installment in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating was mentioned, but the review conveys a highly positive sentiment, suggesting a 5-star rating."

            "I absolutely adore Ty and Kayla, and their love story exceeded my expectations. Kayla, the drummer for The Lilly's, grapples with parental expectations while concealing her life from her high-achieving mother. Meanwhile, Ty, who drives the band's tour bus, is working to rebuild his life after being wrongfully accused of plagiarism and assault. Both characters are relatable and mature, with a relationship grounded in respect, kindness, and open communication. Ty is sweet, unapologetically himself, and shares a heartwarming bond with his grandfather. Kayla's journey of standing up to her mother and mending their relationship is profoundly moving. The book also features excellent BIPOC characters, queer and gender nonconforming representation, and a strong found family dynamic. The dual POV enriches the storytelling, adding depth to their experiences.",

            "The story's conflicts were overly dramatic and often felt unnecessary. For instance, Kayla's secrecy about her band and her parents' extreme reactions came across as exaggerated and unrealistic. The interactions between Kayla and her mom were particularly frustrating; it took too long for Kayla to assert herself, and her mom's disappointment felt overblown. The subplot with Candi was also unwelcome, adding to the excessive drama without offering any clear resolution. Additionally, the journalist's involvement in Ty's past and his attempt to discredit the band felt convoluted and ridiculous. Overall, the multitude of conflicts and subplots pulled the narrative in too many directions. Some elements, like Tiff's issues, would have been better suited for future books to maintain focus and coherence.",
            "Kayla and Ty's romance pales in comparison to Toni and Seb's from the first book. While their relationship is believable, it lacks the depth and challenges that made Toni and Seb's story so engaging. Kayla's parents, especially her mother, are problematic; her mom's racist and narcissistic behavior, coupled with her father's passive responses, creates unnecessary and frustrating conflicts. Ty's backstory is overly tragic, featuring an excessive number of dramatic elements—such as losing both parents and facing false accusations—that feel forced. The heavy-handed use of racism and sexism tropes detracts from the story's impact, with scenes like the music shop encounter, the racist woman at the bus stop, and the landlord in Philly feeling unrealistic. Kayla's mother's immediate belief in Ty's guilt based solely on his accuser's background is particularly distressing and underscores problematic attitudes within the narrative."

Ty, a quiet book nerd, shares an immediate and natural bond with Kayla, and their relationship is sweet and entirely consensual. The book effectively develops both Kayla and Ty as individuals, highlighting how their pasts and family dynamics shape them. Family is significant for both characters, but the band also serves as a supportive found family.

However, the pacing felt uneven, with the story dragging at times due to the simultaneous inclusion of too much and too little happening. The book’s length (over 400 pages) contributed to a bloated feel, which is unusual for contemporary romance.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Both leads, Kayla and Ty, are well-developed and likable.

The length and pacing issues are reminiscent of the first book, though the characters and their development are stronger here.  \n\n- **Standalone Potential:**  \n  The book works well as a standalone, even though it’s part of a series. Readers unfamiliar with the first book won’t feel lost, as the story is self-contained.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Girls with Bad Reputations* has its strengths, including well-developed characters, an authentic romance, and intriguing band dynamics, its pacing and length make it feel bloated at times.

While many books by Black authors focus on trauma, these novels (which also include love stories) offer a refreshing and much-needed perspective.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I was thrilled to receive the audiobook from Netgalley and Sourcebooks Casablanca. The experience of listening to the book was enjoyable and added a unique dimension to the story. The two narrators were exceptional, and I plan to explore more of their work in the future.  \n\n- **Plot and Focus:**  \n  I liked that the love story in the book wasn’t the central focus and didn’t feel forced. Instead, the narrative felt natural and engaging. The characters are incredibly likable, and it was great to reconnect with Kayla, whom I already knew from *The Girl With Stars in Her Eyes*. Ty is also a wonderful character, and both protagonists are portrayed as individuals striving to move beyond their pasts.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book is filled with fun and memorable characters. Ty’s grandfather, Van, was my absolute favorite. The supporting cast added depth and charm to the story, making it even more enjoyable.  \n\n- **Standalone Potential:**  \n  While this book is part of a series, it works well as a standalone. You don’t need to have read *The Girl With Stars in Her Eyes* to enjoy it, though there are minor connections, such as the subplot involving Candy. However, reading this book first will spoil some elements of the first novel, so readers can choose to double back if they wish.  \n\n- **Series Continuation:**  \n  I was disappointed that Book of the Month didn’t continue with the second Lilly’s book, especially since I loved the first one so much. I hope the next installment doesn’t take another three years to release.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I was delighted to revisit the Lilly’s world and catch up with the characters.

            "In this compelling story, Kayla, the drummer of The Lillys, an aspiring all-girl band, breaks free from her parents' expectations to pursue her own dreams. Balancing her two lives becomes challenging when a reporter investigates the band and its members. Enter Tyrell, the quiet new bus driver who often immerses himself in books. Despite his reserved demeanor, Kayla feels an immediate connection with him, and they quickly forge a friendship. However, Ty's troubled past—including a criminal record stemming from a false accusation—emerges as the reporter digs deeper, leading him to contemplate distancing himself from Kayla and the band. The heartwarming relationship between Ty and Kayla is a standout element of the story. Both characters have faced significant challenges, and their genuine bond adds depth and warmth to the narrative.",

Despite his reserved nature, Kayla feels an instant connection to him, and they quickly become friends. Ty’s past, including a criminal record from a false accusation by a girl from a prominent family, resurfaces due to the reporter’s investigation, making him consider pulling away from Kayla and the band.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story explores themes of personal growth, overcoming past mistakes, and finding love amidst challenges. It’s heavy at times, particularly due to Kayla’s loss of her brother, but overall, it leaves a giddy and uplifting feeling.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  Ty and Kayla’s relationship is a highlight of the book. They’ve both been through a lot, and their connection feels genuine and complementary. Their journey together adds depth and warmth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed this book! While it had its heavy moments, it ultimately left me feeling happy and satisfied.

It skillfully balances the challenges of rising fame with a sweet romance between Kayla, the drummer, and Ty, their bus driver. The manipulation by their record label and the tension with Candi’s band heighten the drama. The plot also explores Kayla’s hidden past and her struggle to reconcile her identity as a drummer with her family’s expectations.",

Ty, on the other hand, is bright, bookish, and caring, grappling with past academic struggles while being devoted to his grandfather. The Lillys form a strong and supportive group of women, each with distinct personalities that complement one another.

It doesn’t solely center on the relationship between Kayla and Ty, making it an engaging read for those who appreciate depth beyond the main couple. If you seek romances laden with steamy scenes and a singular focus on the protagonists, this may not be for you.

I was especially concerned because I haven’t been in the mood for romance recently, and I worried that might spoil my experience.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  *Girls with Bad Reputations* is a romance, but it’s much more than that. It also focuses heavily on other elements, such as family dynamics, career struggles, and band drama. The story revolves around The Lillys, a rock band, and their challenges, including label issues and a toxic rivalry with their former bandmate, Candi.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Kayla, the drummer and heroine, is hiding her music career from her family, particularly her highly accomplished and critical mother. Ty, the hero, is trying to rebuild his life after an unjust cheating scandal and arrest, and his relationship with his grandfather adds depth to his character.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  The story has a lot going on, and it works well. The plot isn’t solely focused on the romance between Kayla and Ty but also includes family, friendships, and external challenges. If you prefer romances that immerse you in the primary couple and include many steamy scenes, this might not be for you.

Both she and Ty, the band’s new bus driver, are endearing, bookish, and multi-dimensional characters. They grapple with the challenge of fully committing to their dreams while navigating the risks of publicity.

As Kayla aptly puts it, “Consent was so goddamned sexy.”",

The exploration of Kayla’s character and her family dynamics was particularly well-executed. I appreciated Ty’s quiet strength and his unapologetic authenticity. From their simple moments of relaxation with an audiobook to their fierce support for one another, I loved witnessing their personal growth and the deepening of their connection. The book features a bisexual male main character and a bisexual female main character, with the entire band being predominantly bisexual. It thoughtfully addresses themes of grief and the loss of family members.",

I absolutely loved this second installment of Xio’s slow-burn friends-to-lovers rockstar romance. The exposition into Kayla’s character and discussions about her family dynamics were particularly well-done.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Growth:**  \n  I loved Ty’s quiet strength and how unapologetically himself he was.

Kayla has dedicated herself to being the \"good girl\" to please her mother, but the pressure of meeting her mother's rigid expectations has been overwhelming.

It’s a wonderful continuation of the series.  \n  - As much as I adored Toni and Seb's story, Kayla and Ty also took a piece of my heart.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Kayla and Ty are such kind and sensitive people. Kayla has spent her life trying to be the \"good little girl\" to keep her mother happy, but the stress of living up to her mother's expectations was daunting.  \n  - Kayla’s mother discounted her own gifts because she was too blinded by her narrow interpretation of success. The book beautifully explores Kayla finding herself and owning her love and passion for music, even in the face of her parents' expectations.  \n  - Ty, on the other hand, has been jostled around in life and is also trying to find his way. He only has his grandfather and has faced challenges as a young black man who was falsely accused, leaving him with limited future options.  \n\n- **Romantic Connection:**  \n  - Despite both being in flux, Kayla and Ty are drawn to each other. Their souls seem to connect in a way that feels perfectly fitting.  \n\n- **World-Building and Series Potential:**  \n  - It was fun to be back in the world of the Lillys and see more of their lives.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Writing Style and Series Continuity:**  \n  I have been a fan of Xio Axelrod for several years. My introduction to her writing was *The Calum*, an absolutely awesome story. Her latest novel, *Girls with Bad Reputations*, is book two of her series *The Lillys*. The story continues seamlessly from the first book, introducing us to Kayla, a character we met earlier, and delving deeper into her life.\n\n- **Character Development and Complexity:**  \n  Kayla has a complicated life and a strained family dynamic. She lost her brother (also a drummer) when she was fifteen and struggles to fit into the life her controlling mother envisioned for her. Her parents are both rock stars in the academic world, and her mother especially feels that Kayla has not lived up to her potential. To make matters even more complex, her mother has written a series of books where a totally fictitious and perfect Kayla exists. As the Lillys’ star begins to ascend, Kayla is desperately seeking to keep her two lives separate.  \n  Tyrell, on the other hand, has returned home after a game-changing episode at college. He was wrongfully accused of plagiarism and assault. While he was cleared of all wrongdoing, the stigma of the accusation remains, and his reputation is in shambles. Tyrell has returned home to his grandfather, worried that his presence and his situation will bring him harm. He comes into Kayla’s orbit when he takes a job as the tour bus driver for the Lillys.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and POV:**  \n  I love that the story is told from two POVs, allowing readers to witness the beginning of Kayla and Tyrell’s tender and sweet connection. The dual perspectives enrich the storytelling, providing depth to both characters’ journeys.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The novel explores themes of identity, family expectations, and personal growth. Kayla must reconcile the life she is living with the one her mother wants her to live and decide if she wants the world to know the many parts of her story. Tyrell, meanwhile, must decide on his true vocation, completely clear his name, and be there for his grandfather while falling in love. Both characters are navigating life’s many curves, and their emotional journeys are compelling and relatable.\n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  The romance between Kayla and Tyrell is beautifully portrayed. They are both falling in love with each other, and their connection feels genuine and heartfelt. The challenges they face add layers to their relationship, making their love story even more engaging.\n\n- **Plot Complexity and Resolution:**  \n  Ms. Axelrod layers her story with many moving pieces, and they all come together in a rich tapestry. The plot is intricate but well-balanced, with each element contributing to the overall narrative. The resolution feels satisfying, tying up the various threads in a way that feels both realistic and hopeful.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Girls with Bad Reputations* is a beautifully crafted novel that delves into the complexities of identity, family, and love. Xio Axelrod’s storytelling is rich and layered, with well-developed characters and a compelling dual POV narrative. The emotional depth and intricate plot make this a standout read in *The Lillys* series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story centers on Kayla, an academic overachiever who defies her mother's expectations to follow her passion as a drummer in The Lillys, a burgeoning female rock band. She forms a connection with Ty, their tour bus driver, over their mutual love of books. As the band's fame grows, the media begins to intrude on their lives. The romance between Ty and Kayla is sweet and uplifting, as they inspire each other to discover their true purpose. The novel is enriched by strong themes of female empowerment and features commendable representation of LGBTQIA+ individuals and people of color, which I greatly appreciated."

This provides important context for *The Girl with the Bad Reputation*.\n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The narrators, Tyla Collier and Benjamin Charles, did an excellent job bringing the characters to life. Their voices fit the characters well, with standout performances for Ty and Kayla. The distinct voices made it easy to differentiate between characters. The pacing was great, and the narration flowed seamlessly with the story. The narrators and the author were perfectly in sync. The audiobook's flow was smooth, with clear chapter announcements and a table of contents that helped me follow along with both the e-book and audio.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story follows Kayla, an academic overachiever who rebels against her mother's expectations to pursue her passion as a drummer in The Lillys, a rising female rock band. Ty, their tour bus driver, connects with Kayla over their shared love of books. As the band gains fame, the press threatens their peace. The romance between Ty and Kayla is sweet and heartwarming, with both characters encouraging each other to find their purpose. The novel also features strong themes of female empowerment and includes LGBTQIA+ and POC representation, which I appreciated.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I highly recommend experiencing this book through both the audiobook and e-book formats. The audiobook allows you to adjust the speed and skip parts if needed, while the e-book helps you visualize the characters more vividly.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Girl with the Bad Reputation* is a beautifully written and narrated novel with a sweet romance, strong themes of empowerment, and excellent representation. The narrators brought the story to life, and the dual format experience enhanced my enjoyment. This is a must-read for fans of the series and newcomers alike.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

            "This story fell short of a 5-star rating for me primarily due to its lack of resolution regarding key plot points. While Kayla’s struggle with her mother’s expectations is explored, their reconciliation feels rushed and superficial, resolving neatly after just a brief conversation. The emotional weight of her brother’s death and the impact on both characters remain unresolved, as does the situation with Ty’s grandfather. Although we learn about the resolution of Ty's criminal charges, there’s a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the university issues and the reasons behind the girl’s accusations. The narrative introduces several complex themes, but while some are explored in depth, others are merely skimmed, leaving a sense of unfinished business. Additionally, the Candi drama seems unnecessary, feeling more like filler rather than an essential part of the story.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the first book and was eager to dive into Kayla and Kathy's story. In fact, I would love to see a book for each band member! The narrative is rich and thoughtfully written, showcasing a lot of depth. Kayla and Ty share remarkable chemistry, and I appreciated that the story featured more dialogue between them rather than relying solely on steamy scenes. This choice allowed their relationship to develop and mature, even within a short timeline. Both characters face their own struggles—each significant in its own way—and I admired how they supported one another. Family, whether biological or chosen, serves as a crucial theme in this story, emphasizing that love and connection transcend all definitions of family.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed Ty’s story, which powerfully illustrates the injustices faced by Black individuals. Kayla, raised in privilege, struggles with the estrangement from her parents, fearing that revealing her identity as a member of the Lillys will jeopardize her mother's lifelong work and children's publishing contract."

There’s a lot going on here, and it’s packed with thoughtful writing.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  I enjoyed Ty’s story, which highlighted the injustices of the system for Black people. Kayla grew up privileged and is estranged from her parents after fearing she will ruin her mother’s life-long work and kids’ publishing contract if she gets outed as a member of the Lillys.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry and Relationship Growth:**  \n  I think Kayla and Ty really had good chemistry. I liked that we get more conversation between them than steamy scenes because it fits and allows us to see them and their relationship really grow and mature, even if on a short timeline. They’re both struggling in their own ways—neither insignificant, just different—and I loved that they worked to support each other.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics and Found Family:**  \n  Family was a real connector and plot point in this story, whether it’s blood family or chosen/found family—it doesn’t matter; they’re all family.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution and Depth:**  \n  The thing that held this back from 5 stars for me was that there wasn’t enough tying up of the deep plots. We get a lot about Kayla’s pressure from her mother and how she perceives it, but we barely get Kayla and her mom’s heart-to-heart making things right. Then, it’s like *poof*, everything is right between them and the world after a 3-minute conversation. What about her brother’s death that weighed heavily on them both? We never get closure on Ty’s Pop-Pop. We get closure on Ty’s criminal charges but not about the university, and I really wanted more there, especially with why the girl told lies like she did. I think there were too many deep topics, and while some we dove into, some we just skimmed the surface, and it left me wanting.  \n\n- **Subplots and Filler Content:**  \n  Also, I’m not sure the Candi drama needed a place in this book.

The romance between Kayla and Ty, who meet when he becomes their tour bus driver, stands out as a highlight. The forced proximity trope is skillfully executed, resulting in a love story that feels both organic and swoon-worthy.\n\nMoreover, the narrative explores deeper themes. Kayla wrestles with her mother's expectations of Black excellence, particularly in light of an alternate, more docile version of herself portrayed by her mother. This nuanced exploration of their dynamic invites thoughtful reflection.\n\nTy’s storyline is equally engaging. Wrongfully accused of assault by a White classmate who cheated off him, he experienced jail time before being exonerated. The book sensitively addresses the complexities of his victimhood and the potential for further revictimization.

Ty, wrongfully accused, saw his career shattered but actively sought legal restitution, a pursuit I admired as he truly deserved justice. His grandfather, Van, was also a likable character. \n\nKayla's passion for drumming and her band shone through, though she carried the heavy burden of her deceased brother and an overbearing mother.

I couldn’t forgive her, and I was frustrated by her father's passivity in the situation. \n\nThe connection between Kayla and Ty felt profound, merging their souls long before their bodies. I appreciated that their relationship developed without initial lust; instead, they engaged in meaningful conversation and emotional bonding.

Kayla’s relationship with her parents, especially her mother, was the most thoroughly explored, but other themes felt underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Band Dynamics and Subplots:**  \n  The band dynamic had strong found family vibes, which I enjoyed. However, the subplot involving a former band member causing trouble didn’t particularly interest me. It felt like an overarching threat to maintain tension, but it didn’t add much to the story for me personally.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a compelling rockstar romance with a refreshing twist of having the FMC as the rockstar. The romance between Kayla and Ty was the standout element, while the exploration of deeper themes felt somewhat surface-level. Despite this, the book was enjoyable, and I appreciated the unique perspective it brought to the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (held back from 5 due to the lack of depth in exploring intense themes).  \n\nThank you to Sourcebooks Casablanca for the eARC!"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the story, but having just read a nonfiction book about the exploitation of girl groups, I was on edge, anticipating a dark turn. Thankfully, I recalled that Seb wasn’t a hidden villain, yet I still worried about him and Jordan. I’m a bit concerned about how they funded their nice van—hopefully, Seb isn’t mishandling their money, and they won’t end up like the Ronnettes or the Marvelettes. The multiple remotes for the bus kept me anxious as well, but in the end, everything turned out fine.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the romance in this book. The emotional barriers felt authentic, and the characters genuinely cared for one another, navigating difficult situations together. The found family dynamic was fantastic, and I particularly appreciated the beta hero and the complexity of the characters. There were no true villains present—Candi, while troubled, was too sad to fit that role. Seb, Jordan, and even Candi were well-developed and nuanced. I also admired Ty’s responsible choices, like refraining from texting while driving. The fangirling over LA Banks was both surprising and delightful.",

            "This novel offers an engaging blend of romance and adventure, centered on Kayla and Ty, as well as the all-girl rock band, the Lillys. While familiarity with the first book enhances clarity in the early chapters, each installment can be enjoyed independently. The narrative delves into Kayla's life as the band's drummer, exploring her complex family history and the challenges of maintaining her privacy amid family dynamics. The romance is just one facet of the story; equal focus is given to the band's inner workings, including tour logistics, PR strategies, sabotage from a former member, and looming deadlines.",

As a thoughtful student, he has endured victimization at university due to his race and perceived social status. Ty possesses a strong moral compass and hints at being pansexual, although this remains unspoken. Kayla is irresistibly drawn to him, and their relationship unfolds gradually, almost fading to black, resulting in a satisfying journey.\n\nThe novel excels in its engaging representation, showcasing a refreshing acceptance of differences among young characters, which is both intriguing and inspiring. The romance between Kayla and Ty is tender and subtle, emphasizing themes of caretaking, affection, and love, making their connection all the more endearing.

I appreciated how they confronted their pasts and navigated their relationships with family and friends, though some elements felt a bit cheesy. However, the romance between them was my least favorite aspect. While they shared some cute moments, I found the relationship lacked the angst and depth it needed. They transitioned too quickly from crushes to love, and with a 14-hour audiobook, there was ample opportunity to more convincingly develop their love story."

I'm definitely going to have to pick up the first book because I am so curious about Seb and Toni's story.\n\n- **Relatability and Themes:**  \n  This is a story for all the girls out there who have been told that they're too much, too loud, or not proper enough. I identified with Kayla so much. That fear and anxiety of letting your parents down and of the expectations of being a perfect daughter resonated deeply with me. Even when you know that you've already disappointed them, somehow it still matters. Doing what is right for you hurts/harms them, and so I really empathized with Kayla.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved how over the course of the book we get to see Kayla's relationships improve. She opens up to the Lillys and to Ty. Ty is such a strong, steady presence, and even though he had his own demons, I loved that they worked through them together.\n\n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  Highly recommend this book for lovers of rockstar romance, found family, and non-gender conforming MCs!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt and relatable story that beautifully explores themes of self-acceptance, family expectations, and personal growth. The characters are well-developed, and the relationships feel authentic and rewarding.

It took me a long time to power through, hoping I would eventually start enjoying it, but it just didn’t work for me.  \n\n- **Narration Performance:**  \n  The narrators did a great job with their own characters, but when they changed their voices to portray other characters, it felt cringe-worthy.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  It took everything in me not to stop listening early, but I decided not to quit this time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the narrators' strong performances with their main characters, the novel's pacing and lack of engagement made it a challenging listen. While I persevered, the overall experience was disappointing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I found myself reading it more out of obligation than enjoyment. Compared to the first book in the series, this one fell short, and I would only recommend it to those who enjoyed the first installment and are seeking more from the same universe.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2.5/5"
