The parents in these early chapters were almost unrecognizable compared to how they were portrayed later.  \n\n- **Missed Opportunities for Connection:**  \n  I hoped for a callback to the car-on-the-cliff scene, which could have provided a meaningful connection between the mother’s outlandish behavior and the brother’s mental illness. Instead, the explanation tied it to the incident with the neighbor, which felt unsatisfying and disconnected.  \n\n- **Character Portrayal and Cultural Exploration:**  \n  Titi Machi and the vivid portrayal of characters navigating Puerto Rican and American cultures were highlights. The cultural dynamics were well-captured and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Author’s Intent and Background:**  \n  Learning that the novel started as a research project and evolved into fiction to fill historical gaps was fascinating. The author, a historian, aimed to bring to life the stories of people from Woronoco in the ‘50s and ‘60s who could no longer share their experiences firsthand.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a strong start and excelled in its cultural exploration and character portrayal, the disconnect between the opening chapters and the rest of the story, along with missed opportunities for deeper connections, left me wanting more.

            "In this novel, Andrea Rodriguez's insightful narration adds significant depth to the story. The authenticity stems from the author's own experiences living in Puerto Rico and growing up in Western Massachusetts. The inclusion of Spanish words and phrases throughout the dialogue enriches the narrative, though readers may need to consult translations at first.",
            "Andrea’s mother, Raquel, exemplifies Toxic Mother Syndrome through her emotional detachment, abuse, and neglect. Her abandonment during a crucial period catalyzes the family's breakdown, placing the weight of responsibility on Andrea. The depth of Andrea's longing for maternal affection is poignantly conveyed through her observations of her friend Sally, whose mother embodies comfort and stability. In contrast, Aunt Cecilia—an empowered modern woman—offers love and strength to both Andrea and Pablo, highlighting the stark differences between her nurturing presence and Raquel's harmful impact.",
            "This novel juxtaposes the vibrant landscapes of Puerto Rico with the stark, isolated environment of Woronoco, Western Massachusetts. The family's misery is intensified by the absence of public transportation and Raquel's inability to drive, deepening their sense of isolation. While the natural world brings joy to Andrea and Pablo, it feels like a prison to Raquel, who longs for the conveniences of Puerto Rican life. Set against the backdrop of the 1950s Puerto Rican migration to the U.S. Mainland, which saw around 700,000 Puerto Ricans arrive by 1955 and 1 million by 1960, the story vividly portrays the cultural dislocation and identity struggles faced by Andrea and Pablo, who were initially unaware of their U.S. citizenship. Additionally, it emphasizes the significance of family and extended relatives in Puerto Rican culture, which profoundly impacts Andrea's life choices."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The Things We Didn’t Know is a compelling coming-of-age story that delves into the complexities of cultural displacement, family dynamics, and self-discovery. Through the lens of Andrea Rodriguez’s life, the novel offers a poignant exploration of the challenges faced by Puerto Rican migrants in the U.S. during the mid-20th century. The authenticity of the narrative, combined with rich character development and powerful themes, makes this a standout historical novel.",

I also want to celebrate the truly beautiful individuals who stood by them—Cecilia Martínez (Titi Machi), Aunt Caridid, and cousin Socorro. Without their support, it’s hard to imagine where Andrea and Pablo would be.",

It definitely ended up surprising me in the best way!  \n  - If you’re Puerto Rican, an immigrant, grew up poor, or moved around a lot growing up, this book is for you! None of those options resonate with me, and yet I loved this book.  \n  - I think a major privilege of reading books is getting to experience things you never have or ever would. This book gave me that and taught me many things.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  - First off, I wanted to strangle Andrea and Pablo’s mother. How dare she take them away from the only place they know and treat them the way she did.  \n  - Second, bless their father! He wasn’t perfect by any means, but he truly loved those kids and tried his best to give them and the rest of the people around him the life they deserved.  \n  - Third, thank goodness for truly beautiful people, inside and out: Cecilia Martínez (Titi Machi), aunt Caridid, and cousin Socorro. Who knows where those two kids would be if it weren’t for those amazing humans being there for them!  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  - There were many challenges faced throughout the story, such as language barriers, poverty, discrimination, assault, mental health issues, growing up earlier than planned, and many more. I learned a lot through these things being represented.  \n  - Themes included LGBTQI+, toxic mother, coming of age, family difficulties, and mental health representation.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Engagement:**  \n  - This book made me laugh, made me cry, angry, confused, disappointed, and even relieved. This wasn’t just a fiction story for me, and I really hope you give it a chance!  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  - The audio was fantastic too, so I would really recommend it either way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a surprising and impactful read for me, even though it wasn’t a genre I typically gravitate toward. It offered a deeply emotional journey through its characters, themes, and representation of real-life struggles. The audiobook enhanced the experience, making it a highly recommended read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5 stars)"

            "In this story, the young protagonist, Andrea, embodies innocence and naivety, contrasting sharply with the adult reader's understanding of the complexities surrounding her. This dynamic enriches the narrative. Machi emerges as a standout character, beloved by readers for her unwavering dedication to protecting the children, despite facing derogatory labels. Her depth and humanity serve as a compelling representation of Puerto Rican families, elevating the overall impact of the story.",
            "This book skillfully depicts Puerto Rican family dynamics, particularly through the character of Machi. While the use of derogatory language to highlight her otherness may feel uncomfortable, it adds a layer of realism. Machi's protective actions toward the children ultimately reveal her true character.",

This relocation marks the beginning of Andrea’s journey from childhood to adulthood, as she navigates the complexities of living between two countries and cultures. Set against the backdrop of the 1950s and 1960s, the story vividly portrays the cultural and societal changes of the time, particularly the tension between traditional Puerto Rican values and the emerging freedoms for women in America.",
            "Andrea's character undergoes significant evolution as she confronts the challenges of dislocation, cultural identity, and familial expectations. Her transformation from a carefree child to the de facto head of the household at just 10 years old is a central theme. Notably, her father’s character stands out; he represents traditional, conservative values that conflict with both the changing times and Andrea’s personal growth.",
            "The writing is vivid and authentic, successfully immersing readers in the conservative, tight-knit community that shapes Andrea’s journey. However, the prose can feel somewhat basic, a reflection of the author's status as a new writer. This simplicity, while sometimes charming, limits the novel's full potential.",

The driving force of the narrative was lost for me because I expected a lived story to hold more power and affirmation for real-life experiences.  \n\n- **Expectations from Fiction:**  \n  As fiction, I expect more exploration and drive, as the author has the creative freedom to go anywhere. However, this book felt mundane for the majority of its 320 pages. The story only sped up and wrapped up in the last 50 pages, which was unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  Despite my issues with the story, I must commend the writer for crafting an engaging and wonderfully written text.

These details not only enrich the narrative but also create a poignant connection to Andrea’s heritage.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nElba Iris Perez’s *The Things We Didn’t Know* is a compelling coming-of-age story that combines rich character development, vivid imagery, and powerful social commentary. Andrea’s journey is both emotional and inspiring, showcasing her resilience in the face of adversity. The novel’s cultural authenticity and historical depth make it a memorable and impactful read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This book shed light on the challenges faced by such families, especially the children who lack control over their circumstances.  \n\n- **Appreciation for the Book and Its Creators:**  \n  I am grateful to @thoughtsfromapage and Gallery Books for providing me with an advanced reader copy of this thought-provoking novel.

The author’s ability to craft vivid scenes and develop nuanced characters is commendable.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The portrayal of Puerto Rico and the 1960s U.S. is vivid and immersive.

A couple of twists and turns add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Authenticity and Research:**  \n  The book feels authentic, whether due to the author’s personal memory (if it’s autobiographical) or thorough research.

            "This coming-of-age novel follows a girl growing up in a factory town in Western Massachusetts, immersed in a Puerto Rican cultural community. While it centers on this particular setting, its themes resonate with any ethnic group facing first-generation challenges. As someone who grew up in Massachusetts during a similar time, I found the story especially relatable. The theme of maternal abandonment was particularly striking, adding depth to the narrative. Additionally, the novel powerfully addresses the struggles of first-generation individuals who often serve as interpreters for their immigrant parents. The protagonist’s early transition to adulthood brings emotional complexity to her journey, enriching the overall story."

These themes added depth to the story and made it thought-provoking.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, particularly Luis and Pablo, were intriguing, but their motivations and actions often felt unclear. Luis's protectiveness and Pablo's deviation from the expected path were compelling but lacked sufficient explanation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel delves into important themes and presents a rich tapestry of family drama and cultural conflict, the unresolved questions and lack of clarity in certain character motivations left me wanting more. It was an engaging read but ultimately left me with a sense of incompleteness.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel opens with 9-year-old Andrea and her brother Pablo being uprooted from their home in Woronoco, Massachusetts, and sent to a small Puerto Rican village to live with an unfamiliar aunt. This sets the tone for a poignant exploration of cultural dislocation and instability. As Andrea transitions from childhood to adulthood, the narrative delves into her struggles with identity and belonging while navigating the complexities of life between two countries and cultures. Set against the backdrop of the 1950s and 1960s, the story vividly illustrates the tension between traditional Puerto Rican values and the emerging freedoms for women in America.",
            "Andrea's character undergoes a profound transformation as she shifts from a carefree child to a responsible young woman weighed down by household duties and societal expectations. Her father's conservative views on gender roles create tension and conflict in her life as she matures. Additionally, her aunt, who challenges traditional norms by dressing and acting like a man while managing the family farm, introduces a compelling dynamic to the narrative.",
            "The writing is vivid and authentic, capturing the story's time, place, and culture effectively. However, the prose is somewhat basic, which limits the novel's full potential. While this may reflect the author's status as a new writer, there remains a strong interest in her future works.",
            "The novel explores themes of cultural identity, displacement, and the struggle for belonging in both Puerto Rico and America. It vividly depicts the conservative, close-knit Puerto Rican community and the challenges women face within it, particularly as societal norms begin to shift in the 1960s. Andrea's internal conflict—balancing her desire to please her father with her growing awareness of his outdated beliefs—adds depth and relatability to the narrative."

        "conclusion": "*The Things We Didn’t Know* by Elba Iris Perez is a poignant and authentic portrayal of a young woman’s journey through cultural dislocation, societal expectations, and personal growth. While the writing style is somewhat basic, the novel succeeds in capturing the complexities of identity and the clash between tradition and modernity. It offers a vivid and relatable exploration of a specific time and culture, leaving readers interested in the author’s future perspectives.",

            "The book struggles with lack of clear direction, feeling like three separate stories tangled into one. The initial narrative about the mother’s desperation while taking her two children to Puerto Rico is compelling and engaging. However, the abrupt pivot to a middle school bike-riding subplot feels disjointed and poorly executed. This section lingers for too many chapters without advancing the plot or developing the characters in a meaningful way.",
            "The story initially showcased promising character development, particularly with the mother and her children. However, this potential was abandoned midway through as the focus shifted to the middle school subplot. As a result, the original characters became stagnant and uninspiring, making it hard to remain engaged in their journey.",
            "The book falls short of the excessive praise it has received. It lacks a cohesive and engaging story, leading to frustration and disappointment. Promising elements introduced early on are abandoned, and the narrative struggles to maintain interest, particularly during the middle school bike-riding section, which feels unnecessary and tedious. The pacing suffers as too many chapters are devoted to a subplot that adds little value to the overall narrative."

The initial storyline about the mother and her desperation, taking her two kids to Puerto Rico, was compelling and engaging. However, the narrative took an abrupt and confusing turn into a middle school bike-riding subplot, which felt disconnected and poorly executed. This portion of the story dragged on for too many chapters, failing to advance the plot or develop the characters meaningfully.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters started with potential, particularly the mother and her children, but their development was abandoned mid-chapter. The shift in focus to the middle school storyline left the original characters stagnant and uninteresting, making it difficult to stay invested in their journey.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book struggled to maintain engagement, especially during the middle school bike-riding section. This part of the story was neither interesting nor worthwhile, and it felt like a waste of time. The pacing suffered as a result, with too many chapters dedicated to a subplot that added little to no value to the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Quality and Reception:**  \n  The book does not live up to the excessive praise it has received. It is not a good book, as it fails to deliver a cohesive and engaging story.
