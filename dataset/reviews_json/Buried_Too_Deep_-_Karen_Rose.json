            "The main characters are weak and uninteresting, leaving me indifferent to their fate, whether they ended up together or faced a brutal end at the hands of the villains. Speaking of villains, they were one-dimensional and uninspiring. Additionally, it's hard to believe that every character in a Louisiana setting was white and straight. I expect a reasonable level of diversity in my reads, as it reflects the real world.",
            "My interest in this book dwindled significantly, leaving me dead in the water at 70%. It's the most tedious read I've encountered in a long time‚Äîclich√©d, slow-moving, and as flat as a Saskatchewan highway. Honestly, I'd rather eat a bowl of plain cold instant oatmeal than continue with this. Thank you to NetGalley for the advanced copy. Out of sheer pettiness, I keep requesting Berkley ARCs because they often reject me, but they approved this one. Is this what it feels like to be hoisted by your own petard? Despite my frustrations, the book still looks appealing, so I remain hopeful.",
            "This serves me right for starting with the 30th installment of a series, but in my defense, NetGalley doesn‚Äôt provide that information. It seems this author caters to an audience at least forty years my senior."

They acknowledged their mistake in picking up a later installment in a long-running series but expressed frustration with the overall experience.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Structure and Complexity:**  \n   - The novel features a highly structured plot with numerous sub-plots, making it intricate and engaging to unravel.  \n   - The story goes in many directions, keeping readers guessing about the motives, even if the antagonist is revealed early.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n   - The romance involves two individuals searching for purpose, each carrying significant emotional baggage.  \n   - Phin Bishop and Cora Winslow are an unconventional pairing, with Phin being far from a traditional \"knight in shining armor.\"  \n   - While the pairing is interesting, it didn‚Äôt resonate with me personally.  \n\n- **Character Development and Continuity:**  \n   - Phin Bishop, a supporting character from *Alone in the Dark* (Cincinnati Series), is given a deeper backstory, including his struggles with PTSD and his journey to healing with the help of a therapy dog, SodaPop.  \n   - Karen Rose excels at revisiting minor characters from previous books, showcasing her skill as a writer by making these characters memorable even years later.  \n\n- **Antagonist and Suspense:**  \n   - The antagonist is revealed early in the story, which I found less appealing as I prefer the mystery of guessing the villain‚Äôs identity.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Holes:**  \n   - There are a few plot holes and inconsistencies, but they are minor and don‚Äôt detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKaren Rose delivers another intricate and engaging novel with a complex plot, well-developed characters, and a mix of romance and suspense. While the early reveal of the antagonist and the unconventional pairing of the main characters didn‚Äôt fully resonate with me, the story‚Äôs depth and continuity with previous works make it a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It feels over-the-top compared to the actual content.  \n   - While the description made me want to pick up the book, it set expectations that weren‚Äôt entirely met.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Phin, the male main character (MMC), is well-developed, with a compelling backstory involving PTSD from his military service and a traumatic event.  \n   - Cora Winslow, the female lead, is also deeply explored, with her own struggles and a mysterious past tied to family secrets.  \n   - The preacher and his grandson, Sage, add another layer of complexity, with Sage uncovering hidden truths about his grandfather and grappling with loyalty.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The first half of the book is slow, focusing heavily on setting the scene and character building. While necessary, it felt drawn out.  \n   - The pace picks up significantly in the second half, becoming engaging and hard to put down.  \n   - The thriller elements, including the shooting, stalking, and family secrets, are well-executed but not as pulse-pounding as expected.  \n\n- **Multiple Points of View (POVs):**  \n   - The author handles multiple POVs skillfully, ensuring clarity and coherence throughout the story.  \n   - The transitions between characters‚Äô perspectives are smooth and easy to follow.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - I genuinely liked the book and would recommend it to friends and family.  \n   - While it‚Äôs a worthwhile read, it‚Äôs not something I would revisit due to the slow start and unmet expectations based on the description.  \n   - I plan to read more books by Karen Rose in the future, as her character-building and plot development are impressive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKaren Rose delivers a well-crafted thriller with strong character development and a multi-layered plot. While the slow start and unmet expectations based on the description prevent it from being a 5-star read, the second half is gripping and engaging. It‚Äôs a book worth picking up, especially for fans of thrillers with emotional depth and intricate storytelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n   - The story begins with the identity of the killer already revealed, but the central mystery revolves around *why* the killer committed the crime.  \n   - Cora Winslow, a librarian, receives mysterious letters from her supposedly deceased father, sparking her quest to uncover the truth.  \n   - The killer is also searching for answers, particularly about who has been impersonating Cora's father and whether that person witnessed the murder 23 years ago.  \n   - The dual mystery‚ÄîCora's search for her father's truth and the killer's motives‚Äîkept me engaged throughout the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Cora is a relatable protagonist, transitioning from a quiet librarian to someone forced into a dangerous situation.  \n   - Phineas Bishop, a former military officer with PTSD, adds depth to the story. His emotional support dog, SodaPop, helps him manage his condition while he protects Cora.  \n   - The secondary characters, including Broussard and his team, are well-developed, though their backstories are tied to previous books in the series.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The pacing is excellent, with a steady flow that keeps the reader hooked.  \n   - Multiple points of view are used effectively, contributing to a cohesive and engaging narrative.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n   - This is Book 3 in the New Orleans series and #30 in Karen Rose's Romantic Suspense collection.  \n   - Despite being part of a larger series, the story works well as a standalone, with no prior knowledge of the series required to enjoy it.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The unique approach of revealing the killer early on while focusing on the \"why\" made the story compelling.  \n   - The blend of mystery, suspense, and character-driven elements made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a well-paced, engaging mystery with strong character development and a unique twist on the traditional whodunit format.

The dual mysteries and emotional depth kept me invested from start to finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Continuity and Starting Point:**  \n  I love the Romantic Suspense series and have read all the books. I started with the first Cincinnati book, featuring Faith and Deacon, which was #16 overall. I then went back and read the previous 15 books. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend jumping into the middle of the series. However, one could start at the beginning of a city‚Äôs storyline, as those stories connect well and are labeled on Goodreads.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  This story revolves around Cora, a librarian, and Phin, a veteran with PTSD, along with his service dog, SodaPop. The plot involves private investigators in New Orleans and a mystery surrounding Cora‚Äôs father, who she believed had abandoned her family but was actually murdered 23 years ago. Those responsible are trying to cover it up, forcing Cora to confront the possibility of betrayal by those closest to her. The story weaves together threads from the past and present, with Cora using her librarian skills and family knowledge to uncover the truth alongside the Burke team.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The beginning of the book is slow, but it picks up momentum as the story progresses, with events unfolding more quickly. The pacing allows for a balance between the mystery and the emotional journeys of the characters.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Cora and Phin are both dealing with personal struggles‚ÄîCora with grief and shock, and Phin with his PTSD. They are kind and supportive of each other, forming a strong bond as they work together to uncover the truth about her father‚Äôs death and the recent violent incidents. The Burke team is skilled in some areas but seems lacking in others, particularly in protection, which adds to the tension. Cora finds comfort in Phin‚Äôs competence and the presence of his service dog, SodaPop.  \n\n- **World-Building and Connections:**  \n  I enjoyed the updates on the New Orleans and Cincinnati families, as well as the addition of Cora and Phin to these interconnected worlds. The depth of the world-building and character development is exceptional, making the story feel rich and immersive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis romantic suspense novel delivers a compelling mystery, strong character development, and a well-crafted world that ties into the larger series. While the beginning is slow, the story gains momentum and keeps you engaged.

            "The author excels in crafting intricate crime narratives, as demonstrated by her impressive portfolio of over 30 police procedural novels. Each book is loosely connected, creating a cohesive mini-universe within various U.S. cities that enriches the reading experience.

In *Buried Too Deep*, the intriguing premise unfolds through a multi-layered, twisted crime that intertwines seamlessly with the protagonists' arcs. The author effectively explains the crimes without relying on convenient plot devices, maintaining clarity throughout. While the pacing of the procedural elements is strong, the romance subplot feels rushed, which is a slight letdown.",

For newcomers, I recommend starting with books like *Quarter to Midnight*, *Say You're Sorry*, or *Closer than You Think*.  \n  - A warning: most of her books involve children being victimized, though not directly depicted, as she doesn‚Äôt shy away from the darker aspects of the real world.  \n\n- **Character Development and Craftsmanship:**  \n  - Even a less standout Karen Rose book is well-crafted, featuring believably broken characters who heal over the course of the story.  \n  - She is a master of her craft and my personal favorite author.  \n  - The characters are incredibly likable (or hateable), and their motivations hold up well, especially for someone like me who reads a lot of nonfiction psychology.  \n\n- **Plot and Believability:**  \n  - The lengthy mysteries are incredibly believable, with only a minor critique of some main character plot armor.  \n\n- **Standalone vs. Series Context:**  \n  - This book works fine as a standalone, but Phin‚Äôs history with his family, shaped by his PTSD, begins in *Alone in the Dark*.  \n  - There‚Äôs a level of suspense built from seeing him as a side character in the New Orleans series, waiting for his turn to take center stage.  \n\n- **Emotional Resolution:**  \n  - The resolution of Phin‚Äôs relationships is emotional and reasonably well done.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this may not be Karen Rose‚Äôs definitive work, it still showcases her exceptional craftsmanship, believable characters, and emotionally satisfying resolutions.

It would have been more believable if she had to actively research information instead. On the other hand, SodaPop was my favorite character.

            "I dove straight into this installment from the previous one, and it was just as enjoyable. The only downside? The long wait for the next book! The story picks up where the last left off, with the team tackling a challenging and mysterious case that connects to earlier events. It‚Äôs great to see Val and Molly back in action, along with familiar characters. The investigation is dark, twisty, and filled with surprises that kept me guessing until the end. The author expertly navigates the plot's complexities, maintaining a fast pace and plenty of action. The balance between revisiting the past and confronting current dangers is skillfully executed.",
            "This book centers on Phin Bishop, the night watchman and maintenance worker, exploring his backstory to enrich his character. His compelling journey to return to the Burke Broussard Private Detective Agency after his own disappearance is engaging. The addition of his service dog, SodaPop, who helps him cope with PTSD, further deepens his character. The supporting cast is fantastic, making it easy to become invested in their stories. The interactions among Phin, Val, Molly, and the rest of the team enhance the narrative's depth and intrigue.",
