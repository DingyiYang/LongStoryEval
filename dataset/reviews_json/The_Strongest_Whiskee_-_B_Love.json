            "This fourth installment in the series feels more like a third, as the previous volume serves as a short omnibus that lacks depth regarding the male main characters (MMCs). *The Protectors* is a spin-off of *The Misters* series. While earlier books could stand alone, this entry emphasizes the growing importance of reading previous installments to grasp the main characters, their relationships, and their backstories. The author notes at the end that the next character's story will appear in another series, indicating that the two should be read in tandem for better context. Additionally, I found it puzzling that the author titled this book after the female main character (MFC), despite the narrative primarily focusing on the male character, who is one of *The Protectors*.",

However, readers unfamiliar with the series may struggle to fully grasp the dynamics between the main male characters. Overall, I enjoyed the book; the romance was well-crafted, the characters were engaging, and the medium heat level was satisfying."
