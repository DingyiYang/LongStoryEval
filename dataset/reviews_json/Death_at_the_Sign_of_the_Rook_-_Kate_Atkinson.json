I spent the entire time I listened to this book chuckling. The humor is a standout feature, which is a good thing because the plot setup takes its time.  \n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  Atkinson takes her own sweet time setting up the premise of this book. It’s more devoted to humor and characters than a strong plot. Don’t go into this expecting a straightforward mystery; it has a farcical feel to it.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Atkinson excels at crafting characters that come to life. A diverse group gathers at Burton Makepeace, a crumbling manor house, for a murder mystery weekend. We are introduced one at a time to those who will eventually be trapped together.  \n- **Mystery Elements:**  \n  Jackson Brodie is investigating the theft of a Renaissance painting from the home of a recently deceased old woman. During that investigation, he discovers similar thefts. In each case, the housekeeper/caregiver was the primary suspect, but neither the women nor the art was ever found.  \n- **Narration (Audiobook Specific):**  \n  I listened to this book, and Jason Isaacs did a great job with the narration.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death at the Sign of the Rook* is a humorous, character-driven novel with a farcical tone rather than a tightly plotted mystery.

The last two years brought *Shrines of Gaiety* (a 1920s period drama) and *Normal Rules Don’t Apply* (a collection of short stories), both of which were superb. Now, we have the return of Jackson Brodie in *Death at the Sign of the Rook*, the sixth installment in the private investigator/crime series, which is always a delight.\n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  From start to finish, this is a wonderfully fast-paced, comedic, thought-provoking, and eclectic crime read. The tone is sharp, with Jackson Brodie’s world-weary cynicism and wry humor shining through.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Jackson Brodie is described as \"a mess, a tsunami that would have defeated Marie Kondo,\" yet he returns in his own inimitable style. His interactions with DC Reggie Chase are filled with counterplay and hidden respect, making their dynamic a highlight. The inner thoughts of both major and minor characters are exposed with vividness, often leading to laugh-out-loud moments.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The plot revolves around the theft of two stolen works of art and the inhabitants of the Burton Makepeace estate. The dying aristocracy is lampooned beautifully, and there’s a clear nod to the cozy crime world of fiction, which Atkinson dissects with irony. The story is not traditional crime fiction but a literary novel that happens to feature crimes within its plot.\n\n- **Writing Style and Detail:**  \n  Kate Atkinson’s fantastical imagination and her ability to describe the minutiae of people’s lives make her books a pure joy. Every foible and eccentricity—from prayer groups to white sofas, undertakers, confused vicars, a quirky Lady of the Manor, and drama groups—is laid bare with an exacting eye for detail.\n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  The cast of unforgettable characters and the actions/interactions of Brodie and Chase make *Death at the Sign of the Rook* an unforgettable read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author’s Style and Skill:**  \n  I adore Kate Atkinson and have read everything she’s published. Her literary prose is superb, and in this crime series, she has such fun with the characters, scenarios, and plot lines. She is clever and articulate in her playfulness with words, creating outrageous and unforgettable situations that teeter deliciously close to old-fashioned farce and buffoonery. Her work is simply a joy to read.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This novel is a combination of Agatha Christie (Poirot and Miss Marple), *Fawlty Towers*, and *Upstairs/Downstairs* – a rip-roaring, hilarious tragicomedy that hits all the notes for a superb crime story. It balances devilishly sinister and mysterious elements with laugh-out-loud ridiculousness.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters feel like old friends, and Atkinson’s brilliant inventiveness and skill gradually bring them together accidentally and coincidentally. The cast includes Jackson Brodie, his old partner Reggie Chase, a fabulous country vicar, a damaged ex-army major, and various imperious aristocrats (some fallen on hard times).\n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The story is set in a crumbling, deteriorating country mansion in the English countryside, Burton Makepeace, which has been partially converted into a hotel offering “Murder Mystery Weekends.” The setting is richly atmospheric and plays a key role in the narrative.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The majority of the book follows Jackson Brodie as he investigates a seemingly insignificant crime of a stolen painting, which leads to a possible connection with a more valuable Turner painting stolen from Burton Makepeace. The plot is engaging and compelling, with chaos ensues during the Murder Mystery weekend, complete with dead bodies, guns, and weapons – real or props? The relevance of the stolen paintings adds intrigue.\n\n- **Humor and Wit:**  \n  The novel is filled with humor, stereotypes, caricatures, and sharp, witty one-liners. Atkinson strikes the right balance between sinister mystery and laugh-out-loud moments.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Themes:**  \n  The story teeters on the edge of farce and buffoonery, with ludicrously improbable scenarios that Atkinson manages to wrangle into a believable narrative. Themes of class, decay, and intrigue are woven throughout.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKate Atkinson’s *Death at the Sign of the Rook* is a masterful blend of crime, humor, and literary brilliance. With its quirky characters, clever plot, and delightful mix of mystery and farce, it is a joy to read. Atkinson’s ability to balance the sinister with the ridiculous makes this novel a standout in her already impressive body of work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This classic murder mystery set in Yorkshire delivers all the genre's essentials: a murder solved, thefts recovered, lovers reunited, and order restored. However, I found the resolution came too quickly, leaving me eager for more adventures with Jackson and Reggie in future installments. The story unfolds over a few days and reunites Jackson with DC Reggie Chase, the young woman who once saved him. Now studying to become a sergeant, Reggie reluctantly partners with Jackson to investigate the theft of a missing masterpiece from an aging stately home. The narrative features familiar archetypes from vintage country-house mysteries, including a hockey-stick-wielding termagant, a quirky vicar, a troubled war veteran, and the aging, gun-toting Lady Milton with her flawed aristocratic offspring.",
            "The third-person omniscient narration captivates with a tightly woven narrative that explores multiple characters’ perspectives. The characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional, reminiscent of a sophisticated version of the board game Clue (or Cluedo). The climactic resolution in the library over brandy is particularly satisfying.",
            "Set against the backdrop of Rook Hall, the Miltons host a Murder Mystery Weekend in a bid to make ends meet. Chaos ensues with a blinding snowstorm, an escaped convict, and a less-than-reliable skeleton crew. The humorous depiction of the house, cluttered with so many sofas that it feels like they're breeding when no one's watching, adds to the charm of the story."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Reputation and Series Continuity:**  \n  I love Kate Atkinson’s work, and this sixth installment in her Jackson Brodie mysteries had me squeaking with excitement. The BBC series is good, but the books are terrific. Jackson Brodie, a detective of sorts, has grown from a 30-something former cop into a man on \"the wrong side of sixty,\" but he’s not over the hill yet. His adventures have spanned the ridiculous and the heroic, often focusing on tragically lost and missing women.\n\n- **Plot and Genre:**  \n  This episode is a comic, classic murder-mystery romp set in Yorkshire over a handful of days. It reunites Jackson with DC Reggie Chase, the young woman who rescued him years ago. Reggie, now studying to be a sergeant, reluctantly teams up with Jackson to investigate a missing masterpiece stolen from an aging stately home. The story features stock figures from a vintage country-house locked-room murder mystery, including a hockey-stick-wielding termagant, a dotty vicar, a depressed war-vet, and an aging gun-toting Lady Milton with her flawed aristocratic children.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The action takes place at Rook Hall, where the Miltons host a Murder Mystery Weekend to make ends meet. A blinding snowstorm, an escaped convict, and a skeleton acting crew add to the chaos. The house is described humorously, with so many sofas that it feels like they’re breeding when no one is looking.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Character Development:**  \n  Atkinson’s third-person omniscient narration is a delight, offering a tightly-knit narrative that unfolds from multiple characters’ viewpoints. The characters are gracefully drawn and multi-dimensional, making the story feel like a sophisticated version of the board game Clue (or Cluedo). The inevitable denouement in the library over brandy is satisfying.\n\n- **Resolution and Reader Satisfaction:**  \n  As the genre requires, murder is uncovered, thefts are recovered, lovers are united, and order is restored. However, I felt it was all over too soon. I hope to see Jackson and Reggie back center stage in future installments.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sixth Jackson Brodie mystery is a delightful blend of humor, classic murder-mystery tropes, and richly developed characters. While the resolution is satisfying, the story leaves me eager for more adventures with Jackson and Reggie.

            "Atkinson skillfully weaves together multiple characters and storylines with impressive precision. Her memorable cast is a testament to her talent, even if she occasionally forgets their names post-publication. Jackson Brodie shines as a reliably decent figure, and I was delighted to see the return of Reggie Chase. I especially appreciated Lady Milton—though I can’t recall her first name—yet every character is a joy to encounter.",
            "The author is a clever writer who avoids showing off her knowledge. I often find myself researching the references she includes, like the Caesar shift in coding or the philosophical arguments for the existence of God. Rather than feeling inferior for my lack of familiarity, I appreciate the opportunity to learn from her work.",
            "This book is a delightful romp, brimming with humor. While I may not have caught all the references to other crime writers, I did notice playful nods, like dogs named Tommy and Tuppence and an actor impersonating a Swiss detective. These allusions are often hilarious yet always respectful, showcasing the author’s admiration for Agatha Christie. The only downside of such a captivating read is the wait for the next installment. I hope we haven't seen the last of Jackson Brodie, but in the meantime, I look forward to exploring her short stories."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Consistency and Reliability:**  \n  I always worry that a new Kate Atkinson book, especially a Jackson Brodie novel, won’t live up to her previous works. However, she has never disappointed me. She remains one of my favorite writers, and I’ve read almost everything she’s written, with the exception of one volume of short stories (*Normal Rules Don’t Apply*), which I plan to read soon.\n\n- **Writing Style and Intellectual Depth:**  \n  Kate Atkinson is a clever writer who doesn’t show off. I often find myself looking up references she includes, such as the Caesar shift in code or the by design explanation for the existence of God, but I never feel inferior for not knowing. Instead, I’m happy to learn from her work.\n\n- **Character Development and Handling of Multiple Storylines:**  \n  Atkinson is a deft and clever handler of multiple characters and storylines. Everything fits together with perfect choreography. Her characters are always memorable, though I’ve heard she sometimes forgets their names after finishing a book. Jackson Brodie is wonderfully dependable and decent, and I was thrilled to see the return of Reggie Chase. I particularly appreciated Lady Milton (whose first name I’ve already forgotten—was it Hermione?), but every character is worth meeting.\n\n- **Humor and Playfulness:**  \n  The book is deliciously funny, a real romp. I’m certain I didn’t catch all the references to other crime writers, but I spotted many playful nods, such as dogs named Tommy and Tuppence and an actor pretending to be a Swiss detective. These references were often hilarious but always respectful, reflecting Atkinson’s admiration for Agatha Christie.\n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  The worst part of reading a Kate Atkinson book is knowing you’ll have to wait for her next one. I hope she hasn’t finished with Jackson Brodie yet, but at least I have her short stories to explore in the meantime.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKate Atkinson’s *Death at the Sign of the Rook* is another brilliant addition to her body of work. It combines clever writing, memorable characters, and delightful humor, all while paying respectful homage to the crime genre. I eagerly await her next book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the author expertly develops these characters, revealing their lives in a charming and humorous manner, ultimately weaving them together toward the conclusion.",
            "I have long admired this author, having read nearly all her works. This latest book seamlessly combines the humor and slightly grumpy charm of Jackson Brodie with classic British elements, including a Downton Abbey-style manor, a murder mystery theater evening, and an Agatha Christie-esque mystery set in a snowstorm. It feels lighter in tone than previous Jackson Brodie novels; although there are a few deaths, they lack the gruesomeness of earlier installments. The humor is well-preserved, making it an enjoyable read. The characters embody quintessential British traits, featuring a vicar, a former military officer, and the lady of an old manor grappling with financial troubles. Overall, it’s a delightful mix that showcases the author’s strengths."

She's one of my favorite authors, and I've read almost all the Jackson Brodie books in this series. This book blends the humor and \"slightly grumpy private investigator\" vibes that Jackson Brodie usually brings, along with a mix of classic British elements like an old Downton Abbey-style manor, a murder mystery theater evening, and an Agatha Christie-style mystery in a snowstorm set-piece.  \n\n- **Character Development and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book starts with a brief intro of a group of people at a murder mystery performance, then backtracks to introduce various characters. Each chapter in the beginning introduces another main character or set of characters, eventually bringing them all together toward the end. At first, it can seem a bit confusing trying to keep track of everyone, but I love how Atkinson builds these characters and shows us their lives in a sweet yet funny way.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  This book felt a bit less dark than some of the earlier Jackson Brodie books. While there are a few deaths, there are no gruesome events compared to others in the series. The humor remains intact, making it a win-win. The story also feels very British, with characters like a vicar, a Major/former officer in the British military, and the Lady of an old manor house from an upper-crust family now running short on funds.  \n\n- **Standalone Enjoyment:**  \n  You don’t need to have read the other books in the series to enjoy this one. While there are some recurring characters, my memory of their backstory was fuzzy, but it didn’t detract from the experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved this book and found it to be one of my favorites in the Jackson Brodie series. It combines humor, classic British elements, and a well-crafted mystery with engaging character development. I highly recommend it!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "At first glance, this story presents itself as a classic Agatha Christie mystery, complete with all the quintessential elements: a blinding snowstorm, a deranged killer (who remains unrelated to the main plot), a theatrical production that blurs the line between play props and real-life evidence, and a sprawling mansion inhabited by 19th-century characters, including a skeptical vicar, a battle-hardened veteran, and a disgruntled former cop turned private investigator amidst the windswept, isolated moors. The mystery itself is engaging, with two intertwined thefts that add layers of complexity to the narrative.",
            "The characters in the story are vividly real and distinct. Among them are Jackson Brodie, who is investigating the theft of a painting from a nearby home, and Reggie Chase, a policewoman familiar with Brodie. She previously attempted, but failed, to catch the thief who stole a painting from Burton Makepeace. I suspect that reading the earlier installments would provide deeper insights into these characters.",
            "The story unfolds during a Murder Mystery Weekend at the once-grand estate of Burton Makepeace, where the family still resides in one wing. Due to a severe snowstorm, several planned actors and guests are unable to attend, forcing the hotel to substitute them with unexpected individuals who find themselves stranded by the weather.",
            "\"Death at the Sign of the Rook\" is the funniest mystery I've ever read. The humor truly elevates the book, making it a delightful experience. Anyone who enjoys humorous mysteries should definitely pick it up! The only downside I encountered was keeping track of the characters and their connections. I eventually made a list, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the story. Overall, it's an immensely entertaining read."

        "conclusion": "Death at the Sign of the Rook is a brilliantly humorous and engaging mystery that combines a classic Agatha Christie-style plot with well-drawn, individual characters.

The chapters alternate between multiple narratives, which can be disorienting, but each one is so engaging that it didn't diminish my enjoyment.",
            "I thoroughly enjoy Atkinson's characters. In this book, Jackson Brodie takes a backseat, allowing the strength of the narrative to shine through the diverse cast and their interwoven stories. The ensemble includes two families searching for missing paintings, a local vicar, a veterinary couple, and a group of actors hired to entertain tourists. Each character is well-crafted and engaging, though their abundance can sometimes be overwhelming.",

Each character is well-written and engaging, though the sheer number of them can be confusing at times.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The mystery revolves around missing paintings and family conflict, with plenty of twists to keep me guessing until the very end. While I did figure out the culprit(s) before the big reveal, the storylines are revealed slowly and tied together beautifully by the end.

He is hired by a brother and sister to find a painting they suspect was stolen by their mother’s carer.  \n  - Jackson’s old friend Reggie is investigating a similar case, leading to their reluctant collaboration.  \n  - The plot features many twists and culminates in a thrilling climax at a country house isolated by heavy snow.  \n  - While the plot is lighter compared to other Brodie books, it retains the same wry, often laugh-out-loud wit.  \n\n- **Characters and Voice:**  \n  - Jackson Brodie’s inner voice, including the “chorus of women” led by his ex Julia, humorously critiques his thoughts and prevents him from indulging in any prejudicial notions.  \n  - The internal voices of the characters provide a hilarious commentary on modern societal quirks.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The book blends elements of Agatha Christie, P.G. Wodehouse, and Jane Austen, creating a unique and engaging tone.  \n  - The humor and wit are consistent throughout, making it an enjoyable read.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - I loved the book so much that I immediately re-read parts of it and even revisited another book in the series, *Big Sky*.  \n  - I am very grateful to the publishers and NetGalley for providing a review copy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful blend of mystery, humor, and sharp social commentary. While the plot is lighter than previous Brodie books, it remains engaging and satisfying, with a memorable climax and well-crafted characters. The witty writing and Jackson’s inner voice make it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It’s quite different from the everyday crime, mystery, or whodunnit we’ve all read before.  \n- **Characterization:**  \n  Jackson Brodie is definitely not your average ‘cop turned PI.’ He's a somewhat quirky character with a tough guy exterior, yet inside, he’s a humorous, compassionate soul.  \n- **Plot Development:**  \n  What starts out as a humdrum case of a stolen painting quickly escalates into a case of multiple art thefts, along with a dead body or three. (One of which may be a fake, a product of a Murder Mystery Weekend production held at a very large estate turned hotel.)  \n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The story is filled with offbeat, eccentric characters. Reading these mysteries is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle; pieces are scattered here and there, and as the story develops, these pieces seem to fall into place on their own—well, maybe with a little help from a quirky P.I.  \n- **Enjoyment:**  \n  It’s always a delight to spend time with Jackson Brodie. Total fun!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis latest Jackson Brodie mystery is a delightful and engaging read, offering a unique blend of quirky characters, intricate plot twists, and Atkinson’s signature narrative style.

Set against a backdrop of decaying manor houses and dysfunctional families, it weaves a tale of stolen paintings, duplicitous household staff, a faithless vicar, a war amputee, and a cast of villagers, churchgoers, a detective, and a judge.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Consistency and Return to Form:**  \n  I'm a big Kate Atkinson fan, and I was a big fan of the first three Jackson Brodie novels. Numbers 4 & 5 were something of a letdown, but this one returns us to Atkinson in top form.  \n- **Character Development and Roles:**  \n  Brodie plays a much bigger role in this one, and the roles played by both Louise and Reggie are more satisfying than in the last two novels.  \n- **Plot Structure and Tone:**  \n  There's a line partway through the novel about the house being designed with enough doors for a French farce, and the final scenes of the novel really take on that character of farce. There's more humor (albeit dark humor!) than we usually get from Atkinson.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Expectations:**  \n  This was a very enjoyable read. Makes me more optimistic for any future Jackson Brodie novel.  \n- **Contrast with Other Reviews:**  \n  I read a review of this before it was actually released, and the reviewer was less than impressed, but I beg to differ.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel marks a strong return to form for Kate Atkinson, with a more prominent role for Jackson Brodie, satisfying character arcs for Louise and Reggie, and a plot infused with dark humor and farcical elements. It was an enjoyable read that has renewed my optimism for future installments in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Set against the backdrop of a murder mystery weekend at Burton Makepeace House, the plot unfolds like a play within a play, resulting in hilariously confused interactions among performers, guests, and the actual murderer(s). The story is enriched by early 21st-century themes, including an aristocratic family's decline, a soldier's injury in Afghanistan, a vicar's crisis of faith, and a middle-aged couple scheming over their inheritance.",
            "In this story, Jackson Brodie observes events with a critical eye, maintaining his central role while allowing other characters to shine. Simon, the vicar, stands out with a rich backstory that includes a connection to theological college, a career in television, and a moment of revelation in a York church. His sense of futility and internal conflict are particularly compelling. Ben, the ex-Major, is a graceful yet diffident character who downplays his struggles. His ties to Monte Cassino and his pivotal role in the resolution subvert the traditional doddering Major trope. Each character is fully developed and complex, capable of carrying their own narratives.",

As it turned out, I had no trouble figuring out what was going on. There were probably details that I didn't fully appreciate, but they weren't integral to this plot. I do feel that reading the earlier books would have given me more perspective on Jackson Brodie, who seems to be rather a pain in the arse. Despite that, I couldn't help liking him. I also very much liked Reggie Chase and would like to know how Brodie made her acquaintance. Perhaps I will backtrack.\n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  The book was complex enough to keep the little grey cells firing. It was like a Venn diagram, with three (four?) plots overlapping and interacting in interesting ways. Atkinson leads the reader on a merry chase, trying to keep up with her as she strews clues in her wake. Really intricate, fast moving, and very well done.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The many characters are well realized, amusing, and varied. Two stolen paintings, two investigations, a soldier with PTSD, a vicar who has lost his faith, an upper-class family trying to hold their estate together—it all comes together.\n\n- **Purpose of Reading:**  \n  I read this book to fill the Genre: Mystery square on my Bingo card.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel, despite being the sixth in a series, was engaging and easy to follow, though reading the earlier books might have provided deeper insight into the protagonist, Jackson Brodie.

The primary suspect is the former carer of the deceased owner. Simultaneously, Reggie Chase investigates the theft of a Turner painting from the stately home of Burton Makepeace.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  - The novel features a new case for Jackson Brodie, involving a missing Renaissance painting owned by a deceased woman, with suspicions falling on her former carer.  \n  - Reggie Chase investigates a similar theft at Burton Makepeace, an estate in financial trouble, where Lady Milton’s companion is missing.  \n  - Brodie suspects the two cases are connected, and the story unfolds during a murder mystery weekend at the estate, culminating in a chaotic reveal.  \n  - The mystery itself is not overly complex, and the resolution may not be surprising, but the journey to the reveal is entertaining.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - Jackson Brodie is portrayed as a laid-back yet insightful detective, with a familial bond to Reggie Chase despite her annoyance with his rule-bending.  \n  - The novel provides glimpses into Brodie’s personal life, including his relationship with Tatiana, which seems lukewarm.  \n  - Reggie Chase’s life and personality are also explored, adding depth to her character.  \n  - The supporting cast at Burton Makepeace is extensive and includes memorable characters like Lady Milton’s unpleasant children, Major Ben Jennings (a PTSD-stricken veteran), and Simon Cate (a mute vicar grappling with a loss of faith).  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The story is set in a manor home, evoking the feel of Golden Age mysteries, with a murder mystery weekend adding to the chaotic and absurd tone.  \n  - The estate’s financial struggles and the eccentricities of its inhabitants contribute to the novel’s unique atmosphere.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  - Kate Atkinson’s writing is rich with amusing details about the characters’ quirks and concerns, making the story engaging and often humorous.  \n  - The novel leans more toward character exploration than intricate mystery-solving, which may frustrate readers focused on solving a puzzle.  \n  - Atkinson provides insightful portrayals of the prominent characters, making the story enjoyable for fans of the Jackson Brodie series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Jackson Brodie novel delivers an entertaining mix of absurdity, character depth, and a light mystery. While the plot may not be overly complex, the journey is filled with humor, chaos, and insightful character moments. Fans of the series will likely appreciate the familiar tone and the exploration of Brodie’s world, even if the mystery itself isn’t the main draw.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Impressions and Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  The opportunity to read a new Kate Atkinson/Jackson Brodie novel was too good to pass up. However, this story is nothing like the previous Jackson Brodie tales. It felt a little slow to start, but I’m glad I stuck with it.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel opens with a gathering of individuals, including Jackson, in the library of a large house, reminiscent of an Agatha Christie novel. The setting becomes even more intriguing when Jackson and DC Reggie Chase end up at Burton Makepeace during a snowstorm, coinciding with a murder/mystery event.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The story introduces a collection of characters, each with a detailed background. At first, I assumed such depth meant they would play significant roles in the plot, and indeed, they do. Kate Atkinson’s clever observations and humor in these character bios not only make for amusing reading but also add depth to each individual.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot unfolds gradually, with Jackson’s progress on the case interspersed with his own amusing ponderings. The reunion with DC Reggie Chase, who is working on a similar case, adds another layer of intrigue. When all the characters come together, the story becomes even more engaging.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n  Atkinson’s writing is a delight, blending humor, mystery, and murder seamlessly. Her ability to inject wit and clever observations into the narrative keeps the reader fully entertained.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death at the Sign of the Rook* is a delightful read that combines humor, mystery, and murder to create a thoroughly entertaining story. While it starts a bit slow, the detailed character development and clever writing make it well worth the read. I highly recommend it to fans of Kate Atkinson and Jackson Brodie.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel begins as a typical Jackson Brodie tale, exploring his personal and professional life, but soon shifts into a captivating Golden Age country house murder mystery. The plot kicks off with the theft of a painting from an elderly woman's home, paralleling the theft of a Turner painting from a manor. As the story unfolds, it transforms into a complex, multi-layered mystery featuring a murder mystery weekend, a blizzard, and an escaped killer. Although the book starts slowly and introduces a dizzying array of characters, the background gradually becomes clearer, making the plot more engaging in the final chapters. While the initial pacing may feel overwhelming, the latter half accelerates dramatically, culminating in a fast-paced, comedic finale reminiscent of the game Clue. The tone shifts from serious mystery to humorous chaos, offering a satisfying payoff for readers who stick with the story through its slow build.",
            "Jackson Brodie, a former police detective turned private investigator, is the central character navigating a challenging life. His interactions with a diverse cast—ranging from old colleague Reggie, who significantly contributes to the investigation of the Turner theft, to actors, blizzard refugees, and criminals—add depth and complexity to the story. This lively ensemble creates a chaotic dynamic, particularly in the final chapters.",
            "Set in a manor house during a murder mystery weekend, the story effectively uses a blizzard to amplify tension and isolation. This atmospheric backdrop enhances the classic mystery feel, while the looming storm and the threat of an escaped killer elevate the stakes and create a palpable sense of urgency."

            "This story is a clever and almost farcical parody of an Agatha Christie novel, paying tribute to the Queen of Crime. Set in a dilapidated country estate-turned-hotel, it features a cast of Cluedo-esque characters, including an eccentric aristocratic family, beleaguered staff, a temporarily mute vicar, a PTSD-afflicted amputee major, a private investigator named Brodie, Detective Constable Reggie, and even an escaped convict. Their enforced confinement during a typical snowstorm heightens the chaos. To enhance the Christie atmosphere, the estate is also hosting a Murder Mystery weekend, resulting in a delightful mix of *Rook Hall* and *Fawlty Towers*.",
            "This delightful 4-star read has found a proud spot on my already overflowing bookcase, nestled among the author's other works in my exclusive independent bookshop edition. The humor is consistently excellent, often delivered in parentheses, with Lady Milton emerging as a standout character. The novel cleverly pokes fun at itself through literary references and breaks the fourth wall, sharing character traits and insights directly with the reader."

        "conclusion": "This latest Jackson Brodie novel is a humorous and clever homage to Agatha Christie, filled with eccentric characters, a chaotic plot, and self-aware literary references. While I thoroughly enjoyed it, I’m left wondering about Nanny’s fate. Overall, it’s a delightful addition to the author’s body of work.",

While most characters are well-developed and engaging, Simon, the minister, comes across as tedious, and Jackson Brodie himself feels somewhat peripheral, leaving me wanting more focus on his story.",

I was excited to see how this book compared to her other works and what the series had to offer.\n\n- **Initial Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book took me a bit to get into, partly due to messy formatting. Shifting between characters felt disruptive at first, but once I got a feel for the pacing, it became easier to follow.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  One of Atkinson’s strengths is her fantastic characters, and this book is no exception. The characters are richly developed with intriguing backstories, distinct voices, and unique personalities.\n\n- **Plot Development and Engagement:**  \n  Around 40% into the book, everything started to click, and the story took off from there. While the opening gives a hint of where the story is headed, the journey and ending were still very unexpected. I think the ending would have been even more impactful if I had read the previous books in the series.\n\n- **Plot Summary and Themes:**  \n  Jackson Brodie is hired to find a stolen painting linked to a missing caretaker. Along the way, he reconnects with Reggie, a DI he’s worked with before. The story weaves together a real-life vicar, army captain, marchioness, and a killer with a group of murder mystery actors whose fictional characters eerily mirror the real ones. The climax unfolds in a manor house during a blizzard, blurring the lines between art and life.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a slow start due to formatting issues, the book eventually captivated me with its rich characters, unexpected twists, and clever interplay between reality and fiction. Fans of the series will likely enjoy this latest installment, though newcomers like me might miss some nuances without prior knowledge of the earlier books.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Having read every book by her, including the entire Jackson Brodie series, I found it challenging to recall some characters like Louise Monroe and Reggie Chase, as well as references to Jackson Brodie’s family, since it had been a while since I read *Big Sky*. To fully appreciate this new installment, I would recommend revisiting the previous books in the series.\n\n- **Engagement and Style:**  \n  Atkinson’s Brodie books are consistently engaging, zany, and filled with wisecracking humor. They offer standalone fun with each new adventure, packed with twists and turns. While they are entertaining, they also delve into dark and disturbing themes, such as macabre murders, treachery, and madmen on the loose.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  *Death at the Sign of the Rook* delivers a theatrical murder mystery, complete with stolen artwork, family betrayal, and countless side jokes. The story is intricate and layered, making it a treat for fans of the series.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I highly recommend this book to big fans of Atkinson, especially those who love the Jackson Brodie series. However, I suggest revisiting the earlier books to fully immerse yourself in the experience. Additionally, I’m eager to watch the BBC series based on these books, which is now on my to-do list.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death at the Sign of the Rook* is another captivating addition to Kate Atkinson’s Jackson Brodie series, offering a mix of humor, mystery, and dark themes.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The novel is set in a small Yorkshire village and follows ex-detective Jackson Brodie as he investigates a missing painting. The story incorporates classic mystery elements such as snowstorms trapping characters in a mansion, dead bodies, missing guns, and a murder mystery dinner. The plot is solid and pays homage to traditional mystery writers like Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Atkinson employs a light and humorous touch in this novel, which differs from her usual style in the Brodie series. The tone is subtly British, and the narrative feels like a playful nod to the quaint mysteries of the past. However, the pacing occasionally drags due to the large cast of characters with stereotypical traits.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The novel features a diverse cast of characters, each embodying well-known stereotypes. While this adds to the humor and charm of the story, it also contributes to the slower pacing at times.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  Unlike the earlier Brodie mysteries, such as *Case Histories*, this novel is less of a traditional \"who-dunit\" and more of a lighthearted, fun mystery. It deviates from Atkinson’s usual style, offering a fresh take on the genre.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the occasional pacing issues, the novel is an enjoyable and fun read. It doesn’t focus on solving a complex mystery but rather on delivering a whimsical and entertaining experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death at the Sign of the Rook* is a delightful departure from Atkinson’s typical Brodie mysteries, offering a lighthearted and humorous take on the genre. While the pacing slows at times due to the large cast of characters, the solid plot and subtle British humor make it a fun and engaging read. Fans of classic mystery writers will appreciate the homage paid to the genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars.  \n\n*This ARC title was provided by Netgalley.com at no cost, and I am providing an unbiased review. *Death at the Sign of the Rook* will be published on Sept. 3, 2024.*"

While it can be read as a standalone, readers may encounter characters Brodie has met before. If continuity is important, starting with the first book is recommended.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The story revolves around Brodie being hired to investigate a 'stolen painting' by the children of a recently deceased woman. As he delves into the case, he uncovers inconsistencies in their story and connects it to a similar theft, suggesting the involvement of the same thief.\n\n- **Characters and Subplots:**  \n  The novel features a rich cast of characters, including a vicar who has lost his faith and voice, a major who has lost his leg and sense of purpose, and a formerly wealthy family converting their manor into a hotel to avoid selling it. These characters and their intertwined stories keep the narrative engaging and meandering.\n\n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n  The book balances its mystery with moments of humor, including laugh-out-loud funny scenes that add levity to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed *Death at the Sign of the Rook* by Kate Atkinson. It’s a cozy, meandering mystery with a compelling plot, memorable characters, and a perfect blend of intrigue and humor.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This installment takes a unique turn, presenting an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery performance. Initially, I was puzzled about how we would transition to the stately house murder scene, as it seemed like an outdated trope, and I couldn't picture Jackson Brodie engaging in something so mundane. However, by the end, the narrative transformed into a darkly comic farce, with Brodie's pointed questions and sarcasm irritating the other characters.\n\nThe central mystery revolves around art theft, though the plot does meander at times. The introduction of Carl WhatsHisName in the second half complicates the main mystery but injects much-needed action, danger, and drama that were somewhat lacking in the art theft storyline.",
            "I’ve truly missed the main character and never want this story to end. His sarcastic internal dialogue, cynicism, and protectiveness toward those who penetrate his tough exterior make him compelling. I also appreciate his relentless pursuit of truth and justice. \n\nIt was a delight to see Reggie and Louise Monroe again, and I would love to read more about the “Chase and Brodie Investigations” in the future.",

The references to Cluedo (or Clue, as we Americans call it) had me chuckling, as certain parts of the story evoke the game's spirit.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel is described as \"so British in its characters and inflections\" that it often evoked laughter. The setting captures the essence of a British aristocratic world, blending elements of a detective story with a Downton Abbey-like atmosphere.\n\n- **Satire and Themes:**  \n  The story satirizes the \"down-at-heels landed aristocracy attempting to cope with the modern world,\" highlighting their struggles and absurdities in a humorous yet pointed manner.\n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The murder occurs \"only toward the very end of the novel,\" with the majority of the plot focusing on the search for a \"charming art thief with a sense of justice.\" This unconventional structure keeps the reader engaged in the mystery and character dynamics rather than the crime itself.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Jackson Brodie, the \"perennial detective,\" is portrayed as the nemesis of the English police and even some of his clients. His interactions and the pursuit of the art thief add depth and intrigue to the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel masterfully blends British humor, satire, and detective fiction, offering a unique take on the genre. While the murder mystery takes a backseat, the exploration of aristocratic struggles and the captivating chase for the art thief make for an engaging and entertaining read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This sometimes made the narrative feel overwhelming and caused a bit of a head spin.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the occasional confusion with character introductions, I found the novel overall enjoyable and solid.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Jackson Brodie novel was a satisfying read, blending a cozy mystery vibe with a dramatic and fast-paced conclusion. While the sudden influx of characters in the latter part of the book was a bit disorienting, it didn’t detract significantly from my enjoyment. I’m grateful to NetGalley and the publisher for providing the advance reader copy.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

However, the slow pacing and overwhelming number of characters detracted from my enjoyment, and the ending left me feeling disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In the first half of the book, I found myself immersed in the lives of various characters, which left me wondering when the main plot would emerge. Although the prose was well-crafted, I occasionally felt bored by the lengthy digressions. Jackson Brodie, the detective, intrigued me; he was clearly intelligent, yet the plot centered on him taking a find-a-person case and uncovering inconsistencies in his employers' story. While the final reveal was both surprising and satisfying, I was disappointed by the lack of genuine sleuthing. Brodie's involvement in the resolution felt coincidental, as he likely wouldn’t have solved the case without the perpetrator explicitly laying out the details.

However, the style often digressed into side details that didn’t directly link to the main plot. While this added quirky layers to the atmosphere and world-building, it also made the pacing feel heavy and, at times, tedious.\n\n- **Plot Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The first 50% of the book felt like digressions into the lives of different characters, which made me wonder when the main plot would take center stage. I kept reading because the prose was well-written, but I occasionally felt bored by the tortuous digressions.\n\n- **Main Plot and Detective Work:**  \n  Jackson Brodie, the detective, perplexed me. While he was clearly intelligent, the plot revolved around him accepting a find-a-person case and then uncovering discrepancies in his employers' story. The final reveal was surprising and satisfying, but I felt let down by the lack of actual sleuthing. His presence at the reveal felt coincidental, and he likely wouldn’t have solved the case without the perpetrator explicitly explaining everything.

The twist involving Ben and Reggie was particularly engaging, though I was dismayed when the book briefly turned into an absurd comedy during Ben’s stint as a majordomo.\n\n- **Future Reading Plans:**  \n  I’m hesitant about reading the previous books but might try one more to see if the narrative style is unique to this installment or consistent across the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a skillful writing style and engaging humor, but its heavy pacing and lack of traditional detective work left me with mixed feelings.

The narrative occasionally lost focus on the crime itself.  \n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  I enjoyed the ending and found the resolution satisfying.  \n- **Foreshadowing and References:**  \n  I loved the foreshadowing and references within the book. Many elements were very well done and added depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book, my first by Kate Atkinson, which came highly recommended. While I had some difficulty keeping track of the characters and plot at times, the engaging characters, satisfying resolution, and clever foreshadowing made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

However, the murder itself occurred quite late in the narrative and involved a secondary character, making it feel more like a subplot to the main focus on the art thefts. Having not read the previous book in a while, I struggled to recall key details and character connections, which hindered my engagement with the story. The cleaner, who had previously stolen artwork from various country houses, returned to retrieve a forgotten piece, leading to her confrontation with an escaped prisoner who had committed a murder in the village. While the resolution was satisfying, the pacing felt uneven, with the murder happening too late in the story.",

However, the writing in this book felt so different from her other Brodie books that I suspect she might have hired a ghostwriter. What I loved about the previous books was the deep character development, the thoughtful writing, and the psychological undertow of Brodie’s past influencing the present. Unfortunately, almost none of that was present in this book.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jackson Brodie, a character I deeply admire (yes, I have a crush on a fictional character), was reduced to a minor role in this story. He was brought in occasionally to move the plot forward, provide a side story, or help solve the mystery. This lack of focus on Brodie’s character was a significant letdown.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was meandering, with lots of characters, and while it had some humor and was fairly entertaining, it didn’t captivate me like the previous books. The pacing felt off, and the story lacked the gripping quality that made the other Brodie mysteries un-put-downable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I was disappointed with this book.

The farcical tone at times added to this sense of over-the-top cleverness.  \n\n- **Tension and Climax:**  \n  The climax of the book successfully built tension through peril and suspense, which was engaging.

However, I found it somewhat unsatisfying, as the focus seemed more on eliciting laughter than on providing a satisfying resolution to the plot.

The book opens strongly, introducing a compelling array of characters, including a vicar who has lost his faith, an ex-serviceman grappling with PTSD, and a declining aristocratic family. This rich and detailed introduction resonates with me, even if it seems to have been overlooked by some readers."

In this sixth installment, \"Death at the Sign of the Rook,\" many of these characteristics are present, except for the development of Jackson Brodie's character, of whom we learn nothing new about his family and emotional life.\n\n- **Character Introductions and Depth:**  \n  The book begins very well for my taste, introducing a wide cast of characters: a vicar who has lost his faith, an ex-serviceman with post-traumatic stress disorder, and an aristocratic family on the decline. This introductory part is rich in detail and depth, though it seems to have been less appreciated by other readers.\n\n- **Central Plot and Intrigue:**  \n  The central plot revolves around the theft of some works of art, a subject that in itself is not particularly intriguing. It seems to be a pretext for bringing all the characters together, including Jackson Brodie. Despite this, Atkinson's interweaving of the individual stories remains admirable.\n\n- **Climax and Resolution:**  \n  The climax of the novel occurs at the end, where all the characters converge in one location during an evening of \"Investigate a Murder.\" This part is played out with humor and pays clear homage to Agatha Christie. However, it didn't quite satisfy me. I felt the ultimate aim was more to provoke laughter than to resolve the plot in a satisfactory way.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Disappointment:**  \n  Although the author's quality is evident, I found this installment a little disappointing. The lack of development in Brodie's personal life and a central plot that I didn't find intriguing enough meant that I didn't enjoy the novel as much as I had hoped. However, Atkinson's ability to create complex characters and lively situations is still evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn summary, while Kate Atkinson's narrative skill and character creation remain strong, this installment fell short of my expectations due to the lack of development in Jackson Brodie's personal life and a central plot that lacked sufficient intrigue. Despite these shortcomings, the novel still showcases Atkinson's talent for weaving complex stories and characters.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story revolves around the theft of a potentially valuable painting, echoing a similar incident from years past, rather than a murder. However, chaos ensues during the murder mystery weekend, where an absurdly poor script, set against the backdrop of an epic snowstorm, shifts the tone from humor to broad satire, ultimately feeling more annoying than funny. While the mysteries are resolved, the execution left much to be desired.",
            "Jackson Brodie is an unconventional investigator guided by a strong moral compass that often diverges from the law. The glimpses we get into Brodie's relationships and past struggles are so lightly sketched that they feel almost out of place. His Russian spy girlfriend seems more like an odd distraction than a meaningful addition. While other central characters—Reggie, Simon, Ben, and Lady Milton—are vividly portrayed, they lack the depth of development seen in Brodie and Reggie. Each character grapples with their own isolation and scars, but their storylines do not receive the same attention, leaving them feeling somewhat incomplete.",
            "The author’s amiable style brings a light touch to potentially heavy subjects, skillfully capturing the slightly spooky, comical, and decrepit settings. However, I found that the poignant quality present in the earlier writing diminished as the story progressed.",

However, I appreciated Atkinson's writing style and would be open to exploring earlier books in the series, hoping they might offer a more enjoyable experience."

I returned the book—a brand-new library loan—for someone else to enjoy, as there was a long waiting list. The murder mystery weekends and the setting of Burton Makepeace, a dusty old country house, felt like a farcical depiction of stiff-upper-lip British characters from a sitcom. I expected more depth. The subplots involving George and Fran making marmalade, a mysterious portrait, and a loyal Labrador were intended to create intrigue, but I found them unengaging. The narrative's frequent shifts between characters' perspectives, perhaps meant to maintain interest, ultimately left me feeling fatigued. Elements like the snow struggle, cognac in the Land Rover, the Latin motto, and the repetitive chapter charades felt uninspired.

These characters, though well-developed, contribute to a crowded and somewhat chaotic narrative.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book blends elements of spoof and farce, with a swirling vortex of characters and actual murders.

The narrative switches back and forth between Jackson Brody’s current investigation and Reggie’s investigation from two years ago, along with a couple of other main characters. I struggled to keep the two painting theft stories straight.  \n\n- **Literary References and Parody:**  \n  The book seems to poke fun at Agatha Christie and Victoria Holt. Like in Holt’s books, the house is treated as a character here. There are also many inside jokes and references to other books, some of which I understood, but others felt like they required a British cultural context. I could tell some references were going over my head. Overall, I think the book is a parody of at least two other mystery writers.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Resolution:**  \n  I liked how Kate Atkinson brought all the characters together organically, rather than having the police summon them.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author’s Skill and Style:**  \n  Kate Atkinson is a fine writer with a diverse range of work, from literary novels like “A God in Ruins” to the beloved Jackson Brodie detective series. Her new book, “Death at the Sign of the Rook,” continues this series with a humorous, albeit somewhat light, nod to the Agatha Christie tradition.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The novel is packed with characters, including a faithless and voiceless vicar, an ex-army officer who lost a leg in Afghanistan, an art thief, struggling aristocrats, a murderer, and, of course, several bodies. The story begins with an invitation to a “Murder Mystery Weekend” at Burton Makepeace, a grand manor house partially converted into a hotel. While a real drama unfolds, a group of amateur actors performs their own clumsy drama for the guests. A blizzard traps everyone, adding to the chaos.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The book features a large cast of characters, both real and fictional within the story. However, the sheer number of characters can make it easy to get confused, especially with a body in the pantry and an actual killer on the loose.  \n\n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n  Atkinson’s humor shines through, particularly in her creation of a fictional author, Nancy Styles (writer of “Hark! Hark! the Dogs Do Bark”), who serves as a playful stand-in for Agatha Christie.  \n\n- **Stakes and Tension:**  \n  Despite the murder and the blizzard, the stakes don’t feel high enough to create significant tension or worry for the reader.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“Death at the Sign of the Rook” is an amusing and clever addition to the Jackson Brodie series, filled with quirky characters and a playful homage to Agatha Christie. However, the plot feels somewhat slight, and the stakes lack the intensity needed to fully engage the reader.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The new characters in this book are quirky and unpredictable.  \n- **Plot and Crime Elements:**  \n  There are a few deaths and thefts, but it might sound heartless to say that these deaths and crimes were the least interesting parts of the story.  \n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  In his sleepy Yorkshire town, ex-detective Jackson Brodie is staving off boredom and malaise. His only case is the seemingly tedious matter of a stolen painting.  \n- **Mystery and Cleverness:**  \n  Jackson soon uncovers a string of unsolved art thefts that lead him down a dizzying spiral of disguise and deceit to Burton Makepeace, a formerly magnificent estate now partially converted into a hotel hosting Murder Mystery weekends. As paying guests, impecunious aristocrats, and old friends collide, we are treated to Atkinson’s most charming and fiendishly clever mystery yet, one that pays homage to the masters of the genre—from Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers to the modern era of *Knives Out* and *Only Murders in the Building*.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Death at the Sign of the Rook* may not be my favorite in the Jackson Brodie series, it remains an entertaining read with engaging characters, a clever mystery, and a charming homage to classic and modern detective stories.

Meanwhile, Jackson Brodie investigates the theft of another painting, *The Woman with a Weasel*, from an elderly widow, with her carer, Melanie, as the prime suspect. The narrative raises intriguing questions about the potential connection between the two thefts and the secrets that *The Woman with a Weasel* may conceal. Adding to the tension is the presence of a convicted murderer on the run in the moors surrounding Burton Makepeace.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Creative Process and Intentions:**  \n  - The author, Kate Atkinson, expresses reluctance to write another Jackson Brodie novel, despite pressure from her publisher and a friend.  \n  - She mentions having recently written a novel set in the roaring twenties with Dickensian and gangsta elements (2022) and a collection of short stories (2023).  \n  - Atkinson humorously describes her potential 2024 novel as a \"hot mess of lukewarm milk toast,\" indicating her exhaustion or lack of enthusiasm for revisiting the Jackson Brodie series.  \n\n- **Publisher's Perspective:**  \n  - The publisher eagerly pushes Atkinson to write another Jackson Brodie novel, calling it a \"highly anticipated return.\"  \n  - They emphasize the character's appeal, describing him as an \"irresistible private eye\" and hinting at a new adventure that pays homage to something (left unspecified in the review).  \n\n- **Character Appeal (Jackson Brodie):**  \n  - Atkinson’s friend expresses admiration for Jackson Brodie, calling him \"hapless\" and praising his anti-patriarchal stance.  \n  - This highlights the character's popularity and the emotional connection readers have with him.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe review captures a humorous and candid exchange about Kate Atkinson's reluctance to write another Jackson Brodie novel, despite the character's popularity and her publisher's enthusiasm. Atkinson’s recent creative endeavors and her witty self-deprecation about her potential next project add depth to the discussion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores are mentioned in the review."

However, it feels like Atkinson padded out the story with a Christie-esque murder mystery weekend, and this addition wasn’t executed altogether successfully.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the familiar characters and humor, the slow pacing and less compelling case made this installment feel weaker compared to earlier books in the series. The attempt to incorporate a murder mystery weekend didn’t quite hit the mark.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The whodunnit was identified easily early in the story, which diminished the suspense.\n\n- **Ending and Plausibility:**  \n  The ending felt implausible and left me feeling disappointed.\n\n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n  The shoutouts to Agatha Christie, along with the humor and farcical ambiance, were witty and fun, adding a layer of enjoyment to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the author’s style and have enjoyed the series, this installment fell short for me due to its slow pacing, predictable mystery, and implausible ending. However, the humor and clever references to Agatha Christie provided some redeeming moments.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The mystery itself is decent but leans heavily on atmosphere and classic tropes like a snowed-in country house, making it feel more like an homage to Agatha Christie than a standout story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, these moments were few and far between, making the overall experience inconsistent.  \n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The murder mystery dinner, a key element of the story, doesn’t start until over 70% into the book, which felt like a significant delay and impacted the pacing.  \n- **Accessibility for New Readers:**  \n  I feel this wasn’t the best starting point for someone new to the series, as it may not provide the most engaging introduction to the characters or the world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Death at the Sign of the Rook* has its golden moments of humor and enjoyment, the inconsistent pacing and delayed introduction of the central mystery make it a less satisfying read overall. It may not be the best choice for newcomers to the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This made it difficult to follow and enjoy.  \n- **Characterization:**  \n  The cast of characters, including a vicar, an Army major, a Dowager, a sleuth (Jackson Brodie), and his sidekick (DC Reggie Chase), was reminiscent of an Agatha Christie setup. However, the sheer number of characters detracted from the story rather than enhancing it.  \n- **Setting:**  \n  The crumbling Burton Makepeace house and its chatelaine, the Dowager Lady Milton, provided a grand yet deteriorating backdrop. The house’s history, including the theft of a valuable Turner painting and the disappearance of the housekeeper, Sophie, added intrigue.  \n- **Mystery and Suspense:**  \n  The central mystery revolves around the theft of another painting, *The Woman with a Weasel*, from the house of an elderly widow who died the same morning. The suspect is her carer, Melanie, raising questions about whether this is connected to the earlier theft. Additionally, a convicted murderer on the run in the moors adds tension.  \n- **Subplot:**  \n  The shambolic Murder Mystery event hosted by Burton Makepeace serves as a backdrop to the real drama unfolding in the house, though it felt more like a distraction than a meaningful addition to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was disappointing due to its scattered plot, excessive number of characters, and lack of cohesion. The intriguing setting and mysteries were overshadowed by the chaotic narrative, making it an unenjoyable read.

Much of the book is filled with superficial character interactions and the TLI plot, which seems like unnecessary padding. This subplot adds little to Brody's case and serves merely as a weak backdrop. When it finally resolves, my reaction was indifference—“meh, who cares?” Even Brody appeared disinterested in the resolution of his own mystery.",

The mystery Brody investigates feels weak and could have been resolved in about one quarter of the pages. The rest of the book is filled with shallow character interactions and the TLI plot, which feels like padding.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I didn’t care about most of the characters and even had to go back to confirm who some of them were. Many were archetypes, which felt lazy. The only character I liked was Ben.  \n\n- **Mystery and Resolution:**  \n  The TLI plot didn’t add anything meaningful to Brody’s case and served only as a weak backdrop.

A criminal escapes on a Harley Davidson Sportster motorcycle during a snowstorm with a foot of snow, which is implausible as a motorcycle couldn’t navigate such conditions.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Simon the Vicar’s voice loss feels contrived and serves as a convenient plot device rather than a believable character development.  \n- **Author's Effort:**  \n  It seems like the author may not have put in her best effort, as the book has major plot holes and feels rushed.  \n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  While this book falls short, the author’s best works are truly good. I plan to seek out *Case Histories* to give it a try.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its humorous moments and the author’s commendable intent, the novel suffers from a messy plot, technical inaccuracies, and contrived character developments. While it doesn’t live up to the author’s potential, I remain hopeful about her other works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

After several chapters, Jackson Brodie wasn’t in it, and I lost interest. I wanted to know what he was doing.  \n- **Plot Development:** I’m sure there was a point to developing all the side characters and then bringing them together or something, but it didn’t hold my attention.  \n- **Reader Engagement:** I wonder if others felt the same way about the shift in focus away from Jackson Brodie.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I typically enjoy this series, this particular installment didn’t captivate me due to the absence of Jackson Brodie and the heavy focus on side characters. I didn’t finish the book and am curious if other readers shared my experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

However, the execution fell flat.  \n  - The plot was tedious and lacked the thrilling elements I expected from a detective novel.  \n  - There were too many details with little focus on advancing the story, making it feel slow and unengaging.  \n  - The alternating timeline structure didn’t work for me and disrupted the flow of the narrative.  \n\n- **Resolution and Satisfaction:**  \n  - Many loose ends were left unresolved, which left me feeling unsatisfied by the end.  \n  - The book failed to deliver a satisfying conclusion, especially for someone who reads thrillers for a tightly woven plot.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The setting, Burton Makepeace House, had potential with its Downton Abbey-like charm, but it wasn’t enough to carry the story.  \n  - The concept of a live-action Clue game was intriguing but ultimately underutilized.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  - This book didn’t align with my preferences as a reader who enjoys plot-driven thrillers.  \n  - It might appeal to readers who enjoy detailed settings and slower-paced narratives, but it wasn’t a good fit for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Death at the Sign of the Rook* started with an intriguing premise and a promising setting, it failed to deliver a thrilling or satisfying detective story.

This made the reading experience frustrating and tedious.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The plot lacked meaningful progression for the majority of the book. The excessive focus on unnecessary details detracted from the overall narrative and failed to engage me.  \n\n- **Character Focus:**  \n  The main character was barely featured, which made it difficult to connect with or care about their journey. This lack of focus on the protagonist further diminished my interest in the story.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  Starting the series on book 5 likely contributed to my confusion and lack of engagement. Without the context of the previous books, I felt disconnected from the story and its characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a disappointing read due to its slow pacing, lack of plot development, and insufficient focus on the main character. While my decision to start the series on book 5 may have played a role, the book itself failed to hold my interest or provide a satisfying narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

As a result, I chose to stop reading and move on to something else.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly provided, but the decision to not finish (DNF) implies a low rating."
