            "This book follows Maddie, who is grappling with the recent loss of her brother. He left her a series of notes to be opened at specific locations, but there's a twist: she must undertake this journey with Dom, her brother’s best friend, with whom she shares a complicated history. Their interactions bring a palpable tension to the story. Watching Maddie navigate her grief while also discovering love and her true self is beautifully portrayed. The travel aspect adds an exciting layer, making the reading experience even more enjoyable.",
            "I absolutely adore Dom! Every time he spoke in the latter half of this book, I found myself swooning—he's definitely the best book boyfriend I've discovered this fall. Maddie is equally captivating; she's so funny and relatable, making it easy to empathize with her struggles in life and overwhelming emotions. I really wish we could have glimpsed Dom's perspective, but the story was still amazing. Together, they were perfection. Initially, I was skeptical about their past and Dom’s other relationship, but those concerns faded quickly. Their chemistry was both hot and unexpected, and the depth of their love for each other was heartwarming.",
            "This story took me by surprise in the best way possible. I was enjoying it from the start, but once I reached the halfway mark, I became completely obsessed! I found myself sobbing—though you might not—but regardless, it's an excellent book. I spent most of my reading time smiling, which is a true testament to its quality!",

            "This book offers much more than expected: deep friendships that feel like family, insights into the main characters' professional lives, and explorations of their home lives. I appreciate the portrayal of a man who consistently supports the woman he loves without being overbearing. The female protagonist is refreshingly authentic in her struggle to navigate her challenges while maintaining a facade of composure for others.",
            "The banter was exceptional—so much so that it could easily earn a five-star rating on its own.",
            "If you're seeking a book that evokes deep emotions, this is the one for you. I'm so glad I chose it, and I hope those who read my review will too.",
            "I'm adding Dom to my list of all-time favorite book boyfriends. While I adore road-trip stories, it's a bit of a stretch to label this one as such. Maddie and Dom journey through eight states at the behest of Maddie's late brother and Dom's late best friend, but the road trip aspect doesn't overshadow the narrative as it often does in typical road-trip novels."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a heartfelt and emotionally resonant story that goes beyond the typical road-trip narrative. It excels in character development, realistic relationships, and witty dialogue, making it a standout read. The portrayal of a strong, supportive male lead and a relatable female protagonist adds depth and authenticity to the story. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a book that balances emotional depth with engaging storytelling.",

Having lost my sister in 2008, I empathized deeply with the FMC. The author handled the topic of grief with care, showing that it isn’t what you think it is and that it lasts a lifetime. While most of the book didn’t hit me emotionally, the ending really struck a chord and brought out strong feelings.  \n\n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  The FMC did get on my nerves at times. She clearly has issues, and I wanted her to stop overanalyzing everything in her head (and repeatedly). However, her struggles felt authentic, even if they were frustrating.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements and Tropes:**  \n  I loved the banter and the enemies-to-lovers trope. Dom (the MMC) was a standout character for me, and I adored his dynamic with the FMC.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The family and friends added so much depth to the story. Their interactions and relationships felt genuine and enriching.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The adventures and the letters were highlights for me.

I highly recommend grabbing this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book beautifully explores grief and relationships, with a mix of emotional depth, engaging tropes, and well-developed characters.

The story centers on Maddie, who is struggling with the loss of her brother, Josh. When her ex-boyfriend, Dominic Perry, reappears at Josh’s funeral with a posthumous request, the narrative takes an emotional turn.

            "This book exceeded my expectations and left a lasting impression. While it isn't a traditional enemies-to-lovers story, it certainly captures that dynamic. The plot follows Maddie and Dom as they embark on a post-mortem pilgrimage to honor Maddie's late brother, Josh, by visiting eight states he never had the chance to see. Maddie's grief is central to the narrative, often manifesting as anger, particularly towards Dom, her brother's best friend with whom she shares a complicated history. This journey compels Maddie to confront her feelings for Dom and navigate her grief, which is further complicated by her abandonment issues stemming from her upbringing.",
            "Maddie’s character is richly layered, and her emotional journey is both compelling and authentic, capturing her grief, anger, and growth. Dom is equally well-developed, and their dynamic brims with tension, warmth, and witty banter. Although Josh is deceased, he remains a vivid presence through the memories and stories shared by those who loved him. The central love story between Maddie and Dom is well-crafted and satisfying, with Maddie’s personal growth receiving equal emphasis. This balance makes their happily-ever-after feel truly earned and solid.",
            "The story evokes visceral emotions that can be heavy at times, yet the warmth, wit, and humor provide a perfect counterbalance, preventing it from becoming overwhelming. The author skillfully intertwines themes of grief, love, and self-discovery, resulting in a narrative that is both poignant and uplifting."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a deeply emotional and rewarding read, with well-developed characters, a compelling plot, and a perfect balance of humor and heartbreak. It’s a story that stays with you long after finishing, and I highly recommend it.",

While it’s not a strict \"enemies to lovers\" story, it carries that energy. The plot revolves around Maddie and Dom, who embark on a post-mortem pilgrimage to honor Josh, Maddie’s late brother, by visiting eight states he never got to see. Maddie’s grief is central to the story, manifesting as anger, especially toward Dom, her brother’s best friend, with whom she has a complicated history.

Her grief, anger, and eventual growth are portrayed with authenticity. Dom is equally well-developed, and their dynamic is rich with tension, warmth, and snarky banter. Josh, though deceased, is vividly brought to life through the memories and stories shared by his loved ones, making him a tangible presence in the narrative.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Tone:**  \n  The emotions conveyed in the story are visceral and heavy at times, but the warmth, wit, and humor balance the intensity, preventing it from becoming overwhelming. The author masterfully blends grief, love, and self-discovery, creating a story that feels both poignant and uplifting.  \n\n- **Romance and Resolution:**  \n  The central love story between Maddie and Dom is well-crafted and satisfying. What I particularly appreciated was that Maddie’s personal growth was given equal weight, making the happily-ever-after (HEA) feel earned and solid.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply emotional and rewarding read, with well-developed characters, a compelling plot, and a perfect balance of humor and heartbreak.

While the miscommunication was frustrating, it felt authentic given the characters' youth and poor decision-making. The single POV effectively conveys Maddie’s grief, though I initially yearned for Dom’s perspective.",

Dominick Perry stands out as a top-tier book boyfriend—quiet, responsible, and unafraid to admit his mistakes while being there when it counts. Maddie's friends, including Jeremy and Tula, are genuine and supportive. The Perry twins, Adam and Carter, are intriguing, leaving me wanting more of their story. Josh, the brilliant puppeteer, adds depth, and Rosaline ultimately won me over by the end. Conversely, Cecilia and Florence are characters I strongly disliked, evoking strong negative feelings.",

It dealt with heavy themes of grief and loss, which resonated deeply with me. I cried like a baby, which speaks to the emotional power of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, Maddie and Dom, were the heart of the story. Their individual journeys with grief were compelling, and I appreciated how they eventually came together to help each other through their heartbreak. However, I would have liked to see more of Dom’s perspective to fully understand his emotions.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Tension:**  \n  The structure of the trips to spread Josh’s ashes added a lot of tension to the love story. The emotionally-charged, close proximity during these trips made their attraction and shared past inevitable. This setup kept me engaged throughout the book.  \n\n- **Realism and Consistency:**  \n  My biggest complaint was the miscommunication between friends and siblings at the end. Given how close they were portrayed throughout the book, it felt unrealistic that none of the characters knew the whole story. This inconsistency slightly detracted from the otherwise strong narrative.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This is an emotional, second-chance romance that tackles heavy themes like grief and loss. If you’re looking for a story that balances heartbreak with hope, this book might be for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *PS: I Hate You* is a deeply emotional and engaging read. While there were minor issues with realism and perspective, the characters, their journeys, and the tension-filled plot made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.5/ 5"

            "The spice level was a perfect 3/5, delivering just the right amount of heat without overshadowing the story's emotional core. The happily ever after ending left me feeling satisfied and fulfilled. The narrative begins with the FMC's brother leaving a dying wish for her and his best friend to take his ashes on an adventure he never experienced. This premise immediately drew me in with its angsty and emotional undertones. The dynamic between the FMC and her brother's best friend—who had broken her heart years ago—creates a poignant tension as they embark on a road trip, reading letters from her deceased brother at each stop. It was both heartbreaking and captivating.",
            "The tension and banter between the FMC and MMC were fantastic, particularly in the airport scene and their text/email exchanges, which highlighted their chemistry and unresolved feelings. I appreciated the MMC's protective nature without being overly alpha, and the FMC's vulnerability—her struggles with asthma and grief—added depth to her character.",
            "The single POV format effectively deepened my connection with the female main character. The pacing was excellent, skillfully balancing emotional moments with lighter, humorous scenes.",
            "The book skillfully weaves together several of my favorite tropes, including brother's best friend, road trip, dying wish, grief, and forced proximity—like being trapped by a snowstorm or sharing a bed at an inn. These elements were effectively executed, adding significant depth to the story.",
            "This book takes readers on an emotional rollercoaster, evoking laughter, tears, and swoons. The shared heartbreak of losing Josh, the brother, is especially poignant, and the characters' emotional depth makes their journey feel both authentic and relatable."

He felt full of life despite everything we learned about him coming from flashbacks.\"  \n  - \"Dom's steady presence was the perfect anchor for Maddie's turbulent grief. I loved watching Dom be there for Maddie time and time again during the most difficult points of her grieving process.\"  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - \"It's definitely one of my favorite reads of the year.\"  \n  - \"I adored everything about this book and I'm very excited about this author's future releases!\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an emotional rollercoaster, blending grief, humor, and heartfelt moments seamlessly.

            "Maddie’s character is strikingly real and relatable. The author skillfully portrays her anxious-avoidant attachment, workaholism, grief, depression, defense mechanisms, anxiety, and jealousy. I particularly resonated with her quirks, such as her obsession with sweaters and her habit of buying beautiful journals that remain unused because she struggles to find anything significant to write. It felt like looking in a mirror. As someone who typically doesn't enjoy the enemies-to-lovers trope, I appreciated that Maddie’s initial dislike for Dom was rooted in their complex romantic history, adding depth to their relationship and making the characters feel authentic.",

It’s a narrative that will likely appeal to readers who enjoy stories with depth and emotional weight.  \n\n- **Familiarity vs. Originality:**  \n  While the book does tread familiar ground in terms of its themes and tropes, the strong central characters and poignant exploration of grief and connection make it stand out as a worthwhile read in the contemporary romance genre.  \n\n- **Author Impression:**  \n  Lauren Connolly is a new author for me, but her storytelling left a lasting impression. I will definitely be looking for more of her work in the future.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I’d like to thank NetGalley for providing me with an advanced copy of this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*P.S. I Hate You* is a heartfelt and engaging novel that balances emotional depth with a slow-burn romance. While it may not align with initial genre expectations, its strong characters and poignant themes make it a memorable and worthwhile read for fans of contemporary romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The way Lauren Connelly wrote about loss and grief was exceptionally well done.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was by far my favorite part of the book.  \n\n- **Romantic/Spicy Scenes:**  \n  While I typically enjoy a bit of spice in my reads, the spicy scene in this book felt forced and unnecessary, detracting from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Inspiration and Connection:**  \n  *PS I Hate You* inspired me to want to go on unique adventures in every state with my husband. The fact that a book could evoke such strong emotions and aspirations in me is remarkable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a deeply emotional and inspiring read, with a standout ending and well-portrayed themes of loss and grief. While the romantic/spicy scene felt out of place, the overall impact of the story was profound, earning it a high rating.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars (though it would have been a 3.75/4-star read without the emotional connection and inspiration it provided)."

Her coping mechanisms added depth to her character.  \n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The story was emotionally moving, and I found myself tearing up by the end. It resonated deeply with me.  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The novel combined elements of *Pack Up the Moon* (with letters from a deceased loved one) and *You with a View* (a romance road trip). However, it felt more profound and unique than a typical romance novel.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I loved the book and couldn’t put it down. It was a beautiful story that I would gladly read again.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was more than just a romance; it was a deeply emotional and beautifully crafted story. Despite the main character’s initial flaws, her journey and the themes of love, loss, and healing made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I couldn’t understand why she couldn’t get over something that happened so long ago and was so incredibly cruel to the MMC (male main character).  \n  - The MMC, on the other hand, was way too patient, which added to the frustration but also made him a compelling character.  \n  - As the story unfolded and layers became clearer, I began to understand the FMC’s motivations and actions, though I still found myself screaming at her throughout the book.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  - The book was incredibly frustrating but also fantastic at the same time. It evoked a wide range of emotions, from anger to empathy, and kept me deeply engaged.  \n  - I went through all the feels while reading, which made the experience memorable and impactful.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story unfolded in a way that gradually revealed the complexities of the characters and their past, which kept me hooked.  \n  - The pacing allowed for a deeper understanding of the characters’ motivations, even if it was frustrating at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a rollercoaster of emotions, blending frustration with fascination.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Depth and Themes:**  \n  The novel delves deeply into themes of abandonment and grief, which are portrayed in a moving and impactful way. These elements elevate the story beyond a typical rom-com, adding layers of emotional resonance.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Romance:**  \n  The male protagonist consistently shows up for the female lead, which is both swoon-worthy and heartwarming. However, the romance loses a point for relying on miscommunication as a plot device, which could have been resolved more easily through open conversation.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book is highly emotional and likely to evoke tears, especially for readers with a \"beating heart.\" The portrayal of grief and connection is particularly touching.  \n\n- **Tone and Consistency:**  \n  While the novel maintains a consistent tone overall, there is a random spicy section in the middle that feels somewhat out of place. Despite this, the scene is well-executed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is much more than a rom-com, offering a heartfelt exploration of grief, abandonment, and love. While the miscommunication trope and an unexpected spicy scene slightly detract from the overall experience, the emotional depth and character dynamics make it a compelling and moving read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: 5/5 ⭐️  \n- Swoon Meter: 4/5 🥰  \n- Cry Meter: 5/5 😭  \n- Spice Meter: 3/5 🌶️"

However, after seeing numerous great reviews, I decided to give it a chance by borrowing it from my library.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book is incredibly sad, and it’s hard to get through without shedding tears. Despite the emotional heaviness, the story is deeply moving and worth the emotional investment.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I was completely wrong about my initial hesitation. This book is so good! It exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it. Don’t make the mistake of delaying it like I did.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial reservations, this novel turned out to be a profoundly emotional and rewarding read. It’s a story that stays with you, and I’m glad I gave it a chance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It obscures the novel's true themes and might attract readers expecting a typical BookTok romance, rather than the profound exploration of grief, forgiveness, and self-acceptance that it actually offers.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel beautifully handles themes of grief, letting go, and learning to forgive oneself. These elements are far more central to the story than the romantic aspects, which, while present, are not the primary focus. The depth of these themes is a standout feature of the book.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  While the story includes some romantic elements, they are secondary to the more profound exploration of emotional and psychological growth. The romance does not overshadow the deeper narrative but complements it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its misleading title, the novel is a deeply moving exploration of grief, forgiveness, and self-acceptance. The themes are handled with care and beauty, making it a standout read that transcends its marketing.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Josh, a pivotal character, orchestrates their reunion through a series of letters during his funeral, leading them on an adventure across various states.

A dual POV could have offered a more balanced and nuanced conclusion.",

The time skips, spanning two years with seasonal meetings, are well-executed and contribute meaningfully to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Maddie and Dom undergo significant growth throughout the novel, especially during the time skips.

Even the epilogue felt like an important and necessary part of Maddie and Dom's story.  \n\n- **Potential Triggers:**  \n  If you are sensitive to themes like the loss of a sibling, conversations around cancer, or neglectful/verbally abusive parental relationships, I’d recommend approaching this story with caution or avoiding it altogether. Your health and wellbeing are more important.  \n\n- **Desire for Spin-Offs:**  \n  I would LOVE to see a book specifically about Carter and Adam—they left a strong impression!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a beautifully written and emotionally resonant novel that explores grief and loss with depth and sensitivity.

It’s a compelling and heartfelt narrative that requires emotional readiness from the reader.  \n\n- **Romance Tropes:**  \n  The book is packed with a variety of romance tropes, including best friend’s brother, one-night stand/second chance romance, enemies to lovers, friends with benefits, and eventually friends to lovers. The spice level is moderate, earning a 3 on the 🌶️ scale.  \n\n- **Character Development (Leads):**  \n  Josh is portrayed as a solid book boyfriend, though I wished he communicated more.

            "Initially, I found Maddie unlikable due to her childishness, but as her backstory unfolds, her reactions become understandable. By the end, I was fully invested in her growth. I struggled to connect with Dom at first, but as we gained insight into his character, I grew to appreciate him. While I craved his perspective, I understand why it was omitted until later. Dom is a bit possessive yet incredibly considerate of Maddie's needs—definitely excellent book-boyfriend material! Their relationship felt organic; despite their contrasting personalities—his dry demeanor and her sarcasm—they complemented each other perfectly. Maddie made him work hard to regain her trust, and his groveling was impressive! The banter between them deserves a special mention; Maddie's exasperation of Dom serves as playful foreplay. Their interactions, filled with witty exchanges, emails, and texts, were thoroughly entertaining.",

She was childish, but as we learn more about her childhood, her reactions make sense. I loved her growth and was cheering for her by the end.  \n  - I had difficulty connecting with Dom until later when we get to hear more of his voice.

Excellent book-boyfriend material!  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  - The relationship between Maddie and Dom felt organic. Their personalities were opposites but perfectly complementary; he’s dry, and she’s sarcastic. She made him work hard to regain her trust, and his grovel was next level!  \n  - Honourable mention: the banter! Maddie exasperates Dom, and it is basically foreplay for him.

The story begins after Josh's death, and through his letters to Maddie and Dom, we get to know his personality, making his loss feel personal and deeply saddening.\n\n- **Character Development (Maddie):**  \n  Maddie was unlikeable for most of the book, often being mean to Dom without clear justification. However, her behavior can be attributed to her complicated grief and the lack of a supportive family. Josh was her primary support system, and his loss led her to direct her anger at Dom, the only person who loved Josh as much as she did. While this doesn't excuse her actions, it provides context for her irrational behavior.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The mix of heavy and lighthearted moments was well-balanced, and the concept of scattering Josh's ashes across eight states added a unique and engaging structure to the story. The trips to the different states were enjoyable and added depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook, narrated by Karissa Vacker, was well-done. Vacker's portrayal of Maddie's sarcastic and snarky tone was so effective that it amplified my dislike for the character, more so than if I had read the book in print.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book successfully blends emotional depth with a unique and engaging plot.

But I did come to understand him and empathize with him.\"  \n  Dom’s character was initially challenging to grasp due to his minimal dialogue, but over time, the reader gained a deeper understanding of and empathy for him.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel delivered an emotionally charged experience, skillfully reimagining the road trip trope in a way that resonated with the reader. While Dom’s character required patience to fully comprehend, his development ultimately added depth and emotional connection to the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Despite initially wanting to DNF (Did Not Finish), I found myself deeply intrigued and invested in the story. The emotional rollercoaster was intense—I cringed, shouted, and ultimately cried so hard that I had to comfort myself with late-night eggs and hash-browns. The final chapters, accompanied by the song \"Sleep on the Floor\" by The Lumineers, were particularly moving and left me emotionally drained.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a deeply emotional and engaging read. It evoked a wide range of emotions, from frustration to heartbreak, and left a lasting impression. Despite my initial hesitation, I was captivated by the story and its powerful conclusion.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Not a complaint per se, but by the end, the scenes (while short) didn’t feel like they added much to the story.  \n  - I would have appreciated deeper dives into the emotional connection or longer/more detailed scenes instead of brief, vague descriptions of sex marathons.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - Maddie was bitter (same tho) but funny, and Dom was h-o-t.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - Overall, I enjoyed the writing.  \n  - However, there were some stylistic choices that really irked me, the big one being the author’s use of “the man” in reference to the MMC when it’s clear who’s being referenced, and she could have just used “he.” It appeared 150 times (I searched) and made for awkward reading.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Comparison:**  \n  - Highly recommend if you loved *You With A View* and/or *Mrs. Nash’s Ashes!*  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was an emotional rollercoaster, blending heartfelt moments with humor and yearning. While I appreciated the found family dynamic and the spicy elements, I felt the romantic scenes could have been more emotionally resonant.

            "This book spans several years, allowing for a realistic and immersive development of the characters' relationship. This extended timeline stands in contrast to typical rushed romances, making the story feel more grounded.

A poignant twist reveals Josh's secret love for Dom's ex-wife, adding depth to the narrative. \n\nThe story is a bittersweet romantic comedy with a spicy edge, centered on two characters navigating grief while unintentionally falling in love. It skillfully balances humor and emotional depth, highlighted by moments like the female protagonist's witty remark, \"Leave me alone, I'm puzzling,\" which adds levity. However, it also tackles heavy themes of loss, emotional damage, and toxic family dynamics, particularly through Maddie's narcissistic mother and grandmother.",

Although her challenging life circumstances provide some context for her behavior, her actions frequently seem inconsistent with those of someone in their mid-to-late 20s.

His quiet demeanor and limited dialogue make it difficult to grasp why Maddie is so attracted to him beyond his physical appearance.",

She is tasked with spreading his ashes in eight different states, accompanied by his best friend, Dom. The forced proximity during their journey creates tension, but it also allows them to reminisce about Josh and gradually break down the walls between them. The plot spans over two years, taking Maddie from despair to love and friendship, with a mix of humor and grief.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Maddie is portrayed as a deeply relatable and realistic character.

You never forget what Maddie and Dom are doing, just like grief sometimes cannot leave us.  \n\n- **Plot and Subplots:**  \n  - The side plot involving the Perry twin brothers was a breath of fresh air constantly, and I would not be against following their stories in another book.  \n  - The ending was literally perfection. I cannot think of a standalone I've read recently that has left me as fulfilled and satisfied as this one.  \n\n- **Pacing and Balance:**  \n  - There was just too long of a stretch of spice.

I'm unsure if this was the intended effect, but it affected my immersion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was a deeply emotional and well-crafted story, with complex characters and a narrative that resonated strongly. While the delayed revelation of Maddie and Dom's history and the occasional disconnect in intimate scenes were minor critiques, the book was still a powerful and memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars"

It suggested a typical enemies-to-lovers, second-chance romance, but the book was actually a profound exploration of grief and holding onto the memories of lost loved ones.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story follows Maddie and Dom, exes who are tasked with fulfilling Josh's (Maddie's brother and Dom's best friend) last wish: spreading his ashes across eight states he never visited. Along the way, they open letters from Josh at each destination, which adds emotional depth and structure to their journey. The book is a devastating yet heartfelt exploration of grief, loss, and healing.  \n\n- **Engagement and Emotional Impact:**  \n  I found myself deeply engaged with the story. Every time I put the book down, I looked forward to picking it up again. The emotional impact was strong, and I had to stop myself from crying at the end.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Maddie and Dom had great chemistry and shared funny, witty banter. However, the romantic aspect of their relationship wasn’t the focal point for me. Instead, their journey felt more about personal growth and processing grief together.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*PS: I Hate You* surprised me with its depth and emotional resonance. While the title and initial expectations suggested a lighthearted romance, the book delivered a moving exploration of grief, loss, and the bonds that tie us to those we’ve lost. Maddie and Dom’s journey was engaging and heartfelt, making this a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It had all of my favorite romance tropes but presented them in a fresh new manner.  \n\n- **Character Chemistry and Dialogue:**  \n  Dom and Maddie had palpable chemistry and funny banter, which made their interactions engaging and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Grief:**  \n  Maddie’s grief was written really well, and my heart broke for her. I appreciated that the book took place over the course of two years, allowing her grief and relationship development to feel natural and not rushed.  \n\n- **Subplot and Character Dynamics:**  \n  I didn’t love finding out about Rosaline and Josh’s relationship at the end. I don’t think it added anything to the story, and I would’ve preferred to see Maddie eventually spread the last of Josh’s ashes instead of Rosaline attempting to do so.  \n\n- **Timeline Consistency:**  \n  The timeline was hard to ignore. Maddie is 19 in the flashbacks when Dom proposed to Rosaline but 26 at the time of the funeral and (assuming) 25 when Josh got his diagnosis. This implies that Dom and Rosaline endured an unhappy marriage for 6 years with no plans to quit, which felt excessive and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Structural Clarity:**  \n  I wish Josh’s letters were numbered because the book truly wouldn’t have made sense if they visited the states in any other order. This would have improved the clarity and flow of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this book to be an enjoyable read with strong emotional depth and engaging character dynamics. However, certain elements like the timeline and subplot execution could have been improved to enhance the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐️"

It follows two individuals as they navigate their grief over the loss of their friend/brother to cancer, embarking on a road trip to scatter his ashes across eight states.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Representation:**  \n  The narrative is rich with emotional depth, includes representation of disability (the female main character has asthma), and is filled with plenty of angst and longing.  \n\n- **Critique of Content:**  \n  I’m giving this book 4 stars because I felt the inclusion of a sex scene was unnecessary. The story was so engaging on its own—unlike some other books by such authors like Hannah Grace, which often rely on such scenes to enhance their appeal. In my opinion, a lengthy 10-page sex scene wasn’t needed here.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is a heartfelt and emotionally resonant story with strong themes of grief, love, and second chances. While the inclusion of a sex scene felt unnecessary to me, the book’s engaging plot and emotional depth make it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

Despite its heavy themes, I’m happy I read it and would recommend it to others.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She’s very immature, and while her insecurities are justified, her self-pity was a little over the top.\"  \n  - \"A lot of likeable characters; I’d read a whole novel about Adam Perry.\"  \n\n- **Plot and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  - \"Loved learning about each place they visited and was just as excited as they were to open each letter.\"  \n  - \"Sobbed during the last 40 pages.\"  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  - \"I think I’m going to think about this one for a while.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book shares striking similarities with the movie *PS I Love You*, which I adore. While I connected deeply with Dom and found many characters likable, Maddie’s immaturity and excessive self-pity detracted from the story. The travel elements and the anticipation of opening each letter were highlights, and the emotional ending left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Despite some issues, I got over them and enjoyed the story, so that's really all that matters.  \n\n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  I did not enjoy the FMC (female main character) though, and it had me rolling my eyes way more than I wanted to. I always understand WHY the characters are petty and obnoxious, but I never like it.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book was probably 100 pages too long, so maybe we can work on that next time.  \n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n  I'll definitely read more from this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had some issues with the FMC and felt the book was overly long, I ultimately enjoyed the story and appreciated its vibes. I’m looking forward to reading more from this author in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "I will never forgive Dom for marrying Rosaline. Throughout the story, Maddie pines for him while engaging in non-serious relationships, while Dom enters a loveless marriage. His actions are frustrating—he gets engaged the day after a hookup with someone he claims to love because she’s pregnant, then remains in that marriage for over six years, all while insisting that Maddie is the only one he sees. The twist at the end, revealing that Rosaline and Josh are in love, is irritating. If they truly loved each other, they should have chosen their real partners. I also disliked how Maddie was always the one to make the first move, especially after Dom's betrayal. Once their animosity faded, their relationship devolved into mere physical intimacy, with little meaningful conversation until the very end. If Dom truly loved Maddie, he should have been more romantic and proactive in their relationship.",

            "Maddie, the single POV narrator, is an unreliable and often frustrating character. Her inconsistencies, such as knowing the exact drive time to Rehoboth but later being vague about it, are bothersome. She comes across as bratty and immature, lacking a meaningful redemptive arc beyond the grace afforded by her grieving state. Her antics, like plotting to fill Dom’s socks with shaving cream, feel juvenile and out of place. Dom’s attraction to Maddie is unconvincing; his interest seems unrealistic given her unreliable nature. The romance relies heavily on insta-lust, even for a second-chance trope, and the language used in the spicy scenes feels overly intense for a romcom."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Predictability:** The story was predictable, particularly in its portrayal of the characters Mad Maddie and Domineering Dom. While it was a bingeable read that evoked emotions by the end, the first half required effort to push through.  \n- **Character Development (Maddie):** Maddie, the single POV narrator, was an unreliable and frustrating character. Her inconsistencies (e.g., knowing the exact drive time to Rehoboth but later being vague about it) were bothersome. She came across as bratty, immature, and lacking a meaningful redemptive arc, aside from the grace given due to her grieving state. Her behavior, such as plotting to fill Dom’s socks with shaving cream, felt juvenile and out of place.  \n- **Character Development (Dom):** Dom’s attraction to Maddie felt unconvincing. His interest in her seemed unrealistic, given her immature and unreliable nature.  \n- **Romance Development:** The romance leaned heavily on insta-lust, even for a second-chance trope. The word choices used for the spicy scenes felt overly intense for a romcom.  \n- **Logical Inconsistencies:** Several plot points lacked believability, such as Maddie renting a car for a work trip to Manhattan (a city where cars are unnecessary) and breaking in new hiking boots during a trek in South Dakota without mentioning blisters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a mixed experience. While it was engaging enough to binge and evoked strong emotions by the end, the predictability, frustrating characterizations, and logical inconsistencies detracted from the overall enjoyment. The romance felt rushed and overly intense, and Maddie’s lack of growth made it difficult to fully invest in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25/5"

I Love You*, one of my favorite romances.  \n  - However, around 60% in, the story shifted to unnecessary smut, which felt forced and unnatural given the book's tone and themes.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - Despite its flaws, I would recommend this book, especially to those who have experienced grief or abandonment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply emotional and complex story that tackles heavy themes like grief and childhood trauma.

I found it unrealistic that no one called her out on her behavior.  \n\n- **Characterization (MMC):**  \n  - I loved Dom, the male main character (MMC), and found the love story enjoyable. However, I had the same issue with him as I did with Justin from *Just for the Summer*—men don’t act like this in real life! It felt like he was a caricature of what women want in a male lead, rather than a realistic, flawed human being.  \n\n- **Realism and Depth:**  \n  - I prefer male characters who feel authentic, with both flaws and redeeming qualities. This book fell short in that regard, as the MMC felt overly idealized.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - The book was good, but I kept waiting for it to be great. It didn’t quite reach the level of depth or realism I was hoping for.  \n\n- **Memorable Quote:**  \n  - One quote I loved was: “When you helped me, I could breathe.

The small twist at the end adds some excitement, but overall, it’s a light, entertaining read rather than a deeply compelling one.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

She was almost insufferable, at least for the first half of the book.  \n  - The sheer amount of teeth grinding and her tendency to overthink, which led to frequent bronchial spasms, made her less relatable and enjoyable for me.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story wasn’t terrible, but it also wasn’t great. I wanted to love it more, but it fell short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Authenticity of Details:**  \n  - As someone familiar with asthma (my kids have major asthma), I found the frequent use of an inhaler and the portrayal of bronchial spasms somewhat overdone and distracting.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Reviews:**  \n  - I’m surprised at the glowing reviews this book has received, as my experience with it was more mixed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments, my inability to connect with the main character and the overemphasis on certain details (like her asthma) made it a less enjoyable read overall.

It overshadowed the otherwise sweet and emotional narrative for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a charming and emotional premise, the inclusion of explicit sexual content significantly impacted my enjoyment. It’s a great read for those who enjoy spice, but it didn’t align with my personal preferences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI would have given this 5 stars, but due to the explicit content, my rating is lower. (No specific score mentioned, but the implication is that the explicit content reduced the rating.)"

The emotional weight of the story made it a challenging read for me.  \n\n- **Character Likability (LFC - Lead Female Character):**  \n  I really disliked the LFC because she was such a jerk to nearly everyone nearly all the time. Her behavior made it difficult for me to connect with her, and it felt like an uphill climb to stay engaged with her story.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing was super solid, with a strong command of language and style.  \n\n- **Premise:**  \n  The premise of the book was compelling and well-conceived.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was well-executed, maintaining a steady flow throughout the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book has many strong elements, such as its writing, premise, and pacing, my personal experience was hindered by the heavy focus on grief and the unlikable behavior of the lead female character. It’s a book that could easily be a four or even five-star read for others, but it didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐️, rounded down."

I definitely loved a lot of it, but there were a few things that didn’t sit right with me. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but it felt like it was missing something that could have elevated my experience.  \n\n- **Realism and Authenticity:**  \n  The book had a lot of realistic aspects, which I appreciated. It felt grounded and believable, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  I felt the book could have been 30-40 pages longer. The ending, in particular, felt rushed. While I understand the story takes place over a specific time frame, the conclusion seemed abrupt. A chapter would open, and suddenly, an unspecified amount of time had passed, leaving me a bit disoriented.  \n\n- **Writing Quality and Characters:**  \n  The writing was good, and I liked the main characters (MCs). They were well-developed and engaging, which kept me invested in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the book overall and appreciated its realistic elements and strong characters, the rushed ending and a sense that something was missing kept me from giving it a higher rating.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.9-4.2 stars."

Unfortunately, the execution falters, and the ending feels abrupt and forced, resulting in an unsatisfying resolution.",

In contrast, Dominic is severely underdeveloped; his actions paint him as a terrible person, and his lack of communication with Maddie is frustrating. The narrative fails to clarify his motivations or delve into their past relationship, making their reconnection feel unconvincing. The portrayal of Maddie and Dominic as “exes reconnecting” is misleading, as their history is insufficiently explored to render their reunion believable or compelling. Much of the conflict could have been avoided if Dominic had been honest about his feelings and their past.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The plot is intriguing, with Maddie Sanderson embarking on a cross-country journey to honor her late brother’s dying wish. The premise of reconnecting with her ex, Dominic Perry, while navigating grief and unresolved tensions, holds promise. However, the execution falls short, and the ending feels abrupt and forced, leaving the resolution unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Maddie, the protagonist, comes across as immature and lacking in empathy for a 26-year-old. Her inner monologue is overwhelming and excessive, which detracts from her relatability. Dominic, on the other hand, is severely underdeveloped. His actions make him seem like a terrible person, and his lack of communication with Maddie is frustrating. The story fails to provide a clear understanding of his motivations or explore their past relationship deeply enough to justify their reconnection.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is binge-worthy, but the pacing is inconsistent. Some scenes drag on due to repetitive inner monologue, while others feel rushed. This imbalance disrupts the flow of the narrative.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The states chosen for the trip and the destinations themselves are interesting and add a unique layer to the story. However, the inconsistent pacing and excessive focus on Maddie’s inner thoughts detract from the potential impact of these settings.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The portrayal of Maddie and Dominic as “exes reconnecting” feels misleading. Their past relationship isn’t explored deeply enough to make their reconnection believable or compelling. Most of the conflict could have been resolved if Dominic had been honest about his feelings and the past.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its intriguing premise and binge-worthy writing style, it ultimately fell short due to underdeveloped characters, inconsistent pacing, and an unsatisfying ending. Maddie’s immaturity and Dominic’s lack of depth made it difficult to connect with the story, and the romantic dynamics felt unconvincing.

            "The story unfolds at a deliberate pace, with each trip taking months to plan and execute. This slow rhythm reflects the lengthy process of grief and healing, though it may feel tedious to some readers. The narrative follows Maddie and Dom as they navigate their intertwined past and present struggles. Maddie Sanderson is grappling with the loss of her brother, Josh, who succumbed to cancer. Tasked with spreading his ashes in eight locations, she is dismayed to discover that Josh’s best friend, Dominic Perry, must accompany her. Despite her initial reluctance, Maddie agrees to honor her brother’s last wishes by reading the letters he left behind. The premise is emotionally charged, delving into themes of grief, healing, and complex relationships.",
            "Maddie is a complex and immature character, struggling with a toxic blend of grief, resentment, anger, and disbelief. Her self-destructive thoughts and refusal to forgive Dom render her an unsympathetic and often frustrating protagonist. In contrast, Dom is patient and grapples with guilt over hurting Maddie while navigating his own grief. The dynamic between them is central to the story, highlighting Dom’s empathy against Maddie’s emotional turmoil.",

Maddie's struggle with grief and her resistance to healing, juxtaposed with Dom's patience and guilt, create a poignant exploration of loss and forgiveness. However, Maddie's unsympathetic and emotionally chaotic portrayal may alienate some readers.",

Despite her difficult childhood and trauma, she shows little growth or adaptability, which can be frustrating. Her treatment of others, particularly Dom, is unjustifiable and often harsh. Maddy's frequent outbursts and refusal to take responsibility for her actions render her unlikable. Her relationships, especially with Dom, are strained and one-sided, as she fails to appreciate or reciprocate the support she receives, making her interactions frustrating to follow.",

The idea of forced proximity and hate-to-love tropes had potential, but the story didn’t deliver on its promise.  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  The characters lacked depth, and their connection felt underdeveloped. I couldn’t even remember their names, which speaks volumes about how forgettable they were. Their animosity felt forced and unrealistic, and their relationship progression didn’t feel organic or believable.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The story touches on heavy themes like grief, loss, toxic family relationships, and the death of a sibling. While these could have added emotional depth, they weren’t explored in a way that resonated with me. Instead, it felt like the characters needed therapy rather than a road trip.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Chemistry:**  \n  The romantic and sexual chemistry between the characters was nonexistent. The smut scenes were cringey, overly anatomical, and clinical, which made them hard to get through. I usually enjoy spicy scenes, but these lacked any emotional or physical connection, making them feel out of place.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The audiobook narration by Karissa Vacker was excellent and earned a perfect score. Her performance was engaging and brought life to the story, even when the plot and characters didn’t.  \n\n- **Content Warnings and Sensitive Topics:**  \n  The story includes sensitive topics like the death of a sibling, cancer, grief, and toxic family dynamics. While these were handled, I found the commentary on the male main character’s eating habits problematic and unnecessary.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of *PS I Hate You* had potential, the execution left much to be desired.

However, the vivid descriptions of the various locations were a highlight and showcased the author's ability to create engaging settings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The premise of Josh's death and his request for Dom and Maddie to scatter his ashes across the USA holds promise, but it ultimately falls flat. The emotional impact of Josh's passing and the journey itself is overshadowed by a lackluster romance and unlikable characters.",
            "The story suffers from a lack of character development, leaving Dom and Maddie flat and uninteresting. We barely glimpse their personalities outside of their relationship, making it difficult to invest in their journey. Maddie is intended to be humorous, but I found her annoying, mean, and excessively rude. Dom, in contrast, is utterly dull, lacking any edge or humor. Ultimately, neither character is likable or compelling.",

Despite getting close to the end, I couldn’t bring myself to finish it. The story failed to hold my interest, and I found myself completely disengaged.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There is no character development whatsoever. Dom and Maddie remain flat and uninteresting throughout the story. We only get a sliver of their personalities outside of their relationship, which makes it hard to care about what happens to them.  \n\n- **Character Likability:**  \n  Maddie is supposed to be funny, but I found her annoying, mean, and overly rude. Dom, on the other hand, is a total bore with no edge or humor. Neither character was likable or compelling.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamic (Enemies to Lovers Trope):**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers trope, which I usually enjoy, fell flat here. The transition from Maddie hating Dom to them having sex constantly felt abrupt and unconvincing. The romantic tension was poorly executed.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing, particularly the sex scenes, was some of the worst I’ve encountered. It lacked depth, creativity, and emotional resonance, making those moments feel awkward and unappealing.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The premise—Josh’s death and his instructions for Dom and Maddie to scatter his ashes across the USA—had potential but was poorly executed. The emotional weight of Josh’s death and the journey felt overshadowed by the lackluster romance and unlikable characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book failed to deliver on multiple fronts. The characters were unlikable and underdeveloped, the romance felt forced, and the writing was subpar.
