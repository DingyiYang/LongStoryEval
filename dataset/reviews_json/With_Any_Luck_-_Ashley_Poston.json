These flashbacks explain her ‚Äúfamily curse,‚Äù her relationship with the groom, and her previous encounter with the Man of Honor. All these elements come to light in time for the conclusion, adding depth to the characters.\n\n- **Ending and Ambiguity:**  \n  The ending felt a little ambiguous about the direction of the relationship. However, I think the point might be to compare the pattern of the FMC‚Äôs previous relationships to how she succeeds with her new interest. This ambiguity leaves room for interpretation and reflection.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novella delivers a well-rounded romance with engaging characters, a balanced plot, and meaningful backstory. While the ending is somewhat ambiguous, it adds a layer of complexity to the story, encouraging readers to reflect on the FMC‚Äôs growth and relationships.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

If it were longer, it would have been absolutely perfect and could have easily become my favorite.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI fell in love with this book. While the plot might not be revolutionary, the combination of the dual timelines, the charming characters, and the overall vibe made it a standout read for me. I adored it and only wish it had been longer to fully savor the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• (Highly positive, with a strong emotional connection to the story and characters.)"

I was obsessed with the concept of her curse‚Äîif she kisses someone, the next person they are with becomes their soulmate.  \n\n- **Character Development (Audrey):**  \n  Audrey, the heroine, is a fascinating character. I loved everything at the beginning related to her family and how her curse was portrayed. She is the best man at her best friend Rhett's wedding, which added a fun and unique dynamic to the story.  \n\n- **Focus and Pacing:**  \n  While the story was mostly fun, exciting, and unpredictable, I felt it leaned more toward Rhett's story than Audrey's. I wondered if there was enough time for Audrey to have a proper romance of her own.  \n\n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n  The story kept me guessing about who Audrey's romance would be with, which I appreciated. However, I felt a bit let down by the ending. It didn‚Äôt quite meet my expectations after such a strong start.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a highly enjoyable and creative story with a unique premise and engaging characters. While the ending was somewhat disappointing, the journey was fun and memorable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It added a dynamic and engaging rhythm to the narrative.  \n  - The concept of the characters running around town all day trying to find the groom, with flashes back to their previous meetings, was so compelling. It made me wish this was a full-length novel instead of a short story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - The characters, Love and Luck, were so endearing. I loved their dynamic and how their last names played into their relationship. It would be so cool to have the last name \"Love\" because it could double as a pet name and a regular nickname.  \n\n- **Potential for Expansion:**  \n  - I‚Äôm genuinely sad that this was only a short story. The premise and characters had so much potential to be explored in a regular-length novel. The idea of them navigating their quest together, with more depth and backstory, would have been amazing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a highly enjoyable read with a unique narrative structure and charming characters.

In *With Any Luck*, I appreciated how quickly we connected with the main characters, and the unexpected ending was a delightful surprise. *Rosy and the Dreamboat* by Sally Thorpe delivered excellent witty banter and absurdity, though I deducted a star for the caricature-like portrayal of the fireman.

Their dynamic as they search for the missing groom is engaging and adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story alternates between past and present, which creates a sense of development and complexity. This narrative technique makes the story feel longer and more fleshed out than its actual length.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe interplay between Audrey Love and Theo Luck, combined with the clever use of time shifts, makes this story feel rich and well-developed despite its brevity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Audrey, a woman from a lineage of lucky women who struggle with love. She believes that every kiss she shares leads the recipient to their soulmate the next day. When tasked with organizing her best friend Rhett‚Äôs bachelor party, things take a turn when she wakes up with a hangover to find Rhett missing. Fearing she kissed him and caused him to flee before his wedding to Carmella, Audrey teams up with Theo, Carmella‚Äôs maid of honor and her former fling, to retrace their steps. As the plot unfolds, Audrey realizes she didn‚Äôt kiss Rhett; instead, she sabotaged his relationship out of fear of being alone. The story culminates with Rhett and Carmella eloping, while Audrey and Theo discover they are meant for each other. The narrative is engaging, effectively maintaining suspense around Rhett‚Äôs disappearance. The pacing strikes a balance between tension, humor, and romance, while the use of flashbacks and fragmented memories enriches Audrey‚Äôs character and the overall plot.",
            "Audrey is a superstitious and self-aware character, whose deep loyalty to her friends is central to the narrative. Her internal battle with loneliness and fear of abandonment propels much of the story. Theo, patient and understanding, shares a profound connection with Audrey that unfolds as the plot develops. Meanwhile, Rhett and Carmella‚Äôs relationship is examined through Audrey‚Äôs eyes, revealing their genuine love alongside Rhett‚Äôs uncertainties about the wedding.",

The story delves into friendship, loyalty, and the journey of self-discovery through relationships. The names \"Audrey Love\" and \"Theo Luck\" poignantly reflect the characters' paths and their eventual embrace of love and fortune in their lives."

            "The story unfolds in a dual timeline, alternating between the present-day wedding and the bachelor party the night before. It evokes memories of *The Hangover*, particularly with the groom's disappearance and the ensuing search, a nod the author cleverly includes. The dual timeline is effective, but I would have liked to see a deeper exploration of Theo and Audrey's past interactions, as their connection is central to the narrative. The pacing is sharp and engaging, keeping me invested throughout. While the novella format is effective, I believe the story has the potential to be expanded into a full-length novel, which would allow for richer character and relationship development.",

However, the ending felt incomplete. The protagonist‚Äôs uncertainty about whether the guy who kissed her is her soulmate or if he‚Äôll meet his true love shortly after left me wanting more closure.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The protagonist‚Äôs internal conflict and her valid fear based on her track record were well-portrayed, making her relatable and sympathetic.  \n\n- **Ending Satisfaction:**  \n  I disliked the open-ended nature of the conclusion. The lack of a definitive resolution left me frustrated, as I prefer knowing whether the characters end up together rather than leaving it up to interpretation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was cute and emotionally engaging, with a unique premise that kept me hooked.

The author even references the movie twice in the book, which added to my worry. However, the story took a different direction, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story ended up being really cute and enjoyable. However, it felt too short, and I noticed that a lot of details were left out, which was a bit disappointing.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its shortcomings, the book was a super fun Valentine‚Äôs treat! It left me with a warm and happy feeling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story felt rushed and lacked some depth, it was a delightful and charming read, perfect for Valentine‚Äôs Day.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n‚ô•Ô∏è (No specific numerical rating was provided, but the heart emoji suggests a positive sentiment.)"

We get to see that in snippets here, though it felt more suited to a short story than a full-length novel.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows Audrey and Theo, who are the Best Man and Maid of Honour (respectively) at their best friends' wedding. They have a history of a one-night stand, which adds an interesting dynamic to the story. Audrey's belief that she is the kind of person you kiss before finding the love of your life is a major theme throughout.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  While this was just okay for me and felt very middle of the road, I enjoyed it enough to recommend picking it up. It wasn‚Äôt my favorite, but it was good enough for a light read.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and Amazon Original Stories for providing an e-ARC of this anthology. All thoughts are my own and not influenced in any way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had its moments, particularly in Poston's writing and characterization, but overall, it felt like a story better suited to a shorter format.

It cleverly weaves in popular romance tropes, including a fling that turns into forever, the maid of honor and best man falling for each other, and a reunion romance. Adding an element of intrigue, the plot unfolds as Theo and Audrey race against time to locate the missing groom, Rhett, just two hours before the ceremony.",

Theo's character suggests he may be on the autism spectrum, yet this contradicts his ease in seducing women, including Audrey. Both characters exhibit immaturity and self-destructive behavior, resembling binge-drinking college students despite being in their late 20s.",

It‚Äôs hard to make a significant impact with such a short story.  \n\n- **Character Engagement:**  \n  The main characters just weren‚Äôt my favorite, which made it difficult to care about the story. They didn‚Äôt resonate with me as much as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the lack of connection with the characters, the story was still okay and cute overall. It had its moments, but it didn‚Äôt stand out as much as the author‚Äôs longer works.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Releases:**  \n  I‚Äôm very excited for her new release coming out this summer. Her longer content is amazing, and I‚Äôm looking forward to diving into more of her work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novella was a quick and cute read, it didn‚Äôt leave a lasting impression due to its short length and characters that didn‚Äôt fully engage me. However, I remain a fan of the author and am eagerly anticipating her upcoming release.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è"

I enjoyed his character as well.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  - I enjoyed the story and how Audrey and Theo had a past connection but never forgot each other.  \n  - The fact that they had been together before added depth to their relationship.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narration:**  \n  - The single point of view (Audrey's) worked well for me, even though it limited the perspective.  \n  - The narration revolved heavily around Audrey's thoughts, which sometimes felt repetitive, especially regarding her belief that she had kissed Rhett.  \n\n- **Moral and Ethical Concerns:**  \n  - I was bothered by Audrey thinking she had kissed Rhett, as it crossed ethical boundaries. Rhett was engaged, they were best friends, and he was getting married the next day. This aspect felt uncomfortable and slightly disrupted the flow of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed the novel. The characters were well-developed and engaging, and the storyline was compelling despite some ethical concerns. The single POV worked for me, though the repetitive focus on Audrey's thoughts about Rhett was a minor drawback.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25/5 ü´Ç"

Some stories were stronger and more engaging than others. I appreciated the little references and nods to the other stories, such as characters knowing each other, shared locations, and events.

Starting with her short story was a great introduction. Poston‚Äôs use of magical realism was evident in the main character, Audrey, and it added charm to the story. I loved the setting and the author‚Äôs writing style. The romance between Audrey and Theo immediately hooked me, especially with the frequent allusions to their brief history. Friendship was a major theme, and I enjoyed how it was portrayed. However, the ending felt anti-climactic, and I wished Audrey and Theo‚Äôs relationship had more time to develop if the story were longer. Overall, I liked it and gave it 3 stars.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the anthology had its strengths, such as interconnected references and a few standout stories, it struggled with pacing and over-condensation in many of the tales.

            "This novella centers on Audrey ‚ÄúAudie‚Äù Love, who believes she is cursed to be the girl guys kiss before they find true love. The plot follows her reunion with Theo Luck at a wedding, after a previous one-night stand, as they embark on a mission to locate the missing groom, Rhett. However, the story deviates from the traditional ‚Äúmeet-cute‚Äù format, as their initial encounter occurs off-page, making their reunion the focal point instead. While the novella's brisk pacing suits its short length, it ultimately feels incomplete due to the absence of a proper meet-cute and a lack of emotional depth in character exploration.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n   - The novella is the fifth installment in *The Improbable Meet-Cute* series, featuring Audrey ‚ÄúAudie‚Äù Love, who believes she is cursed to be the girl guys kiss before finding their true love.  \n   - The story revolves around Audrey and Theo Luck, who reunite at a wedding after a prior one-night stand. Their mission to find the missing groom, Rhett, forms the central plot.  \n   - The concept of a ‚Äúmeet-cute‚Äù is not fully adhered to, as the first encounter between Audrey and Theo occurs off-page, making their reunion the focus rather than a traditional meet-cute.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Audrey is portrayed as a relatable and self-aware protagonist, avoiding commitment due to her belief in her ‚Äúkissing curse.‚Äù  \n   - Theo Luck is introduced as Carmilla‚Äôs best friend and Audrey‚Äôs love interest, but his character lacks depth and emotional connection with Audrey.  \n   - The dynamic between Audrey and Theo feels underdeveloped, with their relationship progression feeling rushed and lacking emotional resonance.  \n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n   - The novella‚Äôs pacing is quick, fitting for its short length, but the story feels incomplete due to the lack of a proper meet-cute and insufficient exploration of the characters‚Äô emotions.  \n   - The author missed an opportunity to enhance the story by including a flashback of Audrey and Theo‚Äôs first encounter, which would have added depth and emotional weight to their reunion.  \n   - The inclusion of Princess Illaria as a potential wedding guest feels like a forced connection to the series‚Äô overarching narrative, particularly referencing the final novella, *Royal Valentine*.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n   - The novella reminded me of Lucy Score‚Äôs *The Worst Best Man*, which I rated a 2/5. Both stories share similar themes but suffer from underdeveloped relationships and lackluster execution.  \n   - Compared to other novellas in *The Improbable Meet-Cute* series, this installment falls short, earning a 3/5 rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*With Any Luck* is a light, quick read with an interesting premise but fails to deliver on the promise of a true meet-cute.

            "The story centers on the female main character (FMC), who serves as the Best Man at her best friend's wedding. After a wild bachelor party, the groom goes missing, and the FMC, having consumed too much alcohol, struggles to recall the events of the night. The plot becomes muddled with unclear romantic interests‚Äîwhether she has feelings for the groom or the Maid of Honor, the bride's male best friend, with whom she had a one-night stand during a bridal shower trip to New Orleans.\n\nAdditionally, the narrative introduces a curse: anyone who kisses the FMC will find their true love the next day. This premise raises logical questions, such as whether she has never kissed anyone more than once. The story's believability falters, particularly with the FMC's memory loss and her subsequent quest to retrace her steps to locate the groom, which feels unrealistic. \n\nWhile the curse concept is intriguing, it lacks thorough exploration and logical consistency, leaving its validity and impact on the plot in doubt. The pacing is uneven, with multiple subplots‚Äîsuch as the one-night stand, the curse, and the missing groom‚Äîcompeting for attention, resulting in a disjointed narrative that can be difficult to follow.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The story revolves around the FMC (female main character), who is the Best Man at her best friend's wedding. The groom goes missing after a bachelor party where the FMC consumed too much alcohol and can't remember anything after a certain point. The plot becomes convoluted with unclear romantic interests‚Äîwhether it's the groom (her best friend) or the Maid of Honor (the bride's male best friend), with whom the FMC had a one-night stand during the bridal shower trip to New Orleans. The story also introduces a \"curse\" where anyone who kisses the FMC finds their true love the next day, which raises logical questions (e.g., has she never kissed anyone more than once?).  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The FMC is portrayed as someone who believes she is cursed, which adds an interesting layer to her character. However, her actions and decisions, such as her inability to recall key events due to excessive drinking, make her seem unreliable and less relatable. The male characters, including the groom and the Maid of Honor, lack depth, and their roles in the story feel underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Believability and Logic:**  \n  The story struggles with believability. The FMC's memory loss and the subsequent events, including the trek to retrace her steps to find the groom, feel unrealistic. The \"curse\" concept, while intriguing, isn't well-explored or logically consistent, leaving the reader questioning its validity and impact on the plot.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing feels uneven, with too many subplots (e.g., the one-night stand, the curse, the missing groom) competing for attention. This makes the story feel disjointed and hard to follow at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had potential with its unique premise and quirky elements like the \"curse,\" but it fell short due to an overly convoluted plot, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of believability. The story struggled to maintain my interest, and the unresolved logical inconsistencies made it difficult to fully engage with the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars"

However, the plot feels rushed, a consequence of its novelette format, which crams too many side plots into a limited space. The narrative's frequent time jumps detract from the overall coherence, making it challenging to engage with the story. Additionally, the storyline is highly predictable; I figured out the groom's whereabouts almost immediately after his disappearance. The narrative would have benefited from a longer format, either by narrowing its focus or expanding into a novella. The hurried pacing and insufficient exploration of the characters and their dynamics left me wanting more.",

However, I wouldn‚Äôt fully believe it the way she did.  \n   - The idea that Audrey thought Rhett would find the love of his life and run away from his wedding within a few hours of their kiss felt very self-centered and unrealistic. It seemed like she overestimated her influence, as if she had that much power.  \n\n- **Character Consistency and Development:**  \n   - Audrey‚Äôs belief that Rhett would ditch his wedding for another woman didn‚Äôt align with her supposed knowledge of him as her best friend of many years. Rhett didn‚Äôt seem like the type of guy to do that, yet she was convinced he did.  \n   - Theo‚Äôs behavior was also inconsistent. He noticed Rhett was missing but didn‚Äôt realize his own best friend, the bride, was also missing. This felt unrealistic and out of character for someone who was supposed to care deeply about her.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n   - Theo and Audrey were cute together, and their relationship added a sweet element to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Readability:**  \n   - The book was a very simple and easy read, which made it enjoyable in that regard.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story had a fun and lighthearted premise, the characters‚Äô actions and motivations often felt inconsistent and unrealistic.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story begins with Audrey waking up on the couch in her room at the Bed & Breakfast, only to be interrupted by Theo, the Bride's Maid of Honor, who is searching for the missing groom. The narrative includes flashback chapters that help fill in the gaps in Audrey's memory. The pacing is quick, making it a short and easy read that doesn‚Äôt demand much time.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Audrey is portrayed as hungover and not fully functional, which adds to her quirky and somewhat chaotic personality. She believes she cursed the groom by kissing him the night before his wedding, reflecting her superstitious and self-critical nature. Theo, on the other hand, is depicted as patient and understanding, which contrasts well with Audrey's erratic behavior.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The story explores themes of self-doubt and superstition, as Audrey is convinced her \"luck\" won't change. The tone is light and humorous, despite the underlying tension of the missing groom and Audrey's guilt.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I found the book engaging due to its quirky characters and the mystery surrounding the groom's disappearance. While it wasn‚Äôt a deeply complex read, it was enjoyable and kept me entertained throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a light, quick read with a mix of humor and mystery. The characters, particularly Audrey and Theo, are well-developed and add charm to the story. While it‚Äôs not a time-consuming or overly intricate book, it‚Äôs an enjoyable and entertaining experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The premise is cute and engaging, with a strong focus on romantic comedy elements.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The chemistry between the main characters is strong, adding depth and charm to the story. Their interactions and relationship development are highlights of the narrative.  \n\n- **Format and Narration:**  \n  The story is part of the Amazon Original Stories \"The Improbable Meet-Cute\" collection, available on Kindle and Audible. However, I didn‚Äôt enjoy the audiobook narration, which detracted from my overall experience.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  The story includes open bedroom scenes with sexually explicit content, which may not appeal to all readers. It‚Äôs a short romantic comedy with a lighthearted tone, but the explicit content is worth noting for those who prefer cleaner reads.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"With Any Luck\" is a cute and entertaining romantic comedy with a unique premise and strong character chemistry. While the story itself is enjoyable, the audiobook narration fell short for me, and the explicit content may not suit all readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This added a layer of mystery and kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Series Comparison:**  \n  While I enjoyed this book, it‚Äôs not my #1 favorite from the Improbable Meet-Cute Series.

The unique plot concept and the mystery surrounding the groom‚Äôs disappearance made it an enjoyable read, though it didn‚Äôt top my list within the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

This dynamic added an enjoyable layer to the story.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  While the book wasn‚Äôt outstanding, it also wasn‚Äôt bad.

I would have appreciated more clarity on this aspect.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was enjoyable and had its charming moments, I felt it could have been longer and provided a clearer resolution. Despite these shortcomings, it was a fun and lighthearted read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 to 2.75 out of 5."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  As a long-time fan of Ashley Poston's work, I had high expectations for \"With Any Luck,\" especially since I‚Äôve always rated her books 5 stars. Unfortunately, this novella fell short of my hopes. It lacked the creativity and charm I associate with her writing, leaving me disappointed.\n\n- **Plot Originality:**  \n  The story felt like a PG-rated retread of the movie \"Good Luck Chuck,\" with striking similarities to both \"Good Luck Chuck\" and \"The Hangover.\" I was hoping for something fresh and unique, but the plot offered nothing new, making it feel unoriginal and uninspired.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters lacked the depth and originality I‚Äôve come to expect from Ashley Poston. They felt flat and underdeveloped, which made it hard to connect with them or care about their journey.\n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  The dialogue felt recycled and lacked the wit and spark that usually make Poston‚Äôs stories engaging. It didn‚Äôt contribute to building the characters or advancing the plot in a meaningful way.\n\n- **Tone and Genre Execution:**  \n  While I appreciate the attempt at a light-hearted rom-com, the execution fell flat. The story didn‚Äôt deliver the fresh, engaging narrative I know Ashley is capable of, and it ended up feeling like a rehash of familiar tropes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, \"With Any Luck\" was a letdown compared to Ashley Poston‚Äôs previous works. It lacked the originality, character depth, and engaging dialogue that I‚Äôve come to love in her writing. While I remain a fan, I hope her next contribution returns to the brilliance I know and love.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n‚≠ê‚≠ê/5 Stars"

The release timing, however, felt a bit off, as the story‚Äôs themes seemed more suited for Valentine‚Äôs Day.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This might have influenced my disappointment, as the story didn‚Äôt meet the bar I had set.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works in the Series:**  \n  This book is part of a series of six novellas/short stories by various authors in the RomCom genre. While I read them in order, they are mostly standalone, connected only by occasional mentions of a spa or person. In terms of my enjoyment, I‚Äôd rank them as follows:  \n  1. *The Exception to the Rule* by Christina Lauren (really cute)  \n  2. *Rosie and the Dreamboat* by Sally Thorne (utterly ridiculous and sweet)  \n  3. *Worst Wingman Ever* by Abby Jimenez (sweet but clouded by grandma‚Äôs impending death)  \n  4. *Drop, Cover, and Roll* by Jasmine Guillory (meh)  \n  5. *With Any Luck* by Ashley Poston (most disappointing)  \n  6. *Royal Valentine* by Sariah Wilson (plain idiotic, sorry)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a letdown. While the premise was clever and I‚Äôm a fan of the author, the execution didn‚Äôt deliver.

            "The story follows Audrey Love, a woman cursed in romance, often finding herself as the \"before girl\"‚Äîthe one men date before discovering their true love. Despite her romantic misfortunes, Audrey excels in other aspects of her life. The plot intensifies when she serves as the best man at her best friend's wedding and is forced to collaborate with Theo Luck, the maid of honor and the man with whom she shared a passionate night in New Orleans. The narrative takes a dramatic turn when the groom goes missing after a wild bachelor party, prompting Audrey and Theo to retrace their steps from the previous night in a race against time to find him before the wedding. The pacing is brisk, focusing on the events leading up to the wedding, and employs flashbacks that add depth to the story, though it can feel somewhat rushed. The conclusion features a twist: the bride and groom elope, leaving Audrey and Theo to navigate their rekindled feelings amidst the aftermath. While the ending resolves key plot points, it leaves some romantic tension unresolved, which may resonate with fans of open-ended conclusions.",

It felt like a missed opportunity to create a more immersive experience.\n- **Writing (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ):** The writing style was solid and consistent with Poston‚Äôs usual flair, but it didn‚Äôt shine as brightly here, possibly because of the rushed pacing.\n- **Plot (‚òÖ‚òÖ):** The storyline felt overcrowded, especially with the inclusion of a love triangle. It was hard to fully explore or appreciate the plot within the limited page count.\n- **Intrigue (‚òÖ‚òÖ):** The story lacked the usual pull I expect from Poston‚Äôs work. It didn‚Äôt keep me as engaged or curious as I would have liked.\n- **Logic (‚òÖ‚òÖ):** Some elements of the story felt forced or unrealistic, particularly in how the relationships and conflicts were resolved.\n- **Enjoyment (‚òÖ):** Unfortunately, this novella didn‚Äôt bring me much joy. It felt like a letdown compared to the other works in the series.\n- **Pacing (‚òÖ‚òÖ):** The pacing was uneven, with too much crammed into too few pages. This made the story feel rushed and incomplete.\n- **Dialogue (‚òÖ‚òÖ):** The conversations between characters were okay but didn‚Äôt have the depth or spark I usually enjoy in Poston‚Äôs writing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I‚Äôm a big fan of Ashley Poston, this novella fell short of my expectations. The constraints of the format made it difficult to fully develop the characters, plot, and relationships, resulting in a story that felt rushed and underwhelming. Despite this, I still recommend her other novels, as this novella doesn‚Äôt reflect her usual brilliance.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Overall Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ / 2.38  \n- Characters: ‚òÖ‚òÖ  \n- Atmosphere: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  \n- Writing: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  \n- Plot: ‚òÖ‚òÖ  \n- Intrigue: ‚òÖ‚òÖ  \n- Logic: ‚òÖ‚òÖ  \n- Enjoyment: ‚òÖ  \n- Pacing: ‚òÖ‚òÖ  \n- Dialogue: ‚òÖ‚òÖ  \n\n**Content Warnings:** Sexual Content, Alcohol, Cursing, Infidelity"

The enemies-to-lovers trope was appealing, but the inclusion of a third person slightly ruined the mood for me.  \n  - The wedding scene felt unnecessary; I would have preferred a simpler setting, like a vacation, to keep the focus on their evolving relationship.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The dialogue and interactions, like the kiss scene, were intense and vivid, capturing the raw emotions between the characters. However, the occasional shift to a slightly third-person perspective disrupted my immersion in the story.  \n\n- **Personal Preference:**  \n  - I‚Äôm not typically drawn to this type of romance, so my enjoyment was limited by my personal taste rather than the story itself.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Theo and Audry‚Äôs relationship had its charming moments, the inclusion of a third person and the wedding setting detracted from my enjoyment. The enemies-to-lovers dynamic was engaging, but the story could have benefited from a more focused and intimate approach.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (3/5)"

This moment completely disrupted the good vibes I was feeling.  \n  - The fact that she was so drunk she couldn‚Äôt remember the encounter and only recalled the amount of tequila she consumed made the situation even more unsettling.  \n  - Her initial confusion, thinking she had kissed her best friend instead, added to the discomfort of the scene.  \n\n- **Ethical Concerns:**  \n  - Theo‚Äôs actions were highly problematic. Taking advantage of someone who was clearly too drunk to consent or even remember what happened is morally wrong.  \n  - The situation left me feeling disappointed and frustrated, as it undermined the integrity of the characters and the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel started off strong, but the inclusion of this ethically questionable scene significantly dampened my enjoyment. The portrayal of such a moment felt unnecessary and detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The rushed pacing and lack of emotional depth in the relationship made it difficult to enjoy.

The ideas were there, but they weren‚Äôt fully realized or explored in a satisfying way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had promising elements, its ambitious plot and underdeveloped characters left me wanting more. The lack of context and backstory, combined with unclear character dynamics, made it difficult to fully engage with the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Expectations and Context:**\n   - I chose this book for a buddy read with Roxy, selecting it because it had Ashley Poston, an author Roxy used to fangirl over after reading *The Dead Romantics*. We were excited, but the experience turned out to be a disaster.\n   - I had not read anything by Ashley Poston before, but I now believe she cannot write short stories effectively.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Audrey, the protagonist, was poorly written. By the end of the book, I found her so irritating that I wanted to give her a \"backhanded slap.\"\n   - The male characters were forgettable and underdeveloped. The \"ginger guy\" (whose name I can‚Äôt even recall) seemed one-dimensional and, based on the rushed ending, likely terrible at sex.\n   - Rhett, another character, felt unnecessary and confusing. His presence in the story didn‚Äôt add value, and his role was unclear.\n\n- **Romance and Pacing:**\n   - The romance was unconvincing. The characters fell in love within 15 pages, which felt rushed and unrealistic.\n   - Audrey‚Äôs obsession with Rhett dominated her inner monologue, making the romance feel forced and poorly executed.\n\n- **Plot and Logic:**\n   - The plot was illogical. Audrey spent 30 pages believing she had kissed her best friend the day before his wedding, which made no sense given their supposedly sibling-like relationship.\n   - The story lacked coherence and depth, making it hard to connect with or care about the characters or their relationships.\n\n- **Overall Execution:**\n   - The book was a \"total complete utter disaster.\" The writing, pacing, and character development were all poorly executed.\n   - Despite this negative experience, I am willing to give Ashley Poston another chance with *The Dead Romantics* or *The Seven Year Slip*, as I won‚Äôt judge her solely based on this book.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a major disappointment. The characters were poorly developed, the romance felt rushed and unrealistic, and the plot lacked logic and depth. While I won‚Äôt judge Ashley Poston entirely based on this one work, I found this particular story to be a complete failure.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n1.00 (as mentioned in the original review)."

Her one-night stand, Theo, informs her that Rhett, her best friend and groom, is missing, prompting a frantic search. As Audrey recalls kissing Rhett, complications arise from her curse: anyone who kisses her discovers their true love. Rhett's disappearance hints that his true love may not be Carmilla, his fianc√©e. The plot twist reveals that Audrey actually kissed Theo and they had sex while she was blackout drunk, raising significant concerns about consent.",

Although she insists they share a sibling-like bond and claims to have no romantic feelings for him, her actions and thoughts tell a different story. She seems to idolize Rhett more than her actual love interest, Theo, which is both inconsistent and frustrating. Her advice to Rhett about fleeing his wedding, coupled with her internal struggle about loneliness after he marries Carmilla, adds to the unsettling nature of their dynamic.",

            "The story feels rushed and underdeveloped, likely due to its brief length of 40 pages. The male lead is particularly lacking in depth, leaving me with little understanding of his character. Exposition about the characters is awkwardly inserted rather than unfolding naturally. Interestingly, the relationship between the protagonist and her best friend is more fleshed out than her connection with the love interest, leading me to wonder if she might end up with her best friend instead. The absence of a proper meet-cute is disappointing, as the characters already know each other at the story's outset, which diminishes the romantic tension. Additionally, there are unanswered questions regarding the curse‚Äîspecifically, how the women in the family continue to have children if they are cursed. Are the fathers or grandfathers involved? A brief explanation would have clarified this. The open-door sex scene, which occurs while the female lead is blacked out drunk, feels problematic and unnecessary. Finally, the novella lacks a follow-up scene to confirm whether the curse is truly broken and if the couple remains together, missing an opportunity for closure.",

She loses the groom, abandons her responsibilities, gets blackout drunk the night before the wedding, and doesn‚Äôt wake up until 4 PM on the wedding day.  \n   - Her actions and behavior make her an unreliable and unlikable character in this context.  \n\n- **Portrayal of the Love Interest (Theo):**  \n   - Theo, the supposed love interest, is also poorly portrayed. He and Audrey have a history, but his past refusal to kiss her on the lips and his decision to have sex with her while she is blackout drunk in the present make him an unsympathetic character.  \n   - Their relationship lacks depth and is tainted by questionable decisions and lack of mutual respect.  \n\n- **Overall Story and Themes:**  \n   - The story is marketed as a love story between Audrey and Theo, but it devolves into a narrative about Audrey‚Äôs unhealthy obsession with Rhett.  \n   - The themes of friendship, love, and loyalty are poorly executed, leaving the reader frustrated and disappointed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel fails to deliver a compelling or coherent love story.

However, it hasn‚Äôt dampened my excitement for other books like *The Seven Year Flip*, *The Dead Romantics*, and *A Novel Love Story*, which are on my physical TBR for 2025.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the premise of *With Any Luck* had potential, the execution fell short due to an unlikable protagonist, imbalanced character dynamics, and poor pacing. Despite this negative experience, I remain excited to explore other works by the author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Moral and Ethical Concerns:**  \n  The novella presents a significant issue with dubious consent, which is deeply troubling. The romantic twist hinges on the main character being blackout drunk and unable to remember having sex with the love interest. This scenario is not romantic but rather horrifying, especially since the love interest took advantage of her while she was emotionally vulnerable and intoxicated.  \n\n- **Character Development (Love Interest):**  \n  The love interest is portrayed as manipulative and morally questionable. Instead of being honest about what happened, he allows the main character to believe she kissed her best friend the night before his wedding, which drove the friend away. This behavior is framed as charming, which is problematic and adds to the character's unlikability.  \n\n- **Pacing and Execution:**  \n  Despite the novella being only forty pages long, the author manages to create a character who is deeply flawed and off-putting in such a short span. This raises questions about the story's pacing and the choices made in developing the narrative.  \n\n- **Editorial Oversight:**  \n  It‚Äôs baffling how such a problematic storyline made it past a team of editors. The ethical implications of the plot should have been addressed during the editing process.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novella‚Äôs handling of consent and its portrayal of the love interest are deeply unsettling. The story‚Äôs attempt to frame morally questionable behavior as romantic is not only ineffective but also disturbing. The brevity of the novella exacerbates these issues, making the narrative feel rushed and poorly executed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores are mentioned in the review, but the tone strongly suggests a negative evaluation."

Theo, on the other hand, seemed to exist solely to be annoying and cause conflict between Audrey and Rhett. In the end, Theo was indeed annoying, and I hated him.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Themes (Consent):**  \n  The lack of clear consent, or the blurred lines around it, made me uncomfortable. It was hard to believe that someone could forget an entire night together, be kissed, suddenly remember everything, and then be convinced that this person is their soulmate. Whether it‚Äôs due to superstition or previous ‚Äúchemistry,‚Äù I‚Äôm not buying it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a promising premise, its rushed execution, confusing character dynamics, and uncomfortable handling of consent detracted from the overall experience.

From the unlikeable characters and silly names to the unengaging plot and poor narration, I found little to enjoy. The romantic development was confusing, and the story didn‚Äôt deliver on the promise of an improbable meet-cute. Overall, it was a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
