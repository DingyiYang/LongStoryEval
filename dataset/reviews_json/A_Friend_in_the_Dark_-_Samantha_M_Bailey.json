It’s my favorite thriller of the year, and I feel like it deserves more hype.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Comparison:**  \n  The book gave me major Freida McFadden \"The Housemaid\" vibes, or Freida's writing style in general. It made me feel very similar throughout the whole book, and I didn’t want to put it down.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This is a psychological thriller with a touch of spice in the beginning that almost made me forget I was reading a thriller. However, once the story gets going, things become much more \"thriller-esque.\"  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Suspense:**  \n  I even got spooked in certain parts of the book and had to cuddle up with my boyfriend because it triggered a phobia of mine. I won’t reveal specifics to avoid spoilers, but I recommend checking trigger warnings.  \n\n- **Access and Release Details:**  \n  I got early access to this book from Amazon First Reads for February, and it officially came out on March 1st.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an exceptional psychological thriller that kept me hooked from start to finish. It combines suspense, emotional intensity, and a writing style reminiscent of Freida McFadden, making it a standout read for me this year.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

            "The premise of the story is intriguing: after Eden's husband abruptly leaves her, she reconnects with her college crush on Facebook, leading to an emotional and sexual online affair. However, strange occurrences soon unfold. I appreciated the twist that Olivia was the one messaging Eden; it added a fresh layer to the plot. While some twists—such as Madison being Ava wanting her parents to reunite, Dave's BDSM interests, Ava's disappearance, Justin drugging women, and Olivia and her brother's mental health issues—felt overwhelming for a short book, I was pleasantly surprised by how well-developed the narrative was within its 200 pages. The pacing was quick, making it a swift read of about 1.5 to 2 hours, and it held my interest throughout.",
            "I appreciated how Eden quickly recognized that Justin's messages and calls were off; I cannot stand poorly written characters. Justin is genuinely a terrible person, and at first, Olivia's perspective made it seem like she was merely trying to escape him. However, the Tyler subplot felt unnecessary and seemed tacked on, especially with so many other twists unfolding.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this thriller. It was engaging and fast-paced, keeping me hooked from start to finish. Even with its numerous twists, the story remained satisfying throughout.",
            "The twist of Olivia messaging Eden was refreshing and distinct from other thrillers I've encountered. However, elements of Olivia’s struggle to escape Justin felt reminiscent of a different thriller I recently read."

While some plotlines felt unnecessary and the sheer number of twists was overwhelming at times, the story was well-developed, fast-paced, and kept me engaged. The unique twist involving Olivia messaging Eden stood out, making it a memorable read.",

However, once the story picked up, it became engaging with numerous twists and turns that kept me hooked.  \n\n- **Plot and Suspense:**  \n  The plot was unpredictable, and I couldn’t decide who the bad guy was or what was going to happen next. The suspense was well-maintained, and it kept me guessing until the very end.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I appreciated that the main character (MC) was 45 years old, which is refreshing compared to most psychological thrillers that focus on younger protagonists. The MC is recently separated, has a daughter who hates her, and is essentially going through a midlife crisis when her life takes a dramatic and devastating turn.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  Overall, I really liked this book. It was a quick read for me, taking only a couple of days to finish. Despite the slow start, the story became captivating and held my interest throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an enjoyable and engaging psychological thriller with a refreshingly mature protagonist. While it started slowly, the twists and turns in the plot kept me guessing until the end. The character’s midlife crisis and personal struggles added depth to the story, making it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel unfolds through the perspectives of Eden and Olivia, illuminating how each woman copes with her broken relationships. Eden is lonely and overly accommodating, often allowing others to take advantage of her. I found it frustrating to witness the way her daughter spoke to her, diminishing her self-worth. In contrast, Olivia feels like a mere shadow of her former self, eliciting deep sympathy for the struggles she has faced throughout her life. I harbored a strong mistrust of Justin, wanting Eden to recognize his true nature; I disliked him intensely and couldn't comprehend the charm that appeared to blind both Eden and Olivia. There were moments when Eden’s choices left me exasperated, pushing me to the verge of wanting to shake her and scream. Yet, her vulnerability made her actions both understandable and relatable.",

The story gained traction as it went, and just before halfway through, it became more of a page-turner.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Eden was the perfect character to tell this story, as her experience as a newly divorced (or separated) woman in her mid-forties felt authentic. By the end of the story, it felt like Eden came to understand herself a little better.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The focus was heavily on Eden and Justin’s relationship, which revolved heavily around sexting. The author did a good job of holding the reader's attention, given that the characters' interactions mostly weren’t in person.  \n\n- **Writing and Scenes:**  \n  There were some great scenes that portrayed various aspects of Eden’s life and the problems she faced. However, a few scenes felt overly drawn out, which made the action lull at times.  \n\n- **Ending and Twists:**  \n  The story came together neatly and was packaged up at the end, with a decent twist.

The premise is compelling, showcasing Eden's life spiraling following her divorce and her reconnection with an old college crush.

Her ex-husband is taken aback, her daughter is frustrated, and her friends are surprised by her choices, all while she faces repercussions at work. Tensions rise further when her daughter goes missing. Although I anticipated who Eden was really texting, I enjoyed the misdirection that suggested she was in contact with her crush.

            "I was left ambivalent about Eden. While she appears to be a devoted wife and mother, there’s something unsettling about her character. Eden is grappling with a mid-life crisis: her daughter, Ava, is estranged, her husband wants a divorce, and she feels utterly alone, convinced she is the root of her problems. Their relationship lacks a cohesive development; for example, it's unclear how Ava knows whom her mother is speaking to. Their tensions existed long before Ava left for college, yet the narrative doesn't convincingly connect Ava's animosity to the divorce. It seems the divorce becomes the tipping point, but later, it feels as if Ava’s resentment solely arises from Eden’s new relationship.",

However, I'm glad I didn't DNF (Did Not Finish) because I ended up really enjoying it.\n\n- **Character Development (Eden):**\n   - I couldn't decide if I really liked Eden or not. She seemed to be a dedicated wife and mother, but something about her felt off to me. Eden is in the middle of a mid-life crisis—her daughter kinda-sorta hates her, her husband wants a divorce, and she has nobody to lean on. She believes she is the problem in her life.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**\n   - On the night of her birthday, Eden reconnects with her college crush—or does she? (LOL) This relationship further complicates her life. Her (ex)husband is shocked, her daughter can't stand her, her friends are shocked by her decisions, and she even faces reprimand at work. Things escalate when her daughter goes missing.\n\n- **Character Relationships (Eden and Ava):**\n   - There were aspects of the relationship between Eden and her daughter, Ava, that didn’t align cohesively for me. For instance, why does Ava know who her mom is talking to? Their relationship was already tumultuous before Ava went to college, but there was no clear indication that Ava disliked her mom because of the divorce. The divorce seemed to be the final straw for Ava, but towards the end, it’s portrayed as if Ava’s dislike stems solely from Eden’s new relationship.\n\n- **Realism and Suspension of Disbelief:**\n   - Some elements, like using a voice changer while talking on the phone, didn’t feel realistic to me. However, I was willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of the story.\n\n- **Twists and Engagement:**\n   - I figured out who Eden was really texting, but I appreciated the misdirection that led us to believe she was talking to her college crush. Tyler seemed like a great guy—RIP. Overall, the book kept me engaged and was a quick, enjoyable read.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite some inconsistencies and moments that required suspension of disbelief, I found this book to be one of the better Kindle books I’ve read so far.

Eden sees this as a chance for a do-over, a way to explore how her life could have been if she’d ended up with Justin.  \n\n- **Tension and Suspense:**  \n   - Things quickly get weird when Justin knows too much about Eden—more than he should from just her profile.  \n   - Torn between keeping her guard up and exploring something new and exciting, Eden must separate reality from fantasy before things take a deadly turn.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n   - I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick and fun thriller!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a fast-paced, engaging thriller with a relatable protagonist and a plot that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The writing style is reminiscent of Freida McFadden, and the story’s twists and tension make it a perfect binge-read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their decisions and actions often felt unrealistic, which took away from my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, it was fine—a quick read that had its moments, but nothing extraordinary. There were definitely some eye-roll moments that made it hard to fully appreciate.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an interesting premise and theme, the predictable plot, rushed ending, and frustrating character decisions made it a mediocre read. It was entertaining enough for a quick read but didn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The twists added a thrilling layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  At less than 250 pages, it was a quick and easy read, which I appreciated. The pacing kept the story moving without dragging.  \n\n- **Character Development and Realism:**  \n  The ending, where Ava confessed things to her mom, felt unrealistic to me. Given her situation on a stretcher, it didn’t seem plausible for her to be talking so freely.  \n  Justin’s fate was satisfying—he got exactly what he deserved. As for Olivia, her actions left me shaking my head—she was a mess.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Friend in the Dark* is a wild, intense ride filled with psychological suspense and shocking twists. While the ending felt a bit unrealistic, the overall story was engaging and kept me on edge. The characters, especially Justin and Olivia, left a strong impression, though not always for the best reasons.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book was a quick read that began on a strong note, took an unexpected turn, and concluded in a chaotic yet enjoyable manner. The ending was thrilling, although some elements felt implausible. The premise of Eden reigniting her relationship with her college crush, Justin Ward, was compelling and boosted her confidence. However, the middle of the story lacked cohesion, as Olivia's actions often felt illogical and hard to relate to. While the climax was exciting, it pushed the boundaries of believability in terms of Justin and Olivia's storyline.",
            "Eden Miller is a thoughtfully crafted character, navigating the challenges of her uncommunicative husband and a daughter who blames her for the marriage's collapse. However, the shift to Olivia Ward's perspective falters; her choices lack authenticity, making it difficult to empathize with her. While the author is adept at portraying characters drawn from personal experience, she struggles to bring depth to those outside her familiar realm.",

It seemed the author overextended in trying to create shock value, resulting in a muddled narrative that confused me more than it surprised me. The overall experience was exhausting. Although the book is relatively short, it took me longer to read than expected because I struggled to engage with the implausible plotlines. Multiple times I had to reread sections that either made no sense or were so absurd they left me in disbelief. ",

The plot and twists were so completely disjointed that I’m still not sure I understood what happened. It felt like the author tried too hard to create twists and shock the reader, but instead, she threw a ton of convoluted text on the page, confusing the reader into thinking they were caught off guard. My head hurts just thinking about it.  \n\n- **Character Development and Likability:**  \n  The characters were extremely unlikeable—literally every single one of them. The FMC (female main character) made such mind-blowingly terrible decisions that it physically made me cringe.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  While the book is reasonably short, it took me longer to read than it should have because I couldn’t stay focused on the unrealistic plotlines. There were so many times I had to re-read parts because they either made zero sense or were so incredibly ridiculous that I was genuinely in shock.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Overall Impression:**  \n  I enjoyed the story at first, but the issues with the plot and characters overshadowed that initial enjoyment. I’m very grateful the book is less than 300 pages.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes untreated mental health issues, extreme domestic violence, and some X-rated material.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential at the start, its disjointed plot, unlikeable characters, and overly convoluted twists made it a frustrating read.

The narrative is engaging, with suspense and surprises that kept me intrigued. I initially thought I knew where the plot was heading, but I was pleasantly proven wrong.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**  \n  Toward the end of the story, the stakes were high, and I felt drawn into the intensity of the situation. However, the tension was occasionally undermined by melodrama, which detracted from the overall suspense.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Some characters lacked nuance, which made them feel less compelling. It seemed the author intentionally created unsympathetic characters to serve the story, but this approach didn’t resonate with me personally.  \n\n- **Personal Preference:**  \n  While the story had its strengths, it wasn’t my favorite kind of narrative. The combination of melodrama and underdeveloped characters made it less enjoyable for me overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel showcases the author’s talent for crafting suspenseful and surprising stories, but the melodrama and lack of nuanced characters detracted from my enjoyment. While I appreciated the unexpected twists, the story didn’t fully align with my personal preferences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot includes several twists, but many events lack logical coherence. For example, Eden's suspension from work and the threat of arrest for pleasuring herself in her car while fully clothed feel exaggerated and unrealistic. Similarly, Olivia's subplot, centered on her obsession with her brother's ashes and her erratic behavior, is hard to follow and adds little to the overall story. Although flashbacks to Eden's college days—such as her tutoring Justin, their brief kiss, and the tragic death of her friend Tyler—offer some backstory, they fail to cohesively integrate with the present narrative. The shifting perspectives between Eden and Olivia disrupt the flow, particularly Olivia's storyline, which feels disjointed and underdeveloped. Additionally, the pacing is uneven, with some sections dragging while others rush through key events.",
            "In this story, we follow Eden, a 45-year-old woman grappling with her husband Dave's sudden and unexplained decision to divorce her. While her emotional struggles are relatable, her actions—especially her swift involvement with her college crush, Justin, after 20 years—come across as unrealistic. Dave, though dependable, lacks depth and is often reduced to the mundane habit of cleaning his glasses. Justin, a rebellious drummer, re-enters Eden's life with an intensity that feels implausible given their long separation. Meanwhile, Olivia, Justin's wife, is a perplexing character. Despite being tightly controlled by Justin, who has power over her mentally ill brother, she inexplicably engages in covert antics and communicates with Eden without his knowledge. Her motivations remain murky and inconsistent, leaving readers puzzled.",

While some characters, like Olivia and Dave, were engaging, others, like Ava and Eden, were frustrating and hard to believe. The story's potential was undermined by unrealistic scenarios and poor decision-making by the characters.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "I found Eden unlikable as the main character; she often came across as obnoxious. Although she didn’t deserve what happened to her, I had no motivation to root for her or hope for her improvement. Her view of her college relationship with Justin felt unrealistic—he was merely a player who flirted with her, rather than someone with whom she had a genuine connection. I was particularly frustrated when she referred to a single instance of phone sex as a sexual relationship in the present day. \n\nI also struggled to sympathize with Ava, who appeared bratty throughout the story. While I recognize the challenges of her parents' divorce, her extreme actions to try and reunite them felt excessive. Olivia, however, was my favorite character; she truly deserved better. Despite her flawed decisions, she endured significant trauma from childhood to the present. While I think Eden doesn't owe her forgiveness or contact, Olivia deserves friends and a support system that genuinely cares for her.",

I was invested in finding out what happened, and it was definitely a page-turner.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was propulsive and kept me engaged. I finished it in two days, and there were some GOOD twists that I did not see coming.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I found most of the characters to be either unlikeable or frustrating to read about.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book started off a little on the cringy and steamy side, which made me wonder what exactly I was reading at first.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I was satisfied with the ending.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend it if you’re looking for a unique and propulsive popcorn thriller to read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a mixed but enjoyable read. While the characters were frustrating and the tone initially felt off, the intriguing premise, engaging plot, and satisfying ending made it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the plot’s absurd twists and uneven pacing made it a mixed experience. While the resolution was satisfactory, it didn’t fully compensate for the book’s inconsistencies.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

In the parking lot of the college, the husband reveals he wants a divorce, leaving the wife devastated. She then reaches out to her college crush on Facebook, sparking a virtual \"affair.\" The plot becomes increasingly implausible as it progresses, culminating in an ending that felt ridiculous and eye-roll-worthy.  \n\n- **Character Decisions and Behavior:**  \n  The wife's decision to reconnect with her college crush, despite warnings from her friends and husband, felt unrealistic and frustrating. The crush's revelation that he is technically married but living separately with his wife added to the absurdity of the situation.  \n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  While the story was entertaining in parts, the escalating preposterousness of the plot detracted from its overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had its moments of entertainment, but the unrealistic character decisions and increasingly absurd plot made it difficult to fully enjoy. It was an okay read, but not one I would consider great.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars, rounded up to 3."

The narrative struggles to maintain a balance between engaging storytelling and meaningful progression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her naivety and questionable decision-making were not only frustrating but nearly led to the destruction of her own life and those of her loved ones. Her actions seemed exaggerated and unrealistic, almost as if the narrative was intentionally highlighting her foolishness. Additionally, the rationale behind her husband’s request for separation felt contrived, undermining the overall believability of the plot.",

However, once the pace picked up, it moved at lightning speed with plenty of twists and surprises. This fast-paced momentum made it exactly my type of thriller.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The relatability and pain of a broken family felt genuine, which drew me into the characters and made me fully invested in the story. While the protagonist, Eden, frustrated me at times, this only added to her realism and made her more compelling.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Surprises:**  \n  The twists were exceptionally well-executed, and I didn’t see most of them coming, which is rare for me. This unpredictability kept me engaged and added to the suspense.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I really liked the ending because it didn’t wrap things up with a perfect bow. This felt more realistic and satisfying to me.  \n\n- **Romantic/Spicy Elements:**  \n  There was more spice in this thriller than I’m used to, and while I prefer to focus on the mystery, it didn’t detract from my enjoyment of the story. The strong plot ensured that these elements didn’t overshadow the main thriller aspects.  \n\n- **Overall Plot and Suspense:**  \n  The book was well-plotted and suspenseful, keeping me hooked throughout. It was a great read, and I look forward to exploring more works by Samantha M.

The author struggled to weave the elements together, resulting in a flow that felt unnatural and implausible.

For instance, David's choice to end his marriage over a mild interest in BDSM—without discussing it with his wife—felt extreme and unrealistic. Similarly, Olivia's actions to protect Eden seemed excessive; a simple conversation could have resolved many issues instead of leading to a series of convoluted events.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Emotional Impact (Part 1):**  \n  The book started out really strong, and Part 1 was riveting. I completely felt for Eden. Her feelings of being unloved, her questioning why her husband and daughter pulled away from her, and her pain over being treated poorly were deeply moving and captured my attention. All the pieces were effectively set up during Part 1.  \n\n- **Character Development (Olivia and Justin):**  \n  Olivia’s character felt overly tragic. There’s a trend in novels to pile excessive pain and misery onto a character, and that’s what happened here. Justin, on the other hand, came across as cartoonishly evil. While I understand that abusers like him exist in real life, his portrayal in the novel felt unrealistic and rang false.  \n\n- **Pacing and Execution (Parts 2 and 3):**  \n  After the strong start in Part 1, Parts 2 and 3 fell flat. The execution did not live up to the potential set up in the beginning. The story lost its momentum, and I was ultimately let down by the direction it took.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I was initially gearing up to give this book a 5/5, but the latter parts of the story disappointed me. Still, if you want to read it for free on Prime, it might be worth a try. The author isn’t bad, but the execution didn’t match the promise of Part 1.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had a compelling and emotionally impactful start, but it faltered in its later parts due to overly tragic character arcs and unrealistic portrayals. While the setup was strong, the execution fell short, leaving me disappointed overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI was initially prepared to give this book a 5/5, but the letdown in Parts 2 and 3 reduced my overall satisfaction. No final rating is explicitly stated, but the disappointment is clear."

It didn’t deliver the depth or complexity expected in a thriller.\n   - The story felt more like a diary or a series of direct messages filled with sexting and poor decisions rather than a cohesive narrative.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - The characters were easy to dislike, coming across as naive and oblivious to obvious red flags.\n   - Eden, the protagonist, was particularly frustrating, making poor decisions that made her seem unintelligent and contributed to her husband leaving her.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The writing felt amateurish and lacked the polish expected from a seasoned author.\n   - The dialogue, especially the sexting exchanges, felt forced and unrealistic, detracting from the overall quality of the book.\n\n- **Genre Expectations:**\n   - As a thriller, the book failed to deliver the suspense and tension that readers expect. There were no moments that left me on the edge of my seat or shocked me.\n   - The twists and drama were underwhelming and didn’t provide the “holy sh*t” moments typical of the genre.\n\n- **Author Reputation:**\n   - Samantha Bailey comes highly recommended by some of my favorite authors, which raised my expectations. Unfortunately, this book didn’t live up to the hype.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I had high hopes for *A Friend in the Dark* due to the author’s reputation, the book fell short in several key areas. The plot lacked depth, the characters were unlikable, and the writing felt rushed and amateurish. As a thriller, it failed to deliver the suspense and excitement I was looking for, making it a disappointing read overall.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2 ⭐️"

            "The novel suffers from notable plot holes that are difficult to ignore. For instance, Eden is set to meet Justin, who cancels because his wife, Olivia, took his truck to see Eden instead. However, it later emerges that Justin never had plans with Eden, creating confusion and inconsistency. Additionally, the plot depends on improbable conveniences, such as characters effortlessly accessing each other's cell phones whenever it serves the story. This lack of realism renders the narrative feel contrived and lazy.",
            "In this story, the main character, Eden, is difficult to relate to or like. I often found myself exclaiming, “Don’t do that, it’s foolish!” Unfortunately, she lacks the depth to make her choices compelling. Similarly, Olivia’s motivations feel murky and inconsistent. Portrayed as an abused wife trapped in her marriage, she simultaneously possesses enough autonomy to stalk Eden and disrupt her life over several days. Olivia’s ultimate goal remains ambiguous, rendering her actions seemingly random and poorly justified.",

I found myself frequently thinking, \"Don't do that, that's stupid!\" but she didn't seem to have the depth or relatability to make me care about her decisions.\n\n- **Plot Coherence:**  \n  The novel had significant plot holes that were hard to overlook. For example, Eden has a date with Justin, who cancels because his wife, Olivia, stole his truck to meet Eden instead. However, it’s later revealed that Justin never actually had plans with Eden, which made the entire scenario confusing and inconsistent.\n\n- **Character Motivations:**  \n  Olivia’s motivations were unclear and contradictory. She’s portrayed as an abused wife trapped in her marriage, yet she has enough autonomy to stalk Eden and disrupt her life for days. It was never clear what Olivia’s ultimate goal was, which made her actions feel random and poorly justified.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:**  \n  The logic behind Justin marrying Olivia to keep her from revealing their shared secret didn’t hold up. It was unclear why this secret entitled him to treat her badly or why she would go along with signing over various things to him. Both Eden and Olivia had moments that felt \"too stupid to live,\" which undermined the story’s credibility.\n\n- **Convenient Plot Devices:**  \n  The plot relied heavily on unrealistic conveniences, such as characters easily breaking into each other’s cell phones whenever it suited the story. This lack of realism made the narrative feel contrived and lazy.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  On a positive note, the novel was mercifully short, which made it easier to get through despite its flaws.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started with some promise, it quickly devolved into a confusing and inconsistent story with unlikable characters, illogical motivations, and glaring plot holes.

She shares compromising photos with someone she hasn't spoken to in years, jeopardizes her career with reckless decisions, and dismisses clear signs of danger, like a missing spare key and an open basement window. Justin's equally immature behavior further complicates the situation, making it difficult to feel invested in their marriage's survival.",

Justin’s complicated situation—being separated yet still living with his wife, Olivia—adds unnecessary confusion to the narrative. Eden’s focus on their flirtatious exchanges, rather than grappling with her circumstances, renders her character shallow and emotionally distant.",

The ending felt unnecessary, and the twists failed to deliver.

            "The story raises several unresolved questions: Who attempted to set Eden’s house on fire? Who sneaked in through the basement window? Was Alistair's death a murder or mere coincidence? Additionally, the identity of the person who texted Eden at the restaurant while she was with Olivia remains ambiguous, adding to the confusion. The narrative seems unnecessarily intense, making the plot feel exaggerated without adequate justification. Events, like the divorcée whose life unravels in just 48 hours due to a half-hearted escape from sex slavery, come across as overly convoluted. This inconsistency in tone—intense moments clashing with trivial or illogical character motivations—raises questions about the story’s overall coherence. The unresolved plot points and lack of clear explanations for key events contribute to a sense of confusion.",
            "The divorcée's actions come under scrutiny for their avoidability, suggesting a simple conversation with her best friends could have altered the outcome, indicating poor decision-making. Meanwhile, the husband's reasoning for the divorce seems absurd, particularly his late realization about his father's peculiarities, which serves as a pivotal yet questionable plot point."

There was a lot of suspense, but I kept asking myself “why” about every little thing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were not realistic at all.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  My least favorite trope was present: \"I have an abusive husband, let me pawn him off on someone else.\" This reminded me of books like *The Last Mrs. Parrish* and *Perfect Ruin*.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was good, which is one of the few positives I can mention.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was not a good book. While the pacing kept me engaged, the lackluster plot, unrealistic characters, and reliance on an overused trope made it disappointing. I’m glad I didn’t spend money on it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (due to the good pacing, but the overall experience was underwhelming)."

The idea that a single friend request could escalate into an elaborate scheme within a few hours is hard to believe. The entire book unfolds over just a few days, which makes the complexity of the scheme seem implausible.  \n\n- **Character Development and Motivation:**  \n  The character orchestrating the scheme appears to have been waiting for Eden to reach out for 20 years, ready to take immediate action. This lack of believable motivation and depth makes the character feel contrived.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The dialogue, particularly between Eden and her husband, lacks emotional depth and feels forced. For example, when Eden’s husband asks, “Do you love him?” and she replies, “I’m not sure yet,” it comes across as melodramatic and unconvincing, eliciting an eyeroll.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel suffers from an unrealistic plot, underdeveloped characters, and unconvincing dialogue.

The author fails to weave the story paragraph by paragraph, instead opting to vomit out the setup without any finesse. There is no unique voice in setting scenes or introducing characters. The author clearly does not adhere to the basic tenet of storytelling: \"Show, don't tell.\"  \n\n- **Editing Quality:**  \n  The editing is equally disappointing. Despite the slew of editors mentioned in the acknowledgments, the book lacks polish and refinement. If these editors were indeed paid for their work, they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing such poor writing to make it to publication.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book falls short in both writing and editing.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The novel is labeled as a thriller but reads more like a romance for the majority of the story. While it does have some dark elements to give it a thriller-like feel, the overall tone and plot were predictable.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character was unlikable, and at times, the narrative felt immature, resembling a teenager’s journal.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was a quick and easy read. I continued reading in hopes of encountering some suspense, but it never fully delivered.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  *Slight spoiler* I was disappointed with the way the novel portrayed mental health and domestic violence (DV). The handling of these sensitive topics felt inadequate and lacked depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was an easy read, it fell short of its thriller label, leaning more toward romance with predictable elements. The unlikable main character and immature writing style detracted from the experience, and the portrayal of mental health and domestic violence was disappointing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
