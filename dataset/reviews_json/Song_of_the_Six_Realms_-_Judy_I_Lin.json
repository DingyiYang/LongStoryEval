            "The pacing of the story was uneven, particularly in the middle, where the narrative stalled for over 150 pages without any significant developments. Conversely, the ending felt rushed, cramming too much into the final 50 pages. The plot itself was disorganized; an early problem that seemed poised to be the main focus was drawn out excessively, while a new issue introduced midway took over the narrative but concluded anticlimactically.",
            "The main character is remarkably likable, a rare strength of the book. However, the celestial characters exhibit immature personalities and rapid mood swings, lending the story a distinctly young adult vibe.",
            "The prose was beautiful and immersive, enhancing the overall reading experience.",

While it has some strong points, such as its cultural elements, immersive prose, and likable main character, it suffers from slow pacing, messy plot structure, and rushed resolutions.

However, the celestial characters had immature personalities, and their moods changed too quickly, giving the story a very YA feel.  \n- **Pacing:** The pacing felt slow, especially around the middle of the book, where nothing interesting happened for about 150+ pages. Additionally, the ending felt rushed, with everything crammed into the last 50 pages.  \n- **Plot Structure:** The plot felt messy. A problem introduced early on seemed like it would be the main focus, but it was dragged out too long. Another issue emerged halfway through the book, which took over the narrative but had an anticlimactic resolution.  \n- **Info Dumps:** There were many unnecessary info dumps that disrupted the flow of the story.  \n- **Comparisons:** The book reminded me a lot of *Daughter of the Moon Goddess*, and I would recommend it to fans of that book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book is best described as \"pure vibes.\" While it has some strong points, such as its cultural elements, immersive prose, and likable main character, it suffers from slow pacing, messy plot structure, and rushed resolutions. If you enjoyed *Daughter of the Moon Goddess*, you might find this book worth a read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5/5"

The author repeatedly had to spell out questions to create intrigue, which felt forced and unnatural. The finale was confusing and relied on an overused trope of a human becoming immortal to save everyone, which felt unsatisfying and poorly executed.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The main characters lacked chemistry, especially in the romantic subplot. The kiss between the girl and her love interest felt awkward and unearned, with no buildup or emotional connection. The characters felt like strangers, making their interactions cringe-worthy.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding was virtually nonexistent. The setting and lore were unremarkable and failed to leave a lasting impression. The story relied on tired tropes, such as a parentless girl being adopted into a tea house and \"saved\" by a mysterious man, which felt repetitive and uninspired.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing failed to create intrigue or maintain interest. The story felt flat, and the lack of memorable moments made it difficult to stay engaged. The author's attempts to generate curiosity felt heavy-handed and ineffective.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The finale was random and poorly explained. The resolution, which involved the human girl becoming immortal to save everyone, felt clichéd and unsatisfying. The only redeeming aspect was the Duke's death, which provided a small sense of catharsis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a struggle to read due to its lack of compelling plot, weak character development, and unremarkable worldbuilding.

            "While *Rebecca* significantly influences the plot, it also hampers it in certain aspects. The relationship between the Heroine and Maxim in *Rebecca* is clearly not intended to be romanticized, which adversely affects the romance between Xue and Jinglang in this novel, resulting in a flat and rushed portrayal.",
            "Jinglang's character comes across as somewhat two-dimensional, particularly in the novel's middle sections, likely influenced by Maxim's cold demeanor in *Rebecca*. Unlike Rebecca, Ruilan doesn't serve as an antagonist to Xue, which weakens the intended gothic atmosphere. However, Danrou, akin to Mrs. Danvers, maintains her irritating presence, showcasing strong characterization. I found Chenwen and Lingwei to be engaging characters, bringing depth and interest to the story.",

Ruilan, unlike Rebecca, is not an antagonistic presence to Xue, which diminishes the gothic quality of haunting the narrative as intended. However, Danrou (the equivalent of Mrs. Danvers) is as irritating as her counterpart in *Rebecca*, which shows well-maintained characterization.  \n\n- **Cultural and Mythological Elements:**  \n  The weaving of Chinese mythology throughout the story adds a nice twist to the original *Rebecca* narrative. The inclusion of poetry is also a great addition, enriching the reading experience.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  I enjoyed the characters of Chenwen and Lingwei, who added depth and interest to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a good and enjoyable read with a strong atmospheric quality and beautiful writing.

The ending felt rushed, with too much information and action packed into the last 30-50 pages, going from a plot twist to a battle to a revelation and conclusion in no time at all.  \n\n- **Romance/Love Story:**  \n  I expected more romance. The development of the love story felt confusing and underdeveloped. The characters only had a handful of interactions, which were friendly and sweet but lacked tension. Suddenly, they were hugging and confessing their love, which felt abrupt and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I was not overwhelmed by the ending. It lacked the heartfelt emotional impact I was hoping for.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, it was a casual, cozy read, and I enjoyed the story as a whole. However, upon closer examination, the book had several shortcomings, particularly in pacing, romance development, and the emotional depth of the ending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded up)."

Her writing mixes descriptive and visual language with emotional and breathtaking lines of poetry to create a highly colorful and provocative world inspired by Chinese history and legends.\n\n- **World-Building and Accessibility:**  \n  Despite being a standalone, the world-building and language took me away from the very first page.

Their dynamic is beautiful and soft with their yearning and love language. Lin goes to great depths to highlight their subtle but deeply romantic love story featuring demisexual characters. It's the small things—their conversations and quiet, contemplative looks—it felt slow, genuine, and heart-wrenching.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The overall plot contained mystery, court politics, intrigue, and lurking darkness with Xue's songs creating a cohesive melody. Between deities and mortals, I love how the book challenges the nature of our souls and the love that pushes us.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a testament to Lin's growth as a writer, offering a richly woven tapestry of world-building, emotional depth, and a tender yet profound romance.

The storyline became pretty fun, though the history and buildup could still feel a bit boring at times.  \n\n- **Interludes and Skipping Content:**  \n  I skipped some of the interludes because I wasn’t that interested in them.  \n\n- **Romance and Plot:**  \n  The cute little romance and the overall plot were amazing and fun to read about.  \n\n- **Glossary and Additional Content:**  \n  The glossary at the end included a pronunciation list (which didn’t help me at all) and descriptions of places mentioned in the book. While this was pretty fun, I didn’t really use it.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The book has heavy worldbuilding, but it’s not as overwhelming as something like *Dune*. There’s a lot happening, but it’s manageable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was fine and entertaining, especially if you take the time to sit down and immerse yourself in it.

The bland writing, insufferable protagonist, uneven pacing, and poorly integrated worldbuilding overshadow its intriguing concept and beautiful cover.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

Every description gave life to the characters, and I could see them evolve before me.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Connection:**  \n  Jinglang and Xue have my entire heart, and I hope they will live happily for many centuries.

            "This novel is a captivating fantasy featuring a gifted musician, Guxue, who excels at playing the qín. After losing her family at a young age, she is raised by her uncle. Following his death, she becomes an apprentice at an entertainment house and later accepts a position as a musician at Duke Meng's residence. As the plot unfolds, Guxue uncovers mysteries, confronts dangerous monsters, and realizes that both her life and the realm are at risk. The tension escalates in the final chapters, making the book hard to put down. While the ending is satisfying, I would have preferred an extended epilogue. The pacing is well-balanced, with tension building steadily, and the structure—composed of verses and interludes—adds a creative and engaging layer to the storytelling.",

However, I felt the romance could have been developed more fully. Although both characters shine individually, their chemistry is lacking, and the romance takes a backseat to the fantasy and mystery elements.

Their slow-burning romance unfolds naturally, resulting in a heartfelt and authentic relationship without any forced progression.",

I would absolutely read a novella to see how things are resolved.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Song of the Six Realms* is a beautifully written fantasy novel with rich world-building, a refreshing romance, and an emotionally resonant ending. Despite a slow start, the story captivated me, and I highly recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance in the story progressed rapidly, shifting from a casual connection to a serious relationship in a short time. While this swift development was intriguing, it lacked the depth needed to convincingly portray the characters' devotion. I felt that more development was necessary to establish a believable and heartfelt connection between them. The pacing, especially in the romantic subplot, left me wanting greater depth and nuance. Although the story had compelling elements, the quick progression of certain relationships and plot points ultimately detracted from the overall experience.",

However, the narrative introduced numerous characters, accompanied by extensive background information. While many details enriched the story and added depth to the world, some felt tangential to the main plot, making it challenging to keep track of everything, particularly the intricacies of each character.\n\nXue, the protagonist, appeared somewhat reserved and meek throughout the story. Nonetheless, her passion shone through, making her both admirable and engaging. It was evident that she possessed a strong sense of purpose, even if she didn't always express it as assertively as one might hope.",

The entrance of the Sky Sovereign and his consort felt overly dramatic, and the Sky Sovereign's arrogance made him seem greedy and corrupt.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is fascinating and vast, though it can be quite complicated at first. However, it is explained slowly and effectively as the story progresses, making it easier to understand over time.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is beautiful and vividly captures the essence of the music, poetry, and scenic elements in the story. It adds depth and richness to the narrative.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance is not the main focus of the story and feels underdeveloped. I wish there had been more interactions between Xue and Jinglang to better showcase the development of their relationship over time.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing is uneven. The beginning is slow, which is understandable given the extensive world-building and the need to explain it gradually. However, the ending feels rushed, with a major reveal crammed into the final 20% of the story.  \n\n- **Plot Twists:**  \n  Some of the twists in the story were surprising and added an exciting layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book is a pretty good standalone novel with captivating world-building and a beautiful writing style. I would be interested in reading future works by this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has its strengths, particularly in its intricate world-building and evocative writing style. However, the underdeveloped romance and uneven pacing, especially the rushed ending, detract from the overall experience. Still, it’s a worthwhile read with some unexpected twists, and I look forward to the author’s next work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nActual Rating: 3.5⭐  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to TBR and Beyond Tour, NetGalley, the author, and the publisher for providing me with an e-ARC of the book and including me in this book tour.

            "I enjoyed the book up until about seventy percent in, when a massive info dump overwhelmed me. I completely forgot about the Sky Sovereign since we had only interacted with the consort. Chenwen showed no signs that anything was off, and I couldn't grasp the motives of Lady He and Danrou. By the end, I found myself skimming because I simply couldn't understand what was happening. It left me feeling lost.",
            "I genuinely enjoyed the main romance between Jinglang and Xue; they complement each other perfectly. The supporting characters, like Ruilan, Yingzi, Zhuxi, Chenwen, and Xue's uncle, also added depth to the story. However, I couldn't help but wonder about Danrou's crush on Chenwen—what did she say to him in private? I anticipated that moment would play a significant role in the narrative.",
            "This book heavily draws on its world’s mythology, but it offers little time for readers to fully absorb it. While I grasped some of the details, the abundance of names and characters became overwhelming. Consequently, the worldbuilding didn't resonate with me as strongly as I had hoped."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While this novel was a significant improvement over the duology, with better characters and writing, it struggled with pacing, excessive info dumps, and unclear character motivations. The worldbuilding, though ambitious, was overwhelming and hard to follow at times. Despite these issues, the main romance and some side characters were enjoyable highlights.",

I’m surprised I even read this after giving the duology a three and a two, but I just wanted to see. This book was much improved from the duology, with much better characters and overall better writing.\n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n  I actually liked the main romance in this. Jinglang and Xue fit together so nicely and sweetly. I also liked many of the other characters, such as Ruilan/Yingzi, Zhuxi, Chenwen, and Xue’s uncle.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  I was having a lot of fun until about seventy percent through the book. Then, a MASSIVE info dump hit, and I did not understand a BIT OF IT. I completely forgot we had ever met the Sky Sovereign (we only talked to the consort for some reason). Chenwen had NO hints of anything weird going on with him, and I couldn’t find the motive for Lady He and Danrou. I had to skim over the ending because I did not understand anything that was going on. At all. Help…\n\n- **Character Motivations and Subplots:**  \n  Also, was Danrou seriously just crushing on Chenwen? What did she say to him in private? I thought that was going to be important???\n\n- **Worldbuilding and Mythology:**  \n  This book relied a ton on the mythology of the world, but we weren’t given that much time to retain it personally. I got bits of it, but there were so many names, so many people, and so many things, which gave me a headache. The worldbuilding still wasn’t the strongest for me personally.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel was a significant improvement over the duology, with better characters and writing, it struggled with pacing, excessive info dumps, and unclear character motivations. The worldbuilding, though ambitious, was overwhelming and hard to follow at times.

            "Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The only reason it didn't receive a five-star rating is that the ending felt rushed and lacked the emotional depth present throughout the rest of the story. The narrative follows Xue, a musician grappling with her unknown past and uncertain future. After her parents' death, her uncle takes her in and secures her an apprenticeship at an entertainment house. When a mysterious duke offers to pay off her contract, she is drawn to his estate, where a series of events unfold that challenge her perceptions of the duke and shift everything she thought she knew.",

She catches the attention of Lord Meng, who claims to know her uncle and invites her to his estate to investigate her uncle’s death.  \n  - The plot felt slow, and I often found myself tuning out. Despite the animal attacks and the journey to the spirit realm, not much seemed to happen.  \n  - The villains were predictable, and the one surprise villain turned out to be a red herring.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The Demon Realm was frequently mentioned but only appeared at the end. There was no development or depth given to this realm or its inhabitants, making it hard to care about their role in the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Xue’s character had potential, but her journey felt underdeveloped. Lord Meng’s motives and trustworthiness remained unclear, which made it hard to connect with him.  \n  - The lack of development for the Demon Realm characters made them feel irrelevant to the overall story.  \n\n- **Cultural and Historical Elements:**  \n  - I enjoyed learning about the qin, its history, and its significance. This aspect of the story was fascinating and added a unique cultural layer to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel introduced intriguing elements like the qin and its cultural significance, the plot felt slow and lacked depth. The villains were predictable, and the Demon Realm was underdeveloped, making it hard to stay engaged. Despite these shortcomings, the cultural aspects were a highlight.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot Development: 2/5  \n- World-Building: 2/5  \n- Character Development: 2/5  \n- Cultural and Historical Elements: 4/5  \n- Overall Enjoyment: 2.5/5"

While the slow pace had a nice, atmospheric vibe that kept me engaged initially, it ultimately made the story feel drawn out. By the time the plot picked up, I had already lost interest.  \n\n- **Engagement with the Story and Characters:**  \n  Despite the slow pacing, the overall feel of the story pulled me in. However, by the time the action started, I didn’t care enough about the story or the characters to feel fully invested. I mostly finished the book out of a sense of completion rather than genuine interest.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  Listening to the audiobook helped significantly, especially with the pronunciation of names. I don’t think I would have been able to get through the book without the audio format.  \n\n- **Cultural and Genre Context:**  \n  I don’t typically read Asian fantasy (YA or adult) and am not familiar with Asian folklore or traditions. This lack of familiarity might have contributed to my inability to connect deeply with the story, even though I am Asian myself.  \n\n- **Target Audience (YA):**  \n  I knew this was a YA novel going into it, and while I can appreciate YA, this book felt like it leaned toward the younger side of the genre. As someone who is growing out of that age range, it didn’t resonate with me as strongly as it might have for a younger audience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had a slow, atmospheric pace that initially drew me in, but the lack of action until the very end made it hard to stay engaged.

The love story feels forced and unconvincing, coming out of nowhere. The ending is overly convenient, with presumed-dead characters returning, and bittersweet, as the main couple ends up separated yet holds a sliver of hope. This duality undermines its believability and satisfaction, as the narrative struggles to balance conflicting tones. While the novel is a quick read that entertained me in the moment, the ending feels rushed and chaotic, with events unfolding more out of necessity than logical progression.",

However, the pacing is criticized as glacial, which detracts from the overall engagement with the narrative.  \n  - The central conflict involving the upheaval in the Celestial Realm introduces a high-stakes element, but the slow progression of the plot makes it less impactful.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  - The setting is praised as lovely, suggesting that the world-building is one of the novel’s strengths. The contrast between the mortal world and the Celestial Realm adds depth and intrigue to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  - The romantic relationship between Xue and Jinglang is a key element of the story, but it falls flat. Jinglang’s lack of depth as a character makes the love interest feel underdeveloped and unengaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents a compelling protagonist and a beautifully crafted setting, but its slow pacing and lackluster romantic subplot hinder its overall appeal. While the premise is intriguing, the execution leaves much to be desired, particularly in terms of character development and narrative momentum.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The use of music and poems elevates the story, adding to its charm.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is somewhat complex, but it doesn’t slow down the pacing. It feels immersive and well-crafted.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The two main characters are likable, but I didn’t feel a strong emotional connection to them. (Though it should be noted that it’s difficult to reach my icy heart!)  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is well-maintained despite the complexity of the world-building. It reads like a standalone novel, though I wonder if there will be a sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t love *Song of the Six Realms*, it’s a solid read with a magical atmosphere, strong world-building, and likable characters. The use of music and poems adds a unique touch, though I didn’t feel deeply emotionally invested.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

While I enjoy slow-burn narratives, the pacing felt slightly drawn out in this case.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were engaging and added depth to the story, making it an entertaining read.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The incorporation of Chinese mythology and the depiction of a corrupt heavenly world were highlights, creating a rich and immersive setting.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I chose to listen to this as an audiobook, which was an excellent decision. The narration was superb, and it helped me appreciate the correct pronunciations of foreign language words throughout the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the pacing was slower than I would have preferred for a stand-alone novel, the compelling characters, rich world-building, and excellent audiobook narration made it an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded down)."

It overshadowed the plot, especially in the second half of the book, which felt like a chore to get through due to the excessive focus on detailing the world rather than advancing the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excelled in creating a vivid atmosphere and crafting a compelling main character, it struggled with balancing world-building and plot development. The second half felt tedious, and the stakes of the mission failed to resonate as strongly as they could have.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Engagement and Investment:**  \n  I came very close to not finishing the book at multiple points (70%, 80%, and 90%) due to a lack of engagement and investment in the story. The narrative failed to hold my interest consistently, making it difficult to stay committed to finishing the novel.\n\n- **Focus on Music:**  \n  The parts of the book that focused on music were more interesting and stood out to me. These sections provided a glimpse of what could have been a more engaging and immersive story.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Pacing:**  \n  The book felt more like a fleshed-out outline rather than a fully developed novel. Large portions of the story were summarized, with events and actions told rather than shown through detailed scenes. This lack of depth made the narrative feel distant and unengaging.\n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance subplot suffered from the same issues as the overall narrative. It was summarized rather than developed through meaningful interactions or emotional depth, which left me uninvested in the relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had moments of interest, particularly in its exploration of music, it ultimately fell short due to its lack of detailed scenes and emotional engagement. The narrative style felt more like an outline, and the romance subplot failed to resonate. As a result, I struggled to stay invested and nearly abandoned the book multiple times.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 / 5"

We need more of these.\"  \n  - The book stands out for its unique cultural perspective, which is refreshing and much-needed in the fantasy genre.  \n\n- **Integration of Music in the Plot:**  \n  - \"I liked that music was a critical aspect of the plot, and this book pulled me in.\"  \n  - The use of music as a central element in the story was engaging and added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - \"Disorienting at times, but in a good and important way.\"  \n  - The occasional disorientation in the storytelling was intentional and contributed positively to the overall experience.  \n  - \"I liked the interludes, although I would have liked their placement to be more purposeful-- they seemed a bit random, and I sometimes struggled to connect them to what was around them.\"  \n  - While the interludes were enjoyable, their placement felt somewhat random, making it challenging to fully integrate them into the surrounding narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a refreshing addition to the fantasy genre, with its non-European cosmology and innovative use of music as a plot device. While the pacing and structure were occasionally disorienting, this added to the story's charm. The interludes, though enjoyable, could have been more purposefully placed to enhance their connection to the main narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The world she creates is immersive and captivating, making it a standout feature of the novel.\n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I received an ARC and read a few chapters, decided I loved it, and immediately put it down to pre-order the book. The story was so engaging that I felt compelled to own a physical copy and wait for it to arrive.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAlthough I haven’t finished the book yet, the initial chapters were so compelling and well-crafted that I knew I had to own it. Judy Lin’s world-building is exceptional, and I’m eagerly looking forward to diving deeper into the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The rapid sequence of events left me feeling confused.  \n\n- **Character Decisions and Motivations:**  \n  I’m still unsure why the characters made certain decisions at the end. Their actions felt unclear and lacked sufficient explanation, which made the conclusion unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started strong and held my interest for most of the story, the final portion suffered from rushed pacing and unclear character motivations, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nInitially considered a 4-star read, but the ending lowered my overall rating.

I felt so moved that I wanted to \"hide in a corner and cry.\" The ending, in particular, left me deeply affected, as I was heartbroken by the fate of Jinglang and Xue's relationship.\n\n- **Character Dynamics (Xue x Jinglang):**  \n  The relationship between Xue and Jinglang was one of the highlights of the book for me. I considered them \"the best ship ever\" and was deeply invested in their story. Their connection felt authentic and compelling, making their separation even more heartbreaking.\n\n- **Ending Satisfaction:**  \n  I was dissatisfied with the ending, as I had hoped Jinglang would return in the epilogue. The unresolved nature of their story left me longing for closure. I even imagined an alternate fantasy where they reunite and live happily together.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  I felt the book could have benefited from being a duology. This would have allowed more room to explore Jinglang's return and provide a more satisfying resolution to their story.\n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  Despite my issues with the ending, I still consider this a great book. The emotional depth and compelling characters make it a story I would definitely recommend to others.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a deeply emotional and engaging read, with a standout relationship between Xue and Jinglang.

There were too many components, and too much happened in too short a space of time. I think I mostly kept track of what was happening, but I did find a few things confused me.  \n\n- **Themes and Cultural Inspiration:**  \n  Music and poetry were central to this book, and I really enjoyed how clear the enthusiasm of the main character came through. I Youtubed what a qin sounded like so I could better imagine the scene in my head. I love how the author took inspiration from the poetry of Ancient China.  \n\n- **Pacing and Action:**  \n  I did find that there wasn’t a lot of action in this book. Most of the plot revolves around Xue finding certain songs to unlock hidden memories. Though there were times when action happened, and the ending was filled with action, this is definitely not a book for people who are reliant on action to keep them interested.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Apart from the ending, I really enjoyed this book.

It was unclear who emerged victorious or if any characters retained their goodness.

Her journey begins with hope when a Lord offers her freedom in exchange for a year of service. However, her character arc feels unresolved by the end, as her experiences seem to lack meaningful impact or growth.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The first part of the book is engaging, with strong world-building and a compelling introduction to Xue's life and struggles. However, the latter half of the story loses momentum. The events Xue goes through feel disconnected and ultimately inconsequential, leaving the reader questioning the purpose of her journey.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel excels in creating an immersive world, particularly in the early sections. The setting and cultural elements are well-developed, drawing the reader into Xue's environment and the challenges she faces.  \n\n- **Themes and Resolution:**  \n  The story introduces intriguing themes of survival, servitude, and self-discovery. However, the lack of a satisfying resolution undermines these themes. Xue's encounters, including her interaction with a mythical beast, hint at deeper layers, but these threads are left unresolved, leaving the reader unsatisfied.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel starts strong with rich world-building and a compelling protagonist, but it falters in the second half as the plot loses direction and purpose. Xue's journey, while initially engaging, feels ultimately meaningless, leaving the reader disappointed by the lack of a cohesive or impactful resolution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
