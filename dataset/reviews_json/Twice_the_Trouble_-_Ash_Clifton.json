While some elements were slightly less than plausible, they still worked effectively within the narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Author Potential:**  \n  I would read other works by this author. The book shows promise as a solid debut.  \n\n- **Character Descriptions and Representation:**  \n  I disliked the way one of the main adult female characters was described as having pigtails as her primary hairstyle. The association of pigtails with childishness and the lore of men lusting after women with such hairstyles gave me an uncomfortable feeling. It seemed clear the author was aware of this cultural connotation, as he attempted to explain the hairstyle as not being childish, but it still didn’t sit well with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a solid debut novel with a compelling main character and a well-structured story, despite some minor plausibility issues. However, the portrayal of one female character’s hairstyle and its implications detracted from my enjoyment.

If the story were set in Gainesville or if he had played for UCF, it might have been plausible, but the level of fame attributed to the character feels exaggerated.  \n   - The mention of watching college football in a bar in June is another inaccuracy, as college football season doesn’t align with that time of year unless it’s a re-run, which isn’t clarified.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n   - The overall plot was fine, but the frequent inaccuracies detracted from my enjoyment of the story.
