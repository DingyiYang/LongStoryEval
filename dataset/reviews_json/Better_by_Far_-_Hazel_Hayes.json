            "The novel centers on Kate as she navigates life after her breakup with Finn, with whom she continues to share a house, alternating weeks. This arrangement creates a complex and often painful dynamic. The narrative delves into Kate's grief, which extends beyond the breakup to encompass her past, including the loss of her mother. It explores her struggle to release her former self and the life she once envisioned. Ultimately, the story is less about the breakup itself and more about uncovering deep-seated grief and the journey of confronting past pain.",
            "Kate takes center stage, and her emotional journey is poignantly explored. However, the secondary characters, such as Finn, lack depth and tend to fade into the background. The theme of grief emerges as a dominant force, often overshadowing the human characters.",
            "The writing is rich and introspective, consistently exploring an undefined longing. The tone is heavy and unyielding, deeply immersing me in Kate's pain without providing much relief.",
            "The novel evokes a deep sense of heaviness, despair, and hopelessness. Its lack of clear progression or resolution in healing leaves me feeling emotionally raw and drained.",
            "Having thoroughly enjoyed the author's previous novel, *Out of Love*, I eagerly anticipated *Better By Far* as one of my top reads for 2024."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Better By Far* is a deeply introspective and emotionally heavy novel that explores grief, loss, and the struggle to let go of the past. The writing is rich and contemplative, but the story offers little reprieve or resolution, leaving me with a lingering sense of despair. The underdeveloped secondary characters and the overwhelming focus on grief make it a challenging but impactful read.",

However, the ending was satisfying and tied the story together well.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- First quarter: 4 or 5 stars  \n- Overall: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be lower due to pacing and character engagement issues."

            "In this story, the protagonist ends her long-term relationship and, after a few months of cohabitation, they agree to alternate living in their shared apartment while avoiding contact. Although breakups are naturally emotional and complex, the execution here feels repetitive and lacks depth. The protagonist's grief over her mother's death resurfaces during the breakup, as the loss of her partner brings unresolved emotions to the forefront. This interplay between the two losses has the potential to be compelling, but ultimately feels underdeveloped and poorly balanced.",
            "The book's main theme is unclear and poorly executed, leaving readers uncertain whether it focuses on a breakup, the protagonist's long-standing grief over her mother's death, or the act of writing itself. The themes feel unbalanced, and the secondary storylines lack interest.",
            "I had high hopes for this book, anticipating it would evoke strong emotions akin to those I experienced with Out of Love. Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations and left me feeling disappointed, as it failed to resonate with me on an emotional level.",
            "The book suffers from a lack of originality and feels repetitive, particularly when compared to the author's previous work, *Out of Love*. The protagonist, a writer, draws on her own breakup for inspiration, a concept that feels forced and unoriginal. This meta-element contributes to a sense of déjà vu, as the narrative lacks freshness and dynamism. Rather than presenting a cohesive and satisfying story, the book reads more like a disjointed collection of derivative ideas."

I hoped it would at least deliver the kind of intense experiences I enjoy in literature, similar to \"Out of Love.\" However, I was deeply disappointed. The book failed to resonate emotionally with me.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n   - The main theme of the book feels unclear and poorly executed. It’s hard to determine whether the story is about a breakup, grief over the loss of the protagonist’s mother years ago, or the act of writing itself. The themes are unbalanced, and the secondary storylines are uninteresting.  \n\n- **Character Development and Plot:**  \n   - The protagonist breaks up with her partner after several years together and a few months of sharing an apartment. They decide to alternate living in the apartment week by week, avoiding contact to stick to their decision to end the relationship. While breakups are inherently emotional and complex, the execution here feels repetitive and lacks depth.  \n   - The protagonist’s grief over her mother’s death resurfaces during the breakup, as the loss of her partner triggers unresolved emotions. This interplay between the two losses could have been compelling, but it feels underdeveloped and poorly balanced.  \n\n- **Originality and Freshness:**  \n   - The book lacks originality and feels repetitive, especially in comparison to the author’s previous work, \"Out of Love.\" The protagonist is a writer, and her previous novel was about her actual breakup, which was successful. This meta-element feels forced and unoriginal, adding to the sense of déjà vu.  \n   - There’s a lack of freshness, concept, and dynamism. Instead of a cohesive and satisfying novel, the book feels like a collection of chaotic and derivative ideas.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n   - The book comes across as unpolished, poorly thought out, and undefined. The narrative loses its focus, and the motifs are poorly balanced. The result is a disjointed and unsatisfying reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Better by Far\" fell short of my expectations.

They chose to die before losing themselves and their loved ones completely, ensuring that the narrator could live a life unburdened by fate. This act of selflessness is central to the story's emotional weight.\n\n- **Narrative Impact and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The protagonist's tragic ending is framed as a deliberate choice to give the narrator a chance at a happy life. This creates a poignant contrast between the protagonist's sacrifice and the narrator's determination to live fully, refusing to be consumed by grief or the desire to forget.\n\n- **Themes of Fate and Agency:**  \n  The review highlights the tension between fate and personal agency. The protagonist's decision to die on their own terms, rather than having the choice taken from them, underscores a theme of reclaiming control over one's destiny. Meanwhile, the narrator's resolve to live unburdened by fate reflects a commitment to forging their own path.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe review reflects on the profound emotional and thematic layers of the novel, emphasizing the protagonist's sacrificial act and its impact on the narrator's life.

It's rare to encounter a book that feels complete while still igniting a desire for additional content.

It was an intense and immersive experience.\n   - The exploration of Kate's trauma, grief, and heartbreak was deeply moving, and I appreciated how she navigated these emotions to heal her inner child and heart.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - Finn, Kate's boyfriend, was portrayed as a flawed but not villainous character. He was a liar and made empty promises, yet he wasn't painted as a villain—just a deeply flawed man. This nuanced portrayal reminded me of Sally Rooney's characters.\n   - The novel effectively showed how Finn was wrong for Kate, yet it gave him a brief moment to highlight his shortcomings without demonizing him.\n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**\n   - The writing was exceptional, evoking strong emotions and leaving a lasting impression. The novel delved into themes of love, grief, trauma, and the passage of time.\n   - The quotes from the book were particularly impactful, capturing the essence of the story and its themes. Some of my favorites include:\n     - \"Loving someone means that their absence would make you sad, but their presence doesn’t necessarily make you happy.\"\n     - \"Every couple thinks that they discovered love.

For example:\n     - The idea that life happens in the \"in-between\" moments, not just in the milestones we wait for.\n     - The contemplation of whether humanity has overstayed its welcome on Earth, and the paradox of finding comfort in the thought of an extinction-level event.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a masterpiece of emotional depth and philosophical insight.

These resonated deeply with me, and I appreciated the emotional depth in certain quotes.  \n   - The exploration of grief, love, and hope was poignant and well-captured in several passages.  \n\n- **Quotes and Highlights:**  \n   - The following quotes stood out to me for their emotional resonance and insight:  \n     - “We wear our feelings, wrapping them around ourselves like cloaks that separate us from the world, and grief is the heaviest one of all.”  \n     - “Loving someone and liking someone are two very different things…”  \n     - “Crying quietly for every version of us that might have been…”  \n     - “That’s the difference between panic and grief…”  \n     - “Choosing to be apart is its own special kind of torture…”  \n     - “Why did I stay? Because I had hope…”  \n     - “Are you a language that I’ll lose when I stop speaking it?”  \n     - “The woman I was with Finn feels like an old acquaintance…”  \n     - “Wait and wait for something to happen that we think will make it all better…”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had moments of brilliance, particularly in its exploration of grief and relationships, the lack of a cohesive plot and the narrative style made it difficult for me to fully engage. I felt let down by the overall structure and wished for a more guided storytelling experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 - 2.5 (strong 2)"

The protagonist is a whiny millennial, which might resonate with readers who identify similarly, but it doesn’t connect with me.  \n- **Characterization:**  \n  The protagonist comes across as overly whiny, which didn’t appeal to me personally.  \n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  Hayes does an alright job of blending the grief of losing a mother with the grief of a breakup. However, since I haven’t experienced either of these situations, the emotional depth failed to resonate with me.  \n- **Potential Appeal:**  \n  While the book didn’t work for me, I can see how it might be meaningful for the right audience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book wasn’t a good fit for me, primarily due to the protagonist’s personality and my lack of connection to the themes. However, I acknowledge that it could be impactful for readers who relate to the experiences and emotions explored in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I was thrilled to win a copy in a giveaway.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - Hayes is a skilled writer, and there are plenty of beautiful sentences throughout the book.\n\n- **Plot and Theme:**\n   - Unfortunately, the plot is mostly obscured by the overwhelming tide of grief that the main character must wade through.\n\n- **Memorable Quotes:**\n   - \"I mean, I know you love me. Despite it all, I know you love me. And I love you too. But loving someone and liking someone are two very different things. Loving someone is almost an impulse, a physiological response to your shared experiences. Loving someone means that their absence would make you sad, but their presence doesn't necessarily make you happy. That's reserved for liking someone—liking who they are, liking who you are around them, and therefore wanting to spend time with them. So basically what you said is that if I died tomorrow you'd be sad, but while I'm still living, you'd rather not be near me, if it's all the same.\"\n   - \"To be clear, no one wants to write a book; they want to have already written one—it's the difference between wanting clean teeth and wanting to have them cleaned. Anyone who tells you they want to write is either lying or not doing it properly. Oh, they're probably putting words on a page alright, but then you might as well be jotting down a recipe or a shopping list. Writing, for me, isn't about putting words on a page; it’s about putting myself on the page, leaving so much of myself there that I go to bed wondering if perhaps, this time, I give too much away, whether I've kept enough to get by on.\"\n   - \"That's what writing feels like sometimes—cursing at rabbits; I spend entire days berating sentences for not being better. As though it's their fault and not mine. But even when I hate them, I still love them. Just as a painter has to love the smell of paint, or a sculptor the feel of wet clay between their fingers, a writer must love sentences. All of them. Because every sentence written, no matter how mediocre, brings us one step closer to the elusive perfect sentence, that rare beast we spend our whole lives hunting—not to keep or to tame, just to find, to say we have found it. Like a butterfly between cupped hands, we hold each perfect sentence close, allowing ourselves to peek in and marvel at its precious form before setting it free, knowing it was not meant for us alone. This is the secret—to write not for the page or even the paragraph, just the next good sentence. And once it's been found, to let it fly.\"\n   - \"I asked you once if you ever worry you'll run out of melodies. 'Of course not,' you said, laughing. You actually laughed. 'Why worry,' you added, 'when there are endless possible combinations of notes?' Such a logical way of looking at it. And I know that words, too, can be arranged in infinite beautiful ways. But my fear is less about the existence of good sentences and more about my ability to find them. To continue to dive for them day after day. There are days, rare, hallowed days, when writing feels less like dredging my depths and more like ambling along the shoreline of my psyche, collecting all the gleaming gems conveniently scattered there. I gather them up, rinse away the silt and sand, and arrange them in pretty formations for people to enjoy. But most days I go under. I dive and dive, barely coming up for air until I find myself deposited once more on the slow, wet sand, exhausted but empty-handed. On these days, I haul my tired body up and trudge begrudgingly homeward, all the while convincing myself to never come back here again. But I do. I always come back.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *Better By Far* showcases Hayes' talent for crafting beautiful sentences and delves deeply into themes of grief and love, the plot is somewhat overshadowed by the heavy emotional weight carried by the main character. The book didn't quite meet my high expectations set by *Out of Love*, but it still offers poignant reflections and memorable quotes that resonate.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

I appreciated how the writing encouraged deeper reflection, even when discussing seemingly simple topics.",

Given the author's background in horror films, it was fascinating to see how they wove these chilling moments into the narrative.",

However, the middle portion of the book—roughly 30-70%—felt less gripping and even a bit tedious at times. The pacing was slow, and while some lines were undeniably thought-provoking, the earlier chapters felt less impactful. Most of the character development seemed to be crammed into the final 20%, which made the earlier sections feel uneven.  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  I struggled to find a connection with any of the characters during the middle portion of the book. The characters felt too similar to those in Hazel’s debut novel, and with no narrative tie between the stories, the familiarity detracted from the freshness of this book. Fans of her first novel may find comfort in the familiar tone and character dynamics, but for me, this similarity made *Better by Far* less engaging.  \n\n- **Personal Resonance and Audience Appeal:**  \n  I suspect readers who have experienced a difficult breakup may connect with the story and its characters more deeply. Lacking that personal connection, I found it harder to fully immerse myself in their struggles.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its uneven pacing and lack of fresh character dynamics, *Better by Far* delivers a heartfelt and emotionally resonant story, particularly in its powerful ending.

The phrase “grief is love with nowhere to go” encapsulates the experience beautifully. This narrative provokes thought and reflection, striking me harder than most likely due to my own encounters with loss.

No author has ever made me cry more with just the deftness of their words.  \n\n- **Conceptualization and Marketing:**  \n  I think errors of judgment were made in the way *Better by Far* was conceptualized and marketed. I loved *Out of Love*, so I don’t have a problem with a break-up story that turns out to be about something more. However, *Better by Far* seemed to lose sight of the break-up entirely, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**  \n  The book initially promised a fascinating, moving meditation on grief, exploring the intersection of Kate’s fresh grief over her break-up with Finn and her repressed, decades-old grief over her mum’s death. However, this potential was not fully realized.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Sub-Arcs:**  \n  Seemingly random sub-arcs and unrelated themes (mostly about the nature of art/creation) went nowhere for a long time. They suddenly came together at the end, but in a way that didn’t feel satisfying or cohesive, as they weren’t interwoven for the first 95% of the story.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  Parts of the book were boring. Kate’s recurring nightmares, for example, felt repetitive and reductive rather than inspiring any sense of terror. The art-related themes, while better executed in *Out of Love*, didn’t add much to this story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t hate *Better by Far*, it didn’t live up to my expectations, especially after loving Hazel’s debut novel, *Out of Love*.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Theme and Focus:**  \n  I initially thought this novel would focus more on a breakup, but it turned out to be a deep exploration of grief and its various forms, as well as the role of art in processing emotions.  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  While I’m not a big fan of horror, I appreciated the macabre elements, though they were a bit much for my taste.  \n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  There were one too many dream sequences for me, but I understand their importance in advancing the plot.  \n- **Cultural Context:**  \n  The novel felt very Irish, which added a unique and authentic layer to the story.  \n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  I was delighted to discover that one of the chapter titles references a Dodie song, which happens to be one of my favorites. Later, I found out from the acknowledgements that the author and Dodie are close friends, which made the connection even more special.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a thought-provoking and culturally rich novel that delved into themes of grief and art, though the horror elements and dream sequences weren’t entirely to my taste. I’d still recommend it, especially for its Irish authenticity and the personal connection I felt through the Dodie reference.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

The exploration of grief is a central theme, transitioning from one form of loss to another.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The story is told in both first and second person, which adds a unique and intimate perspective to the narrative.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The inclusion of random graphic nightmare scenes felt jarring and could have benefited from a content warning (in my opinion).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel effectively transitions from exploring the grief of a breakup to the deeper grief of losing a parent, using a distinctive narrative style. However, the graphic nightmare scenes felt out of place and could have been better handled with a content warning.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
