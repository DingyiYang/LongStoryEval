            "The book became dry over time, lacking major revelations or compelling love scenes, which diminished my enjoyment. The title, *The Seaside Sisters*, is misleading, as the narrative also follows their aunt and a love interest, creating a sense of overcrowding. It feels like three separate plots that could each stand alone, with minimal interaction between the main characters. While the multiple happily-ever-afters (HEAs) are satisfying, the overall story lacks depth and engagement, making it unlikely that I would choose to re-read it.",
            "Hannah, the protagonist, comes across as unremarkable and lacks depth. Her love interests and struggles as a writer fail to engage the reader. In contrast, Sara’s storyline captivates as she navigates the challenges of job hunting after being a stay-at-home mom while dealing with an unsupportive husband. Maddie’s career is intriguing, but her indifference toward her husband and their unresolved issues feel underdeveloped and unnecessary. The chemistry between Hannah and her love interest is lacking, making their connection feel forced. Additionally, Sara's husband exhibits inconsistent behavior, leading to a surprising and unclear direction in their relationship, while Maddie’s marital struggles add confusion rather than depth and could have been omitted entirely.",

            "While the plot and character dynamics had their shortcomings, the book was easy to listen to. The narration was excellent, with moments of humor and emotion that kept me engaged throughout.",
            "In *The Seaside Sisters*, I anticipated a strong exploration of the relationship between Hannah and Sarah, but their interactions were disappointingly minimal. The addition of their aunt Maggie’s perspective felt unnecessary and did little to enhance the story or the connections among the characters. This lack of meaningful engagement left the narrative feeling disjointed. \n\nThe romance aspect was also underwhelming; the characters’ dates lacked significance, and the marriages of Sarah and Aunt Maggie felt shallow. The male characters were underdeveloped, with unclear personalities and motivations, making it hard to follow the progression of their relationships. Consequently, Hannah’s “happily ever after” felt unconvincing, lacking the genuine connection and buildup necessary to make it feel earned.",
            "The book's description piqued my interest, especially since it veers away from my usual genres. Hannah's return home to grapple with panic attacks, stress, and grief while trying to reclaim her writing spark is an engaging premise. The introduction of her sister Sarah, who longs for fulfillment beyond her roles as a wife and stay-at-home mom, heightened my anticipation for a profound journey of self-discovery and healing after loss."

The premise of Hannah returning home to cope with panic attacks, stress, and grief, while hoping to rediscover her writing mojo, felt promising. The introduction of her sister Sarah, who is seeking fulfillment beyond her roles as a wife and stay-at-home mom, added to my anticipation of a meaningful journey of discovery and healing after loss.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The title, *The Seaside Sisters*, led me to expect a strong focus on the relationship between Hannah and Sarah. However, their interactions were minimal, which was disappointing. The inclusion of a third POV from their aunt, Maggie, felt unnecessary, as it didn’t add much to the story or deepen the connections between the characters. The lack of meaningful interaction among the three main characters left the narrative feeling disjointed.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  The romance aspect of the story fell flat for me. The dates the characters went on didn’t seem to lead anywhere meaningful, and the marriages of Sarah and Aunt Maggie felt lacking in depth. The male characters were underdeveloped, and their personalities and motivations were unclear, making it hard to understand why the relationships unfolded as they did. Hannah’s “happily ever after” felt unconvincing, as there were no moments of genuine connection or buildup that made it feel earned.  \n\n- **Narration and Pacing:**  \n  Despite the issues with the plot and character dynamics, the book was easy to listen to. The narration was well-done, and there were moments of humor and emotion that kept me engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its initial setup and themes of healing and self-discovery, it ultimately fell short due to underdeveloped character relationships, a lack of meaningful romance, and disjointed storytelling.

            "This story is a delightful and heartwarming tale that follows Sara, Hannah, and their aunt Maddie during a summer in Chatham, Cape Cod. It beautifully explores their relationships and the changes they face in the wake of their mother's passing. However, the grief surrounding their loss feels somewhat sidelined, only addressed in the latter part of the narrative. I would have preferred a deeper exploration of this poignant theme throughout the story.",
            "While Hannah serves as the main character, her storyline lacked depth and interest for me. I found myself more engaged with Sara, who expertly balances her new job with the demands of motherhood and marriage. Aunt Maddie's perspective added some depth, but overall, I didn't feel a strong investment in the characters' outcomes.",

However, in this case, the constant food descriptions didn’t have the same effect. They felt repetitive and didn’t enhance the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were not well-developed, and I didn’t feel invested in the sisters or their relationships.

However, even that subplot felt like it was just going through the motions, lacking depth or emotional impact.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book is short and could easily be read or listened to in an afternoon. The length is one of its few positive aspects, making it a quick read.  \n\n- **Visual Appeal:**  \n  The cover is visually appealing, which is another positive aspect of the book.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Overall, there wasn’t much here to make me recommend it.

It didn’t resonate with me and seemed too perfect.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was disappointing. The lack of chemistry between the main characters, the slow and unengaging plot, and the overly idealistic ending made it a barely 3-star read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars."

            "The book exclusively features characters who are white, straight, cisgender, and conforming, catering to its elderly audience and sparing them potential discomfort. The portrayal of men as infantile and dependent on their wives starkly contrasts with the depiction of women as self-sacrificing individuals who consistently prioritize their husbands' needs over their own.",
            "The story presents marriage as the pinnacle of a woman's existence, suggesting that pursuing or maintaining this union is always the right choice. Compromise within marriage is depicted as women sacrificing their own ambitions to cater to their husband's desires. Traditional gender roles and values are reinforced throughout the narrative, appealing particularly to older generations. \n\nThe book distinguishes between \"regular rich people\" and \"really rich people,\" implying that the former are more relatable, while the latter exhibit a lack of authenticity in their decor and lifestyle choices. Despite the focus on wealth, it ultimately conveys the insignificance of money, subtly reflecting the financial realities faced by authors who receive advances. \n\nAdditionally, it references free parking near a hospital and within walking distance of Fenway Park, evoking a sense of nostalgia that feels somewhat outdated.",
            "This book appears to be specifically tailored for affluent white women aged 85 and older residing in assisted living communities. It’s an ideal choice for listening during visits with elderly relatives, whether it's Grandma, Aunt Mary, or Mrs. Ferguson from down the street."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is clearly designed for a niche audience of elderly, wealthy white women, and it succeeds in catering to their tastes and sensibilities.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Target Audience:**\n   - The book seems tailored for a very specific demographic: rich white women aged 85+ in assisted living communities. It’s perfect for listening to during visits with elderly relatives like grandma, Aunt Mary, or Mrs. Ferguson from down the street.\n\n- **Narration Style:**\n   - The narrator speaks loudly and clearly, with a voice reminiscent of Daria’s sister’s squeal, which might appeal to the intended audience.\n\n- **Character Representation:**\n   - The book avoids any characters who are non-white, non-straight, non-cis, or non-conforming, ensuring that the elderly audience isn’t made uncomfortable.\n   - Men are portrayed as infantile morons who would be helpless without their wives, while women are depicted as self-sacrificing, always prioritizing their husbands’ needs over their own.\n\n- **Themes and Values:**\n   - Marriage is presented as the ultimate purpose of a woman’s life, with the idea that getting or staying married is always the correct choice. Compromise in marriage is framed as the woman setting aside her own goals to support her husband’s whims.\n   - The book reinforces traditional gender roles and values, which may resonate with the older generation.\n\n- **Daily Routines and Activities:**\n   - Characters wake up extremely early, even if they have nowhere to be, and are often on their third activity by 8am. Anything ending at 9pm or later is considered a late night.\n   - Meals are a significant focus, featuring unseasoned, meat-based mid-20th-century dishes. Garlic bread is treated as a spicy and exotic delicacy, described in detail.\n\n- **Social Commentary:**\n   - The book contrasts “regular rich people” with “really rich people,” suggesting that the former are more down-to-earth, while the latter have limited decor and food options. However, money is portrayed as meaningless, with a nod to the financial realities of authors who receive advances.\n   - There’s a mention of free parking near a hospital and within walking distance of Fenway Park, a scenario that feels outdated and nostalgic.\n\n- **Pop Culture References:**\n   - The book includes oddly specific pop culture references, such as Pearl Jam being the favorite band of the twenty-something characters, which might allow elderly readers to show off their knowledge.\n\n- **Legal Themes:**\n   - The law firm setting avoids too much “unseemly” legal talk, focusing instead on the gentle suggestion that not everyone prosecuted for a crime is guilty. The lawyers, like the elderly audience, seem confused by the adversarial justice system, making them more relatable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is clearly designed for a niche audience of elderly, wealthy white women, and it succeeds in catering to their tastes and sensibilities. While it may evoke frustration or sadness for younger readers, it hits the mark for its intended demographic, offering a nostalgic and comforting experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "The story is told in the third person and follows multiple characters spending their summer in Chatham on Cape Cod. Although I initially struggled to distinguish between the many characters, I found that as the narrative progressed, the shifts became clearer and more recognizable.",
            "I found Hannah's character inconsistent; she starts decisively but suddenly becomes indecisive without clear justification. Nonetheless, I appreciated her experiences with writer’s block and shadowing lawyers for inspiration, even if the situation felt somewhat implausible. Additionally, the portrayal of Sara and Maddie’s marital conflicts felt problematic—Sara silently seethed while allowing Tom to dominate her, and Maddie was so preoccupied with her own issues that she overlooked Richie’s dissent.",
            "This novel explores relatable themes such as grief from losing a parent, re-entering the workforce after raising children, marital conflict, evolving relationships, and the small-town versus big-city dilemma. These elements combine to create a light, enjoyable summer read, perfect for the beach.",
            "While the novel may resonate with many readers through its relatable themes, it didn't fully capture my interest.

However, I enjoyed the parts of her story dealing with writer’s block and her shadowing lawyers for book ideas, even if the scenario felt implausible. Sara and Maddie’s handling of their marital conflicts also felt problematic—Sara silently seethed while letting Tom dominate her, and Maddie was too absorbed in her own dilemma to notice Richie’s disagreement.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The audiobook was narrated by Stephanie Nemeth-Parker, who did a great job with character voices. However, I think the story might have benefited from a larger cast of narrators rather than just one.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Appeal:**  \n  While the novel will likely appeal to many readers due to its relatable themes, it wasn’t entirely for me. I did enjoy Sara’s enthusiasm for her new job at the bookstore and Maddie’s insights into her work as an author rep.

Their story prompted me to reflect on how a change of scenery might aid in healing. I appreciated Hannah's authentic creative process as an author, which seemed to stem from the writer's personal experiences. Additionally, Sara's character struck a chord with me, mirroring friends who often feel undervalued while juggling household duties, childcare, and work.",

The vivid descriptions effectively bring the settings to life, though at times they feel overly wordy. Chapter 21 appears to have an editing oversight, as Spencer and Hannah repeat the same conversation at both the beach and the baseball game. Additionally, the phrase “I see why you love it here” becomes repetitive, especially when spoken by characters not from Chatham. The presence of several typos in the last third of the book further suggests a rushed ending. I hope these issues will be addressed before the official publication.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The plot was extremely slow-paced, with no conflict, surprises, or excitement.  \n  - The story felt mundane and repetitive, with nothing significant happening throughout the book.  \n  - The last 50 pages were skimmed because the narrative failed to engage.  \n  - The ending felt abrupt and rushed, leaving no satisfying resolution.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters lacked depth and personality, feeling superficial and two-dimensional.  \n  - There was no meaningful character connection or development.  \n  - The relationships, especially the romantic ones, were flat and lacked chemistry.  \n  - The portrayal of most male characters was negative, which detracted from the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n  - The book was marketed as a romance, but it felt more like a mundane account of everyday life, with excessive detail about meals and routines.  \n  - The title, *Seaside Sisters*, suggested a focus on the relationship between Hannah and Sarah, but their interactions were limited and overshadowed by unrelated subplots, such as the elderly aunt’s relationship issues.  \n  - The story lacked a clear direction or purpose, making it feel like \"words on a page that meant absolutely nothing.\"  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing felt like an attempt to overcome writer’s block, resulting in a lack of creativity and engagement.  \n  - The excessive detail about mundane activities (e.g., meal preparation) detracted from the overall narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a significant disappointment. The lack of plot, character development, and meaningful relationships made it difficult to engage with the story. The pacing was slow, the characters were flat, and the narrative felt aimless. Despite my efforts to give it a chance, I found myself skimming through the final pages, eager for it to end. I am unlikely to read anything else by this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (out of 5)."

            "The first third of the book drags, with little action and generic characters and settings that give it a formulaic beach read vibe. The story centers on a family making small, everyday changes, which isn’t inherently negative—after all, not every transformation needs to be monumental.",
            "**Hannah:** Her sections were the longest but lacked engagement. The romance felt devoid of chemistry, leaving me uninterested in her storyline. **Sara:** I found her part the most compelling. Her husband's behavior frustrated me, but his quick turnaround felt appropriate for this genre. I enjoyed witnessing her journey toward personal fulfillment and growth. **Aunt Maddie:** Her storyline was captivating, highlighting the challenges of maintaining a long-term marriage that demands effort and care. I appreciated the realistic depiction of an imperfect yet enduring relationship.",

It’s a light, formulaic read that works for those looking for a comforting, everyday story.",

While it lacks major conflicts and resolves all issues neatly by the end—sometimes a bit too easily, like with Hannah's writer's block and Tom's disrespect toward Sara—it suits the casual nature of a beach read.

            "The story effectively weaves together multiple character arcs, though this occasionally limits the depth of individual character exploration. While the pacing remains steady, an overemphasis on setting descriptions can slow the narrative at times.",
            "Hannah, a best-selling romance author, grapples with writer's block and grief after her mother's passing as she returns to her hometown of Chatham, Massachusetts, to stay with her Aunt Maddie. Meanwhile, Hannah's sister, Sara, is a stay-at-home mom with four children longing to re-enter the workforce, and Aunt Maddie, facing a separation from her husband, questions her life choices. While the story aims to weave together the narratives of these three women, it lacks depth in their development. I would have preferred a greater emphasis on their personal growth and backstories.",
            "The setting of Chatham, Massachusetts, is richly detailed, capturing everything from the weather to local shops, which makes it easy to visualize the environment. However, I found the level of detail excessive. While it enhances the atmosphere, I would have preferred a greater emphasis on character development over the extensive descriptions of the setting.",

While these multiple storylines prevent the book from losing momentum entirely, the middle section drags due to an overemphasis on Hannah’s mundane daily routines. Although the resolution of all three arcs is satisfying, the pacing suffers as excessive attention is given to trivial details, particularly Hannah’s frequent meals. The abundant food descriptions overshadow more critical elements, such as character development and emotional depth.",

Although the characters' situations are relatable, they lack depth, with minimal physical or emotional descriptions beyond their ages.

However, the constant mention of name brands and exclusive colors in Chatham became tiresome and detracted from the story.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot lacked dramatic conflict and moved at a slow pace. Many parts of the story felt uneventful, making it less engaging compared to the author's previous works.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, such as Hannah, Sara, Tom, and Aunt Maddie, were interesting but underdeveloped in some areas. For instance, Maddie’s reasons for living apart from her husband were never clearly explained, leaving a gap in her character arc.\n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  The conflicts, such as Sara’s struggle with her husband Tom and Hannah’s writer’s block, were introduced but resolved too easily or lacked depth. Sara’s decision to leave for a week to make Tom understand her role felt like a missed opportunity for deeper exploration.\n\n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s writing style is generally enjoyable, with entertaining plots and well-crafted characters. However, this particular novel felt bland and did not meet the expectations set by her previous works.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential with its charming setting and interesting characters, it fell short due to its slow pacing, lack of dramatic conflict, and underdeveloped character arcs. It was not one of the author’s best works, despite her proven ability to create engaging stories.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story follows Hannah, a published author struggling with writer's block, as she visits her aunt in Cape Cod for a change of scenery. The plot is light and enjoyable, making it a perfect summer beach read. However, I found that some conflicts were resolved too quickly, and certain storylines were overlooked, resulting in a rushed pacing.",
            "Hannah is a relatable character, grappling with the challenges of authorship even after her initial success. The dynamics between Hannah, her aunt, and her sister are well-developed, adding depth to the narrative. Her friendships also shine, showcasing her ability to connect with others. However, Spencer's character feels inconsistent; his grumpy demeanor is only briefly displayed, leaving a disconnect in his portrayal.",
            "The writing style is light and accessible, lending a breezy feel to the book. The consistent tone makes it an enjoyable read, despite some shortcomings. The author’s emphasis on food and drinks is evident, with detailed descriptions of each dish and drink. However, this focus can be overwhelming, overshadowing other important elements. Descriptions of settings and characters are lacking; for instance, the aunt’s large house and a restored hotel are mentioned but not vividly depicted. Additionally, Hannah’s emotions during her interactions with Spencer are unclear, leaving readers uncertain whether she feels excited, nervous, or indifferent."

Her latest, *The Seaside Sisters*, is no exception and is sure to delight her readers!  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  Set in Cape Cod and featuring some of the places and a couple of appearances from her past book, *The Bookshop by the Bay*, the novel creates a vivid and immersive setting. I absolutely love the way that Kelley describes the setting and the food! It makes you yearn to be in the scenes with her characters.  \n\n- **Character Development and Storyline:**  \n  The story follows two sisters, Hannah and Sara, as they experience their first summer without their mom. Hannah, who moves from Brooklyn for the summer, dominates more of the book and provides a great storyline of a budding author trying to deliver her second book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  I just wish that there was more to Hannah's story because the epilogue was not enough!  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an ARC in exchange for my honest opinion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Seaside Sisters* is another delightful read from Pamela Kelley, with a charming setting, relatable characters, and a compelling storyline. While I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I felt the epilogue left me wanting more closure for Hannah's journey.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

            "The book follows three women—Hannah, Sara, and Maddie—each grappling with unique challenges during a summer on Cape Cod. While the story is a light and quick read, the characters' struggles often feel less significant than they could be. Additionally, the overly tidy resolutions to their issues diminish the narrative's depth.",
            "In this story, Hannah grapples with writer's block as she attempts to complete her second book. Meanwhile, Sara, a stay-at-home mom of four boys, juggles a part-time job and an indifferent husband, while Maddie navigates her new life after a long separation from her husband. Although their challenges are relatable, the absence of significant financial struggles and the tidy resolutions diminish the impact of their experiences. While Hannah's relationship with her new boyfriend is introduced, it lacks the depth I hoped for. The interactions among the three women are central to the narrative, yet their dynamics could have been explored more thoroughly to enhance the emotional resonance of the story."

The story explores themes of family, loss, and new beginnings, as Hannah and her sister Sara navigate their mother's passing and their own personal journeys—Hannah finding love and Sara rekindling her relationship.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Hannah and Sara are well-developed characters with relatable struggles. Hannah's reluctance to move into her late mother's home and her decision to stay with her aunt add depth to her character. Sara's challenges of raising four boys while dealing with grief make her storyline compelling.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The beachside setting is vividly described and contributes to the novel's charm. The prose is delightful and enhances the overall reading experience, making it a perfect summer read.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  While the writing is generally enjoyable, there are moments where it becomes overly explanatory. For instance, the detailed description of the movie *Top Gun* felt unnecessary and detracted from the flow of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful and heartwarming summer read with a charming setting and relatable characters. Despite some minor issues with overly descriptive passages, it offers a satisfying escape and explores meaningful themes of love, loss, and new beginnings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It does.  \n  - She immerses herself into the small town and her relationship with family.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - The Aunt and Sister have more romance than the FMC, and both are experiencing marital problems.  \n  - Nobody wants to deal with the mom's house, and it is ignored most of the story, only popping up as a sighting at one point, and then an incomplete project at the end.  \n\n- **Realism vs. Escapism:**  \n  - In all honesty, it's very realistic.  \n  - But I don't read fiction to find reality.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a light, summery read with a focus on family dynamics and small-town life. While it captures realism well, it lacks the escapism and romantic depth I typically seek in fiction, making it feel somewhat bland overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The underdeveloped characters, disconnected narratives, and lackluster romantic subplot left me wanting more. As a first-time reader of this author, I was disappointed and unlikely to explore more of their work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story itself was cute, but there were three people's stories to follow, and just as I got into one, another one started. I found this difficult to keep up with at times.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I did like Sara and Hannah and felt like their closeness is what all sisters want or have. I also loved Joy—she was so fun and always wanted what was best for everyone involved.  \n\n- **Overall Suitability:**  \n  Overall, I don't think this is the book for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story had its charming moments and some well-developed characters, the multiple storylines made it hard for me to stay engaged. The book didn’t quite resonate with me personally.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There’s also a hint of Elin Hilderbrand’s style, particularly in how the setting plays a significant role. In Hilderbrand’s books, Nantucket feels like a character, and similarly, Cape Cod serves as a character/setting in Pamela Kelley’s work.  \n\n- **Themes and Handling:**  \n  The novel explores themes such as sisters, grief, and potential marital troubles. These topics were approached gently, with the author skimming the surface rather than delving deeply into them.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  The book is a fun and light read, making it an enjoyable experience. It left me interested in exploring more of Pamela Kelley’s work in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a lighthearted and engaging read, particularly for fans of authors like Susan Mallery and Elin Hilderbrand.

While the detailed descriptions of the environment and food add to the ambiance, the characters and their emotional journeys could have been explored more deeply. The book is enjoyable but doesn’t quite match the charm of the author’s previous works. Fans of light, summery reads with a focus on family and self-discovery will find it appealing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The sisters, Hannah and Sara, are strong yet sensitive women with their own careers and aspirations, embodying support rather than aggression. Their strong family bonds shine through as Hannah moves to Chatham for the summer to overcome her writer's block, with Sara and Aunt Maddie by her side. When Sara encounters marital issues, Hannah offers her guidance, and both sisters rally around Maddie during her challenges. The warmth of their family ties is heartwarming, and I enjoyed witnessing their growth and mutual support throughout the story.",
