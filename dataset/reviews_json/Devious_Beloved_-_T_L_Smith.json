            "This novel concludes without a cliffhanger, offering a satisfying journey to the happily ever after (HEA), even if it seems unlikely given the characters' circumstances.

            "This book had it all: spice, groveling, revenge, challenging parents, forced marriage, blackmail, a fierce protectiveness, morally grey characters, and a hint of enemies-to-lovers. The electric tension between Whiskey and Lottie kept me hooked from start to finish.",
            "Lottie is unapologetically herself, fiercely standing her ground against her father and Whiskey, never allowing them an easy path with her. Whiskey, while delighting in provoking her, shows care in his own unique way. Their ongoing struggle to push each other away ultimately draws them closer, and I loved that Whiskey fell first. The intensity of their relationship is captivating. Whiskey's heartfelt confession—*“You make me smile when I didn't know I needed to. When you smile, my heart does this stupid pitter-patter I didn't agree to. I didn’t love you straight away; I just knew I wanted you. I’d give it all up for you. I want you to know that.

            "The plot lacks action and suspense, focusing primarily on romance and blackmail. However, I believe this absence of tension was appropriate for the story. The ending was perfectly placed, highlighting the characters' growth throughout the narrative. I appreciated the dual perspectives, which enriched the plot and allowed for more developments. It's clear why this book stands alone; all loose ends were tied up, and every question was answered.",
            "This story centers on a tumultuous love/hate romance that felt drawn out at times. I wished for the characters to unite sooner, although their chemistry delivered some steamy moments. The main male character, Whiskey, is accustomed to getting his way—what he wants most is Lottie. While I don't condone his methods of convincing her to marry him, his deep feelings for her are evident throughout the narrative.\n\nLottie, the female lead, finds herself blackmailed into a marriage with a man she despises, largely due to her family's fixation on appearances. I empathized with her struggle, as she was stuck in a role that stifled her choices. Still, she managed to assert herself as best she could. Whiskey's feelings for Lottie are clear; he falls for her first, and their dual perspectives in the writing allow readers to engage deeply with their emotional journeys.\n\nOverall, the characters were well-developed and significantly enriched the plot, making it an enjoyable read despite some frustrations with the pacing of their romance.",

He was a guy who was used to getting what he wanted, and what he wanted was Lottie.  \n   - I don’t agree with what Whiskey did to Lottie to get her to marry him, but it was easy to see how much she meant to him and how much he loved her.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - There wasn’t really any action or suspense in the plot; the main aspect was the romance and blackmail.  \n   - I felt like there didn’t really need to be any action or suspense, though.  \n   - The ending was left at the perfect place and showed how far the characters had come.  \n\n- **Character Development and Perspectives:**  \n   - The characters were great and added a lot to the plot.  \n   - Lottie was the main female character, and in this book, she was blackmailed into a marriage with a guy she hated. Her parents were all about appearances.  \n   - I actually felt for Lottie because she was always expected to act a certain way and didn’t get to make her own choices. However, she stood up for herself as best she could.  \n   - Whiskey fell first for Lottie, and his feelings for her were evident.  \n   - The book was written from both Lottie and Whiskey’s points of view, which helped me connect more with both characters and see their feelings for each other develop.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n   - I’m really happy that the book was written from dual perspectives because it allowed for a lot more things to happen in the plot.  \n   - I can completely understand why this book is a standalone; everything was wrapped up, and all the questions were answered.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n   - The cover for this book is absolutely perfect for it.

            "The ending felt rushed, particularly following the significant reveals. Lottie’s sudden change of heart seemed abrupt, failing to fully express her love for Whiskey. While the build-up to the climax was compelling, the resolution fell short of matching that intensity, leaving some emotional payoff lacking. The book is a reimagining of *Formerly Cruel Beloved*, featuring some name changes. It offers a blend typical of TL Smith’s style, featuring an anti-hero and a fierce heroine. The story centers on Whiskey and Lottie, whose one-night stand introduces major complications for Lottie. Whiskey, as an anti-hero, skillfully manipulates circumstances for his gain, yet Lottie stands her ground, giving as good as she gets. The addition of the Shane angle adds intrigue, forcing Whiskey to confront the consequences of his actions.",
            "Whiskey is an unconventional hero—manipulative and self-serving, he embodies the essence of an anti-hero. In contrast, Lottie is a strong, independent heroine who refuses to be dominated by him, cleverly making him pay in unique and entertaining ways. While Lottie’s unsupportive and unloving parents add depth to her character, their portrayal could be further developed. Barry, Whiskey’s friend, and Emma, Lottie’s best friend, are intriguing side characters who deserve their own novella."

The anti-hero and b*dass heroine elements were engaging, and the Shane angle added a nice twist. However, the rushed ending and unresolved questions left me wanting more.

            "Lottie (Bunny) is a strong character who has long lived in the shadow of her father's expectations. Her decision to call off her wedding marks a significant step toward independence and rebellion. In contrast, Whiskey embodies the classic Alpha male archetype, complete with possessive tendencies, yet his character is rich and complex. Despite the shaky beginnings of their relationship, Lottie and Whiskey's bond evolves into something remarkable. Lottie steadfastly refuses to let Whiskey dictate her life, and their initial power struggle ultimately transforms into mutual respect and love. The 17-year age gap adds an intriguing dimension to their dynamic rather than hindering it.",

It was impossible to put down, making it hard to function normally.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story evoked a wide range of emotions, from anxiety and anger to love and care. The tension between the main characters (MCs) was palpable and kept me hooked from the very beginning.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Lottie (Bunny) is a strong character who has spent most of her life living for her father’s image. Her rebellion against his expectations, especially when she called off her wedding, showed her growing independence. Whiskey, on the other hand, is a classic Alpha male with possessive tendencies, but his character is compelling and layered.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The story revolves around a night that Lottie and Whiskey shared, which Whiskey later uses as blackmail to seek revenge for something Lottie knows nothing about. This creates a complex dynamic built on lies and manipulation, which adds depth to the plot.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  Despite the rocky foundation of their relationship, Lottie and Whiskey’s connection evolves into something extraordinary. Lottie refuses to let Whiskey control her life, and their power struggle eventually turns into mutual respect and love. The age gap (around 17 years) doesn’t hinder their relationship; instead, it adds an interesting layer to their dynamic.  \n\n- **Memorable Moments:**  \n  Several scenes stood out, such as Whiskey finally admitting his feelings and the moment in Paris, which was unforgettable. The office scene involving Whiskey’s ex was also a highlight.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an incredible read, filled with emotional depth, complex characters, and a gripping plot. The relationship between Lottie and Whiskey, though unconventional, was beautifully developed, and their journey from conflict to love was both intense and satisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating, likely 5/5."
