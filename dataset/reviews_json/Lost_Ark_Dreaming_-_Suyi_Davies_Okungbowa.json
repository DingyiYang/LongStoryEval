It creates a bridge between gritty dystopian sci-fi (think Cyberpunk 2077 or Blade Runner) with a cultural fantasy rooted in the author's identity.  \n\n- **Ending and Style:**  \n  While most of the story is literal, the ending is very metaphorical and open-ended.

It was quite different, and I ended up liking it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novella exceeded my expectations, offering a fresh take on a familiar sci-fi trope while blending dystopian and cultural fantasy elements.

While the reviewer did not love these works, they found this novel \"more gratifying\" than either of them or their combination. The world-building is effective and distinct, though comparisons to Paolo Bacigalupi's works are noted as potentially not holding up.  \n\n- **Originality and Impact:**  \n  The novel is described as \"quite novel\" and ultimately satisfying. It stands out as a unique contribution to the dystopian genre, leaving a strong impression on the reader.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a compelling, fast-paced, and elegantly written work that combines brutal yet evocative storytelling with a unique post-climate crisis setting. Despite drawing inspiration from other works, it surpasses them in terms of gratification and originality. The reviewer strongly recommends it as a standout addition to the dystopian genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "The story unfolds through the perspectives of three main characters—Yekini, Ngozi, and Tuoyo—while incorporating archived materials. It tackles themes of class conflict, government corruption, solidarity, and outside intervention. However, the narrative comes across as generic and lacks depth in its exploration of these themes. I found the ending particularly unsatisfying and abrupt. The allegorical elements overshadowed other aspects of the story, making it challenging to engage with or critically assess the narrative. My experience with this novella parallels my struggles with other works, such as *Son of the Storm*, which I found uncomfortably peculiar and ultimately set aside.",
            "In this story, Yekini, a mid-level government analyst, aspires to enhance the tower for the benefit of all. Ngozi, also a mid-level administrator, is driven by ambitions to ascend to the upper class, convinced he deserves a better life. Meanwhile, Tuoyo, who lost his wife at sea, seeks solace while managing the undersea level. However, the characters come across as caricatures of their roles, making it challenging to connect with or invest in their journeys.",
            "This novella is rich in allegory, which made it difficult for me to fully grasp its deeper meanings. My struggle may stem from a lack of relevant cultural knowledge, a challenge I've encountered with other allegorical works, particularly those by Black African authors. The story presents a surreal blend of African politics, climate fiction, and Yoruba mythology, set in a futuristic Nigeria where five towers shaped like a hand rise off the coast. Only the central tower, the Pinnacle, remains habitable. The political allegory is structured around a familiar economic model: the upper floors symbolize the ruling elite, the middle floors represent the professional class, and the submerged lower levels depict the underclass. Those outside the tower are viewed as adversaries. Additionally, the climate fiction aspect highlights rising sea levels that have engulfed much of the world."

            "The story's exploration of hope and despair in a post-apocalyptic world evokes comparisons to the obscure Polish film *O-bi, O-ba: The End of Civilization*, which similarly features a mythical vessel as humanity's last hope. While this trope appears frequently in generation ship narratives, it is particularly well-executed in this tale.",
            "While it relies on familiar tropes, this novella is a compelling and well-crafted piece that exemplifies the effective use of the novella format.",
            "Initially, the novel appears to follow the typical YA dystopian formula, featuring familiar elements like a sinister government concealing secrets and a society divided by class, reminiscent of *Snowpiercer* and *An Unkindness of Ghosts*. However, it sets itself apart with its distinctive interludes, which add depth and originality to the narrative."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Impression and Tropes:**  \n   - At first, the novel seemed like a typical YA dystopia, relying on familiar tropes such as the \"evil government hiding secrets\" and the class-based division of people across physical \"layers\" (similar to *Snowpiercer* and *An Unkindness of Ghosts*).  \n   - While these tropes are central to the story, the novella distinguishes itself through its unique interludes.  \n\n- **Interludes and Narrative Style:**  \n   - The interludes, which include poetry, newspaper articles, and thematic reflections, add an interesting layer to the book.  \n   - While they provide a fresh and unique element, they sometimes disrupted the flow of the story, especially given the high frequency of interludes in such a short narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Comparisons:**  \n   - The story’s themes of hope and despair in a post-apocalyptic setting reminded me of the obscure Polish film *O-bi, O-ba: The End of Civilization*, which also explores the idea of a mythical vessel as humanity’s last hope.  \n   - This trope is common in generation ship stories but is executed effectively here.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n   - Despite its reliance on familiar tropes, the novella stands out as an interesting and well-crafted work.  \n   - It serves as a great example of how to effectively utilize the novella format.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Lost Ark Dreaming* is a compelling novella that, while rooted in familiar dystopian tropes, distinguishes itself through its unique interludes and thematic depth.

Its incorporation of African spirituality and cultural elements offers a fresh perspective, though it may leave some readers curious yet uninitiated. The archival interludes occasionally disrupt the flow, as they seem to break the fourth wall to underscore the story’s themes. While the novella's brevity is both a strength and a weakness—providing a concise narrative—it also limits the development of its world, characters, and themes. Ultimately, the story presents a tantalizing glimpse into a larger universe, leaving readers eager for more exploration and detail.",

Ngozi is a richly developed character, embodying the tension between ambition and moral dilemmas. Yekini acts as a bridge between social strata, skillfully navigating new information and changing circumstances. In contrast, Tuoyo, while capable, lacks the depth of the other characters, making him less memorable.",

The lower levels, submerged underwater, are inhabited by the poor and working class, while the wealthy occupy the upper levels. This compelling setting is heightened by the tension of an actively sinking environment, creating a vivid and haunting visual. Although the world is rich in history, partially revealed through archival reports, the story's brevity leaves the city and its towers feeling somewhat empty and underdeveloped.",

The African setting offers a refreshing departure from typical American narratives in the climate fiction genre, presenting a unique perspective.",

While it partially avoids the common technofix pitfall, it still hinges on the notion that salvation is rooted in technology, which weakens a more profound critique of modern behaviors. The mythological elements create a direct conflict with the technological aspects, distinguishing it from solarpunk traditions."

            "In this story, we meet Yekini, a dedicated Midder analyst who balances her career with caring for her grandmother. Driven by a strong sense of justice, she strives to do right by everyone. In contrast, Ngozi, another Midder, embodies bureaucratic disdain for the Lowers while grappling with his own traumatic past. Meanwhile, Tuoyo, an engineer and mechanic from the Lower class, is still mourning the loss of his wife to the terrifying Children of Yemoja. The characters are well-developed, and their personal struggles lend significant emotional depth to the narrative.",
            "Set in a future ravaged by climate change and flooding, the story follows a mega-wealthy capitalist who constructs five towers, known as The Fingers, off the coast of West Africa. The tallest tower, the Pinnacle, emerges as humanity's last refuge. Within this structure, society is stratified: the Lowers reside below sea level, the Midders occupy the middle, and the Uppers live at the top. This layered world-building enriches the narrative, adding depth to the characters and their struggles.",
            "The incorporation of Yoruba mythology and flood narratives, including figures like Mami Water and Yemoja, alongside references to Noah and the ark, added a distinctive and culturally rich dimension to the story.",

It added depth and authenticity to the story, making it stand out in the genre.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The novella format was perfect for this story lengthwise. It concluded nicely, and I wasn’t left wanting more. The plot revolves around a breach in one of the underwater floors, and the characters must figure out what happened and how to survive. The pacing was well-balanced, keeping me engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The story masterfully blended suspenseful action scenes with introspective elements. It highlighted the role humans play in shaping the world and explored the idea that the stories people are taught and told aren’t always the truth. This added a layer of complexity and thoughtfulness to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed this novella. It combined a gripping setting, rich cultural elements, and a well-paced plot with meaningful themes. The blend of action and introspection made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Set in a near-future, flooded Lagos, this novella showcases a society largely confined to a towering skyscraper amidst a submerged city. Through a blend of archival documents, flashbacks, and subtle hints, Okungbowa constructs a grounded and believable dystopia. The world-building stands out as one of the novella's greatest strengths, defying typical genre expectations and taking unexpected yet well-reasoned turns. The dystopian atmosphere strikes an ideal balance—neither excessively exaggerated to be implausible nor too subdued to lack intensity. It resonates with genuine human behavior, creating an unsettlingly authentic experience."

Their interactions added emotional weight to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The exploration of class structure and societal hierarchy in a post-apocalyptic world was thought-provoking and added layers to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novella excels in world-building and thematic depth, it left me wanting more in terms of action and a satisfying conclusion. The balance between plot and backstory was well-handled, but the brevity of the format limited its potential for a fully immersive experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The worldbuilding is tightly focused, creating an insular environment that raises questions about the broader state of humanity and the world above the waves. Society is divided into uppers, midders, and lowers, highlighting the growing detachment of the elite from the lower classes who sustain the infrastructure.",

The layered narrative mirrors the structure of an ark, interweaving a broader story about the flood and ark with a focused near-future dystopia and its potential heroes. \n\nThe protagonists illustrate various societal strata, revealing the desperation of those striving to maintain their status and the tension between classes. The story critiques governmental neglect and the postponement of essential maintenance, drawing striking parallels to real-world governance. Furthermore, it examines the possibilities for communication and cooperation between the inhabitants of the tower and the beings of the deep.",

It begins with a gripping event: a Yemoja's Child entering the Lower airlock, triggering a lethal reaction from the ruling class. While the narrative draws inspiration from *Snowpiercer* and J.G.

The ending, though abrupt, is emotionally impactful, revisiting protagonist Yekini's dream and leaving some plot questions intriguingly unresolved.",

It explores central themes of societal inequality, the awakening of ancient gods, and the rapid evolution of humanity, highlighting the conflict between the ruling class (the Haves) and the oppressed (the Have-Nots).

            "The story opens with a dream sequence in which Yekini envisions a grand Ark and a figure reminiscent of Olokun, Noah, or Deucalion, symbolizing survival in a flooded world. The plot centers on Yekini, Ngozi, and Tuoyo as they tackle a perilous breach in the submerged levels of the Pinnacle, mirroring the tower's stratified social structure. The climax is thoroughly satisfying, seamlessly tying together all narrative threads while leaving the possibility for either a continuation or a standalone conclusion.",
            "In this story, Yekini, an analyst from the Midders level, wrestles with her family's troubled past and views her current assignment as a form of punishment. Meanwhile, Tuoyo, a mechanic and foreman, copes with the grief of losing his wife while navigating the demands of his job. Ngozi, a bureaucrat of higher status, confronts the unease of working in the undersea levels, underscoring the stark social divides within the Pinnacle.",
            "The prose is both poetic and mythic, seamlessly intertwining with the story's action and adventure. The narrative captivates, enriched by interludes that deepen its themes and emotional impact.",
            "Set in a future Lagos largely submerged underwater, this novella follows survivors residing in the Pinnacle, the last tower constructed by the Diekara family. It reimagines the human survival trope within towering structures, providing a fresh perspective on post-catastrophe societies.",
            "This novella delves into profound themes, including the nature of stories, myths, memory, and the influence of propaganda on belief. It highlights the hope that emerges when individuals are willing to sacrifice privilege for truth. The narrative examines the critical choices that arise when reality challenges a rigid hierarchy of status and value. Echoing the themes and styles of Rivers Solomon’s *The Deep*, it presents a unique perspective on survival and societal structures."

        "conclusion": "*Lost Ark Dreaming* by the author is a remarkable and absorbing novella that masterfully weaves together themes of myth, memory, and societal hierarchy within a richly imagined post-catastrophe world. Its poetic prose, compelling characters, and satisfying climax make it a standout piece of speculative fiction.",

This book had potential but fell short, which is why I gave it a two-star rating.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Novel**  \n   - The perspective shifts were well-executed.  \n   - The plot was intriguing, offering a glimpse into a post-climate-change society and raising questions about how our cities and societies might transform.  \n   - The core message about capitalism failing to address the climate crisis and the greed of corrupt corporations resonated with me, though I wish it had been explored more deeply.  \n   - A powerful quote (p. 83) highlighted the hypocrisy of blaming marginalized communities for environmental destruction while corporations perpetuate it.  \n\n- **Weaknesses of the Novel**  \n   - The ending was unsatisfying and failed to tie the ideas together, leaving many unanswered questions.  \n   - The biological evolution of the Children felt inconsistent. While they developed physical adaptations like webbed fingers and gills, their language and communication skills remained unchanged, which seemed unrealistic.  \n   - The Children's motivations were unclear. They disagreed with Omiwalé's mission but allowed him to steal the Queen Conch and instigate a war, which didn’t make sense.  \n   - The mystical element of the Queen Conch felt forced and poorly integrated, detracting from the story rather than enhancing it.  \n   - The lack of exploration into class riots within the Towers made the world-building feel incomplete. Only two riots in centuries seemed unrealistic.  \n   - Ngozi's character arc was clichéd, with a predictable transformation from a mean, arrogant rich guy to a suddenly empathetic figure.  \n   - Yekin's \"purpose\" often felt delusional and unconvincing.  \n   - The fate of Lagos after the Beluge was left unexplained. Did everyone die in the flood, or did they all evolve into the webbed-finger, scaly fish-humans? The lack of detail was frustrating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some compelling elements, such as its critique of capitalism and its exploration of a post-climate-change society, it ultimately fell short due to an unsatisfying ending, inconsistent world-building, and underdeveloped characters and themes.

It was particularly jarring when a new chapter began with the same narrator as the previous one, especially after a series of different perspectives. At times, these chapter breaks felt like a superficial way to emphasize the final sentences of the preceding chapter. I believe the novella would have benefited from being expanded into a full-length novel, as speculative fiction novellas can be challenging to execute effectively. Crafting a convincing and cohesive world in a shorter format is difficult, especially when the audience lacks the necessary cultural context.",

I’m moving on from this book without further analysis.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Tension escalates as a mysterious group threatens the tower's inhabitants, prompting urgency among the characters. Three protagonists—Yekini from the middle section, Ngozi from upper administration, and Tuoyo from the lower working decks—must navigate this crisis to uncover the truth. Complicating their journey is Amos Dickari, a descendant of the tower's founder, who relentlessly pursues them with his police force.

However, the characters' willingness to make sacrifices hints at a deeper purpose and a glimmer of hope for the future.",

Many narratives juxtapose the upper and working classes for social commentary, but this one focuses solely on the lives of the oppressed.

The world is so interesting that I could’ve easily spent more time learning about it. I was particularly curious about the specifics of the tower, even though I know that wasn’t the main focus. That said, the length feels perfect for a movie adaptation—I can already visualize it, and it’s so good.  \n\n- **Characters and World-Building:**  \n  The characters were distinct, and the inclusion of the Queen Conch as a mythic touch added a cool layer to the story. The melding of different religions through their overlapping ideas set an interesting and positive tone about remembrance and unity.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  I appreciated that we never saw the Uppers (the tower levels for the rich and powerful). Many works use images of the upper class contrasting with the working class as class commentary, but this one wasn’t about them. They exist, and we know orders come from them, but they hide away from the people they’re oppressing. This approach emphasizes their distance and inhumanity, making it clear that what truly matters is the people at the bottom working together to create a better life for all.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  I definitely recommend this book!

However, the novel’s inspiration remains decidedly original, blending these influences with African mythology and speculative fiction.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The three main protagonists undergo remarkable evolution throughout the story, which adds depth and engagement to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - While the novel is very good overall, there is a notable issue with the motivations of the representative of the new species who interacts with the protagonists. This creates unmet expectations for the reader and feels like a missed opportunity that could benefit from revision.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a compelling and original work of African science fiction, blending rich mythological elements with post-apocalyptic and socio-political themes. While the character development and thematic depth are strong, the motivations of a key character feel underdeveloped, leaving some narrative potential unfulfilled.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

This novella offers a tantalizing glimpse into the society within the tower, but I found myself disappointed by its abrupt conclusion.",

Years later, rising seas have transformed these structures into a refuge for survivors, who now inhabit their various levels, knowing only the confines of their walls. The author's world-building is captivating, drawing readers into the intricate political and social dynamics of life within the Fingers.",

Lost Ark Dreaming is an imaginative novella set in the wake of a climate change disaster.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  Off the coast of Lagos, five towers were built (known as the Fingers) to house elites. Years later, the seas have risen, and survivors live in the various levels of the Fingers, knowing only the world within these walls. The world created by Okungbowa is fascinating. I was easily sucked into the political and social implications of the world of the Fingers.  \n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  The story follows three characters, each one from a different echelon of the tower (Upper, Middle, and Lower) as they solve the mystery of a leak in the Lower level, and a greater mystery involving the creatures known only as the Children.  \n\n- **Mythology and Themes:**  \n  The mythology behind the Children and what actually happened to the people of Lagos was especially interesting.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  This short novella only gave us a taste of the society created within these walls, and I was disappointed when it came to a too-quick end.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  As someone who has not read a lot of speculative fiction, I was easily drawn into the story and enjoyed every minute of it. I highly recommend this book to those looking for a new speculative fiction story, or those who would like to simply try something new. Lost Ark Dreaming is a fantastic read, and I can't wait to discover more works by Okungbowa.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLost Ark Dreaming is a captivating and imaginative novella that explores a post-climate change world through rich world-building, intriguing mythology, and compelling characters. While the story felt too short, it left a lasting impression and a desire to explore more of Suyi Davies Okungbowa's works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

From the opening paragraph, it becomes clear that the story offers something unique and different.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  Beneath the surface of the cli-fi action adventure lies a profound exploration of humanity's disconnection in late global capitalism. The novel examines how we have lost touch with each other, our ancestors, spirituality (particularly non-organized religious spirituality), and our relationship with the natural world.  \n\n- **Use of Mythology and Spirituality:**  \n  Okungbowa skillfully incorporates ancient myths of rising waters and arc saviors to highlight humanity's need to reconnect with ancestral spirituality. The story emphasizes that survival and a better world depend on individuals who can awaken others to the interconnectedness of all life and the importance of centering our relationship with nature.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The \"new saints\" in the story are not the powerful or anointed but rather ordinary, everyday people who have experienced profound realizations about unity and survival. These characters serve as a reminder that change and hope come from within the mundane.  \n\n- **Impact and Message:**  \n  The novel delivers a powerful message about the necessity of reconnecting with our roots and the natural world to survive and thrive.

While the ending felt a bit abrupt, the unique world, strong narrative voice, and skillful use of multiple perspectives make it a compelling read. I’m eager to see what Suyi Davies Okungbowa could achieve with a longer format.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The monster is depicted as resilient, adaptable, and a symbol of limitless possibility, challenging conventional boundaries of identity and existence. The overall message is profound and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Execution and Style:**  \n  While the thematic content is compelling, the execution of the story didn’t resonate with me as much. The narrative style or structure may not have fully captured my interest or aligned with my preferences.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novella delivers a powerful and important message about the nature of monstrosity and the fluidity of identity. However, the execution of the story fell short of my expectations, making it less enjoyable for me overall.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
