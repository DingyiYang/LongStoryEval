            "*Sky Full of Elephants* opens with a haunting image: all white people in America walking into the sea. The narrative centers on Charlie, a former inmate and electrical master, who is given the mission to reshape the new United States. He receives a message from his estranged daughter, who lives in Wisconsin with her white family, urging him to take her to the South, where some white people may still be alive. Their journey in electric cars—necessitated by the cessation of gas drilling—unfolds against the backdrop of a post-white world, showcasing its beauty and complexities.",
            "I commend the author for probing the violence underlying this utopia and crafting characters who grapple with its moral complexities. The world he envisions is appealing, yet it raises a crucial question: Would I be allowed to exist in this utopia, or does it necessitate the eradication of people like me?",
            "The novel envisions a utopia built on the genocide of white people, a concept that poses a significant challenge for white readers. Although the author occasionally seems to take pleasure in this idea, they mostly allow characters to wrestle with the moral complexities of this new reality. In this world, Black individuals can live free from violence and oppression. The author argues that capitalism and oppression are intrinsic to dominant cultural frameworks, and their absence here creates a utopian society. While I appreciate this imaginative vision, it ultimately oversimplifies complex issues and risks perpetuating the very violence the narrative seeks to critique.",
            "This book wasn't intended for someone like me—a straight, white, middle-class, educated, cisgender male—and that discomfort is what makes it significant. It challenged my perspective and compelled me to confront uncomfortable truths."

        "conclusion": "*Sky Full of Elephants* is a thought-provoking and challenging novel that forces readers to confront uncomfortable truths about privilege, oppression, and the cost of utopia. While I admire the author’s imagination and the moral questions they raise, I find the premise to be an oversimplification that risks perpetuating the very violence it seeks to critique.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Target Audience and Personal Impact:**  \n  The book was not written for someone like me—a straight, white, middle-class, educated, cisgender male—and it made me uncomfortable. However, I believe that’s precisely why it was important for me to read it. It challenged my perspective and forced me to confront uncomfortable truths.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  *Sky Full of Elephants* begins with all white people in America walking into the sea and drowning. The story follows Charlie, a former inmate and master of electricity, who is tasked with transforming the new United States. He receives a message from his estranged daughter, who was living in Wisconsin with her white family, urging him to take her to the South where some white people might still be alive. The journey with Sidney in electric cars (since gas drilling has ceased) reveals the beauty and complexities of a post-white world.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel presents a utopia predicated on the genocide of white people, which is a challenging concept for white readers. At times, the author, Campbell, seems to relish this idea, but at his best, he allows the characters to grapple with the moral implications of this new reality. In this world, Black people can live freely without fear of violence or oppression. Campbell suggests that capitalism and oppression are inherent to white culture, and their absence in this new world creates a utopia. While I can appreciate the imaginative vision, I find it to be an oversimplification that risks perpetuating the very violence Campbell critiques.\n\n- **Character Development and Moral Complexity:**  \n  I commend Campbell for questioning the violence inherent in this utopia and for creating characters who wrestle with its moral complexities. The world he imagines is one I would want to live in, but it raises a critical question: Would I be allowed to exist in this utopia, or does it require the eradication of people like me?\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Sky Full of Elephants* is a thought-provoking and challenging novel that forces readers to confront uncomfortable truths about privilege, oppression, and the cost of utopia. While I admire Campbell’s imagination and the moral questions he raises, I find the premise to be an oversimplification that risks perpetuating the very violence it seeks to critique. Nonetheless, it is an important and impactful read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their road trip from Wisconsin to Alabama highlights their struggle to understand one another, complicated by Charlie’s secret reason for his incarceration and the emotional distance he has kept from Sidney.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The road trip is the highlight of the novel, showcasing how the vanishing of white control affects different aspects of the country. However, once Charlie and Sidney enter Mobile, in the Kingdom of Alabama, the plot shifts dramatically. The festive atmosphere and the lifting of a societal burden take precedence, and the father-daughter dynamic virtually disappears as they focus on other priorities.\n\n- **Character Transformation:**  \n  Sidney’s sudden and seemingly magical embrace of her black identity after a lifetime of stubborn denial feels abrupt and unrealistic. This transformation, while symbolic, lacks the gradual development needed to make it believable.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel delves into themes of identity, both individual and collective, and examines how the enduring repercussions of slavery have manipulated a whole race. The reason for the white erasure, tied to the profound historical suffering inflicted by white America, is a powerful commentary, though the abrupt transformation into an idyllic world feels like a stretch.\n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n  While far from perfect, “Sky Full of Elephants” is a stimulating read.

            "The story falls short of the grit and suspense I anticipated from the premise. After a promising start, the plot loses momentum and fails to fulfill its potential. Instead of genuinely examining the structures of race in America, the book feels crafted to elicit a reaction from white readers. This over-explanation and emphasis on the white perspective ultimately diminish the story's impact.",
            "Sidney, the central character, is quite insufferable. Her perspective as a sheltered biracial girl with a white mother restricts both her depth and relatability.",

The narrative follows Charles Brunton, a man wrongfully convicted of a crime, who is freed after a bizarre phenomenon leads every white person in America to drown themselves. As he seeks to rebuild his life and reconnect with his daughter, Sidney, he navigates a drastically transformed society. This speculative science fiction tale effectively weaves together compelling themes with social commentary.",
            "Charles emerges as a compelling protagonist, showcasing remarkable resourcefulness in navigating a new world, despite his lack of formal education. His daughter, Sidney, is a complex character wrestling with emotional scars from her family's loss and her strained relationship with Charles. The secondary characters, like King Hosea and Queen Vivian, enhance the narrative by illustrating the varied ways individuals adapt to this shifting reality.",
            "The prose is both poetic and beautifully crafted, enhancing the sci-fi narrative and imbuing it with depth rather than turning it cheesy. The author skillfully integrates fantasy elements while maintaining a strong foundation in speculative fiction, which is truly commendable.",
            "The novel vividly portrays a post-apocalyptic America where infrastructure has crumbled, governments have vanished, and society has been irreversibly altered. The stark contrast between functioning cities like Washington, D.C., and Chicago and the perilous, monarch-ruled South is compelling. Moreover, Mobile, Alabama is depicted as a peaceful, culturally rich city steeped in hoodoo traditions, adding a fascinating layer of depth to the narrative."

However, the characters often feel underdeveloped, and their actions and motivations can be confusing or unconvincing.",

The book suggests that the world would become a utopia, with black people being happier and more connected to their \"magic black spiritual energy.\" However, the execution of this concept feels inconsistent and raises many unanswered questions, such as the fate of white people in prison or the logic behind the mass suicide.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character, Charlie, was in prison when The Event occurred, and his journey afterward is central to the story. Sidney, his half-white daughter, struggles with her identity, oscillating between embracing her whiteness and having mystical black experiences. However, the characters often feel underdeveloped, and their actions and motivations are sometimes confusing or unconvincing.  \n\n- **World-Building and Logic:**  \n  The world-building is inconsistent and lacks coherence.

The tone wobbles between serious and absurd, making it difficult to take the story seriously. The use of \"magic realism\" is questionable, as the magical elements, like \"magic baths,\" feel out of place and poorly integrated.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel attempts to explore themes of racial identity, oppression, and utopia, but these themes are muddled by the inconsistent logic and lack of depth. The idea that white people are an \"idea\" rather than a race is confusing, especially since all white people in the story die. The book also glorifies marijuana and natural energy, which feels like a superficial addition rather than a meaningful commentary.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  The book is described as profoundly dull, with utopia being portrayed as uninteresting and characters' struggles to accept it feeling tedious.

The idea of every white person walking into the nearest body of water to unalive themselves a year ago is both shocking and thought-provoking. Imagining the aftermath—empty suburbs, abandoned pets, deserted campuses, and the collapse of institutions like banks and prisons—made me reflect on the world around me and how it would look in such a scenario. This is a great indicator of good speculative fiction.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The first ten pages of the book are the best, and by the 20% mark, I thought this would be a five-star read. However, somewhere in the middle, the narrative became very symbolic, ethereal, and poetic, which shifted the tone and pacing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I enjoyed Sidney’s character arc and how she evolved from seeing herself as an outsider to becoming part of an “us” over the course of the book. This transformation was compelling and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Engagement and Thought-Provoking Nature:**  \n  The book makes you think and challenges you to reflect on societal structures and identity. It’s a deeply introspective read.  \n\n- **Format and Accessibility:**  \n  The audiobook version was boring and hard to follow. I gave up on it and switched to the hardcover, which was a much better experience. Reading the physical book allowed me to fully engage with the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel starts with a gripping premise and strong opening, but its shift to a more symbolic and poetic tone in the middle may not resonate with all readers. Sidney’s character development is a highlight, and the story is thought-provoking, though the audiobook format is not recommended.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nInitially thought to be a five-star read, but the middle section impacted the overall experience.

The plot becomes disjointed after the characters arrive in Mobile, AL, where the story loses momentum, leading to a lack of significant events.

Additionally, geographic and cultural inaccuracies, particularly in the depiction of Wisconsin and Sidney's aunt, weaken the story's authenticity. The introduction of a monarchy feels misplaced and lacks proper justification, especially within a narrative that critiques capitalism.",

Having lived his life defined by race, he suddenly finds himself in a world where his skin color no longer shapes his existence. This newfound freedom leaves him grappling with feelings of unearned liberation and a transforming sense of self.\n\nSidney, Charlie’s biracial daughter, encounters her own identity struggles as she was raised by her white family.

This distinctive backdrop allows for a profound exploration of identity and social transformation.",

The story is set in a post-racial America where capitalism no longer drives society, homelessness is eradicated, and life appears surprisingly easier. This unique backdrop sets the stage for an exploration of identity and societal transformation.  \n\n- **Character Development and Internal Conflicts:**  \n  The protagonist, Charlie Brunton, is a Black man who has spent twenty years wrongfully imprisoned. His unexpected freedom challenges his sense of identity, as his life has always been defined by his race. Now, in a world where his skin color no longer dictates his existence, he grapples with feelings of undeserved freedom and a shifting sense of self.  \n  Sidney, Charlie’s biracial daughter, struggles with her own identity, having been raised by her white family. The trauma of witnessing her family’s drowning adds layers to her internal conflict, as she navigates the tension between her external identity and her internal self. Campbell’s nuanced portrayal of these characters and their struggles is both sensitive and insightful.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel delves deeply into themes of race, identity, and societal norms. Campbell challenges the status quo with pointed observations, such as Sadie’s reflection on the lack of diversity in certain fields: “I’ve never even seen a Black pilot before.” These moments prompt readers to reflect on normalized societal issues that often go unnoticed.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Campbell’s writing is filled with beautiful prose and powerful quotes, making the novel a compelling read. His ability to capture complex emotions and internal conflicts with clarity and depth is a standout feature of the book.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot takes an unexpected turn in the middle of the book, shifting towards themes of magical realism and sci-fi. While intriguing, this tonal shift may feel jarring to some readers. Additionally, the novel has a few notable plot holes and pacing issues that detract from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Audience and Representation:**  \n  The novel seems specifically tailored to a Black audience, which is both a strength and a limitation. While it deeply explores Black experiences, it largely overlooks the broader spectrum of minority experiences in America. Other racial groups, such as Asians, are only passingly mentioned, which feels somewhat odd in a world devoid of white people.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Sky Full of Elephants* is not a book to read for its plot but rather for its profound exploration of race, identity, and societal norms. It challenges readers to reflect on deeply ingrained perspectives and poses uncomfortable questions about the world we live in.

This lack of clarity left me with more questions than answers, and I struggled to grasp the overall message or purpose of the narrative.",

Her behavior was often outrageous, such as nearly shooting a father and his young child without cause. While her backstory—resentment towards her Black father, insecurities, and lack of exposure to Black culture—provides some context, her actions and dialogue came off as exaggerated and stereotypical. Her struggle with belonging, feeling “too Black for the whites and too white for the Blacks,” felt generic and uninformed, as if the author had never engaged with someone mixed-race.

The book had a positive overall message, and I have the utmost respect for what the author was trying to accomplish. It’s an incredibly important endeavor.\n\n- **Execution and Clarity:**  \n  However, I was often confused while reading. The book gets very metaphorical, which, for me, was only effective to a certain extent. For example, the metaphor of the sky full of elephants and the trumpets didn’t make sense to me. Additionally, I never fully grasped how the machine worked, and since it was a huge part of the latter half of the book, my lack of understanding made everything really hard to follow. I was left with more questions than answers and didn’t feel a clear sense of purpose or understanding of the book’s message.\n\n- **Character Development (Sydney):**  \n  I found Sydney insufferable, especially in the first half of the book. As a biracial Black person myself, I felt her character made us look horrible. She was flat-out racist in many ways, and her behavior was often out of pocket—like almost shooting a dad and his young child for no reason. While I understand her backstory (resentment toward her Black dad, insecurity, and lack of exposure to Black people), her actions and dialogue felt exaggerated and stereotypical. Her character arc about not feeling like she belonged anywhere because she’s “too Black for the whites and too white for the Blacks” felt generic and uninformed, as if the author had never spoken to a mixed person. Lines like “oh my lips are too big” were cliché and eye-roll-inducing.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  There were parts of the book I enjoyed, but my frustration with Sydney and the confusion I felt about the metaphors and the machine overshadowed those moments. The first half of the book was particularly hard to read, which spoiled a lot of the experience for me, even though it improved by the end.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I respect the book’s concept and the important themes it tackles, I struggled with its execution, clarity, and the portrayal of Sydney’s character.

However, it felt like it was more than just that, which left me unsure about how to categorize or fully grasp it.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Charlie was a great character, and I enjoyed following their journey. On the other hand, Sidney frustrated me throughout the book—I often wanted to shake them for their actions or decisions.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The book started off strong with the big event, which hooked me initially. However, I felt like I lost the plot midway, and the pacing or direction seemed to falter. The ending fell flat for me, as it didn’t meet my expectations or deliver the impact I was hoping for.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book had potential with its intriguing premise and strong start, but it struggled to maintain momentum and deliver a satisfying conclusion. While Charlie stood out as a compelling character, Sidney’s actions were frustrating, and the plot’s mid-to-late execution left me feeling uncertain about my overall experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The novel delves into profound themes of suffering, endurance, and the cyclical nature of internal conflict, portraying the struggle to free oneself from an intangible enemy that gnaws at both memory and future—an issue that can't be resolved through physical means or apologies. It presents a compelling literary sci-fi concept: a world where all white people vanish by walking into the water. This thought experiment, reminiscent of Octavia Butler and Colson Whitehead, uniquely examines the implications of removing whiteness from society.

The narrative critiques the illusion that societal reforms have adequately addressed the mistreatment of people of color, envisioning a world where healing is attainable.

To explore whether Black healing should be pursued in a way that harms oppressors and their descendants.  \n  The post-apocalyptic premise, where white people are gone and life is better, serves as a deliberate oversimplification to underscore these themes.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The lead characters include a Black man falsely imprisoned after a white woman falsely accuses him of rape, and a biracial teenager who struggles with self-loathing instilled by her white family. These characters are central to the book’s exploration of identity and healing.\n\n- **World-Building and Plausibility:**  \n  The post-apocalyptic world, where the absence of white people leads to a better life, is presented with both plausible and implausible elements.

It presents Black communities in a reductive and offensive manner, implying that a Black-led society would descend into chaos and incompetence. This perspective overlooks the many successful Black-led organizations and individuals who excel in government, STEM, and community education.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The novel is not especially well-written. The prose lacks polish and fails to engage effectively.  \n\n- **Racial Representation and Themes:**  \n  The narrative is inherently racist and perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Black people. The portrayal of Black communities is reductive and offensive, suggesting that a Black-led society would devolve into chaos and incompetence. This ignores the existence of Black-led organizations and contributions in fields like government, STEM, and community education. The premise of only one enclave offering real aid in the entire country is absurd and dismissive of real-world efforts by Black communities.  \n\n- **Character Development (Sidney):**  \n  Sidney, the protagonist, is deeply irritating and serves as a mouthpiece for the author. Her lack of self-awareness and unwillingness to reflect on her biases is frustrating. Her character arc, which hinges on finding a Black man attractive as a catalyst for reconsidering her views, is shallow and problematic.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is underdeveloped and leaves many unanswered questions. While the story is over, the lack of depth in the setting and broader context is disappointing.  \n\n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n  The book’s synopsis claims it is “brimming with heart and humor,” but this is not reflected in the actual content. The tone is more offensive and frustrating than heartfelt or humorous.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel fails on multiple levels, from its poor writing and offensive racial stereotypes to its unlikable protagonist and underdeveloped world-building. It does not live up to its synopsis and feels more like a misguided attempt at diversity rather than a genuine exploration of its themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe review does not explicitly mention a numerical rating, but the overall sentiment is strongly negative, suggesting a low score (e.g., 1/5 or 2/5)."

How does the presence or absence of whiteness affect Black individuals differently? What becomes of systems established and sustained by white people if they were to vanish? Would a world without white people result in a utopian reformation of hierarchy, education, and governance?",

It's misguided to suggest that white people shouldn't engage with literature exploring themes of whiteness.

What happens to systems created and upheld by white people when white people no longer exist? Would a world without white people lead to a utopic transformation of hierarchy, pedagogy, government, and education?  \n\n- **Audience and Relevance:**  \n  I disagree with other white reviewers who claim this book isn’t written for white people. It’s absurd to think that white people shouldn’t engage with books about whiteness. Whiteness itself is the reason some white people feel these questions and novels aren’t for us, which completely misses the point.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  I found issues with the plot and pacing, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Characterization and Dialogue:**  \n  The characterization and dialogue also had significant shortcomings, impacting my engagement with the story.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The near exclusion of non-Black people of color felt like a strange decision, limiting the scope of the narrative.  \n\n- **Use of Magical Realism:**  \n  The introduction of magical realism halfway through the novel took me out of the story and shifted my focus away from real-world responses, reactions, and possibilities.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book offers a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of whiteness, it falls short in execution due to issues with plot, pacing, characterization, dialogue, and representation.

            "The story isn't the book's strongest element, and some readers might view it as unrealistic. For instance, scenes depicting characters walking into water and drowning may seem improbable, though they do reference the historical event of Igbo Landing. Additionally, Sidney's sudden transformation from self-hatred to enlightenment could feel rushed to some readers, but it powerfully echoes themes from Malcolm X's speech, “Who Taught You to Hate Yourself.”",

It’s lyrical and evocative, making the reading experience immersive despite the plot’s shortcomings.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n  The book is bold, emotional, and thought-provoking.

It has me thinking deeply about many issues, such as how many of our country’s (and world’s) problems are inherently tied to white supremacy and colonialism. The book raises questions about whether certain societal ideals (e.g., patriarchy, sexism, capitalism) would have emerged in communities untouched by these forces or if they were ingrained by the white-dominated societies people were forced to partake in.  \n\n- **Discomfort and Reflection:**  \n  I’ve read reviews where white readers say this book made them uncomfortable, and I think that’s the point. The book challenges the comfort of a world catered to certain groups and asks, “What if you were removed from the picture altogether?” While some may oversimplify the story as being about genocide, I believe it’s more about the deeper conversations it sparks.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  I’m VERY happy that the book revealed the cause of the “event.” I was worried we’d be left to speculate, so learning the truth was satisfying and shocking—I did NOT see it coming. However, I wish the ending wasn’t so abrupt. I wanted to see more of the new world and have more questions about what comes next.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While I liked most of the characters, I had a hard time empathizing with Sidney. I found her really unlikeable, which made it nearly impossible to connect with her. Although things turn around for her by the end, I wish I had liked her more earlier on to make her arc more impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a deeply thought-provoking and unique novel that challenges readers to reflect on societal structures and their origins. While I had some issues with the abrupt ending and Sidney’s character, the book’s exploration of complex themes and its shocking resolution left a lasting impression on me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The novel explores the generational trauma endured by a people who have faced centuries of enslavement, violence, exploitation, and destruction at the hands of white oppressors. It serves as a poignant reminder that the past shapes our present and future, and that memory persists.

It feels weak and poorly executed compared to the rest of the narrative, failing to provide a satisfying conclusion. The trend of leaving things open-ended among contemporary writers comes across as pretentious and condescending, as if implying readers are incapable of understanding deeper meanings. I find this approach lazy and have stopped reading other authors for less.  \n\n- **Themes and Impact:**  \n  Despite the disappointing ending, Cebo Campbell’s debut is a powerful and unforgettable work. It’s highly uncomfortable to read, which makes it essential. The novel delves into the generational trauma of a people who endured centuries of enslavement, murder, mistreatment, exploitation, and destruction at the hands of white oppressors. It reminds us that the past shapes the present and future, and that memory endures. The book emphasizes the importance of identity in the human experience and highlights how a significant portion of the population has been—and continues to be—denied access to this experience due to social and cultural norms imposed by white people, as well as the ongoing renewal of trauma.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The character of Sidney stood out to me as particularly compelling. Her struggle of living between two cultures and identities, feeling like she belongs to neither, is highly relevant today. Reading about Sidney’s existence in this limbo evoked a near-physical pain in me, allowing me to imagine the loneliness and isolation of such a situation.  \n\n- **Exploration of Trauma and Freedom:**  \n  Another thought-provoking aspect was the portrayal of individuals who, after being freed from oppression, found themselves lost in their newfound freedom and even longed to return to their previous state. This illustrates how trauma becomes intrinsic and systemic, shaping personalities, desires, and goals to align with those of the oppressor. It made me realize that what I once saw as adaptation or assimilation was, in fact, survival.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s ending is a letdown, its exploration of generational trauma, identity, and the enduring impact of oppression makes it a must-read. It’s an uncomfortable yet essential narrative that challenges readers to reflect on history, memory, and the complexities of freedom.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

It brilliantly addresses the question of identity, showing how being Black no longer carries the same weight and fear, allowing Black people to simply exist without racial constraints.  \n\n- **Identity and Reclamation:**  \n  The journey of identity in the book is depicted as a reclamation rather than a discovery.

Additionally, it overly centralizes America within the global context, failing to acknowledge how white supremacist and capitalistic structures are global phenomena that would still influence America even if all white people disappeared.  \n\n- **Execution and Ambition:**  \n  While the concept is brilliant and ambitious, the execution has its flaws. Despite these shortcomings, the book is still worth reading for its innovative ideas and thought-provoking themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a fascinating and ambitious exploration of identity and race in a world without white supremacy. While it excels in its thematic depth and portrayal of identity reclamation, it struggles with world-building and addressing broader global implications. Despite its flaws, it remains a compelling and worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up for Goodreads."

It weaves complicated questions around history, sociology, science, and magic into a father-daughter and community narrative, exploring themes of cultural and racial identity in America.  \n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**  \n  The novel presents a complex yet absurdly simple answer to the question of who we are culturally and racially in America (without spoiling it). It delves into an alternate reality America, where the absence of white people and white institutions forces characters to either fill the void, obsess over the loss, or move on entirely.  \n\n- **World-Building and Imagery:**  \n  The book vividly portrays what America (and the world) could look like if we let go of and heal from the beliefs, structures, and institutions rooted in white colonialism. It emphasizes valuing community, art, culture, spirituality, and living a good life above all else.  \n\n- **Impact and Reflection:**  \n  This is one of those books that \"clicked something into place\" in my brain, leaving a lasting impression. I feel compelled to revisit it in the future to uncover more layers of meaning.  \n\n- **Pacing and Storytelling:**  \n  The pace meanders, and the story isn't perfect, but I also think this is part of the experience, adding to the book's unique charm.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply engaging and thought-provoking exploration of identity, community, and the legacy of colonialism.

While she was clearly meant for significant growth and embodied the story's themes, her character arc ultimately felt unsatisfying.

It follows a man who was wrongfully imprisoned and his biracial daughter, who has never met him. The premise is packed with interesting elements.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel explores numerous thought-provoking themes, including the struggle of finding one’s identity and history as a biracial person raised as one race, internalized racism, and unconscious bias. These themes stood out to me the most.  \n\n- **Character Development (Sidney):**  \n  Initially, I didn’t enjoy Sidney’s character due to her negative attitude. She was clearly designed for significant growth and served as the vessel for the themes mentioned above. However, I didn’t feel her character arc reached a satisfying culmination.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The last 20% of the book felt slow, with not much happening despite big decisions being made. The ending didn’t feel like a proper resolution or an intentional open ending—it felt more like an almost-climax that lacked impact.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  I wish Sidney and Charlie, the father, had more shared screen time in the book. Their relationship felt underdeveloped, which was a missed opportunity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was engaging and tackled compelling themes, but it fell short in its pacing, ending, and character development, particularly with Sidney and her relationship with Charlie.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It feels disjointed and lacks the polish expected in a full-length novel.\n\n- **Representation and World-Building:**  \n  The book’s portrayal of a utopian Black nation is deeply flawed and unrealistic. It ignores the existence and realities of African and Black Caribbean nations where systems are not controlled by white people. The idea that Black Americans could create a utopia by appropriating traditions and histories from other Black countries is problematic and dismissive of those cultures.\n\n- **Internal Consistency:**  \n  The book contradicts itself by presenting a utopia with no class or hierarchy while featuring a king and queen who rule over everyone. The absurdity of their children having to wait in line to speak to them further undermines the book’s logic.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This book put me in the deepest reading slump I’ve ever experienced. It is one of the worst books I’ve ever read, and I regret wasting my time on it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a poorly written, cliché-ridden narrative with a flawed and unrealistic premise. Its lack of coherence, problematic representation, and internal inconsistencies make it a frustrating and disappointing read. I strongly advise against wasting time on it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nIf I could give this book zero stars, I would."

            "I found certain aspects of the book challenging, as they felt unrealistic and reflected my own biases. For example, the depiction of a utopian, non-violent society emerging after the disappearance of all white people seemed inconsistent, especially with the later introduction of violent walkers. Additionally, portraying Alabama as more racially violent and backward than other regions frustrated me, as it contradicted my own experiences in the state. Some characters, particularly Sidney, felt underdeveloped and unconvincing. Sidney was particularly insufferable, serving mainly as a voice for the absent white characters. Her inaction in the face of walkers was especially frustrating, given that she had the power to influence them but chose not to.",
            "The absence of Christianity among the surviving Americans seemed unrealistic, especially considering that most Black Americans identify as Christian. Additionally, the book overlooks certain professions and hobbies, such as the military and golf, suggesting they are unappealing to Black individuals, which contradicts my own experiences.",
            "This story employs symbols—such as Little donning a KKK uniform and the walkers in white—that might initially seem excessive, yet can be interpreted as metaphors for inherited trauma. Herald's assertion that \"Black carries us as a force\" is powerful, particularly when juxtaposed with the notion that \"White is an idea, not a race.\" The book prompted deep reflection on both my own identity and the experiences of others. Its central theme is encapsulated in Ethel's poignant question to Charlie: \"They're gone. Now you got no excuses for who you can be. So who you gonna be? Same as you were? Or everything you would've been otherwise?\" This theme resonated with me, especially in light of Sydney’s realization about her mother's regrets and inaction."

For example, flights are free, but workers earn salaries, and there's no explanation for how maintenance and other costs are covered. The idea of a slower-paced life with free expression was enjoyable, but the economic logistics didn't hold up.\n\n- **Symbolism and Metaphor:**  \n  The use of symbols, like Little draping himself in a KKK uniform and walkers wearing white, felt over the top but could be interpreted as metaphors for inherited trauma.

            "Charlie and Elizabeth's relationship felt rushed; deepening their connection beyond a weekend fling would have amplified the emotional weight of her betrayal. The book could have more critically examined Black society by exploring how influential Black figures often perpetuate harmful ideologies, akin to a Clarence Thomas-like character. Additionally, the notion that greed and capitalism vanish with white people is overly simplistic, overlooking the intricate power dynamics within Black communities.",
            "The characters Sidney and Charlie struck a deep chord with me, mirroring my own experiences as a suburban Black child in predominantly white environments. Little’s character, while initially shocking, was uncomfortably relatable, shedding light on the internalized shame often linked to Blackness. Meanwhile, Zu’s character represented a missed opportunity to tackle homophobia within Black culture and confront internalized bigotry.",
            "The dystopian setting, in which white people have vanished, serves as a unique and thought-provoking backdrop for examining Black identity and history. The presence of Black scientists, poets, and activists, along with the inclusion of Haiti's story, enriches the narrative with depth and historical significance. However, the lack of representation of other races—aside from a single Asian character—feels like a missed opportunity for broader inclusivity.",
            "This book offers therapeutic insights for Black readers, exploring themes of identity, belonging, and the effects of societal shame on Black culture. It encourages reflection on the harmful narratives surrounding Blackness in America and emphasizes the importance of cultural pride and reconnection. While it may initially appear to advocate for a pro-Black utopia, the narrative refrains from placing blame on white individuals for the country's issues, instead prioritizing introspection and societal critique."

            "In reviewing this book, I feel it's essential to acknowledge my identity, as it shapes my interpretation of the story. With strong Mexican and Spanish roots, alongside my identity as a privileged white American, I approached the narrative with curiosity about how the author would address those in the \"grey area\"—neither white nor Black. While the author touches on this later in the story, I still felt uncertain about my place within the narrative. This discomfort was thought-provoking, especially as a second-generation German with family who survived WWII, prompting me to confront the implications of my whiteness.\n\nThe ending felt more like a space for observation than critique. As a non-Black American, I recognized it wasn't my place to scrutinize the author's conclusion. Instead, I interpreted it as a call to continue learning and advocating for change, which was a powerful takeaway. \n\nThe italicized chapters detailing individual experiences during \"the event\" were brilliantly executed and resonated with my love for psychological horror. However, I wished for more of these vignettes to fully explore the world's transformation after the loss of a significant portion of society. The brief mention of the walkers in the desert hinted at this potential but left me wanting more, which felt like a missed opportunity to deepen the story's impact and showcase the author's talents. While I understand the author's intent to avoid an overemphasis on hate, expanding on these moments could have enriched the narrative further.",

It acknowledges the grief stemming from genocide while also celebrating the love and change that have emerged in the past century. Sidney, a character of both white and Black heritage, poignantly embodies this tension as she navigates feelings of being orphaned, lost, and longing for the familiarity of white America.",

            "In the gripping first half of the novel, the high tension of a road trip narrative captivates the reader. However, the second half, while still engaging, pivots towards introspection and identity exploration. Although these themes are meaningful, they lack the initial excitement. The ending aims to deliver an emotional resonance but falls slightly short. \n\nThe story begins with a compelling premise: a year after all white people in America drown themselves, the country undergoes radical changes. It follows Charles Brunton, a college professor, and his estranged daughter Sidney on their journey to Alabama. The tension of navigating this transformed America—filled with abandoned areas, dangerous zones, and evolving societal norms—drives the first half. In contrast, the latter part delves into identity, particularly Sidney’s struggle with her mixed heritage and the changing role of Black Americans in this new landscape.",
            "The relationship between Charles and Sidney is central to the story, with their strained dynamic—stemming from Charles' absence—adding significant emotional depth. Sidney's anger towards her family and her journey of self-discovery, as she explores Black history and her place in a transformed America, are particularly compelling elements of the narrative.",
            "The novel masterfully depicts a vivid, post-apocalyptic America, enriched by details such as the disinterest in oil pumping, the rise of communal hospitality, and the intriguing rumors of Alabama being ruled by a king. However, I found myself wanting a deeper exploration of how America has transformed since the mass drowning, as the world-building in the first half felt more engaging than in the latter half.",
            "The novel delves into themes of identity, family, and community. Sidney's journey to reconcile her mixed heritage within a predominantly Black America is both poignant and thought-provoking. The emphasis on unity and resilience is beautifully illustrated through the sense of togetherness and the welcoming of strangers as family."

The tension of navigating this altered America, with its abandoned areas, dangerous regions, and new societal norms, drives the first half of the novel. The second half shifts focus to exploring identity, particularly Sidney’s struggle with her mixed heritage and the evolving role of Black people in this new America.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The relationship between Charles and Sidney is central to the story. Their strained dynamic, rooted in Charles’ absence from Sidney’s life, adds emotional depth. Sidney’s anger toward her family and her journey of self-discovery as she learns about Black history and her place in this transformed America are particularly compelling.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel excels in creating a vivid, post-apocalyptic America. Details like the lack of interest in oil pumping, the shift toward communal hospitality, and the rumors of Alabama being ruled by a king add richness to the setting. However, I wished for more exploration of how America has changed since the mass drowning, as the world-building in the first half was more engaging than in the second.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel explores themes of identity, family, and community. Sidney’s struggle to reconcile her mixed heritage and her place in a Black-dominated America is thought-provoking. The sense of togetherness and the welcoming of strangers as family highlight the novel’s emphasis on unity and resilience.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The first half of the novel, with its high tension and road trip narrative, is gripping. The second half, while still good, shifts focus to introspection and identity, which, though meaningful, lacks the same level of excitement. The ending, while attempting to resonate emotionally, fell slightly short of its intended impact.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Sky Full of Elephants* is a fascinating novel with a unique premise and strong themes of identity and community. The first half, with its tension and world-building, is particularly engaging, though I wished for more exploration of the altered America in the latter part of the story. Despite a somewhat underwhelming ending, the novel offers thought-provoking ideas and a compelling journey of self-discovery.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot and Premise: 4/5  \n- Character Development: 4.5/5  \n- World-Building: 3.5/5  \n- Themes and Messages: 4/5  \n- Pacing and Structure: 3.5/5  \n- Overall: 4/5"

            "The story follows Charles, a Black man, and his biracial daughter, Sydney, who grapples with her identity after witnessing her white family members drown themselves. Sydney's transformation from denying her Blackness—referring to Black people as \"them\"—to embracing her identity and using \"us\" is compellingly depicted. A particularly poignant moment occurs when Sydney recalls being mistaken for one of the less fortunate at a church event, underscoring her internalized self-perception.",

Although some logistical questions, such as water contamination and currency, emerge, the narrative primarily emphasizes the emotional and societal implications of this premise.",

This aspect is highly compelling and makes the novel stand out.  \n\n- **World-Building and Logical Consistency:**  \n  The world-building falls short in terms of details and logical consistency. There are many unanswered questions about the semantics of who died when the white people went into the water and who survived.

            "The portrayal of Sydney's internalized racism, shaped by her upbringing in a white household, felt overly simplistic and lacked depth. She seemed aware of her issues but failed to show any character development throughout the story. Her dismissive attitude suggested a lack of concern, as if she were merely stating, “Yes, I’m racist against my own people, but I’m an angry teenager, so it doesn’t matter.” The introduction of an Asian character appeared superficial and insufficiently developed. Sydney's remark about the presence of white people in the Asian character’s absence came off as shallow and did not contribute to a meaningful conversation about race.",

The depiction of Orange Beach felt overly simplistic, suggesting that everyone aspired to be white and return to a bygone era. This approach missed the chance to engage with more complex issues, such as the triangulation of Asian Americans, the model minority myth, and the interplay between white supremacy and anti-Blackness.",

It diverges from typical dystopian fiction by focusing on the legacy of racial trauma rather than mere survival in an apocalypse.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending fell flat for me, which is why I deducted half a star from my rating. While the thematic focus on racial trauma was powerful, the execution of the conclusion didn’t resonate as strongly as the rest of the book.  \n\n- **Reader Reception and Reflection:**  \n  I’m disheartened that some white readers felt personally attacked by the book’s approach. As a white woman, I believe we *should* feel ashamed of our ancestors’ history and confront the uncomfortable truths about racial trauma. The book challenges us to consider what a reckoning or rebalancing of the scales might look like for those left behind.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is absolutely gorgeous, with numerous quotable passages. One standout example is the reflection on what it means to be Black: “What a strange fruit we are to have never ripened. Hung, dangled, sweetened, eaten, but never just filled up with the miracle of ourselves.”  \n\n- **Opportunity to Read:**  \n  I’m grateful to the author and NetGalley for providing me with the chance to read this book in exchange for an honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a thought-provoking and beautifully written speculative fiction novel that tackles the legacy of racial trauma with depth and nuance. While the ending didn’t fully satisfy me, the book’s themes and prose left a lasting impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 out of 5 stars."

The fate of white inmates in jail is also left unexplained, and the lack of action from Black prison guards is perplexing. Furthermore, the depiction of Black survivors as a harmonious community feels unrealistic, disregarding how people typically behave in the aftermath of disasters.

The portrayal of Black survivors as a harmonious, cooperative community feels like a stretch, ignoring real-world examples of human behavior following natural disasters or during chaotic events.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The story started off intriguing but became inconsistent and seemed to veer off track. For example, the storyline about the pilot needing to steal gas to avoid the dangers of the south and keep flying was introduced but then completely disappeared. Additionally, the portrayal of the south as a dangerous \"black hole\" didn’t make sense and didn’t contribute meaningfully to the plot. These inconsistencies and plot holes, especially in parts I found interesting, diminished my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Characterization and Perspective:**  \n  The use of multiple narrators for different points of view was a fun concept. However, the narrators (Leon Nixon, Erin Ruth Walker, and Janina Edwards) weren’t particularly skilled at switching their voices to differentiate characters, which affected the overall experience.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  Despite the issues, I’m curious to read more books from this author. As one reviewer pointed out, this book might resonate with someone like me—a white person who checks off various boxes. It feels like the inconsistencies could be attributed to this being a debut novel, and I’m hopeful the author will grow and refine their storytelling in future works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing start, its inconsistent plot development and unresolved storylines left me feeling less satisfied. The audiobook narration, though innovative in its use of multiple narrators, fell short in execution. However, I remain interested in the author’s potential and look forward to exploring their future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Audiobook narrators: 2.8 stars"

The story revolves around themes of black identity and history, which are central to the narrative.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel depicts a world where countless white people walk into the water and drown, while black people rise to uncover their identity and the history that shapes them. The two main characters, Charles Brunton and his daughter Sidney (whose white mother and family drowned), have a complicated relationship marked by deep suffering. Their journey from Wisconsin to the Kingdom of Alabama is arresting and thought-provoking. Both characters are trapped in different forms of darkness but ultimately emerge by confronting hard truths and embracing the importance of freeing black consciousness.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Charles and Sidney’s growth is central to the story. They navigate their pain and trauma, ultimately finding strength in their shared history and identity. Herald, the King of Alabama, articulates a powerful message about the collective consciousness and power of African heritage, which was systematically destroyed.\n\n- **Writing Quality and Focus:**  \n  While I found the novel compelling and will seek out Campbell’s other works, I felt the quality and focus were uneven at times.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a powerful exploration of black identity, history, and consciousness, though it may not resonate equally with all readers. Despite some unevenness in quality and focus, it left a lasting impression on me, and I look forward to reading more of Campbell’s work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The answers to the unfolding mysteries came late in the story, creating a sense of delay. While the ending was a bit dramatic for my taste, I appreciated how Sidney's character arc concluded, providing a satisfying resolution.",

Their evolving relationship and shared experiences as they navigate this new chapter together form the heart of the narrative.",

Despite its attempts at inclusivity, the book ultimately conveys a narrow-minded perspective that contradicts its intended message.",

The narrative seems to center solely on the USA, neglecting global issues like immigration and overpopulation in countries such as China and India. Additionally, the book overlooks other minority groups, including Asians, Native populations, and Latinos, creating an impression of exclusion that primarily highlights only black individuals. This narrow perspective undermines the story’s potential for a more inclusive dialogue.",

The necessary suspension of disbelief for a sci-fi novel fell flat, as the societal changes and world-building felt unrealistic and unconvincing.

I found it intriguing that some white readers on Goodreads felt uncomfortable with this premise, while others noted that discomfort is intentional. However, the focus of the story isn't on white people—they literally don't exist. Instead, it centers on black individuals and their potential in a world devoid of white influence. The apocalyptic theme is captivating; while some characters view the event as the end of the world, for many, it represents a new beginning. A pivotal moment for me was when Charlie drove through Wisconsin. Initially, I worried about the dangers of sundown towns for a black man, but then I realized that the threat had been neutralized."

The premise of this book is inherently fascinating, though it might be hard to stomach for some. One day, every white person walks into a body of water and drowns themselves, leaving the people of color to rebuild the world into whatever they want it to be.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  I found myself drawn to each character, particularly Charles, who has been in prison for 20 years, and his teenage daughter, Sidney. The book switches perspectives, which gives it a well-rounded tone and deepens the connection to the characters. I could have read so much more about them and was actually sad when the story ended.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book is incredibly powerful and moving. The emotional depth of the characters and the weight of the premise left a lasting impression on me.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Future Potential:**  \n  The author’s ability to craft such a compelling narrative makes me excited to see what else they will write in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant piece of speculative fiction.

It reflects a deep disdain and resentment towards white people, which I believe stems from the author's personal hatred. Instead of addressing this hatred, the author sought validation from a like-minded community, which ultimately led to the creation of this book.  \n- **Moral and Ethical Implications:**  \n  The book promotes a harmful and divisive ideology that judges individuals based on their race rather than their character or actions. It perpetuates the idea of condemning people for the mistakes of their ancestors, which I strongly disagree with. I believe we should focus on what individuals contribute to the world rather than their racial background.  \n- **Impact on Society:**  \n  I am deeply disturbed by the book's popularity and the number of 5-star ratings it has received. This, to me, reflects a troubling trend in society where such divisive and hateful ideas are celebrated rather than condemned. It highlights a broader societal issue where people fail to recognize the harm caused by such ideologies.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a deeply troubling work that promotes hatred and division based on race.

The sci-fi elements felt forced, the father-daughter relationship was neglected, and the ending left me confused and unsatisfied. However, the imaginative world-building and the journey of the characters made the read worthwhile overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Sidney's character struck me as inconsistent and unrealistic. As a 19-year-old mixed-race individual in modern-day Wisconsin, she came across as overly naive.

Additionally, it strains credulity that Sydney knows where to find Charles and has his phone number, especially since her mother, who is now gone, never shared this information and there is no internet access.

Not everything is for everybody, and that’s okay.  \n\n- **World-Building and Speculative Fiction:**  \n  I’m a reader who often wants the buildup. With good speculative fiction, which I think this is, I can be dropped into a world, told how things are, and believe them on their face. In this world, white people have met their demise, and life continues.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story, a father crossing the country for his daughter, is a vehicle for a more meaningful message. It includes a sprinkling of science and a question of circles, but mostly it serves as a sociological thought experiment: what would happen in such a world?  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book was compelling from the start.

This is evident from the very first sentence, which sets a poetic and provocative tone.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  The narrative presents a bold and uncompromising premise: if all white people killed themselves, the immediate response of those left would be to break open all the prisons. There is no discussion, reneging, or conflict around this idea.  \n\n- **Engagement and Appeal:**  \n  If it weren’t for the book club I joined, I would have stopped reading after the first sentence and felt better for it. The book is not rooted in reality, which may not appeal to everyone. However, for those who enjoy unconventional and thought-provoking works, there are a few diamonds in the rough.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a poetic and provocative piece that challenges conventional storytelling. While its lack of grounding in reality may deter some readers, those who appreciate bold and unconventional narratives may find value in its unique perspective.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The book’s exploration of these themes was impactful and meaningful.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the disappointing ending, I am 100% recommending this book to anyone who will listen. The overall journey and the themes it addresses make it a worthwhile read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the ending fell short of expectations, the novel’s exploration of identity, societal restrictions, and the desire for freedom resonated deeply with me. The journey through the story was compelling enough to overlook the anti-climatic conclusion, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to others.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel presents an ambitious and contentious plot, especially surprising given its under-300-page length.

While it would be impossible to cover every possible scenario following the central event, I wished for more exploration of different parts of the U.S., including various communities and industries, to see how they operate in this new context.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Campbell's writing style is lyrical at times but can also feel overelaborate. The story and plot sometimes take a backseat to character deliberation, which shifts the focus away from the narrative drive.\n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n  The book effectively highlights the complexities of living in a suddenly \"post-racial\" country. It underscores the ongoing struggle with identity and the enduring desire for community and connection, which are central to the novel's themes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its ambitious plot and thought-provoking themes, the novel's brevity left me wanting more exploration of its world and characters.

            "The story prominently features the protagonist’s daughter, who grapples with internalized anti-Blackness. While her growth is a central theme, I found myself questioning whether her journey ultimately felt satisfying or justified the emotional investment as a reader. However, I appreciated the diverse perspectives and discussions that explored how Black individuals might navigate such a world.",
            "The discussions on Blackness in this book are profound and skillfully executed. The notion that Black individuals can pursue wholeness and critical self-reflection, rather than mere retribution, is particularly moving. The narrative is emotional, imaginative, and refreshing in its exploration of Black consciousness and experiences. It thoughtfully examines how white ideologies can persist even in a world devoid of white people. I was captivated by the premise, which asks: in a world without white people, what does it truly mean to be Black? However, the execution of this idea did not fully align with my expectations. While the book effectively explores Blackness through a historical lens and addresses themes of identity, self-actualization, and dreaming, I felt that whiteness remained a central focus, despite the absence of white characters. This left me feeling somewhat conflicted.",
