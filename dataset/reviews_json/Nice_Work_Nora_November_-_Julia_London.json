I related to her struggles with parental pressure and feeling like she hadn’t accomplished much.  \n   - Her growth after the near-death experience was inspiring—she made her own decisions, took risks, and stood strong.  \n\n- **Character Development (Jack):**  \n   - Jack felt more like a side character, but he was still charming.  \n   - The story focused more on Nora’s growth than their romance.  \n\n- **Overall Message:**  \n   - The book emphasizes choosing peace and authenticity over societal expectations.  \n   - It’s a heartwarming, uplifting story about self-discovery with a touch of romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a gem for anyone in the mood for soul-searching and inspiration.

            "The story features notable strengths, such as Nora's personal growth and her pursuit of new opportunities. However, some plot points remain unresolved or underdeveloped. The financial subplot is particularly confusing and lacks a satisfactory explanation.

While her father's abusive behavior is a crucial issue, the absence of consequences or acknowledgment for his actions is frustrating. Jack, the love interest, is an endearing character, but their romance feels underdeveloped. Their relationship is primarily conveyed through flashbacks and their fated meet-cute, with little real interaction until the end."

            "I appreciated the significant development of the female main character (FMC) throughout the book. Her near-death experience acted as a catalyst for her personal transformation, leading to profound growth. While there was initial chemistry between her and the male main character (MMC), I felt she wouldn't have found true happiness with anyone at that time, as she was still struggling with her own life. The story effectively highlights the importance of timing in relationships, suggesting that her eventual readiness for love made their connection all the more meaningful.",

Readers who are detail-oriented, especially about finances, may find themselves rolling their eyes at these elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is an engaging mix of light-hearted chic-lit and serious themes, with a protagonist who feels authentic and relatable. However, the unrealistic portrayal of Nora's financial situation undermines the plot's credibility. Despite this flaw, it remains an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While it can be challenging to read due to its heavy subject matter, Nora's journey is ultimately inspiring and worth experiencing. The audiobook could have been improved with the inclusion of trigger warnings.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5 stars rounded up."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Portrayal of Mental Illness:**  \n   - The book poignantly describes mental illness, particularly depression, in a way that feels authentic and relatable.  \n   - It avoids the common trope of \"solving\" mental illness through external factors like a partner or medication. Instead, it emphasizes the ongoing effort required to manage it.  \n   - Nora's struggles with depression and her journey to work through it made me feel seen, as someone who also has to work daily to maintain happiness or contentment.  \n\n- **Character Development (Nora November):**  \n   - Nora's near-death experience (NDE) gives her a new perspective on life, leading her to create a \"reverse bucket list\" of things she wants to accomplish.  \n   - She faces repeated failures in her attempts to complete her list, such as killing plants, nearly burning down a kitchen, and injuring herself while playing basketball.  \n   - Her journey is marked by resilience and growth, as she learns to surround herself with supportive people and let go of toxic relationships.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n   - The book delivers strong, impactful messages about forgiveness, self-improvement, and the importance of perseverance.  \n   - It highlights that while mental illness may explain certain behaviors, it doesn't excuse the hurt caused to others. This message resonated deeply with me.  \n   - Nora's fulfillment of her reverse bucket list in unique ways, despite her failures, underscores the value of effort and the journey itself.  \n\n- **Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n   - Nora's strained relationship with her sister is a central focus. Her sister doesn't immediately forgive her for past neglect during depressive episodes, which adds depth and realism to the story.  \n   - The narrative emphasizes the importance of surrounding oneself with good people and letting go of negative influences.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt and authentic exploration of mental illness, resilience, and personal growth. It avoids clichés and delivers powerful messages about forgiveness, perseverance, and the importance of supportive relationships. Nora's journey is both relatable and inspiring, making this a book that many readers, including myself, could deeply connect with.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It simplifies a complex mental illness into a lack of confidence and suggests unrealistic solutions, which undermines its potential.

            "The narrative feels disjointed, with numerous subplots—such as community theater, gardening, cooking classes, basketball goals, and rehab experiences—that distract from the main storyline. While Jack's perspective adds depth, it also contributes to the overall lack of focus. The story centers on Nora November, who, after a near-death experience, reevaluates her life and creates a reverse bucket list. Her goals include reviving her grandfather's garden, changing careers, improving relationships, and reconnecting with a man she met during a gas station hold-up. The book effectively explores themes of starting over, living authentically, and confronting regrets.",
            "Nora is a multifaceted character who evolves from a life marked by depression and inauthenticity to one of self-discovery and growth. Jack, the gas station attendant and hospice worker, offers an intriguing perspective, but his storyline lacks depth. Nora's relationships with her sister, cousin, and family are pivotal to her journey, yet some interactions come across as rushed or superficial.",
            "Nora's severe depression prior to her accident is a crucial aspect of her character, yet its resolution feels abrupt and insufficiently explored. The emotional weight of her guilt surrounding her grandfather's death and her near-death experience is compelling, but the narrative could have benefited from a deeper exploration of these themes.",

            "The pacing of the book is uneven, dedicating a considerable portion to Nora's struggles, while reserving just the final 10% for her successes. This leads to a rushed and less satisfying conclusion, particularly in the last chapter, which summarizes her achievements in the past tense. Additionally, the dual POV—mainly from Nora's perspective with occasional insights from Jack—could have been better balanced to enhance the narrative. The story follows Nora as she reinvents herself after a Near Death Experience (NDE) by creating a reverse bucket list to pursue her life goals. It opens with a poignant conversation between Nora and her deceased grandfather in heaven, establishing an emotional tone. Throughout her journey, Nora tends to her grandfather's plot in the community garden, rebuilds relationships with her sister and cousin, and reconnects with a man she met during a hostage situation.",
            "Nora and Jack, the corner-store owner, are relatable characters who elicit empathy from readers. Nora's resilience in the face of her depression is truly inspiring. The complexities of her family dynamics, especially her strained relationships with her sister and cousin, enrich her character development.",

While the pacing and dual POV could have been improved, the likable characters and emotional journey make it a rewarding read.

            "The opening of the story was challenging, concentrating on Nora's difficulties in re-entering life. However, at 26% into the book, a shift to Jack's perspective provided an unexpected depth. The reverse bucket list concept was intriguing, though some aspects—such as breaking plates, starting fires, and the basketball scene—felt overly dramatic.",
            "In this story, the protagonist Nora hails from a family so dysfunctional that they verge on caricature. Her wealthy parents' refusal to assist with her medical bills amplifies this dysfunction, leaving readers feeling both frustrated and incredulous.",
            "While the story presents a unique premise, some plot points come off as implausible. For instance, Nora's transformation into a magical baker seems contradictory to her struggles. Additionally, the corner store subplot, which involves a dramatic revelation about a past kiss and an agreed-upon date, feels more melodramatic than genuinely engaging, resembling a contrived \"what if\" scenario. The conclusion, including the senior thespian musical and various resolutions, leans towards being overly charming and unrealistic.",
            "This book is not a romance or chick lit; instead, it narrates a woman's mental health journey through a highly dysfunctional family. Combining drama with absurdity, it strikes a tone that feels like a blend of serious drama and a Hallmark movie. The exploration of fighting personal demons is compelling, particularly illustrated by Nora's poignant statement on page 308. While the themes of shifting perspectives and embracing imperfection are commendable, the execution occasionally veers into the extreme."

        "conclusion": "While the book offers a unique exploration of mental health and dysfunctional family dynamics, it often veers into absurdity and stretches believability. The reverse bucket list concept and character growth were compelling, but the overly dramatic and unrealistic elements detracted from the overall experience.

            "The romance between Jack and Nora was endearing yet ultimately underwhelming, feeling nearly non-existent and not significantly enhancing the story. The idea of a reverse bucket list—things Nora regretted not doing after her death—had great potential. However, her journey of self-discovery was fraught with challenges, marked by demoralizing and isolating experiences. While I appreciated the realism, it sometimes felt overwhelming.",
            "Nora, the protagonist, is a deeply flawed character grappling with depression and a near-death experience. Her father is cruel and self-important, while her mother is harshly judgmental. Nora's strained relationships with her sister Lacey and cousin Gus, who no longer trust her, add to her struggles, making portions of the story difficult to digest. Although her determination to rebuild her life is commendable, it occasionally falters amidst the volume of negative experiences she faces, making her seem somewhat like a caricature.",
            "The book frequently left me feeling upset due to its heavy themes and the relentless challenges faced by Nora. While this highlights the author’s skill, it also made the story emotionally taxing for me.",
            "The book was marketed as \"uplifting and hilarious,\" but I found it fell short of these expectations. Rather than being humorous or uplifting, it came across as a realistic depiction of a young lawyer grappling with depression and the harsh realities of her life."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The book was marketed as “uplifting and heartwarming” and “hilarious and heartwarming,” but it did not meet these expectations for me. I did not find it particularly hilarious or uplifting. Instead, it felt like a realistic portrayal of a young lawyer struggling with depression and the harsh realities of her life.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Nora, the protagonist, is a deeply flawed character dealing with depression and a near-death experience. Her father is depicted as cruel, controlling, and self-important, while her mother is harshly judgmental. Her sister Lacey and cousin Gus have their own struggles and no longer trust Nora, which, while understandable, was difficult to read. Nora’s determination to rebuild her life was admirable, though it wavered at times. However, the sheer number of negative experiences she endured made her feel like a caricature to me.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The concept of a reverse bucket list—a list of things Nora regretted not doing after she died—was a fabulous premise. However, her journey to self-discovery was bumpy, demoralizing, and isolating, filled with many negative experiences. While I appreciated the realism, it became overwhelming at times.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance between Jack and Nora was cute but underwhelming. It felt practically non-existent and did not add much to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book often left me feeling upset due to its heavy themes and the constant barrage of challenges Nora faced. While this speaks to the power of Julia London’s writing, it made the story emotionally taxing for me.  \n\n- **Content Warning:**  \n  The story mentions suicide, which may be triggering for some readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Nice Work Nora November* had a compelling premise and powerful writing, it did not align with the uplifting and hilarious tone I expected. The story’s heavy themes and relentless negativity made it a challenging read for me, despite moments of admiration for Nora’s resilience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.  \n\n***Thank you to NetGalley, Harper Muse, and Julia London.

            "Nora November undergoes a transformative near-death experience that compels her to redefine her life. She abandons her previous identity and crafts a reverse bucket list, setting ambitious goals like leaving her lucrative position at the family law firm, nurturing her grandfather's garden, and reconnecting with a man she met during an armed robbery at a local corner store.",
            "In tending to her grandfather's garden and attempting (though often failing) at cooking and basketball, Nora embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Through these experiences, she comes to recognize not only her own needs but also the ways she has neglected, and been neglected by, the significant people in her life.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed following Nora as she pursued her goals, stood up for herself, and embraced what made her happy. This charming story is a delightful read that I highly recommend. It's light and breezy, perfect for enjoying under a large umbrella with a refreshing drink—ideally accompanied by a gentle ocean breeze."

She is able to voice both characters so well, and I really did not want to stop listening to this one.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  Nora November has a near-death experience that changes everything. She no longer wants to be the person she was before and creates a \"reverse bucket list.\" Her goals include ditching her high-paying, high-profile job at the family law firm, tending to her grandfather's garden, and reconnecting with the man she met during an armed robbery at a local corner store.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  As Nora tends to her grandfather's garden and tries (and fails) at cooking and basketball, she learns more about herself and her needs. She also realizes she neglected, and was neglected by, some of the most important people in her life.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I loved listening to Nora accomplish her goals while standing up for herself and doing things that made her happy. This was a very sweet story. I definitely recommend it. It is easy-breezy for the most part and could definitely be devoured while under a large umbrella, sipping something with a little umbrella (maybe with a little ocean breeze too).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNice Work, Nora November is an entertaining and heartwarming story with excellent narration by Karissa Vacker. It’s a fun, easy listen that combines self-discovery, personal growth, and a touch of romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25 stars  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and HarpersCollin Focus for this advanced audio copy of Nice Work, Nora November in exchange for my honest review.

This includes both ordinary aspirations, like learning to cook and cleaning her late grandfather’s garden, and more personal goals, such as reconnecting with Jack, a man she met during a robbery. Jack, a nurse who cares for terminally ill patients, also reflects on his life after inheriting a plot of land from a patient. The parallel stories of Nora and Jack, as they hope to meet again while living their own lives, form the core of the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nora is portrayed as someone who has been held back by her pressure-filled career, driven by a desire to please her father. Her near-death experience prompts her to reevaluate her life and pursue her dreams. Jack, on the other hand, is a compassionate nurse who finds himself reflecting on his own life after inheriting the garden plot. Both characters are well-developed, with their regrets, aspirations, and emotional journeys taking center stage.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book explores themes of regret, self-discovery, and the pursuit of happiness. It also delves into heavier topics such as death, depression, and emotional abuse, which are handled with sensitivity. The tone is reflective and emotional, with moments of hope and introspection.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  The story is told in parallel narratives, alternating between Nora and Jack’s perspectives. This structure effectively builds anticipation as their paths seem destined to cross again. The writing is engaging, though the book differs from what I expected based on the blurb.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings:**  \n  The novel includes several trigger warnings, such as death, depression, and emotional abuse, which may be difficult for some readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers an intriguing concept with its \"reverse\" bucket list and parallel narratives of Nora and Jack.

            "The story unfolds through Nora's journey rather than after she has reached a better place, which I found less satisfying. I would have preferred more present-day scenes featuring Nora and Jack, rather than relying on their memories of the hostage situation. The narrative follows Nora as she embarks on fulfilling her reverse bucket list after a near-death experience, with a significant focus on her desire to reconnect with Jack, whom she met during a robbery.",

Clinically depressed and burdened by unaddressed trauma, she faces barriers to therapy, mainly due to its cost. The portrayal of her family, particularly her parents, is deeply unflattering, and few characters are genuinely likable—Nora included. Yet, despite her flaws, she is striving to improve her situation.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Theme:**  \n   - The idea of a second chance was intriguing, as not everyone gets such an opportunity.  \n   - The story's tone was inconsistent with the bright and optimistic cover description, often feeling too depressing.  \n\n- **Character Development (Nora):**  \n   - Nora's bold actions seemed reckless and naive due to the lack of background information about her life before the accident and her interactions with her family.  \n   - Her attitude, especially her outbursts towards her father, felt painfully juvenile and inconsistent with her portrayal as a grown woman and a powerful attorney.  \n\n- **Character Development (Supporting Characters):**  \n   - Nora’s relatives were portrayed as caricatures of rich people, making their behavior too predictable and unrealistic.  \n   - The grandfather’s community and their theatrics were a highlight, and focusing more on them could have improved the book.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The ending was realistic, but the journey to get there felt tedious.  \n   - The plot could have been more engaging if it had centered around the grandfather’s community rather than Nora’s family dynamics.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The book evoked mixed feelings, with some elements being enjoyable (e.g., the grandfather’s community) and others detracting from the experience (e.g., Nora’s character and her family dynamics).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept of a second chance was compelling, the execution fell short due to inconsistent character development, predictable family dynamics, and a tedious plot. The grandfather’s community stood out as a bright spot, but the overall tone and focus of the story left much to be desired.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Nora November is a richly complex character grappling with depression and feelings of inadequacy.

This includes leaving her soul-draining job as an attorney, reconnecting with her sister, meeting a mysterious man she connected with during a store robbery, and cultivating her late grandfather's garden. The premise is engaging, and the journey of self-discovery is compelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nora is a memorable and relatable protagonist. Her struggles with admitting she is unhappy and her determination to change her life make her journey inspiring. Jack, the mysterious man she meets, also has a well-developed arc as he strives to become something more. However, the dual perspectives (Nora and Jack) felt slightly unbalanced, and the story might have been stronger if it focused solely on Nora.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing is delightful and keeps the reader engaged. The pacing allows for a thorough exploration of Nora's journey, though the inclusion of Jack's perspective occasionally detracts from the main narrative.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The novel effectively conveys the emotional weight of Nora's transformation. Her struggles and triumphs resonate deeply, making her journey both heartwarming and inspiring.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Nice Work, Nora November\" is a good read with a unique premise and memorable characters. While the dual perspectives slightly dilute the focus on Nora, her journey of self-discovery is compelling and emotionally impactful.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

I appreciated how the story highlighted the difficulty and stress of making significant life changes, especially when mental health challenges are involved. It didn’t sugarcoat the process, which made Nora’s struggles and growth feel real and impactful.  \n\n- **Themes and Message:**  \n  The book’s focus on prioritizing joy and standing up for oneself was inspiring. I loved that the ending was happy, even though not all of Nora’s problems were magically solved. The story emphasized that happiness isn’t about solving every issue but about finding and defending what brings you joy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a timely and meaningful read for me. Nora’s journey of self-discovery and resilience resonated deeply, and the story’s honest portrayal of change and mental health challenges felt authentic. The uplifting yet realistic ending left me feeling inspired and reflective.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her lack of urgency in securing a stable job, such as a temp position, makes her seem disconnected from genuine financial concerns. Additionally, the protagonist's parents, especially her father, are poorly developed; he comes across as a one-dimensional villain, and the revelation of his racism on page 282 feels forced and adds little to the narrative.",

This would have provided a better understanding of her relationships with the supporting cast and herself.\n\n- **Handling of Mental Health Themes:**  \n  The book tackles serious mental health issues, but I didn’t like the way the author, London, handled them. The treatment felt superficial, as if she included these themes out of obligation rather than depth. A more realistic portrayal could have been achieved by showing Nora’s past struggles rather than just referencing them.\n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Performance:**  \n  The narration was pretty good. I like Karissa Vacker a lot, and her performance added to the experience of the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I initially enjoyed the book and appreciated Nora’s journey of reinvention, the superficial handling of mental health themes and the lack of deeper exploration into Nora’s past and relationships left me wanting more.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Nora, who decides to change her life after a near-death accident. Unlike typical NDE (near-death experience) books that focus on a person changing their perspective on life, this novel delves deeper into Nora grappling with depression and dealing with a seriously dysfunctional family.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nora is a compelling protagonist, and I found myself rooting for her throughout the story. Her journey is both emotional and relatable, especially as she navigates her struggles with mental health and family dynamics.  \n\n- **Tone and Emotional Impact:**  \n  While there are sweet and uplifting moments, the book is not a light-hearted read. It tackles heavy themes like depression and family trauma, which adds depth and emotional weight to the narrative.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed the audiobook version of the novel. The narration complemented the story well, enhancing the overall experience.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I received early access to this book through NetGalley and HarperCollins in exchange for an honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNice Work, Nora November is a poignant and emotionally resonant story that explores themes of depression, family dysfunction, and personal growth. While it’s not a light-hearted read, Nora’s journey is compelling and relatable, with moments of sweetness that balance the heavier themes. The audiobook version is highly recommended for its engaging narration.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The obstacles Nora faces in her quest to change her life after a near-death experience, as well as the portrayal of her parents, were too intense. While I understood the author’s intent, I didn’t enjoy the execution.  \n\n- **Narration:**  \n  Karissa Vacker’s narration was a strong point. Her tone perfectly captured Nora’s anxiety, adding depth to the character and enhancing the listening experience.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book tackles heavy and important topics, including alcoholism, emotional abuse, and mental illness. These themes were handled with seriousness, though the overall tone of the story felt overwhelming to me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel addresses significant and impactful themes, the execution felt overly dramatic and intense, which detracted from my enjoyment. The narration, however, was a standout element that brought Nora’s character to life.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3⭐️"

Nora does everything she can to stop living for her parents (I hated them both) and to start living for herself with this second chance at life. There are a few heavy topics, but it is mostly a light story. However, make sure to read the trigger warnings before diving in.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nora's journey of self-discovery and her determination to live for herself rather than her parents was compelling. Her parents, on the other hand, were characters I strongly disliked, which added to the emotional weight of her decisions.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook is narrated by Karissa Vacker, who did an amazing job expressing Nora's emotions throughout the story. I really enjoyed her performance and will be listening to more audiobooks narrated by her.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I found the story engaging and emotionally resonant. It was a mix of light-hearted moments and deeper, thought-provoking themes, making it a well-rounded read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a heartfelt and inspiring story about second chances and self-discovery. While it touches on some heavy topics, it remains mostly light and uplifting. The audiobook narration by Karissa Vacker enhances the experience, making it a highly enjoyable listen.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this compelling story, protagonist Nora November experiences a profound transformation following a near-death encounter. Determined to restart her life, she crafts a reverse bucket list that sparks both personal growth and tension with her family. The dynamics between Nora and a group of seniors striving to save their theater, along with her quest to find Jack—the stranger she met during a hostage situation—infuse the narrative with depth and humor.",

It skillfully blends therapy, romance, and an appreciation for the elderly, striking a balance between serious and lighthearted moments. Nora's struggle to meet her parents' expectations and her journey toward self-acceptance, especially concerning her depression, resonate deeply and are highly relatable.",
            "The story resonated with me, especially the poignant line from one of the seniors: “When anyone says they want to die, what they really mean is they want to live, but they don’t know how.” The book's exploration of missed connections and self-discovery is both heartwarming and thought-provoking."
