Nevertheless, the reveals are skillfully handled and clever, even if they lack traditional twists.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  I love quirky murder mysteries, so this book caught my eye and made it onto my anticipated reads list. The story starts with Molly waking up after a night out for a company party. She is extremely hungover, can‚Äôt remember the night before, but finds a cute man in her bed. The premise intrigued me, especially as Molly discovers her best friend and roommate, Posey, has died. While the police believe Posey‚Äôs death was an accident, Molly has her suspicions and starts piecing together what happened the night before and the clues Posey left behind.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Molly is a compelling protagonist. Throughout the story, she realizes there were things she didn‚Äôt know about her best friend and is confronted by her own trauma. This added depth to her character and made her journey more engaging.  \n\n- **Cultural Observations:**  \n  As an American, I found it odd that the ‚Äúnight out‚Äù was in the middle of the week and everyone was expected to be at work the next day. This cultural difference stood out to me, though it didn‚Äôt detract from the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Entertainment Value:**  \n  The book was a fun read that kept me entertained until the end. The mystery unfolded at a good pace, and I was invested in uncovering the truth alongside Molly.  \n\n- **Critique:**  \n  My only critique is that it felt a little too convenient how some characters knew each other. This minor flaw didn‚Äôt overshadow my overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis quirky murder mystery was an engaging and entertaining read. Molly‚Äôs journey to uncover the truth about her best friend‚Äôs death, while confronting her own trauma, added depth to the story. Despite a minor convenience in the plot, the book kept me hooked until the very end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5 stars  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and HQ for providing an eARC in exchange for an honest review."

She proved that you don‚Äôt need years of experience if you‚Äôre passionate about something.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I woke up every day wanting to read this book. I read before bed and went to sleep thinking I wanted to read just a little more. I was so engrossed that I could have finished it in one day, but I tried to savor it because I knew finishing it would physically hurt‚Äîand it did.  \n\n- **Desire for a Sequel:**  \n  I really hope a sequel is in the works, even though the book just came out this year. I need to know what happens after Molly discovers what she did at the end (no spoilers for first-time readers!).  \n\n- **Appreciation for the Author:**  \n  Katy Brent, please write more! Write whatever you have in your mind, and I‚Äôll be there to read it all proudly.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Recommendation:**  \n  This book is going on my shelf, and I hope it will soon have some company.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations in every way. Katy Brent‚Äôs passion and skill as a debut author shone through, creating a story that was utterly captivating and left me craving more. I highly recommend it and eagerly await future works from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

In that first story, the main character, someone you were meant to dislike, ended up being lovable due to her sass, humor, and intelligence.

It delivered a fantastic reading experience that met my expectations while introducing fresh elements. The comedic murder mystery tone from the first novel remained intact, and the writing was brilliant, filled with sharp wit and humor.

            "I look forward to a potential Book 2 that follows Robyn and Molly's adventures in Hydra, especially with \"Jack\" visiting and the possibility of a respectful romance after Posey. The characters made a lasting impression and show promise for further development. I found it unsettling at first to think the guy could genuinely care for the drunk girl, as this is often not the reality in our society. My initial assumption was that he might be a murderer, highlighting the distrust prevalent today. I'm relieved he turned out to be decent, and this twist added depth to the story.",

It kept me very engaged, and I found myself flipping pages like crazy.  \n\n- **Character Development (FMC Molly):**  \n  Molly, the female main character, was a bit exasperating at times. She starts off as a serious drunken mess, which was frustrating.

            "The story follows Molly Monroe, an ordinary woman in her early 30s working at a tween girl magazine, who unwittingly goes viral for all the wrong reasons after her staff Christmas party. As the narrative unfolds, it shifts from a light-hearted tone to a more serious atmosphere, which I found enjoyable.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Narrative Style:**  \n  The novel is quick-paced and easy to follow, making it a breeze to read and enjoy. The narrative style is light and engaging, which keeps the story from feeling too heavy despite its dark themes.  \n\n- **Character Development (MFC Molly Monroe):**  \n  Molly Monroe (not Munro) is a hot mess but remains likable and relatable, even if her actions sometimes evoke a sense of guilt.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity and Twists:**  \n  The storyline offers multiple possible directions and includes many moving parts, which kept me guessing until the very end. The unexpected twist in the penultimate chapter was particularly shocking and elevated my enjoyment of the book. The line, \"It was him,\" was a standout moment that left me eager to devour the final chapter.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  While the plot explores dark themes, the author, Katy Brent, manages to maintain a light tone throughout, preventing the story from becoming overly heavy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a fun, fast-paced mystery that draws you in early and keeps you engaged with its twists and turns. The unexpected twist near the end significantly improved my overall impression of the book, making it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nInitially rated 3, but the twist increased my rating to 4."

I found myself questioning whether Jesse was genuinely taunting Molly or if it was merely a careless mistake. While I enjoyed the overall story, the mystery element felt lacking. The revelation of Jack and Josh was almost spoiled when Jesse casually mentioned \"Josh,\" making the connection to Jack too obvious, especially given Jack's previous deceit toward Molly. Although the ending was creative, I was left puzzled by the reveal and uncertain about how Molly managed to bring alcohol through customs.",

Posey was an intriguing character, revealing that she was not who Molly believed her to be. However, I found it challenging to reconcile the ages of the older characters. For instance, Marilyn and Patrick were said to be the same age, yet their children had about a 12-year age difference, which seemed inconsistent. Additionally, Molly noted that Marilyn looked much younger than her own mother, adding to the confusion. The age gap between Molly and Marilyn‚Äôs daughter appeared closer to 17 years, mirroring Patrick‚Äôs kids and further complicating the timeline.",

This novel is quite different from her debut, which I also adored, but it retains a similar quality that makes her work stand out.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Engagement:**  \n   - The story evoked strong emotions in me‚Äîanger, annoyance, and confusion‚Äîbut never because the story was bad. It was incredibly well-written and engaging.  \n\n- **Social Commentary and Themes:**  \n   - The book effectively highlights societal double standards, particularly how women are unfairly judged and crucified for engaging in sexual acts, while men often escape scrutiny. The author uses scenes and \"Twitter replies\" to showcase this issue.  \n   - It also touches on the devastating consequences of having private content leaked online, such as losing one's job, reputation, and future opportunities.  \n   - The theme of \"if I cannot have you, no one else can\" is explored, reflecting how this mindset often costs women their lives.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery Elements:**  \n   - The murder mystery kept me guessing. I had suspects in mind, and while I was correct about one, the other possibilities kept me on edge. The detail about multiple people having keys to the flat added to the suspense.  \n\n- **Criticism and Defense of the Book:**  \n   - Some might argue that the book relies on stereotypes or is poorly written, but I believe it effectively reinforces the reality of why women must remain cautious and distrustful of men in certain situations.  \n\n- **Aesthetic Appeal:**  \n   - The book covers are absolutely adorable and add to the overall appeal of the novel.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Work:**  \n   - I am eagerly looking forward to Katy Brent‚Äôs next book. Given how good her first two books are, I‚Äôm confident it will be another hit.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKaty Brent‚Äôs latest novel is a powerful, emotionally charged story that tackles important societal issues while delivering a gripping mystery. Despite its differences from her debut, it maintains the same high quality and leaves a lasting impact. The book‚Äôs themes, suspenseful plot, and stunning covers make it a standout read, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what she writes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There are similarities and differences between the two books. Both feature strong, likable female lead characters and are heavily focused on feminism, with the protagonists suffering at the hands of men but ultimately getting their revenge by the end.  \n\n- **Plot and Genre:**  \n  This book follows more of an amateur investigation, a \"whodunit,\" with significantly less murder compared to the first book. I must admit, I was a little disappointed by the reduced focus on murder. While I enjoyed the mystery aspect, it lacked the thriller edge I felt with the first book. For example, Kitty Collins from *How to Kill Men* worked in a meat-grinding factory, whereas Molly Monroe in this book works for a young girls' unicorn and alpaca magazine.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Format:**  \n  The book is written in an unusual format, similar to the first book, with a heavy social media influence throughout. I found this approach engaging and unique.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you enjoy lighthearted murder mysteries, I recommend adding this one to your to-be-read list.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book, though it didn't quite match the thrill and intensity of the author's previous work. It offers a fun, lighthearted mystery with a strong feminist theme and a unique writing style.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Cover Design and Initial Appeal**  \n   - The cover is stunning and immediately drew me in. It was the primary reason I purchased the book.  \n   - I was already a fan of Katy Brent's previous work, *How To Kill Men and Get Away With It*, so seeing her new book with such an eye-catching cover made it an instant buy.\n\n- **Social Commentary and Relevance**  \n   - The book does an excellent job of portraying how women are treated in society, particularly online. The viral video incident and the subsequent slut-shaming and victim-blaming Molly endures are painfully realistic.  \n   - The internet's reaction to Molly's situation, including the conspiracy theories after Posey's death, mirrors real-life online behavior, making the story deeply relevant.  \n   - Molly and Posey are not portrayed as \"perfect victims,\" which is refreshing and important. Women shouldn‚Äôt have to be flawless to deserve empathy and justice.\n\n- **Character Development**  \n   - Molly is a flawed, relatable protagonist. Her struggles with grief, career dissatisfaction, and unhealthy coping mechanisms make her feel like a real, three-dimensional person.  \n   - Posey, though not perfect, is also a well-rounded character. Her romantic missteps don‚Äôt diminish her right to justice, which is a powerful message.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing**  \n   - The story is gripping and kept me hooked from start to finish. The mystery surrounding Posey's death and Lulu's disappearance was compelling.  \n   - However, Molly's chaotic investigation was frustrating at times. Her lack of strategy and poor decision-making, especially when dealing with potential suspects, felt unrealistic and reckless.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Men and Villainy**  \n   - Most male characters in the book are depicted as one-dimensional villains, which felt overdone. Patrick, Jesse, and Oliver are all portrayed as awful in their own ways, with little nuance.  \n   - The only \"good guy,\" Jack/Josh, also has secrets, but the reveal of the murderer was predictable. I wished for a more surprising twist, like having the \"good guy\" turn out to be the killer, which would have added depth and realism.\n\n- **Handling of Dark Themes**  \n   - The book tackles heavy topics like sexual assault, cyberbullying, grief, and gaslighting with sensitivity and respect.  \n   - The ending was both heartbreaking and chilling, leaving a lasting impact.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some flaws, such as the predictable villain and Molly's chaotic investigation, the book is a compelling read. Katy Brent‚Äôs ability to address dark themes with care and her creation of relatable, flawed characters make this story memorable. The social commentary on how women are treated, both in society and online, is particularly striking and relevant.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific numerical rating was provided in the review, but the overall tone suggests a positive yet critical evaluation.)"

However, the plot‚Äôs complexity stretched believability, and some character dynamics, particularly with Posey, were frustrating. Despite a somewhat confusing ending and uneven payoff for the twists, the story remained entertaining throughout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story opens with a captivating premise: public shaming on social media, prompting a thought-provoking question about society's fascination with public scorn. The plot is engaging and unexpectedly deviates from what the cover suggests, steering clear of the pitfalls of a typical romantic novel.",

The language is very simple, making it easy to read in English in just two days. It has the qualities of a \"lectura de aeropuerto\" (airport read) in the best sense, with varied themes that spark interesting debates.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around a compelling issue at the beginning‚Äîpublic shaming on social media‚Äîwhich makes the reader question why society enjoys public scorn so much. The plot is engaging and offers something different from what the cover might suggest, avoiding the trap of being a silly romantic novel.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The book was a total surprise for me. I was looking for a light read but didn‚Äôt expect something so captivating. The cover initially made me think it would be a cheesy romantic novel, but the story turned out to be quite different.  \n\n- **Humor as a Selling Point:**  \n  One negative point is that the book seems to overemphasize humor as a selling feature. In my opinion, humor isn‚Äôt a standout characteristic of this book, and this focus might mislead potential readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book is an entertaining and thought-provoking read with a mix of humor and darker moments.

Although the plot picks up after Chapter 10, it remains cluttered and poorly structured.

The ending of Chapter 19 was both surprising and unsatisfying, failing to redeem the story's earlier shortcomings. Overall, the resolution felt underwhelming.",

It only served to make the real killer jealous of Patrick, the neighbor, and resulted in unnecessary deaths (the teen‚Äôs mom and adoptive dad).  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Molly, the FMC, knew almost nothing about her supposed best friend and roommate, Posey, which felt unrealistic and underdeveloped.  \n   - The neighbor‚Äôs wife, Trudy, seemed like the more logical killer due to her husband‚Äôs affair with Posey and the insulin references, but this plotline was ultimately irrelevant and didn‚Äôt tie into the actual murder.  \n\n- **Resolution and Ending:**  \n   - The true killer was revealed in the final moments, but nothing was done about it, leaving the resolution unsatisfying.  \n   - The twist involving the teen girl being killed by her own mom felt jarring and out of place, adding to the overall confusion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book didn‚Äôt work for me. The narrative relied on problematic tropes, the plot was disjointed and forced, and the character relationships felt underdeveloped. The ending was unsatisfying, and many subplots seemed irrelevant or poorly executed.

            "The book's central premise, in which Molly goes viral for a compromising video, is quite implausible. Social media platforms typically remove explicit content swiftly, and since Molly's face isn't visible in the video, it's unlikely anyone would recognize her. Moreover, as an average person rather than a celebrity, it seems unrealistic that the video would attract significant attention or provoke public disdain.",

Her actions often lack logic, making it challenging to connect with or support her. For instance, after discovering her friend dead in the bathtub, Molly suspects murder yet chooses not to inform anyone, including her friend's mother or other friends. Instead, she isolates herself and engages only with a stranger who followed her home while she was intoxicated. This irrational behavior undermines the story's credibility and makes it difficult to engage with the narrative.",

However, the narrator and heroine, Molly, is portrayed as an utter idiot. Almost none of her actions make sense, which made it difficult to connect with or root for her.  \n\n- **Plot Plausibility:**  \n   - The central premise of the book‚ÄîMolly going viral for a compromising video‚Äîis highly implausible. Social media platforms would quickly remove such explicit content, and Molly‚Äôs face wouldn‚Äôt be visible in the video, making it unlikely for strangers to recognize her. Additionally, since Molly isn‚Äôt a celebrity, it‚Äôs unrealistic that the video would gain widespread attention or that people would care enough to hate her for it.  \n\n- **Character Decisions and Logic:**  \n   - Molly‚Äôs decisions throughout the story are frustratingly illogical. For example, after finding her friend dead in the bathtub, she concludes it was murder but doesn‚Äôt discuss this with anyone‚Äînot even her friend‚Äôs mother or other friends. Instead, she isolates herself and only communicates with a stranger who followed her home the night she was drunk, despite knowing nothing about him. This level of irrational behavior made the story hard to take seriously.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Engagement:**  \n   - The book was an unpleasant and disappointing read. Molly‚Äôs constant poor decisions and the unrealistic plot made it feel like a waste of time. The story failed to engage me emotionally or intellectually, leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a significant letdown.

Additionally, Patrick's capacity to manipulate the media as a wealthy and influential lawyer feels exaggerated and lacks explanation.

Additionally, the revelation that Molly's father is imprisoned for killing her mother's harasser seems arbitrary.
