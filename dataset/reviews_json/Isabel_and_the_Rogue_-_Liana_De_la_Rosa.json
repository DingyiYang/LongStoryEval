            "The story takes on a spies-and-intrigue vibe, centering on the quest for French communications to support Mexico. However, the pacing drags at times, particularly during the lengthy waits for letters that can take weeks to arrive. Incorporating more romantic moments could have enhanced the narrative, increased tension, and quickened the pace.",
            "The romance in the story felt like only 25% of the plot, and I would have appreciated an epilogue featuring more joyful romantic moments. While the romance gained momentum around the 50% mark, the first half could have benefited from more chemistry to sustain the tension throughout. The ending was sweet and satisfying, especially given the earlier conflict between Isabel and Sirius. The spicy scenes were hotter than in *Ana Mar√≠a and the Fox*, but the overall tension could have been enhanced with additional romantic moments to balance the slower spy narrative. I wished to see Isabel gain more confidence by the end; it was frustrating that she still doubted Sirius's attraction to her, despite his clear efforts to prove it. Additionally, Lady Needham's racist behavior was never adequately addressed, and I felt Sirius could have done more to confront her. On a positive note, I loved Isabel‚Äôs evolving relationship with her sisters and am excited for Gabby‚Äôs book, eager to see her confidence and personality shine.",

            "The novel's portrayal of spy games is laughably poor, with both Isabel and Sirius depicted as inept spies. The intelligence plot relies on absurd and convoluted scenarios, such as Isabel serendipitously discovering critical information from a dropped letter during a carriage ride. The logic of the mission is flawed; Isabel's focus appears to be on uncovering a single piece of information rather than gathering comprehensive intelligence to end the war. Additionally, the book's time scale is jarring, featuring an unnecessary two-year jump that fails to significantly influence either the characters or the plot. This inconsistency is compounded by week- or month-long time skips that hinder credible character development and plot progression.",
            "Isabel Luna Vald√©s presents an intriguing premise, but her portrayal lacks finesse, coming across as clumsy and blunt. Similarly, Sirius Dawson's character arc‚Äîcentered on struggles with self-worth and love‚Äîfits the mold of clich√© hero narratives. The resolution of his arc feels rushed and unconvincing, as a single conversation with friends seemingly fixes his deep-rooted issues."

While espionage elements are present, the third act shifts focus to a breakup and a happily-ever-after resolution, resulting in a lack of action. Although the pacing can be slow at times, it effectively allows for the natural development of Isabel‚Äôs character.",
            "Isabel Luna has always felt invisible, overshadowed by her charming and beautiful sisters. This sense of invisibility becomes an asset as she spies for Mexico during the war with France. Unlike typical historical romance heroines, Isabel is quiet, nervous, and insecure, struggling with low self-esteem, largely due to her father's harshness. Her growth is gradual, and she only begins to recognize her self-worth two-thirds of the way through the book. While her younger sister Gabriela and Sirius often defend her, this support can feel repetitive.\n\nIsabel truly comes alive when discussing the repatriation of cultural artifacts, revealing her passion and confidence. However, the romance between Isabel and Sirius feels incomplete without the context of the first book, where their relationship began. Sirius, a military captain and spy grappling with survivor's guilt, adopts a rakish persona to gather intelligence. Their relationship features intimate moments, including a steamy scene beneath a desk at a ball, complemented by hot, swoon-worthy dialogue. A balloon scene reminiscent of *Bridgerton* adds a delightful twist with a more satisfying outcome.",

The presence of a Latin heroine and authentic historical figures enriches the narrative with representation. A particularly notable moment is a discussion on the repatriation of cultural artifacts, which the author enhances with informative endnotes.",

I adore a good secret romance, and these two excelled in that aspect. \n\nSeeing myself in Isabel was a profound experience; I felt her struggles with feeling unseen and unworthy. Then enters the blue-eyed blonde, who sees her in a way that makes her fidget under his gaze. Sirius's deep affection for Isabel resonated with me, and I found myself falling for both of them and their enchanting story.",

            "Review:  \nI no longer want to be the overlooked Luna sister; I‚Äôm ready for more. As Isabel's tough exterior gradually softens, the tension between her and Sirius begins to build. For a considerable portion of the story, the romance feels somewhat minimal due to their initial adversarial relationship. However, I appreciated how the author cleverly developed their connection through their collaboration to gather information for aid to Mexico. Their secretive encounters culminate in some delightful spicy scenes, particularly the *swoon*-worthy moment under the desk.",

While the romance takes a backseat at times, the collaboration between the characters and the spicy moments make it an enjoyable read. The story continues to captivate, leaving me eager for the next chapter.",

            "Sirius's jealousy over the viscount's interest in Isabel adds significant tension and depth to his character. The third-act breakup is resolved in a manner that feels both logical and earned, with Sirius respecting Isabel's desire to return to Mexico. The book thoughtfully weaves in political themes, exploring the colonial histories of Britain and France, which enriches the narrative. Set in the 1860s, the inclusion of condoms as a realistic detail is a refreshing departure from typical historical romances. Unconventionally, the ending sees Isabel departing England while Sirius chooses to move to Mexico to be with her, resulting in a meaningful and satisfying conclusion.",
            "I absolutely adore Isabel, the Latina (Mexican) female main character, who shares my passion for reading‚Äîa true book girlie. I appreciate the book‚Äôs diverse cast, especially in a genre often dominated by white, privileged characters. Isabel stands out as an independent and intelligent woman with meaningful goals, breaking the mold of typical regency romance heroines. \n\nSirius, the male lead, is a gentleman who respects Isabel as an individual rather than a possession. Although he‚Äôs an ex-rake, he does not objectify women. The banter between Isabel and Sirius is witty and engaging, and it's clear that Sirius falls for Isabel first, evidenced by his affectionate terms like \"sunshine\" and \"darling.\" Their first intimate moment is genuinely emotional and refreshingly free of fetishization. Additionally, Sirius‚Äôs poetry recitals during intimate moments add a romantic and lyrical depth to their relationship.",

            "The sisters consistently praise one another, yet their superficiality undermines the authenticity of their bond, as their lives and personalities remain underdeveloped. Their expressions of unworthiness come off as whiny rather than significant due to this lack of depth. The male lead is labeled a rogue, yet his actions throughout the story fail to align with this characterization, creating inconsistency and frustration. Additionally, Isabel's advocacy for British intervention in French colonization of Mexico overlooks Britain's own extensive colonial history in regions like Ireland, Egypt, India, and beyond. This selective outrage feels hypocritical and diminishes her credibility as a character.",

The blend of historical fiction and romance was stunning and well-researched, as noted in the author's note.  \n- **Series Anticipation:**  \n  I‚Äôm very curious to see how Gabby‚Äôs book will advance the plotline and where it will leave the Luna sisters by the end of the series. I‚Äôm rooting for everything‚Äîromantic, familial, and otherwise‚Äîto work out for them, and I can‚Äôt wait to read Gabby‚Äôs story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis second installment in the Luna Sisters series was even better than the first, with a compelling blend of historical fiction and romance. Isabel‚Äôs journey of self-love and her relationship with Sirius were highlights, and the continuation of the overarching plotline left me eagerly anticipating the next book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She starts off shy and insecure and ends up only slightly less shy but still just as insecure.

            "The first half of the book drags, lacking action and momentum. The romance between Isabel and Sirius doesn‚Äôt kick in until after the halfway point, making it feel both delayed and underdeveloped.",
            "In this story, Isabel Luna serves as a spy for the Mexican government, but her lack of training and direction makes her efforts feel more like snooping than true espionage. Much of her time is spent rummaging through desks at noblemen's homes during balls, which detracts from the narrative's tension. Additionally, the romance between Isabel and Sirius falls flat, lacking the necessary chemistry and emotional depth. A stronger buildup could have made their relationship more engaging and compelling.",
            "The novel is set during what appears to be the Second Franco-Mexican War, yet it offers only a fleeting mention of President Lincoln's assassination, which muddles the historical context. Aside from the French presence in Mexico, there are no substantial historical details or context provided. As a result, I would categorize this work more as a period piece than true historical fiction due to its lack of depth in historical representation."

        "conclusion": "While the novel has an interesting premise, it falls short in delivering a compelling historical backdrop, well-developed espionage, and a satisfying romantic arc. The pacing is slow, and the lack of historical context and character depth makes it feel more like a period piece than a historical romance. However, the potential for the story to improve with the other characters' narratives leaves me curious to explore further.",

Ugh.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  There was definite spice üî•, which added to the story.  \n\n- **Historical Fiction Romance Thread:**  \n  I loved the historical fiction romance thread.

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the romance! The first half featured excellent pining from Sirius, which built anticipation for their relationship. Once the romance developed, the pace of the book flew by, with some steamy scenes‚Äîlike that unforgettable moment under the library desk! I appreciated Sirius's early recognition of Isabel's depth beyond her initial appearance. However, I found myself wanting Isabel to display a bit more confidence, especially given Sirius's constant praise of her impressive qualities. Nonetheless, I admired how she leveraged others' assumptions about her being a wallflower to her advantage, even as she grappled with some of those internalized opinions.",
            "I found the political themes intriguing and appreciated the exploration of a time and place often overlooked in romance and history. Set in Europe but deeply tied to Mexico, the story follows the sisters as they navigate their longing for their homeland while advocating for its interests in England. This connection adds a sense of significance and uniqueness to the book.",

The scenes were hot (like the under-the-desk moment in the library‚Äîsay less!).

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story is the second installment in the Luna sisters trilogy, focusing on Isabel, a Mexican woman in Victorian England who is recruited to spy on high society to aid Mexico against the French invasion.  \n   - Sirius, a rogue with a troubled past, discovers Isabel's mission and offers to help, leading to a complex relationship.  \n   - The plot includes a twist ending that is unusual for contemporary romances.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Isabel is portrayed as daring and resilient, despite her self-perception as a plain and retiring wallflower. Her growth in confidence and self-awareness is a central theme.  \n   - Sirius is a well-developed character with a compelling backstory as a Crimean War veteran haunted by his experiences and the lack of support for veterans.  \n   - The dynamic between Isabel and Sirius is well-crafted, with their personalities complementing each other.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Accuracy:**  \n   - The novel uses the French invasion of Mexico as a backdrop, incorporating historical figures like Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz and Senora Maza de Juarez.  \n   - While the historical setting is engaging, the story occasionally sacrifices accuracy for dramatic effect (e.g., Isabel sneaking out at night to break into Sirius' house).  \n\n- **Writing Style and Author's Perspective:**  \n   - The author, Liana de la Rosa, expresses her love for Isabel as a character, which is evident in the depth and care given to her portrayal.  \n   - The inclusion of an author's note provides additional context and enriches the reading experience.  \n\n- **Reader Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - The book exceeded expectations and was so enjoyable that the reader plans to reread it.  \n   - Recommended for fans of historical romance, though readers who prioritize strict historical accuracy might find some elements jarring.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a captivating historical romance with strong character development, an engaging plot, and a unique twist.

            "This novel seamlessly blends historical romance with political intrigue, resulting in moments of palpable tension. However, the political espionage element occasionally feels underdeveloped, which might have enhanced both the story's tension and pacing.",

Sirius is an ideal romantic partner for her, showcasing his thoughtfulness by stocking his library with books he believes she‚Äôd enjoy. Their chemistry is palpable, especially in moments like when he recites poetry to her. The novel excels in featuring strong female characters and meaningful representation. A standout scene involving Isabel and her sister Gabby, as they discuss colonization and the theft of cultural artifacts with a professor, is handled thoughtfully and adds significant depth to the story.",

            "This story skillfully blends romance, character development, and historical context. The conflict rooted in miscommunication is credible, considering the characters' vulnerabilities and circumstances. While the setup for future books is well-executed, it does prolong the wait for the next installment. The romance is the heart of the narrative, featuring authentic moments of tension and vulnerability. The hero's deception as a rogue for espionage creates compelling conflict with the heroine. Flirtation through books and situations of forced proximity, such as hiding under a desk, adds both charm and chemistry. Although the \"I don't deserve her\" trope is present, it is handled realistically. The open-door passion scenes are both spicy and tasteful, seamlessly fitting into the storyline.",

The heroine, a wallflower struggling with low self-esteem due to her difficult relationship with her father, is resolute in her mission to protect her country's democracy. The well-developed secondary characters, including Isabel's sisters, enrich the narrative. Additionally, the setup for future romances, such as Gabriela's story, is intriguing and builds anticipation.",

The balloon scene was a highlight, showcasing a tender moment between the two.  \n\n- **Setting and Tropes:**  \n  The historical setting in England was well-executed, and the tropes (book lover heroine, interracial romance, military/politics, slow burn, virgin heroine) added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  Isabel's sisters, Gabby and Ana Maria, made brief appearances, adding continuity from the first book. Other side characters, like the Duke of Whitfield, Lady Needham, and Viscount Westhope, played their roles effectively in advancing the plot.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  Ruby Hunt's narration was excellent, with distinct accents and voices for each character. However, the audiobook felt slightly longer than necessary.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Isabel and the Rogue* had its moments, particularly in the steamy scenes and the historical setting, the heavy focus on politics detracted from the romance. Dawson's character lacked depth, and the emotional connection between the leads felt underdeveloped. Despite these flaws, it‚Äôs worth reading, especially for fans of the first book, *Ana Maria and the Fox*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- üå∂Ô∏è (Steam): 4/5  \n- üéß (Audiobook): 4/5  \n- üò≠ (Emotional Impact): 2/5  \n- ‚ù§Ô∏è (Romance): 3/5  \n- ‚≠êÔ∏è (Overall): 3/5  \n\n**Recommendation:**  \nYes, especially if you‚Äôve read *Ana Maria and the Fox*. I‚Äôm looking forward to Gabby‚Äôs story next!"

            "Isabel and Sirius‚Äôs chemistry was truly captivating. There were numerous moments when I had to pause to catch my breath because of how deeply he wanted to please her‚Äîshe is the light in his life, the only one who can penetrate his fa√ßade. The spice in this second book took me by surprise and was a step above the first; I can hardly remember the last time spicy scenes made me blush so intensely. \n\nWhile I adored the first book, I found myself particularly drawn to Isabel. Her relatability shines through as she seeks solace in the shadows, finding comfort in her books and silence while striving to carve out her own place in the world. The author masterfully explores the tumultuous emotions Isabel experiences‚Äîfear, lust, anger, and longing‚Äîmaking them feel incredibly real. Overall, I loved the deeper exploration of her character in this installment.",
            "I envisioned a real-life Isabel, delivering sharp observations on colonial injustices at the ball or rummaging through an unsuspecting gentleman's desk. The book skillfully intertwines social commentary with the narrative, making the historical context both relevant and impactful.",
            "The emotional weight of the political turmoil is amplified by my deep investment in the characters. At times, I forgot this was a real war, feeling instead as if the stories could easily belong to the characters I had come to cherish. The author connects with readers on a profound level, making it feel as if the beloved characters are friends I could reach out to after turning the last page."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I loved this book. The character development, the relationships, the spice, the social commentary‚Äîit was such an incredible mix of so many amazing ideas and feelings. I feel lucky to have gotten to experience it early! Definitely pick this up if you are looking for a swoony, historical romance with MMCs to make you blush and FMCs to inspire you to be your bravest self. This will be a favorite series of mine for sure!",

From fear to lust to anger to longing... every emotion felt palpable.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Storytelling:**  \n   - The emotional impact of the political turmoil of the time hits that much deeper because of how invested I was in these characters. There were times when I forgot this was an actual war that happened, and stories like these could have very well existed.  \n   - Liana speaks to the hearts of her readers, making you feel like the characters you love are friends you could call after you turned the last page.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry and Spice:**  \n   - The chemistry between Isabel and Sirius was unreal. There were so many times that I had to pause and compose myself before continuing because THAT. MAN.

However, I had none of these issues in this installment. The romance felt perfectly paced, with clear progression in the characters' reactions and emotional shifts.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters, Isabel and Sirius, were beautifully crafted. Isabel‚Äôs independent spirit and desire to prove herself were given a love story that truly suited her. Sirius, despite being widely noticed, felt unseen, which created a compelling dynamic. Their introversion and extroversion, respectively, allowed them to hide in plain sight until they found each other. The emotional and physical chemistry between them was balanced, with jealousy, uncertainty, longing, and self-denial that felt authentic to their personalities.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance was well-developed, with a perfect blend of physical chemistry and emotional connection. The hints of jealousy, uncertainty, and longing added depth to their relationship, making it feel genuine and satisfying.\n\n- **Sisterly Relationships:**  \n  The relationships between the Luna sisters continued to shine, providing humor and levity while also exploring deeper themes of family, cultural loss, and belonging. Their interactions added richness to the story.\n\n- **Political Subplot:**  \n  The political subplot in this installment felt more nuanced and compelling compared to the first book. The search for French intelligence, shifting international allegiances, and the presence of approaching armies and hidden political leaders added tension and depth to the narrative. It culminated in a happily-ever-after that felt perfectly suited to the couple and subverted many historical romance norms in a refreshing way.\n\n- **Standalone Potential:**  \n  While this is a follow-up to *Ana Maria and the Fox*, it can be read as a standalone. The backstory is filled in throughout the book, making it accessible to new readers while still rewarding for those who read the first installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a fantastic follow-up to *Ana Maria and the Fox*, addressing the pacing and storytelling issues I had with the first book.

            "The plotting in this installment surpasses that of the first book, focusing more on character development than on a complex plot. The improved pacing enhances the overall engagement and enjoyment of the story.",
            "This book significantly improves upon the romance of its predecessor. The central relationship between Isabel and Sirius is well-developed, showcasing genuine chemistry. Their interactions are believable, as both are engaged in separate covert missions that naturally draw them together. They spend ample time together, both publicly and privately, and their attraction is evident on both intellectual and emotional levels. Watching their admiration and care for each other grow, despite their reservations, is a highlight of the story.\n\nIsabel is a relatable and well-rounded character. Her struggle to forge her own path within her family feels authentic, and her bookish, socially anxious nature is balanced by her agency and determination, making her easy to root for. Sirius, as a lovable hero, demonstrates care and respect for Isabel that is truly swoon-worthy. However, while his past trauma motivates his actions, it is not explored as deeply as Isabel's motivations, leaving some room for further development.",

            "The book presents an intriguing premise of a shy bookworm doubling as a spy, but ultimately feels like 70% of a compelling story. Isabel's character struggles to uncover meaningful information on her own, often arriving too late to make a real impact. While Sirius's storyline is more developed, it lacks the depth of intrigue I hoped for‚Äîhis past as a fake womanizer could have added more tension, and I wished he had been more actively engaged in the narrative. Overall, the plot feels undercooked and leaves the promise of a richer experience unfulfilled.",
            "The romance between Isabel and Sirius was a standout aspect of the story. Their attraction developed slowly and naturally, making their relationship feel genuine and heartfelt. The chemistry between them was palpable, and their dynamic was both charming and believable. I appreciated that both characters were nerds and bookworms, adding a unique and endearing layer to their romance. Isabel and Sirius were well-crafted and likable; Isabel was clever and witty, while Sirius was kind and charming. I enjoyed witnessing Isabel's growth and found it heartwarming that Sirius made a significant sacrifice for her.",

The author‚Äôs portrayal of Mexico and the Luna sisters‚Äô deep love for their homeland resonates with my Mexican-American heart. I found a strong connection with the sisters, especially in their shared longing for Mexico and aspirations for its future. Captain Sirius Dawson, a war hero haunted by his past, has constructed a public persona to shield himself. Initially, this fa√ßade repels Isabel, but as they spend more time together, it becomes evident that they both desire much more from each other. Their relationship is beautifully developed and profoundly emotional. While I related to Ana Maria‚Äôs oldest daughter complex in the first book, I also connected with Isabel, the overlooked wallflower. Unknown to her sisters, she embarks on a secret mission in England, making her journey all the more intriguing.",

            "I appreciated many aspects of the book, but the plot moved a bit too slowly for my taste. I craved more emotional depth from the characters, as their reasons for separation felt resolved too easily. Stronger dialogue could have addressed these issues more effectively. However, I loved the ending. Despite the pacing concerns, I found the story enjoyable and plan to continue reading, though it doesn't rank among my top favorites.",
            "This book excels at integrating real historical events into its narrative, making the setting a significant force in the plot. For instance, I discovered France's invasion of Mexico coincided with the Civil War‚Äîsomething I never learned in school. Delving into this story and conducting further research illuminated how pivotal this military conflict was to the Union's victory in the Civil War. I truly appreciated this blend of fiction and true history.",
            "I appreciated the diverse characters and perspectives in the novel, which offers a refreshing break from Euro-centric narratives. I particularly admired how the characters addressed issues of colonialism and repatriated artifacts, reminiscent of Evie Dunmore's *A Gentleman's Gambit*."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book has many strengths, including its historical depth, diverse representation, and non-Euro-centric perspective.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Comparison:**  \n  I was looking forward to this second book in the Luna Sisters series, as I felt there was a lot of good set-up for the relationship of the main characters (MCs) in this book from the first one. However, I can't help but compare this series to *A Caribbean Heiress in Paris*, and overall, I find that series to be stronger, particularly book 1.  \n\n- **Historical Depth and Setting:**  \n  One of the things these books do really well is incorporate actual history into the narrative. The setting isn't just a backdrop; it actively affects the plot. For example, I learned about France's invasion of Mexico around the same time as the Civil War, which I hadn't been taught in school. Reading this book and researching further made me realize how crucial this military conflict was to the Union winning the Civil War. I loved this aspect of true history.  \n\n- **Diverse Representation and Themes:**  \n  I appreciated the diverse characters and representations in the novel. The book isn't Euro-centric, which I found refreshing. I also loved how the characters spoke out about colonialism and stolen objects, which reminded me of Evie Dunmore's *A Gentleman's Gambit*.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While I enjoyed many aspects of the book, I found the plot to plod along a little too slowly for my liking. I wanted a bit more emotional depth from the characters. The reasons for their separation felt too easily resolved, and I felt that some good dialogue could have addressed these issues more effectively.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I loved the ending of the book. Despite some pacing issues, I found this series to be a good one, and I will continue reading it. However, it‚Äôs not a top read for me‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt absolutely love it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book has many strengths, including its historical depth, diverse representation, and non-Euro-centric perspective. However, the slow pacing and lack of emotional depth in certain areas held it back from being a top-tier read for me.

Her journey involves taking significant risks to earn respect, which she only achieves upon her return. \n\nSirius, on the other hand, carries the weight of being blamed for his mother‚Äôs death since birth, which profoundly impacts his self-worth and belief in his deservingness of love.

However, the ending is perplexing; Isabel's choice to return to Mexico instead of staying in England with Dawson and her sisters feels illogical. Additionally, Dawson's realization that he could join her in Mexico seemed forced, as he only considers it after his friends suggest it.",

The romance between Isabel and Sirius unfolds organically as they collaborate as spies against French interests, evolving into a charming tale of unexpected emotions that I found truly endearing.",

The author skillfully integrates history into the narrative, making it feel engaging rather than textbook-like.",

However, the beginning was awkward and could have been tightened up. If it hadn‚Äôt been for a book club, I might have given up on it early on.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  The dual POV was a nice element of the writing style.

            "Isabel's character was frustrating to me. She repeatedly expressed her desire to return to Mexico, even amidst a war, which felt childish‚Äîlike she was stubbornly refusing to acknowledge her feelings for Sirius or adapt to her new surroundings. In contrast, Sirius grappled with guilt, and his emotional journey, particularly after a night of drinking and mourning his past relationship, revealed his vulnerability. However, his decision to acquiesce to Isabel's demands and move to Mexico felt more like a forced resolution than a natural evolution of his character. \n\nThe relationship between Isabel and Sirius transitioned from not-quite-enemies to friends and eventually lovers. While this development had potential, it was overshadowed by Isabel's constant complaints about not fitting in and her longing to return home. The resolution, with Sirius agreeing to move to Mexico despite his unfamiliarity with the language and culture, felt unsatisfying.

I felt frustrated that Isabel didn‚Äôt acknowledge how Fernando and the Priest manipulated her insecurities, leading her to take unnecessary risks. While I understand it‚Äôs fiction, this aspect of the story felt underdeveloped.\n\n- **Cultural and Historical Representation:**  \n  I appreciated the inclusion of Mexican history in the novel, as it‚Äôs refreshing to see such representation in media. However, the portrayal of Presidente Ju√°rez was problematic. His misogyny, even by the standards of his time, was unsettling, and the novel‚Äôs depiction of him as a figure of admiration felt inaccurate. Additionally, the historical inaccuracy regarding the U.S. response after the Civil War (e.g., the McLane-Ocampo Treaty) detracted from the story‚Äôs credibility.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The manipulation of Isabel‚Äôs insecurities by Fernando and the Priest added an interesting layer of conflict, but it felt unresolved. I would have liked to see more acknowledgment of this dynamic and its consequences.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel succeeds in highlighting Mexican history and creating complex characters, it falls short in addressing historical inaccuracies and fully resolving character conflicts. The portrayal of Presidente Ju√°rez was particularly disappointing, given his problematic legacy. Despite these flaws, the story‚Äôs cultural representation remains a strong point.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I found her to be a compelling and engaging protagonist.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  I really enjoyed the political intrigue and Isabel's involvement in helping the Juarez government fight the French occupation of Mexico. The author did an excellent job of weaving in a hot topic that remains relevant today‚Äîtreasures taken by colonizers or powerful nations for \"protection\" that don't belong to them. This added depth and relevance to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  As for the love story, I actually liked Isabel much more than her love interest. I found myself rooting for Viscount Westhope half the time, which added a fun dynamic to the narrative.  \n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  The book left me very curious about how Gabby's story will unfold. I can't wait to see what happens next in the series!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was an enjoyable read with strong character development, engaging political intrigue, and a thought-provoking theme. While the romantic subplot had its moments, Isabel's character and the broader plot were the highlights for me. I‚Äôm eagerly looking forward to the next installment in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Enemies to lovers but, more importantly, also enemies to confidants, lending weight and layers to their love that was greatly appreciated.  \n\n- **Plot Engagement and Pacing:**  \n   - I was a little off balance at the start because it relies on the reader remembering secondary character moments from book 1‚Ä¶ which I didn‚Äôt, entirely.

These men who believe a woman is good for nothing but a wife? I'm just assuming they thought her expendable.

It was cute and enjoyable to read.  \n\n- **Setting and Cultural Representation:**  \n  I liked that the main character and her sisters were from Mexico, living in England during the Victorian era. This added an interesting cultural dynamic to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Roles:**  \n  The two main characters were supposed to be \"spies,\" but there was very little actual spying done. This aspect of the plot felt underdeveloped and didn‚Äôt fully deliver on its premise.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a light and enjoyable historical romance with a unique cultural perspective. However, the spy element of the story was underutilized, which left me wanting more in terms of plot execution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Similarly, Sirius, the British war hero, struggles with his own need for validation, adding complexity to his character. The romance between Isabel and Sirius is engaging and at times intense, yet something felt lacking. It wasn't until the very end that I truly fell in love with them as a couple.",

            "One aspect that fell short for me was the overemphasis on finding solutions for Mexico, which became repetitive and ultimately lacked significant resolution. This made certain parts of the story feel frustrating and prolonged.",
            "In this story, Captain Dawson embodies a rogue tempered by the scars of war, which adds depth to his character. Isabel's empowering journey to discover her own voice as the overlooked middle sister is beautifully portrayed. The shared love for books between the characters enriches their relationship in a delightful way. I felt a strong empathy for the kind-hearted guy who loves the female main character (FMC) but remains a mere bystander while she navigates her connection with the male main character (MMC). His predicament resonated with me, and I genuinely hope he finds a wonderful romance of his own.",

The themes of being a wallflower and the dynamic between a wallflower and a rogue are something I always enjoy.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n  The rogue in this story, Captain Dawson, is not a true rogue but rather someone haunted by war, which I found compelling. Isabel's journey of finding her own voice after being overlooked as the middle sister was empowering and well-executed. Their shared love for books added a charming layer to their relationship.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  One aspect that didn‚Äôt work for me was the extensive focus on searching for ways to help Mexico, which felt repetitive and ultimately didn‚Äôt lead to significant outcomes. This made parts of the story feel frustrating and drawn out.  \n\n- **Secondary Characters and Emotional Impact:**  \n  I felt deeply for the \"VERY NICE GUY\" who loves the female main character (FMC) but is left as an innocent bystander while she figures things out with the male main character (MMC).

I love the mix of nobility and untitled people and the way history is integrated into the story. The integration of the Mexican War for Independence is so well-done, and I love when I get to read about histories you don't often see in romance novels.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I adore how Sirius is a day one simp for Isabel and just wants to ply her with poetry collections. Their dynamic is charming and adds a lot of personality to the story.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing remains, for me personally, a bit slow. This is personal preference, really; I just love when there's a little more romance earlier on and a little more tension.\n\n- **Anticipation for Future Books:**  \n  I cannot wait to see Gabby get her book! The potential for her story has me excited for what's to come.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed the world-building, historical integration, and character dynamics in this novel. While the pacing felt a bit slow for my taste, the story's charm and unique elements kept me engaged.
