        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  - The novel is a fantastic science fiction story exploring the consequences of runaway genetic engineering and other technological advancements.  \n  - It presents a dystopian yet familiar world where stolen DNA plays a central role.  \n  - The story follows three women: Quinn, an Unselected surrogate; Ember, a bio-security guard with a dark past; and Lily, a young journalist investigating her mother’s hidden criminal history.  \n  - The book starts with a gripping third-trimester pregnancy surprise and maintains tension throughout.  \n\n- **Themes and Accessibility:**  \n  - The novel delves into complex topics like medical and technology ethics, which resonated deeply with me as a clinical and technology ethicist.  \n  - The author, Peikoff, successfully makes these dense, academic topics accessible and engaging for a general audience.  \n  - The story encourages thoughtful discussion about ethics without resorting to fear-mongering or derailing the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development and Interconnectedness:**  \n  - Initially, I was concerned about how Lily’s storyline would connect with Quinn’s and Ember’s, especially since their perspectives didn’t intersect early on.  \n  - However, the end-chapter tie-in was masterfully executed.  \n  - The revelation that Lily’s chapters were set 20 years in the future and that she was Ember’s daughter added depth and clarity to the narrative, particularly regarding Ember’s “unfairly long prison sentence.”  \n\n- **Minor Criticisms:**  \n  - A few small threads felt underdeveloped, such as why Ember didn’t hire others to manage her business after her first client or more details about Quinn’s transition to life after The Vault.  \n  - These issues were minor and didn’t detract significantly from the overall story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an absolute gem, combining a gripping plot, thought-provoking themes, and well-executed character arcs. It’s a must-read for anyone interested in science fiction, ethics, or simply a compelling story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating, likely 4.5/5 or 5/5."

            "The plot is fast-paced and engaging, propelling the story forward with urgency. It centers on Thorne, a celebrity targeted by the Vault, a clandestine hacker group that steals celebrity DNA for blackmail and profit. To safeguard him during his global concert tour, Thorne hires Ember, a self-styled bio-security guard. Meanwhile, Quinn, a surrogate for hire, believes she is carrying Thorne’s DNA for a widowed gay fan and plans to confront him. Additionally, Lily, a recent college graduate, seeks a high-tech story for her magazine and finds inspiration in her parents' decision to have another baby in their 80s, a phenomenon she dubs \"golden age parenting.\"",
            "Thorne, a teenage guitar sensation, is under constant threat from the Vault. Ember, a savvy bio-security guard, is dedicated to his protection. Meanwhile, Quinn, a surrogate, finds herself drawn into Thorne's world, and Lily, a young journalist, investigates the ramifications of her parents' decision to have children later in life.",
            "The novel depicts a remarkably believable high-tech future set in the 2050s, captivating me and compelling me to turn the pages eagerly. In this world, IVF technology allows parents to select embryos based on analyzed strengths, rendering naturally conceived children a rarity and at a disadvantage. Screening for disease vulnerabilities in fertilized eggs has nearly eradicated inherited diseases, making test-tube babies the norm. Procreative sex has become obsolete, with new technology enabling the conversion of any human cell into sperm or eggs. Smart contact lenses have replaced cell phones, now seen as quaint relics of the past.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n  I initially thought this was a sci-fi dystopian novel, but it turned out to be more of a speculative fiction with a unique thriller aspect. This unexpected twist got me hooked.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The story is set in the 2050s, and the author, Kira Peikoff, does a remarkable job of explaining the technological advancements and setting the scenes. However, it took me some time to fully grasp the world-building, as I could only read a chapter or two at a time initially.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The book is told from three different points of view—Ember, Lily, and Quinn—which help to unfold the story in a compelling way. While the beginning was a bit slow for me, midway through, I couldn’t put it down. The pacing picked up, and the story became incredibly engaging.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Enjoyment:**  \n  The writing is well-crafted, and the story is based on a crazy, mind-blowing idea that I found thoroughly enjoyable. It’s a unique and thrilling read that kept me wanting more.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  The book was released on March 6, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and gripping speculative fiction novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a well-written, unique, and thrilling speculative fiction novel with strong world-building and an engaging narrative. Despite a slower start, the story becomes unputdownable, making it a highly enjoyable and mind-blowing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the overall concept is compelling, some elements felt a bit exaggerated; for instance, the notion of The Vault being managed by just two people and the plan to bomb it stretched believability.

Set in 2025, the novel presents a fun, futuristic thriller centered on IVG as a primary tool for human procreation. The idea of using IVG to eliminate diseases and select genetic traits is intriguing and plausible given current scientific progress. Additionally, the theft and replication of DNA adds a layer of realism, making the story both engaging and thought-provoking."

I had some ideas, but they weren’t even close.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  It’s a futuristic/dystopian book that makes you think about the line between biology and ethics. This works well since the author’s college major was bioethics.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Influences:**  \n  The book reminded me a bit of the *Unwind* YA series (one of my favorites) and a lot of the movie *Gattaca*. Some people mentioned *Black Mirror*, but I haven’t read or seen that.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a thought-provoking futuristic/dystopian novel with a surprising twist ending.

The Ember/Thorne/Quinn plot centers on Quinn, a young pregnant woman who asserts she is carrying Thorne’s child, prompting questions about The Vault and its intentions. Meanwhile, Lily’s storyline delves into the emotional and philosophical challenges of being an “Unforeseen” in a society where most pregnancies are lab-created and embryos are chosen based on genetic profiles. While the two narratives initially seem unrelated, they converge at the end, which I found to be a minor drawback.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  - The novel features two distinct storylines: the Ember/Thorne/Quinn mystery/thriller and Lily’s speculative fiction narrative.  \n  - The Ember/Thorne/Quinn storyline revolves around a young pregnant woman, Quinn, who claims to be carrying Thorne’s baby, raising questions about The Vault and its motives.  \n  - Lily’s storyline explores the emotional and philosophical implications of being an “Unforeseen” in a world where most pregnancies are lab-created and embryos are selected based on genetic profiles.  \n  - The two storylines feel largely unrelated until the very end, which was a minor drawback for me.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  - The novel delves into thought-provoking themes, such as the ethical implications of genetic manipulation and the emotional impact on those who are “Selected” versus “Unforeseen.”  \n  - It raises questions about whether society should use such genetic tools, balancing the benefits of avoiding inherited diseases against the risks of selecting children’s traits.  \n  - The philosophical and emotional depth of Lily’s storyline adds a layer of complexity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - Ember Ryan is a strong protagonist, running a bio-security business to protect celebrities’ DNA from The Vault.  \n  - Thorne’s character is intriguing, especially as his relationship with Ember becomes strained due to Quinn’s claims.  \n  - Lily’s internal struggle with her identity as an “Unforeseen” adds emotional resonance to her character.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  - The novel is a hybrid of science fiction, mystery/thriller, and speculative fiction.  \n  - The Ember/Thorne/Quinn storyline is fast-paced and suspenseful, while Lily’s narrative is more introspective and philosophical.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite the minor issue of the disconnected storylines, I found the novel to be a solid and entertaining speculative thriller.  \n  - The thought-provoking themes and engaging characters made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Baby X* is a compelling blend of science fiction, mystery, and speculative fiction. While the two storylines feel somewhat disconnected until the end, the novel’s exploration of ethical dilemmas, emotional depth, and engaging characters make it a recommended read for fans of speculative thrillers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall: Solid and entertaining (no specific numerical score provided)."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Pace:**  \n  - I really enjoyed this sci-fi book, though I wouldn’t call it a thriller per se. The pace picks up towards the end, making it a mix of both genres.  \n\n- **World-Building and Concept:**  \n  - The futuristic world is well-established, and the author does a good job explaining the \"science.\" The concept is fascinating and well-executed: scientists can use DNA to create a baby, allowing parents to select embryos based on desired qualities. It’s uncommon and even shameful to be a child conceived naturally in this world. There’s also a black market website where people can access anyone’s DNA for a price.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Accessibility:**  \n  - The book doesn’t get overly technical and is easy to understand. It’s told through three distinct women’s perspectives in third person, with each POV being clear and engaging. The audiobook features different narrators for each character, which added to the experience.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The main characters are easy to root for, and their distinct voices make the story compelling.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  - The story is well-plotted, with a big twist that I guessed around the 60% mark (though I’m a seasoned thriller reader). Despite predicting it, I still enjoyed seeing how the characters reached that point. The twist isn’t obvious and can still shock readers.  \n\n- **Suspension of Disbelief:**  \n  - Some parts required suspension of disbelief, but it didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Themes and Quotes:**  \n  - The book explores thought-provoking themes like genetic manipulation, privacy, and identity. Some standout quotes include:  \n    - “Independence awaited at long last, a world full of exciting possibilities. The reality had turned out much quieter.”  \n    - “The erosion of privacy—both technological and biological—had been steadily occurring for decades.”  \n    - “Real life didn't conform to desires, no matter how desperate. Innocent people suffered.”  \n    - “Do you ever wonder what's really you? When you achieve something, is it because you were Selected to do it, or is it you, whatever that means?”  \n    - “No one's a blank slate. We all come into this world with our own set of tools, whether your parents choose them or not.”  \n\n- **Recommendations:**  \n  - I would recommend this book if you enjoy:  \n    - *The One* by John Marrs  \n    - Discussions about the ethics of genetic manipulation  \n    - Female main characters who are easy to root for  \n    - Sci-fi thrillers set in the future  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It combines an intriguing sci-fi concept with well-developed characters and a thought-provoking plot. While some parts required suspension of disbelief, the story’s execution and themes made it a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to Dreamscape Media and NetGalley for providing a copy of the *Baby X* audiobook in exchange for an honest review."

However, the compelling premise and engaging narrative make it an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded up)."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  - The novel is set in a futuristic USA where technology has advanced significantly, including the ability to create sperm and eggs from DNA swiped from everyday objects.  \n  - The concept of using DNA to create children is genius, and the addition of a black-market site (The Vault) adds intrigue and danger.  \n  - The mystery is well-planned and kept me engaged, with an ending I didn’t see coming.  \n  - The dystopian world feels both futuristic and believably real, raising ethical questions about technology and society.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Trace Thorne is a standout character—a humble superstar who handles his unexpected involvement in the mystery with grace and becomes a father figure in a heartwarming way.  \n  - Quinn, Ember, and Lily’s lives intertwine in unexpected ways, but their relationships felt rushed, making it hard to connect with them.  \n  - Ember’s insistence on hiding her past from her fiancé was frustrating, as it added unnecessary pain to Trace’s life.  \n  - Quinn’s naivety in trusting a stranger at a concert was irritating but bearable.  \n  - Lily’s resentment toward her parents, especially her mother, colored her perspective and made her character less likable at times.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  - The book is easy to follow despite its sci-fi and thriller elements, with minimal technical jargon that often slows me down in similar novels.  \n  - Some paragraphs felt drawn out, with unnecessary details like repeatedly describing Quinn’s pregnancy or Shane’s daily attire.  \n  - The pacing was generally good, but the rushed character development and relationships detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  - The futuristic setting is unique and immersive, with innovations like digital contact lenses and driverless vehicles.  \n  - The dystopian elements, such as the ethical dilemmas surrounding DNA manipulation, are thought-provoking and relevant.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Baby X* is a captivating and thought-provoking novel that paints a dystopian future both fascinating and unsettling. While the unique plot and standout character Trace Thorne shine, the rushed relationships and occasional over-description slightly marred the experience. Despite these flaws, the book’s intriguing world and ethical questions make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot and Concept: 5/5  \n- Characters: 3.5/5  \n- Writing Style and Pacing: 4/5  \n- Worldbuilding: 5/5  \n- Overall: 4.5/5  \n\nThanks to NetGalley for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review! #netgalley #arcreview"

The twist connecting the characters was intriguing, revealing that the man who deceived Quinn is Ember’s ex, and the embryo is created from their DNA.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - The book is a great fit for lovers of speculative fiction, dystopia (non-apocalyptic), and thrillers.  \n  - It explores themes of reproductive autonomy, the implications of advanced technology, and the ethical dilemmas surrounding genetic engineering.  \n  - The story includes a touch of romance, which complements the plot without overwhelming it.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - Set in the mid-21st century (around 2050), the novel presents a future where traditional baby-making is obsolete, and parents select embryos curated for traits, predispositions, and disease prevention.  \n  - The government plays a central role in this system, requiring genetic data storage for national health insurance, leading to a lack of privacy.  \n  - The pervasive use of social media and technology makes individuals’ actions easily trackable, adding to the dystopian atmosphere.  \n  - The author effectively paints a world with good intentions but significant potential for things to go wrong, which they do.  \n\n- **Characters and Plot:**  \n  - The story follows several key characters, each facing intriguing decisions and dilemmas that explore moral gray areas.  \n  - The characters’ development and interactions are engaging, though one character’s storyline initially felt slow but eventually became exciting.  \n  - The author balances character-driven storytelling with the exploration of complex scientific and technological concepts.  \n\n- **Accessibility and Writing Style:**  \n  - The author makes topics like science, technology, and reproduction accessible and easy to understand for lay readers.  \n  - The focus remains on the characters and story rather than delving into overly technical explanations, which keeps the narrative engaging.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Appeal:**  \n  - The book offers an interesting contrast to “Red Clocks” by Leni Zumas, presenting a future where reproduction is highly controlled but in a different way.  \n  - Fans of “Red Clocks” and similar speculative fiction or dystopian thrillers would likely enjoy “Baby X.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“Baby X” is a compelling and thought-provoking novel that blends speculative fiction, dystopia, and thriller elements. It explores complex themes like reproductive autonomy and genetic engineering while maintaining an engaging and accessible narrative. Despite a slightly slow start for one character’s storyline, the book is a solid and enjoyable read that will appeal to fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5 stars"

            "The story is presented through three distinct perspectives, effectively intertwining the characters' experiences. Each storyline delves into the implications of advanced reproductive technology, such as predicting genetic traits, illnesses, and abilities before implantation. However, the middle section felt somewhat repetitive, which slowed the narrative's momentum. Additionally, a lengthy list of genetic possibilities read by one character did not translate well in the audiobook format, making it tedious enough that I found myself skipping ahead to the main narrative. On a positive note, the unexpected twists were well-executed and genuinely surprising. The ending tied everything together seamlessly, providing a satisfying conclusion.",

The setting in Laguna Beach and the futuristic concept of DNA selection added depth to the story. While I enjoyed the plot and ending, the absence of the author’s note in the eGalley was a slight disappointment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- My Rating: 3.5 (rounded up)  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and Crooked Lane Books for providing this early eGalley.

While it could have explored ethical dilemmas more deeply and embraced greater diversity in its characters, it succeeded in being an enjoyable story without crossing into offensive territory.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Nonetheless, I loved how it played out.  \n  - I don’t love when books mention COVID, and it felt super unnecessary here. The talk about COVID and the new pandemic/quarantine etc., just felt really out of place and not needed.  \n\n- **Character Development and Perspective:**  \n  - I do sort of wish we got a POV from Thorne.  \n  - I did feel the book was a little chaotic and hard to follow at times.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - Still a solid 4-star read.  \n  - I would highly recommend it if you like thrillers and sci-fi.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some minor flaws, such as the unnecessary inclusion of COVID-related themes and occasional chaotic pacing, this book was an engaging and thrilling read.

It’s better suited for readers who enjoy mystery or thriller themes with a touch of sci-fi.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Extra star for the thought-provoking nature of the concepts."

How many times were Quinn and Ember just left to their own devices, even by FBI agents?  \n\n- **Subplots and Character Relevance:**  \n  The Lily subplot was odd.

She wasn’t necessary.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s premise and use of future reproductive technology were intriguing, the execution of the thriller elements and certain subplots fell short.

It was an intimacy that both thrilled and terrified her.” Another striking moment is the portrayal of a character’s physical traits: “…the slight bump in his nose, endearing insofar as he had resisted the cultural pressure to eradicate his flaws.

It was intriguing and drew me in.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story is told from the perspectives of three different characters. While this approach adds depth, it also disrupted my immersion. Just as I became invested in one character’s storyline, the chapter would end, and I had to read through two others before returning to it. This constant shift made it harder to stay fully engaged.\n\n- **Chapter Length:**  \n  The chapters were short, which I generally appreciate as it kept me reading. However, the brevity also contributed to a lack of connection with the characters. I felt I didn’t have enough time to fully understand or empathize with them.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There were moments of brilliance in the character descriptions, such as the line: “His eyes were searching hers not out of lust, but out of yearning: to see more than she had allowed before. It was an intimacy that both thrilled and terrified her.” Another example is the description of a character’s physical traits: “…the slight bump in his nose, endearing insofar as he had resisted the cultural pressure to eradicate his flaws. He was himself and he didn’t give a damn, not like those other shallow celebrities who nipped and tucked and tweaked and plucked themselves into stereotypes of perfection.” These passages stood out for their depth and insight, but such moments were too few to fully compensate for the overall lack of connection.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  All in all, it was a good sci-fi read, but I expected more. While there were elements I appreciated, the execution fell short of my expectations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had an engaging premise and moments of vivid character insight, but the narrative structure and lack of deeper character connection hindered my overall enjoyment. It’s a decent sci-fi novel, but it didn’t fully deliver on its potential.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, it is occasionally bogged down by overly explicit explanations.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  I appreciated the interconnected shifting points of view, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot didn’t quite deliver for me. The twists felt predictable, and numerous loose ends left me questioning. Additionally, the story requires a significant suspension of disbelief.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book leans more towards a straightforward thriller rather than the nuanced storytelling of authors like Kazuo Ishiguro or Margaret Atwood. This was unexpected, as I anticipated more of a sci-fi vibe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Baby X* has an intriguing premise and strong world-building, its predictable twists, loose ends, and deviation from the expected sci-fi tone left me somewhat disappointed. It falls short of the nuanced storytelling I had hoped for.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

By the end, I partly understood why this was the case, but I wish it had been made clearer earlier on, at least in one perspective, what year it was supposed to be.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I don’t think I would recommend this book to anyone who loves sci-fi. It might be enjoyable for someone just dabbling in the genre or who doesn’t read a lot of sci-fi, but for avid sci-fi readers or enthusiasts, this book might not meet expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong concept, solid world-building, and an interesting plot, it fell short in character development, timeline clarity, and predictability of twists. It may appeal to casual sci-fi readers but might disappoint those deeply invested in the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The ending of this story was a standout moment that truly blew me away. While I anticipated some of the conclusions, the execution remained deeply satisfying. Set in a near-future United States where conceiving children is a precise scientific process, the premise is both intriguing and thought-provoking. The plot follows Ember Ryan, a bio-security guard tasked with protecting famous singer Trace Thorne from The Vault, a black market for stolen DNA. The arrival of Quinn, a pregnant woman claiming to carry Thorne’s child, injects significant tension and upheaval into the narrative. Additional characters, including a desperate would-be father and a curious journalist, add layers of mystery, leaving readers questioning everyone’s true motives.",

A journalist chasing a big story.  \n  Each character is impacted by the actions of DNA thieves, adding depth to the story.  \n\n- **Execution and Realism:**  \n  While the concept is strong, the execution feels far-fetched. For example:  \n  - The bio-guard falls in love with a famous musician mere weeks into her assignment.  \n  - The surrogate becomes best friends with someone she just met at a rock show, practically moving in together immediately.  \n  - The journalist is given an unrealistic three-day deadline to secure a hot scoop, or her competitor will take the job.  \n  These plot points strain believability and detract from the story's credibility.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents a fascinating and original concept with a compelling futuristic setting. However, the execution of the plot and character dynamics feels rushed and unrealistic, which undermines the overall impact of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The company processes the DNA to create a selection of embryos, each with its own list of genetic traits. Parents then choose which embryo to develop, leading to the birth of a genetically selected baby. The premise is intriguing and raises questions about the potential consequences of such technology.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The story is divided into three distinct storylines that eventually overlap. Two of these storylines tie in early on, but the connection to the third is not revealed until much later in the book. This delayed revelation adds an element of surprise and keeps the reader engaged. The plot is highly driven and maintains a thriller-like pace, making it difficult to put the book down.\n\n- **Twists and Surprises:**  \n  The novel includes a twist that I did not see coming, which added to the overall enjoyment and suspense of the story. This unexpected turn of events was well-executed and contributed to the book's page-turning quality.\n\n- **Philosophical Depth:**  \n  While the novel does include some philosophical musings, they are relatively sparse and not as deeply explored as one might expect in a work by authors like Margaret Atwood. The focus remains more on the plot and thriller elements rather than profound philosophical inquiry.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a highly engaging and plot-driven dystopian thriller with an intriguing premise and a well-executed twist. While it lacks the depth of philosophical exploration found in some other works in the genre, it succeeds in keeping the reader hooked with its fast-paced narrative and surprising developments.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

Despite some minor confusion with the POVs, the book left a lasting impression, and I’m eager to explore more of the author’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

For instance, the transition in Quinn’s storyline, where her suspicions about Robert’s lie were abruptly resolved without showing the process, felt jarring. Similarly, the revelation about Ember’s involvement with the vault came out of nowhere and wasn’t revisited in subsequent chapters, making it feel unnatural and disjointed.\n\n- **Narrative Execution:**  \n  The storytelling often relied on telling rather than showing, which diminished the impact of key reveals.

I was hoping for more depth and discussion on these issues, but they were not explored as thoroughly as I had anticipated.  \n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  It was a quick read, which made it accessible, but the brevity also contributed to the lack of depth in addressing complex topics.  \n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n  This is not my usual genre, so my expectations might have been influenced by that.

In contrast, the author of this book creates a world rich with technological advancements, such as contact lenses that replace cell phones for web browsing, firmly placing it in the sci-fi genre. \n\nThe premise is captivating: DNA can be manipulated to create an egg from any cell, enabling same-sex couples to contribute DNA to their child.

John Marrs’ book *The One* (also about speculative uses of DNA) has only that singular tech advanced, while everything else feels contemporary.  \n  - Peikoff, although listed as speculative fiction, sets her story in a world with MANY tech advances, such as contact lenses replacing cell phones for web surfing. This, in my opinion, places it more firmly in the sci-fi category.  \n\n- **Premise and Themes:**  \n  - The premise was really cool—DNA being manipulated to create an egg from ANY cell, allowing same-sex couples to both contribute DNA to their child.  \n  - The story explores ethical questions around selecting embryos based on potential personality traits, medical conditions, and skills, as well as the pushback against such practices.  \n  - The idea of celebrities and other desirables having their DNA stolen and sold by a terrorist group called The Vault is intriguing and not far-fetched.  \n\n- **Characters and POVs:**  \n  - The book follows three main female characters: a bio-guard, a young woman named Lily struggling with her identity as a naturally conceived child, and a surrogate mother who suspects she’s carrying an illegal celebrity embryo.  \n  - The characters’ voices were practically indistinguishable, and I often had to remind myself who was who.  \n  - Lily’s POV felt unnecessary, especially since her connection to the other women was predictable early on.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**  \n  - While marketed as a thriller, the multiple POVs and frequent switching between them kept the tension to a minimum. Just as things got exciting, the perspective would shift, slowing the momentum.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n  - The dialogue felt stilted and juvenile, particularly for characters who were supposed to be in their 40s but sounded more like teenagers.  \n  - The twist was not as impactful as intended, especially for someone who reads a lot of twisty books.  \n\n- **World-Building and Execution:**  \n  - The world-building included many futuristic tech advances, which I found interesting but overwhelming at times.  \n  - I wish the author had explored the ramifications and potential fallout of DNA manipulation with more depth and finesse.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the story and found its premise thought-provoking and relevant. However, the execution fell short in areas like character differentiation, pacing, and dialogue. While the concept of DNA theft and manipulation is fascinating, the book could have delved deeper into its ethical implications and consequences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It delves into the idea of creating babies in a lab using DNA, allowing parents to select or eliminate specific characteristics, traits, and intelligence. The concept raises questions about perfection, hereditary conditions, and the moral and ethical dilemmas that arise when the process is corrupted, such as the theft of DNA from celebrities for profit.  \n\n- **Character Development and Likability:**  \n  The story follows three women—Quinn, Lily, and Ember—each dealing with their own situations related to this evolution in childbearing. While their individual storylines eventually converge, the characters were not especially likable. The development and presentation of these characters felt lacking, which detracted from the overall impact of the story.  \n\n- **Plot Execution and Climax:**  \n  The premise was intriguing, but the execution fell short. The climax seemed over the top and verged on being ridiculous, which undermined the believability of the story.  \n\n- **Scientific Detail and Realism:**  \n  The medical science aspects of the novel were fascinating and all too believable.

However, Baby X was a huge letdown despite my high expectations.  \n\n- **Exploration of Themes:**  \n  - The book touches on numerous social themes and issues, such as privacy, safety, playing \"God,\" oppression vs. discrimination, moral right vs. wrong, informed consent, justice and equity, equality of access, and unforeseen complications. Unfortunately, these themes are largely unexplored, representing a missed opportunity.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  - The writing feels amateurish and awkward, akin to a cheesy B movie produced for cable. The scenes between Ember and Thorne were particularly cringe-worthy.  \n\n- **Scientific Feasibility:**  \n  - The science in the book seems more like fantasy than reality. The baby-making process described appears ridiculous and unlikely to be possible within ten years.  \n\n- **World-Building and Future Tech:**  \n  - The world-building and depiction of future tech were enjoyable aspects, though flawed. Some of the technology described is too advanced to be plausible within a decade.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The book features three main characters whose perspectives rotate throughout. Lily was the only character I liked, though she came off as whiny at times. Quinn was portrayed as weak and ditzy, while Ember’s insta-love romance with Thorne was unbearable. I ended up skimming Ember’s chapters halfway through.  \n\n- **Thriller Elements:**  \n  - The book fails to deliver as a thriller. At no point was I on the edge of my seat or worried about potential dangers.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  - The small mystery twist, which is the book’s only other positive, occurs very late in the story and is predictable. While it’s a nice surprise, it doesn’t compensate for the book’s overall shortcomings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBaby X had a lot of promise but ultimately fell short in execution.

It’s a downer that I had to read that far before it finally caught my interest, but that’s the way the cookie crumbles.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The plot took a long time to finally get good. A certain POV felt really useless, even with what happens. I feel like there are plotholes, but I can’t seem to point them out.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  The book has interesting concepts for the future and gets really tense when it wants to.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  Reading it felt like watching a futuristic drama series that got a below-good score on Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic. I really wanted to see if it was that middling, and although it got entertaining in the last two episodes, I still agreed with the middling scores.  \n\n- **Mood and Context:**  \n  I would read this after watching some speculative fiction show or after heavily discussing reproductive health rights with someone.  \n\n- **Overall Ranking:**  \n  This goes in C tier.

They definitely did their research, and the premise was so intriguing that I even started having dreams about this world.  \n\n- **Plot and Tone:**  \n  The plot felt cheesy and read like a YA novel. It avoided difficult questions for the sake of the plot, which made it hard to fully suspend my disbelief. For example, the idea of genetically “coaxing” cells into sex cells was somewhat believable, but the concept of someone collecting all fallen DNA from a person in public with 100% accuracy felt incomprehensible.  \n\n- **Diversity and Social Awareness:**  \n  The novel had a glaring lack of diversity and racial awareness, especially within the intersection of health and technology. There was no discussion of health equity, racial disparities, or how health inequalities might evolve in the next 50 years. While other cultural aspects, like universal healthcare and disease screening, were explained, the absence of any mention of racial tensions or disability equality felt ignorant and upsetting.  \n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I was entertained by the novel. The premise was fascinating, and the world-building kept me engaged, even though there was a significant gap in addressing critical social issues.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Baby X* is an intriguing and entertaining exploration of a near-future society with well-researched technological elements.

It had a lot of potential, but the execution fell short.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  There were too many indistinct voices, particularly among the female characters. The narrators were quite dull to listen to, which I believe is a reflection of the story itself. The male main character (MMC) exhibited some of the most unrealistic behavior and dialogue I've ever encountered.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The plot was told rather than shown, which made it feel less engaging. Additionally, there were instances where things were conveniently made up to ensure the story made sense later on. This is a narrative technique I strongly dislike, and it was used excessively in this book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the book was intriguing, the execution left much to be desired. The lack of distinct character voices, unrealistic behavior, and reliance on convenient plot devices significantly detracted from my enjoyment. As a result, I cannot round up my rating to 3 stars.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75 stars (not rounded up to 3)."

            "The plot is disjointed and overloaded with random sci-fi elements that fail to cohesively integrate into the main narrative. The inclusion of a chatbot mimicking a deceased husband, reminiscent of a Black Mirror episode, and a character publicly revealing her mother’s criminal past feels derivative and uninspired. These scattered ideas disrupt the pacing, leaving the story feeling unfocused and chaotic.",
            "The main characters in the story are underdeveloped and lack depth. One is a surrogate, another a bio-guard, while the third is a bland character who is ultimately rescued by her husband after sacrificing herself for him. These so-called strong female characters are undermined by their lack of agency and dependence on male figures. Furthermore, the police's decision to send a highly pregnant key witness to a hotel alone, without protection, is both illogical and contrived, leading to her kidnapping.",
            "The tone of the story is inconsistent, oscillating between serious social commentary and flippant, almost comedic dismissals of complex issues. Additionally, the writing features random capitalization of words, which seems intended to evoke a speculative fiction vibe but ultimately feels gimmicky rather than impactful.",
            "This book explores themes of bodily autonomy, paranoia, genetic determinism, and society's fixation on genetic makeup over skill. However, its treatment of these themes is problematic, especially regarding disabilities. The portrayal of a child suing their deaf parents and another character resenting their parents for choosing to have them despite a predisposition to depression is deeply insensitive and reinforces harmful stereotypes. While the author avoids the term eugenics, the narrative still suggests a troubling perspective on eliminating disabilities and maximizing genetic potential.",
            "The novel delves into a sci-fi world where babies can be created from any type of cell, raising issues such as stolen celebrity DNA, extortion, and shifts in fame and privacy. While the concept of a bio-guard—a bodyguard for DNA—is intriguing, it remains underdeveloped and unconvincing. The setting features advanced technologies like lab-made babies, extended lifespans, cosmetic procedures, robot animals, and 3D-printed items, but these elements are only briefly mentioned and lack deep integration into the narrative."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The novel attempts to explore a sci-fi world where babies can be created from any type of cell, leading to issues like stolen celebrity DNA, extortion, and societal shifts in fame and privacy. The idea of a \"bio-guard\" (a bodyguard for DNA) is introduced, but it feels underdeveloped and unconvincing. The setting includes advanced technologies like lab-made babies, extended lifespans, cosmetic procedures, robot animals, and 3D-printed items, but these elements are mentioned in passing without deep integration into the narrative.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book touches on themes like bodily autonomy, paranoia, genetic determinism, and the societal obsession with genetic makeup over skill. However, the handling of these themes is problematic, particularly in its portrayal of disabilities. The inclusion of a child suing their deaf parents for being deaf and another character resenting their parents for choosing them despite a predisposition to depression is deeply insensitive and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. The author avoids using the term \"eugenics,\" but the narrative still promotes a troubling perspective on eradicating disabilities and maximizing genetic potential.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters are poorly developed and lack depth. One character is a surrogate, another is a bio-guard, and the third has no personality and is ultimately rescued by her husband, sacrificing herself for him. These so-called \"strong female characters\" are undermined by their lack of agency and reliance on male figures. Additionally, the police's decision to send a highly pregnant key witness alone to a hotel without protection, leading to her kidnapping, is illogical and contrived.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot feels disjointed and overstuffed with random sci-fi elements that don’t cohesively tie into the main narrative. The inclusion of a chatbot mimicking a deceased husband (reminiscent of a Black Mirror episode) and a character publicly exposing her mother’s criminal past feels derivative and lacks originality. The pacing suffers as a result of these scattered ideas, making the story feel unfocused and chaotic.\n\n- **Tone and Writing Style:**  \n  The tone is inconsistent, veering between serious social commentary and flippant, almost comedic dismissals of complex issues. The writing style includes random capitalization of words, presumably to evoke a speculative fiction vibe, but it comes across as gimmicky rather than effective.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver a coherent or thoughtful exploration of its themes. The characters are underdeveloped, the plot is disjointed, and the handling of sensitive topics like disabilities is deeply flawed. While the sci-fi elements could have been compelling, they are poorly integrated and overshadowed by the book's problematic messaging and lack of originality.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly negative assessment.)"
