The dual POV structure is executed well, though it leans more heavily on Leith‚Äôs perspective, which is a refreshing change from typical fantasy romance narratives.\n\n- **Aesthetic and Presentation:**  \n  Extra credit is given for the beautiful sprayed edges and artwork, which enhance the reading experience and add to the book‚Äôs overall appeal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is an engaging blend of romance, fantasy, and action, with a unique focus on the male protagonist‚Äôs perspective. The world-building is immersive, and the characters‚Äô struggles are compelling. The aesthetic details, such as the sprayed edges and artwork, make it a visually stunning addition to any bookshelf.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the enthusiastic tone suggests a high rating."

Its standalone nature and lack of a cliffhanger make it a satisfying read, though deeper exploration of its political elements could have enhanced the story further.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Masve, on the other hand, was initially harder to connect with, but her character arc in the second half of the book, as she embraced her royal title, made me come to love her.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is fast-paced, filled with complicated politics, unsure alliances, and shocking twists. I couldn‚Äôt put the book down because I was constantly eager to know who would survive. The dual POV helped me better understand the intricacies of the story.  \n\n- **Fantasy vs. Romance Elements:**  \n  The fantasy elements are the strongest aspect of the book, with a focus on violence, political intrigue, and magical creatures. While there is some romance and spice, it doesn‚Äôt carry the same swoon-worthy tension as other fantasy-romance books I‚Äôve read. However, the strength of the fantasy elements more than makes up for it.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Robson‚Äôs writing is captivating and immersive. From the opening sentences, I was transported into a world of violence, political complexity, and otherworldly creatures.  \n\n- **Audio vs. Physical Reading Experience:**  \n  I sampled the audiobook but found fantasy, especially with such intricate world-building, challenging to follow in audio format. I prefer a physical read for books like this, though there was nothing negative about the audio performance itself.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Kingdom of Arrow of Old Erth* is a gripping fantasy novel with complex world-building, compelling characters, and a fast-paced plot filled with political intrigue and shocking twists. While the romance elements are understated, the strength of the fantasy aspects more than compensates. Robson‚Äôs writing is immersive and captivating, making this a book I couldn‚Äôt put down. I‚Äôm excited to see where the story goes in the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated the subtle twists woven throughout the story. The revelation of the larger motives behind the leadership's decisions and the purpose of the games was both surprising and skillfully executed. The ending was particularly satisfying. While the court politics section in the middle felt necessary, it could have been more polished. Initially, the writing from the female main character's perspective wasn't as strong, but after the halfway mark, I found myself fully immersed and invested in the narrative.",
            "I appreciated that most of the book is told from the male point of view, which is uncommon in the fantasy romance genre. Our male main character, Leith, is a compelling mix of ruthlessness and humility, with a kind heart and a great sense of humor. I found myself highlighting several lines simply for their humor. Although the narrative transitions to a dual perspective when the love interest is introduced, it primarily retains Leith‚Äôs viewpoint.",
            "The book's opening grabbed my attention with intense action, immersing me in Leith's world right away. While there were moments that caused me to lose interest, which led to a slight deduction in my rating, the story picked up dramatically by the 70% mark. At that point, I found myself unable to put it down, eager to discover what would happen next.",

I‚Äôve been waiting for this book to release since I initially heard about it earlier in 2024, and it did not disappoint.  \n\n- **Point of View (POV):**  \n  I really liked that the majority of the book is told from the male POV, which is rare in the fantasy romance genre. Our MMC, Leith, is ruthless yet humble and kind at his core, not to mention funny. There were many lines I highlighted just because they made me laugh. While it becomes a dual POV once the love interest is introduced, the story remains primarily Leith‚Äôs perspective.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The beginning of the book pulled me in quickly, starting with some intense action right off the bat. I was immediately drawn to Leith and his world. However, there were parts of the story where I lost interest, which led me to dock a point. That said, by the 70% mark, I couldn‚Äôt put it down because I needed to know what would happen.  \n\n- **World-Building and Plot Development:**  \n  The court politics dump in the middle of the book felt necessary but could have been written a bit better. The writing from the FMC‚Äôs POV wasn‚Äôt as strong initially, but after the halfway point, I became fully immersed and invested.  \n\n- **Twists and Ending:**  \n  I enjoyed the little twists throughout the story. The reveal of the bigger picture behind the leadership‚Äôs decisions and the reason for the games was surprising and well-executed. The ending was satisfying.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you‚Äôre looking for a fun story with gladiators, mythical creatures, and a touch of romance, this is the book for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Bloodguard* was an engaging and enjoyable read with a unique male POV, compelling characters, and a satisfying blend of action, intrigue, and romance. While there were moments where the pacing lagged, the story ultimately delivered a thrilling and immersive experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI docked a point for parts where I lost interest, but the book still held my attention strongly overall."

The monsters and gladiator fights were the standout elements, demonstrating both creativity and intensity. The diverse range of creatures added depth to the world.

This omission significantly impacted my rating.\n\n- **Ending and Closure:**\n  - While the ending felt flat, I appreciated that there wasn‚Äôt an unnecessary cliffhanger, which added to the overall satisfaction of the read.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this was a really good read with strong characters, surprising plot twists, and rich cultural details. However, the lack of character descriptions, the skipped marriage ceremony, and the flat ending prevented it from being a 5-star book for me. I‚Äôm optimistic about future books from this author and can see myself giving a 5-star rating if these aspects are improved.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4 stars."

            "The middle section of the novel occasionally lags, especially during the political machinations at court. The shift between arena action and palace intrigue may feel jarring for some readers.",
            "The protagonists, Leith and Maeve, are richly developed characters. Leith evolves from a desperate brother into a hardened gladiator while maintaining his humanity, and Maeve subverts the typical princess trope, emerging as a compassionate healer and strategist. However, the secondary characters, particularly among the nobles, lack depth and often blend together; a more focused approach on fewer supporting players could have enhanced their characterization. The love story between Leith and Maeve unfolds naturally through shared trauma and mutual respect, making their bond feel earned rather than fated. Their eventual separation is heart-wrenching, adding significant emotional depth to the narrative.",

The magical elements, including moon horses and estrellas, are seamlessly woven into daily life, enhancing the narrative without overshadowing it. However, certain aspects, particularly the specifics of magical abilities, would benefit from greater clarity and consistency.",

Central themes of truth and identity emerge as characters like Maeve and Leith grapple with reconstructing their understanding of themselves and their world. The tension between love and duty propels the narrative, as both protagonists navigate their personal desires in the face of societal obligations."

While the plot twists added intrigue, I craved more context about the broader kingdom.",

            "I added this book to my TBR months ago, drawn in by its connection to the upcoming *Gladiator 2* movie. As a fan of gladiators and historical themes, I was eager to explore this story. The premise‚Äîa supernatural twist on the gladiator narrative featuring trolls, giants, and elves in a Rome-like setting‚Äîimmediately piqued my interest. I hoped it would capture the grandeur, emotion, and action of the original *Gladiator* film. This romantasy offers a unique male-dominated perspective, which is refreshing yet raises some concerns. The dual POVs follow Leith, a gladiator aiming for the title of Bloodguard, and Maeve, an elven princess navigating a power struggle for the throne. While Leith‚Äôs perspective is more prominent, I appreciated Maeve‚Äôs strength and agency, particularly when she demonstrated her combat skills."

As a fan of gladiators and historical themes, I was excited to dive into this story. The premise of a supernatural twist on the gladiator narrative, featuring beings like trolls, giants, and elves in a Rome-like setting, immediately captured my interest. I hoped it would deliver the same grandeur, emotion, and action as the original *Gladiator* movie.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Initially, the story felt lacking in plot, focusing heavily on gladiator action. As the narrative progressed, more stakes and hidden elements were revealed, which revived my interest. However, I still felt the stakes weren‚Äôt high enough to fully immerse me. The plot twists added intrigue, but I wished for more context about the wider world of the kingdom.  \n\n- **Genre and Perspective:**  \n  This is a romantasy with a unique male-dominated perspective, which was refreshing but also raised some concerns. The dual POVs feature Leith, a gladiator striving for the title of Bloodguard, and Maeve, an elven princess navigating a power struggle to become queen. While Leith‚Äôs perspective dominated, I appreciated Maeve‚Äôs strength and agency, especially when she showcased her combat skills.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Maeve stood out as a strong, capable heroine who didn‚Äôt shy away from action. Her ability to match Leith in combat and her resilience in the face of danger made her a compelling character. However, the story‚Äôs male-centric focus occasionally made her feel sidelined, which conflicted with my feminist sympathies.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement and Entertainment Value:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book kept me entertained.

            "The political warfare was engaging and well-executed, though it didn't quite reach the heights of the genre's best. Maeve's straightforward goal of seizing the throne and overthrowing evil was enjoyable, and while the plot thickened as the story unfolded, it ultimately remained somewhat predictable.",
            "The romance in this story fell flat, lacking the angst, heat, and intensity I anticipated. While the pairing was likable, their relationship felt superficial and emotionally shallow. Although there were moments of mild steam, the romance failed to generate strong emotions or tension. I expected more conflict and animosity between the characters, but their swift attraction made their dynamic feel dull. Maeve is a righteous and protective character who wields a sword against monsters, yet she lacks significant power. Leith, a lowly villager in search of gold and glory, shares some traits with Maeve but remains underdeveloped. The themes of social disparity and hierarchy abuse added depth to the world, but I struggled to understand Leith's motivation for marrying Maeve, as he seemed to contribute little beyond his integrity and resistance to corruption.",

            "This insta-love romance, featuring a dual POV and a compelling business partners-to-lovers dynamic, kept me on the edge of my seat. If you appreciated the challenges in *Phantasma* or *Hunger Games*, you'll find plenty to enjoy in *Bloodguard*.",
            "I appreciated that Maeve, the female main character, wasn't a typical damsel in distress, and Leith, the male lead, avoided being a stubborn jerk. He struck me as a toned-down blend of Geralt from *The Witcher* and Joel from *The Last of Us*‚Äîa charming tough guy you can't help but love. His protective instincts towards Maeve and those he cares about give off strong \"touch her and die\" teddy bear vibes. The early banter between them is delightful. \n\nAlthough their romance leans towards insta-love, the depth of love, adoration, and care they share in their intimate moments adds a compelling layer to their relationship. However, I wish there was more exploration of the reasons behind their love. While they recognize each other's good hearts, there aren't many other factors that draw them together, making their connection feel somewhat forced, as if it were born out of obligation rather than a natural, evolving partnership.\n\nAdditionally, I would have liked to see more of Giselle and Caelan. They are such a cute couple‚Äîreminding me of Elain and Lucien for some reason‚Äîand I hope the author provides more insight into their story in a potential sequel.

If you enjoyed the trials in *Phantasma* or *Hunger Games*, you‚Äôll enjoy what‚Äôs in store in *Bloodguard*.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I believe it‚Äôs the author‚Äôs romantasy debut, so don‚Äôt expect any Brandon Sanderson levels of world-building, or an *ACOTAR*-like romance, but it‚Äôs a nice story nonetheless.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I enjoyed that the FMC, Maeve, wasn‚Äôt a complete damsel in distress, and the MMC, Leith (Keith with an L), wasn‚Äôt a total stubborn asshole! He actually reminded me of a toned-down version of Geralt from *Witcher* meets Joel from *TLOU* ‚Äî a charming hard ass that you hate to love. Total ‚Äútouch her and die‚Äù teddy bear vibes when it comes to protecting Maeve and those he cares about.  \n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**  \n  The early banter between these two is *chef‚Äôs kiss*. Despite their romance being insta-love, the amount of love, adoration, and care the main characters have for each other really shows in their intimate scenes, which made their relationship more compelling in my opinion.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The book isn‚Äôt spicy at all. There are two open-door scenes, but the descriptions aren‚Äôt overly graphic. I personally hate reading sex scenes in the first person because of the incredibly awkward internal monologues. That aside, these scenes felt like a wholesome, vulnerable, emotional type of love rather than a moment of raw, intense lust.  \n\n- **Relationship Development:**  \n  I just wish we had more conviction behind the ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs‚Äù of their romance and how they fell in love. For example, they know they‚Äôre both good people with good hearts, but there‚Äôs nothing else that brings them together, and no other obvious reasons for falling in love, so it almost feels forced or something done out of obligation rather than a choice between the two characters and something that continues to grow into a beautiful, meaningful partnership.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  I also wish we got to see more of Giselle and Caelan. I need to know if her condition ever improves! They‚Äôre so cute together (they remind me so much of Elain and Lucien for some reason), so I hope we get more insight into their story in the next book, should Robson write it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Bloodguard* is a breath of fresh air with its engaging plot, dual POV, and charming characters.

While Maeve's family dynamic is intriguing, I would have liked to see a deeper connection among them, which may be explored in future installments.",

The plot twist at the end felt forced, and I believe the story could have been stronger without the fantasy aspect.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The first half of the book was great, with a lot of political intrigue, action sequences, and engaging side characters. The pacing felt just right, and the high-stakes elements kept me hooked.  \n  - However, the latter half of the book felt overwhelming and poorly timed. A major plot twist occurred too early, leaving me unsure how the story could continue for over 100 pages. This caused my interest to wane.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The romance didn‚Äôt kick in until around the 50% mark, and when it did, it was just ‚Äúfine.‚Äù I almost forgot this was a romantasy because the romance felt more like a subplot.  \n  - While I liked the main characters individually, I felt they lacked chemistry. I wished there had been more tension and a ‚Äúwill-they-won‚Äôt-they‚Äù dynamic before they got together.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The side characters were intriguing, and I wanted to learn more about them.  \n  - The main characters were likable but lacked the depth and chemistry needed to make their romance compelling.  \n\n- **World-Building and Genre Appeal:**  \n  - The book is a fun, bloody, new adult romantasy that fans of *Gladiator* and *House of the Dragon* might enjoy.  \n  - Despite its strengths, the second half of the book felt like an afterthought, and it wasn‚Äôt strong enough to make me want to continue with the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe first half of the book was engaging and well-paced, with plenty of action and political intrigue. However, the romance fell flat due to a lack of chemistry and tension between the main characters. The latter half of the book felt rushed and overwhelming, ultimately diminishing my interest in continuing the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5"

            "The antagonists lack depth, resembling cartoon villains with transparent motives. Their scheming is predictable, making it clear that Maeve will easily triumph over them. This simplicity highlights a broader issue in the romantasy genre, where plot often takes a backseat to romance, leading to uninspired and mediocre storytelling.",

Leith and Maeve, both of whom are ‚Äúbrown,‚Äù offer a refreshing contrast to the typical ‚Äúlily white‚Äù characters in the genre. Maeve‚Äôs queer parents further enhance the representation. However, many characters still exhibit traits that feel coded as white in their interactions, and the oppression they experience lacks depth, coming across more as cosplay than as meaningful commentary.",

These themes are introduced intermittently, often appearing more as affirmations of Maeve‚Äôs moral integrity than as subjects of thorough exploration. Additionally, it remains unclear why Maeve, despite her lineage of royal authoritarians, possesses empathy while others in her family do not."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Genre Focus and Balance:**  \n  I would‚Äôve enjoyed this story more if it had leaned more into being a fantasy novel with romance elements rather than a romantasy book. The romance between Leith and Maeve felt unnecessary and lacked chemistry, overshadowing the potential for a stronger fantasy narrative. The plot points connecting them were tenuous, and the story would have been more compelling with a tighter focus on fantasy.\n\n- **Character Diversity and Representation:**  \n  The story stands out for its diverse cast of main characters, who are rarely reduced to stereotypes. Leith and Maeve are both described as ‚Äúbrown,‚Äù a refreshing departure from the typical ‚Äúlily white‚Äù characters in the genre. Maeve‚Äôs queer parents add another layer of representation. However, most characters still feel coded as white in how they navigate their world, and the oppression they face lacks gravity, feeling more like cosplay than meaningful commentary.\n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  The book includes lightly critical commentary on capitalism, neoliberal policies, and anti-immigrant rhetoric. These themes are touched upon sporadically, often seeming to serve as reminders of Maeve‚Äôs moral goodness rather than being deeply explored. It‚Äôs unclear why Maeve, descended from a line of royal authoritarians, developed empathy while others in her bloodline did not.\n\n- **Antagonists and Plot Depth:**  \n  The antagonists are one-dimensional, acting like cartoon villains with transparent intentions. There‚Äôs no mystery or complexity to their scheming, and it‚Äôs obvious Maeve will overcome them. This lack of depth reflects a broader issue in the romantasy genre, where plot concerns often take a backseat to romance, resulting in mediocre and uninspired writing.\n\n- **Genre Critique and Future Trends:**  \n  The book attempts to inject thoughtful and inclusive elements into the romantasy genre, but it doesn‚Äôt fully succeed. While it‚Äôs clear the author aimed to elevate the genre, the execution falls short. I believe romantasy struggles to serve as a vehicle for critical or elevated storytelling, and future attempts may result in even more uneven outcomes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel makes commendable strides in diversity and representation, its focus on romance over fantasy, lack of compelling antagonists, and superficial thematic commentary detract from its potential. The story feels like a missed opportunity to deliver a more profound and engaging fantasy narrative.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her lack of revenge and failure to take decisive action after her family's harm significantly lowered my opinion of her.

The author skillfully depicted his kills, showcasing him as a clever and ruthless fighter rather than simply stating he was a killer. However, my main concern was the insta-love aspect. What was intended to be a slow-burn, marriage-of-convenience romance escalated too quickly, leaving me feeling as though a chapter was missing. The abrupt transition from convenience to deep love felt unrealistic.",

Pursuing a passion outside of nursing takes courage and determination, and I admire her ability to balance both.  \n\n- **World-Building and Fantasy Elements:**  \n  My favorite part of the book was the gladiators concept and the various fantasy species. The world-building had potential, but many elements were mentioned briefly without thorough explanation. I hope future novels in the series will expand on these aspects.  \n\n- **Action Scenes and Character Execution:**  \n  I enjoyed the action scenes, particularly how Leith‚Äôs gladiator character was portrayed. The author didn‚Äôt just tell us he killed people; she described how he did it, making him feel like a smart, clever, and vicious fighter.  \n\n- **Point of View (POV) and Blurb Accuracy:**  \n  The promise of a sole male main character (MMC) POV wasn‚Äôt entirely truthful, as the story is told from dual POVs of the MMC and the female main character (FMC). Additionally, the blurb‚Äôs mention of ‚Äúseize two weapons‚Äù was misleading, as Leith often used 4-5 weapons in battles.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  My biggest issue was the insta-love. The romance was supposed to be a marriage of convenience with a slow-burn, but it escalated so quickly that I felt like my copy was missing a chapter. The sudden shift from convenience to deep love felt unrealistic.  \n\n- **Language and Authenticity:**  \n  While the use of modern language didn‚Äôt bother me, I think avoiding it would have added more authenticity to the fantasy world.  \n\n- **Use of Death in the Story:**  \n  Death was overused as a shock factor rather than being meaningfully integrated into the storyline. Almost everyone dies, which felt excessive. Additionally, the blood oath between Soro and Maeve was confusing‚Äîif Leith killed Soro, why didn‚Äôt Maeve die too?  \n\n- **Potential for Future Books:**  \n  I‚Äôm interested in learning more about Giselle and Caelen‚Äôs story, which the author hinted at for future books. There‚Äôs a lot of potential to expand on the world-building and unresolved plot points in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had strong elements, such as the gladiator concept and well-executed action scenes, but it was hindered by insta-love, overuse of death, and some inconsistencies.

She may have been a Princess, but she was also a healer who cared about her people and felt powerless to do more without the clout to back her up. With her father accused of killing his mother, the Queen, and her uncle in charge, there's not much she can do until she comes of age and can step up as Queen.

In most books, the person participating would get a lot of help from the other main character, almost sailing through without much difficulty or harm. Not in this book.

The romantic relationship between the MMC and FMC took over the narrative but was poorly executed, lacking depth and believability.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The main characters, particularly the MMC and FMC, felt underdeveloped. Their relationship progressed unrealistically, going from strangers to in love within about 70 pages. Secondary characters like Caelen and Giselle were more intriguing, but their potential was wasted as they were sidelined and not given proper closure in the abrupt epilogue.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was superficial and confusing. The story introduced a plethora of fantasy creatures (trolls, elves, mages, wizards, shapeshifters, pixies, etc.) without explaining their powers or the magic system. The timeline and setting were also unclear, with dialogue that felt out of place in the context of royals and gladiators.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing felt unpolished, with Leith‚Äôs inner monologues often using modern slang like ‚Äúhell no‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck yeah,‚Äù which clashed with the story‚Äôs tone. The book read like a first draft that needed significant revision and refinement.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  The story came across as generic and superficial, failing to deliver on its promising premise. The inclusion of too many characters without proper background or development further diluted the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its gladiator and male POV elements, it ultimately fell short due to poor plot development, underdeveloped characters, weak world-building, and an unpolished writing style. The rushed and abrupt ending left many loose ends, making the overall reading experience disappointing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I loved the concept, the world-building, the political intrigue, and the characters/their dynamic.  \n- **Pacing:**  \n  The second half of the book became very slow and lackluster, to the point where I had to force myself to finish. The ending felt rushed and anti-climactic, as if it was brushed over.  \n- **Character Focus:**  \n  The book was advertised as a main male character story, but it turned out to be simply dual POV.  \n- **Plot Development:**  \n  One of the things that kept me going was hope‚Äîhope to see her dad freed and hope to meet Leith's family (I was really looking forward to seeing them meet Maeve). However, they died, and I lost hope. I felt like Maeve grieved more than Leith.  \n- **Missed Opportunities:**  \n  Given the slow plot, it would have been nice to see some of their wedding, which could have added a cute and satisfying element to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started strong with an intriguing concept and well-developed characters, the pacing issues in the second half and the rushed, anti-climactic ending significantly detracted from the overall experience.

I almost didn‚Äôt finish it, but I held on because of how good the beginning was. The pacing improved significantly at the 55% mark, though considering the book is over 500 pages on Kindle, it felt like a lot of reading before it got better.\n\n- **Plot Consistency:**  \n  As a fantasy novel, some elements felt unrealistic, particularly Leith‚Äôs actions in the fights as a mortal. One moment he was half-dead, and the next day he was ready for battle, which seemed outrageous. Additionally, I found it confusing to track the time lapses between battles, which disrupted my immersion in the story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the pacing issues and some inconsistencies, I still liked the book and will keep it on my shelves as a trophy. It holds sentimental value for me, especially since I had been waiting for its release for over a year, which likely contributed to my high expectations and the buildup I felt.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a strong start and eventually picked up again, the slow middle section and some unrealistic elements in the plot made it a challenging read at times. However, my overall enjoyment and attachment to the story led me to appreciate it in the end.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The obstacles keeping them apart are numerous and complex, yet they manage to find each other and fall deeply and quickly in love.  \n\n- **World-Building and Unique Elements:**  \n  The gladiator aspect of the story, combined with the inclusion of mythical creatures, sets this book apart from other romance novels I‚Äôve read. These elements added a unique flavor to the narrative.  \n\n- **Interest in Sequel:**  \n  I would consider picking up the sequel, but my decision would depend on which characters it focuses on.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book surprised me with its unique blend of forbidden romance, gladiator themes, and mythical creatures. While I enjoyed the standout elements and the intense connection between Maeve and Leith, I‚Äôm left uncertain about the story‚Äôs direction and whether I‚Äôd continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Both stories feature elves as rulers who look down on humans, a human male protagonist falling in love with an elf female protagonist, and a deadly contest to be with her. Initially, I didn‚Äôt enjoy this book as much because of the similarities, and I felt *A Kiss of Daggers* had a better story.  \n\n- **Writing Quality and Grammar:**  \n  There were some weird grammar errors in the first part of the book that pulled me out of the story. This made it harder to engage with the narrative early on.  \n\n- **Character Development and Romance:**  \n  Around page 180, I started to really enjoy the book. I loved the romance between Leith and Maeve. Their relationship is built on mutual respect, which I found refreshing and compelling.  \n\n- **Action and World-Building:**  \n  The gladiator games were a highlight for me. The battles were written exceptionally well and were very engaging. However, I had several unanswered questions about the world and its mechanics. For example:  \n  - Why hasn‚Äôt Leith earned a single tattoo despite fighting for a while before the book starts?  \n  - How did Leith meet Sullivan, and what were the qualifications to enter the arena?  \n  - How does the magic system work? For instance, if the wizard was dead, why did the beast still move? Shouldn‚Äôt a magic construct disappear when its creator dies?  \n  - How did Giselle get her affliction?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial reservations and some unanswered questions, I ended up really enjoying the book.

It lacked the depth and maturity needed to engage the reader.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I didn‚Äôt feel immersed in the fantasy world or understand how it functioned. The setting felt underdeveloped and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were poorly written. Maeve came across as meek and naive, but her sudden transformation into a warrior felt forced and inconsistent. There wasn‚Äôt enough development for the \"shocking\" deaths to have any emotional impact.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was undeveloped and relied heavily on insta-love, which I find unbelievable. The sex scenes were cringy and lacked authenticity.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  The novel felt incomplete and unpolished. It seemed rushed to publication, likely to capitalize on the romantasy trend, rather than being a well-crafted story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a major disappointment. From the juvenile writing and weak world-building to the poorly developed characters and cringy romance, it fell short in almost every aspect. The beautiful book design was the only redeeming feature, but it couldn‚Äôt save the lackluster content.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5/5"

It felt original, exciting, and like it had the potential to go somewhere intriguing.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  By the time I reached around 70% of the book, I was confused about why it hadn‚Äôt wrapped up yet. The pacing felt disjointed, especially with the multiple perspectives. Major events would happen in one POV, end on a cliffhanger, and then when the story returned to that POV, it would be days later, taking half the chapter to address what had happened. This approach completely took me out of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  Many big players were introduced, but they weren‚Äôt very likable‚Äînot because they had bad characteristics, but because they were vaguely introduced and thrown into the story without enough depth. As a result, I didn‚Äôt care about them, and when something happened to them, I was bored. Even the main characters seemed indifferent, caring more about dead lemurs than dead family members, which left me confused.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n  The writing felt repetitive, with the author seemingly more invested in the animals than the human characters. There was a lot of telling rather than showing, which made the narrative less engaging. Additionally, the inclusion of spice (romantic/sexual content) often felt cringe-worthy, leading me to skip past those scenes.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I really wanted to love this book, but it just wasn‚Äôt for me. The execution fell short of the promising premise, and I struggled to stay engaged with the story and characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an exciting and original premise, its disjointed pacing, underdeveloped characters, repetitive writing, and lack of emotional depth made it a disappointing read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.25 ‚≠êÔ∏è"

While the beginning had promise, around the midpoint, I found myself getting bored and just wanting the book to wrap up.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  In the first half, I was invested in the romance as the main characters built a friendship and got to know each other gradually. However, halfway through, the story rushed into a smutty scene, and suddenly the characters were madly in love and willing to sacrifice everything. This abrupt shift felt forced and jarring, as if it was an attempt to satisfy the booktok crowd rather than letting the romance develop naturally.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building fell flat. The story dropped us into the action with an opening fight scene, but there was no real explanation of how the gladiators operate, how one becomes a Bloodguard, or what it truly means to be one. The potential for a deeper dive into the politics of the world was there, but it only scratched the surface. The lack of detail left me frustrated and distracted, especially since the romance wasn‚Äôt gripping enough to compensate.  \n\n- **Editing:**  \n  The book needed a few more rounds of editing to refine the romance, pacing, and world-building. It‚Äôs surprising, given that the publication date was pushed back four times. I‚Äôm confused as to what the publishers were doing with the extra 10 months they had with this book.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The narration of the audiobook didn‚Äôt help. The male narrator deepened his voice to the point of mumbling, making it hard to follow. While I‚Äôve enjoyed this narrator in other works, here, I couldn‚Äôt get into it.

It was also billed as a romatasy, which is a personal favorite genre of mine. However, the execution fell short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The book reads like it was written by a 16-year-old boy. The writing felt abrupt, with scene shifts and changes within scenes happening too quickly. It seemed like there was too much going on, and I struggled to determine the actual goal of the characters for most of the book. While everything did come together in the end, the journey was confusing and disjointed.  \n\n- **Tone and Content:**  \n  Parts of the story were overly explicit, which felt unnecessary and immature, akin to a teenager swearing or being crude just for the sake of it. This detracted from the overall experience and made it hard for me to fully enjoy the book.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narration was another issue. The male narrator had a very guttural voice, which was consistent for every word spoken, not just for specific characters. This forced me to slow down from my typical listening speed, making the female narration sound too slow. Attempting to switch speeds with different points of view was too much effort and disrupted the flow of listening.  \n\n- **Personal Disappointment:**  \n  I was really bummed because I wanted to love this book and have it as a beautiful addition to my shelf. However, I can‚Äôt justify buying a book I disliked this much.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its promising elements and genre, the book failed to meet my expectations due to its immature writing style, disjointed pacing, overly explicit content, and subpar narration.

The gladiator scenes were particularly captivating and immersive.\n\n- **Character Development (Maeve):**  \n  Maeve's character was problematic for me. Her innocence felt overdone, especially her unwavering belief that her \"uncle\" was a good person, which seemed unrealistic.\n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance felt rushed and unconvincing. The sudden declaration of love between characters who barely knew each other lacked depth and believability.\n\n- **Publishing and Edition Concerns:**  \n  The publishing company‚Äôs strategy of releasing special editions created a sense of urgency and anxiety, especially for those who missed out on earlier editions of other books like *Fourth Wing*. This added an unnecessary layer of stress to the reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started strong with engaging scenes and a visually appealing presentation, it fell short in character development and the execution of the romance subplot. Maeve‚Äôs naivety and the rushed romance detracted from the overall enjoyment. Additionally, the publishing strategy added an unwelcome layer of pressure.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars"

In fact, I wished there was less romance in the book, which is rare for me.  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel had potential for strong world-building, particularly with the intriguing gladiator plot. However, this aspect was overshadowed by the poorly executed romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was a letdown. The lack of chemistry in the romance and the missed opportunity to fully develop the world-building left me unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I had high expectations for this book based on the description, which promised a plot-driven, enemies-to-lovers, marriage-of-convenience story in a high fantasy setting. However, the book fell far short of these expectations.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  The romance felt shallow and unconvincing. It was based on insta-lust/love, with the male lead supposedly loving the female lead because she‚Äôs ‚Äúhot and generous,‚Äù and her loving him because he‚Äôs ‚Äúgood, kind, and strong.‚Äù There were no deeper reasons for their connection, making it boring and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**  \n  The plot was extremely slow, with only one twist that, while shocking, had no meaningful impact on the story or the main character‚Äôs emotional journey. This made the twist feel pointless and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Action Scenes:**  \n  The fight scenes were underwhelming, especially for a story centered around a gladiator. They lacked excitement and failed to engage me.  \n\n- **Subplots:**  \n  Subplots like the Phoenix and a murder mystery felt random and unnecessary. They didn‚Äôt add to the story and left me wondering why they were included at all.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was subpar. I struggled to understand certain elements, like Maeve‚Äôs magic monkey that understands English. Additionally, the use of modern phrases like ‚Äúeye-fucking,‚Äù ‚Äúclout,‚Äù ‚Äúok,‚Äù ‚Äúmotley crew,‚Äù and ‚Äúdoped up‚Äù broke the immersion of the ancient fantasy setting.  \n\n- **Character Introduction:**  \n  The author did a poor job of introducing Maeve‚Äôs two dads. It took me a while to realize that ‚ÄúPapa‚Äù and ‚ÄúFather‚Äù were separate characters, as this wasn‚Äôt clearly established.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a disappointment. While the premise was intriguing and there was one surprising twist, the shallow romance, slow plot, weak world-building, and unnecessary subplots made it a frustrating read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (generously given for the interesting premise and one twist)."

The writing was overly simplistic, the tone was exaggerated and comical, and the content, particularly the sex scene, was poorly executed. I cannot recommend this book to anyone.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned, but the tone of the review suggests a very low rating, likely 1/5 or 2/5."

The pacing felt off, and I finally decided to DNF it at 56%.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  No actual time was devoted to the development of the relationship between the MMC and FMC.

Maybe I wasn‚Äôt reading carefully enough because I didn‚Äôt care, but it seemed poorly explained to me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell flat for me due to its lack of engagement, poor pacing, underdeveloped relationships, and plot inconsistencies.
