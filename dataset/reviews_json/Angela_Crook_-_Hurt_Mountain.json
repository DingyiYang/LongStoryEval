For example, Delilah mentions to Brandon that others on the mountain are involved in the same child-kidnapping scheme and the creation of Families. Yet, aside from a brief mention of someone burning down the main house, this plot thread is never revisited. Was there an investigation? Did it link to other missing children cases? Were the missing children or Families ever found?",
            "I found Jacob's character confusing. Was he Delilah’s brother? If he was under Father’s control, why did he have the freedom to come and go, especially after Carly's death when he seemed to visit less frequently? Could he be from one of the other Families?"

I would have rated it higher if it hadn’t randomly switched to a supernatural/paranormal theme toward the end. If I had known that was coming, I wouldn’t have read it at all.  \n\n- **Plot Consistency and Resolution:**  \n  The book left some questions unanswered. For instance, Delilah told Brandon that there were other people in the mountain with the same arrangement of kidnapping children and starting these \"Families.\" However, other than mentioning that someone burned down the main house and they couldn’t find out who, it’s never addressed again. Was it investigated? Did it connect to any other missing children cases? Did they find the missing children or the \"Families\"?  \n\n- **Character Development and Clarity:**  \n  I didn’t understand Jacob at all. Was he Delilah’s brother? If he was subject to Father, why was he able to come and go freely, to the point where he didn’t come around as often after Carly was killed? Was he from one of those other Families?  \n\n- **Supernatural Element Integration:**  \n  The supernatural twist toward the end felt confusing and out of place. For example, I didn’t understand why Brandon burned down the Teaching Room. Wasn’t it evidence? This part of the story became weird and unclear, and I may have missed some details due to the confusion.  \n\n- **Ending Satisfaction:**  \n  The missing pieces and unresolved questions left me feeling unsatisfied when the book ended.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had moments of intensity and emotional impact, the sudden shift to a supernatural theme and the lack of resolution for key plot points and character motivations left me feeling confused and unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The novel intricately weaves a mystery within a mystery through compelling yet predictable storytelling. It meets the conventions of a dark thriller, featuring tormented characters, a semi-rural setting, foreshadowing, and eerie parallels between missing persons cases. The plot-driven narrative kept me engaged, particularly with the tension surrounding Jane Doe’s sudden appearance and the dark secrets of her past. While there are no significant twists, the author expertly manages pacing to sustain my interest and propel the story forward, ensuring I kept turning the pages despite the absence of major surprises.",
            "The characters in this story are largely unlikable. Dr. Olivia Blake, the female main character, cries excessively, while Brandon, the male lead, cheats on his fiancée. The parents and neighbors are unsupportive, and the hospital staff come across as bland and inexplicably insensitive. One character's motivation to sabotage Olivia remains unclear. However, the best friend and the fiancée stand out, with the latter being particularly impressive. The novel would have benefited from more character development and a reduction in excessive emotional displays, such as crying.",
            "This novel is not a light read, given its references to violence. However, it appeals to those seeking an engaging, plot-driven story—perfect for a casual read on a rainy Sunday afternoon."

        "conclusion": "*Hurt Mountain* is a dark thriller with a predictable yet engaging plot that keeps readers hooked through effective pacing. However, the unlikable and underdeveloped characters detract from the overall experience. While the novel delivers on the expected elements of the genre, it falls short in character depth and emotional resonance. It’s a decent choice for readers seeking an undemanding, plot-driven story, but it lacks the complexity and nuance to leave a lasting impression.",

However, the pacing slows in the middle as Olivia's incessant crying, whining, and fainting become tiresome. The resolution comes in a dramatic showdown, yet several elements remain unresolved, particularly regarding the family and the origins of the events in the forest, leaving me unsatisfied. While I didn't dislike the book, I wished the author had prioritized the mystery over the characters' immature behaviors. The ending felt rushed, and the lack of closure on key plot points was disappointing.",

Olivia's obsession with Jane Doe leads her to make hysterical choices that can be frustrating to follow. Similarly, Brandon, a former cop, also makes questionable decisions that seem inconsistent with his background. While both characters exhibit lingering feelings for each other, their actions often come across as immature and unrealistic. In contrast, Jane Doe displays greater strength and intelligence than the main characters, though Brandon and Olivia find some redemption by the end.",

While the premise was intriguing, it didn't fully align with my personal preferences.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book is well-written and intense, with a narrative that keeps the reader engaged. The chapters are incredibly short, which makes for a fast-paced reading experience.  \n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters are well-developed and easy to keep track of, which adds to the clarity and flow of the story.  \n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  While the story is good and an interesting read, it wasn't something I would typically choose or pull off a shelf. It didn't quite match my idea of reading entertainment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book is decent and well-crafted, but it didn't resonate with me personally. It might appeal more to readers who enjoy intense, fast-paced narratives with a focus on family and mystery.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Dark, emotional, and tense, this story ultimately falls short. The romance between the female and male leads is poorly executed; their rekindling feels rushed and uninspired, despite lingering unresolved feelings. The MMC’s fiancée, initially portrayed as kind and understanding, abruptly ends their relationship in a contrived manner that adds little to the narrative. While the crime-solving aspect is intriguing, the pacing and revelations often rely more on exposition than on engaging storytelling, which diminishes their impact. Additionally, the lack of character growth and flat dynamics render the overall experience dull, despite the promising premise.",

Although her struggles elicited some pity, her immature actions made it difficult to support her. Similarly, the male main character (MMC) showed little growth, and his romantic subplot felt underdeveloped and unnecessary."

The painful yet empathetic portrayal of characters grappling with grief, loss, assault, abuse, and trauma makes it compelling.  \n\n- **Religious Themes**  \n   - While religious trauma is a significant theme, the continued emphasis on religion at the end felt unnecessary and could have been omitted without affecting the story.  \n\n- **Character Development**  \n   - Brandon’s growth through therapy is admirable, but Olivia’s refusal to seek therapy despite her evident struggles is frustrating. Her displacement of grief onto Delilah and her delayed acknowledgment of needing help for herself were notable flaws in her character arc.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation**  \n   - Despite some critiques, the book is highly recommended as a gripping thriller that effectively pulls readers out of a slump.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis thriller is a compelling read, especially for those interested in cults and second-chance relationships. While it handles heavy themes with empathy, the unnecessary emphasis on religion and Olivia’s lack of personal growth are minor drawbacks. Overall, it’s an engaging and emotionally impactful story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5 stars"

            "The story captivates with its quirky elements and intriguing mystery, primarily driven by the main victim's inability to reveal crucial information. The resolution comes just in time to avert another tragedy, a familiar trope in such narratives. However, the victim's disability remains unexplained, beginning with vague hints and later shifting to detailed discussions about abstract concepts and past experiences. The ending feels rushed, wrapping up too quickly in just a few pages, and the climax could have benefited from more suspense. Despite these issues, the story is easy to follow, with character arcs developed in a clear chronological and contextual manner. The narrative flows smoothly without disjointed time jumps, making it an enjoyable read even when fatigued. Nonetheless, structural flaws, such as the hurried conclusion and some implausible elements, detract from the overall quality.",
            "In this story, the protagonist, Olivia, comes across as an improbable character. While she is portrayed as an intelligent career woman, her questionable mental stability, emotional volatility, and history of alcohol abuse undermine her credibility. Additionally, the introduction of supporting characters only after their deaths feels like a missed opportunity for deeper development and richer storytelling."

However, I expected more of a mystery/suspense focus based on the summary, but this aspect seemed to take a backseat to Olivia and Brandon’s storylines for much of the book. The inclusion of supernatural elements felt out of place and created an odd mash-up of genres that didn’t quite work for me.  \n\n- **Content and Trigger Warnings:**  \n  I wish I had been more aware of the trigger warnings before reading this book, as I would not have chosen it otherwise. The book includes heavy themes such as child abuse, child sexual abuse, and religious cults, which were difficult to navigate.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and Lake Union Publishing for providing me with the opportunity to read this digital ARC in exchange for my honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story had potential, the shift away from the promised mystery/suspense focus and the inclusion of jarring supernatural elements left me disappointed.

It successfully delivered what a thriller should do, maintaining my interest throughout.  \n- **Character Development:** I appreciated the character development, which added depth to the story and made the characters feel more real.  \n- **Plot and Twists:** There were some new and interesting ideas and twists that kept the story engaging and unpredictable.  \n- **Pacing Gaps:** However, there were uncomfortable gaps in time where a character was left alone for seemingly weeks at a time. These periods lacked development or consideration, making it feel like more should have happened during those stretches.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a compelling and engaging thriller with strong character development and intriguing twists. While the pacing gaps were noticeable, they didn’t detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

However, the pacing improved significantly afterward, and the story became much more gripping and fast-paced.  \n- **Engagement:**  \n  Once the story picked up speed, it became a book I couldn’t put down. The latter part of the book was highly engaging and kept me hooked.  \n- **Length:**  \n  The book is relatively short, which helped mitigate the slower start, as the 35% mark came quickly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a very good book with a strong and engaging second half. While the slower start prevented me from giving it a perfect score, the latter part of the story more than made up for it, making it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI would have loved to give it 5 stars, but due to the slow start, I couldn’t.
