            "The first 60% of the book dragged, largely consisting of characters meandering around the train and engaging in dialogue. Although there was a subplot involving Elena, it fell flat and didn’t capture my attention. The narrative finally gained some momentum around the 60% mark, but it still felt disjointed and failed to keep me engaged. While I wasn’t completely invested, I found the ending unique and fitting given the preceding events.",

However, it ended up being disappointing and didn’t live up to my expectations.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The first 60% of the book felt slow and uneventful, with characters mostly walking around the train and talking. While there’s a subplot involving Elena, it was anticlimactic and failed to engage me. The story only picked up some action around the 60% mark, but even then, it felt disjointed and didn’t hold my interest.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were one-dimensional, and I never felt like I got to know them or cared about their fates. This lack of depth made it hard for me to connect with the story.  \n\n- **Premise and Potential:**  \n  The premise of a dangerous train journey through the magical wastelands of Siberia is fantastic and had so much potential. If the story had more “oomph” and better execution, it could have been phenomenal.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  While I wasn’t fully invested in the story, I didn’t hate the ending. It felt unique and appropriate given the events leading up to it.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  Despite my disappointment with this book, I’d be willing to try another book by Sarah Brooks in the future. She clearly has a talent for crafting intriguing premises.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong premise and a decent ending, its slow pacing, lack of character depth, and overall flat execution made it a disappointing read for me. However, I recognize the author’s potential and would be open to reading more of her work in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75 stars, rounded up."

            "The novel employs a multi-view narrative—a technique I'm not usually fond of—but it largely succeeds here. Beginning with an excerpt from *The Wasteland*, the story unfolds through three limited perspectives: Marya Antonovna Fyodorova, WeiWei, and Henry Grey. Set on the Great Trans-Siberia Train journeying from Beijing to Moscow, it traverses the enigmatic Wastelands of Greater Siberia. While the historical context of these Wastelands remains ambiguous, this only heightens the intrigue. However, the final quarter of the book shifts from subtlety to overt allegory, rushing toward a conclusion that feels unsatisfying. The author shines in creating a richly atmospheric setting, with a slow yet engaging pace that gradually intensifies the tension. The story's ambiguous strangeness keeps readers uncertain whether it leans toward horror or weird fiction, enhancing the sense of anticipation throughout.",
            "The main characters are compelling and well-developed: Marya embarks on a quest for the truth behind her father's death, WeiWei, born on a train, navigates her unique heritage as a sixteen-year-old, and Henry Grey, a disgraced scientist, seeks redemption. While the side characters are sketched briefly, they add depth to the narrative. Notably, the Countess and her maid, Vera, deliver delightful comic relief.",
            "The author, much like a visual artist, beautifully wields language to create vivid and evocative imagery. Although the writing can become somewhat heavy-handed in the latter sections of the book, this flaw is largely forgivable given the overall impact of the narrative.",
            "The novel delves into themes of truth, perception, and the unknown, especially through the Wastelands sickness and the characters' journeys. However, the allegory becomes overly explicit in the final quarter, diminishing the subtlety established earlier."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This novel delivered exactly what I wanted, with a plot reminiscent of *Annihilation*. Despite my usual aversion to multi-view narratives, the structure worked well here. The atmospheric writing, intriguing characters, and slow-building tension kept me engaged, though the heavy-handed allegory and rushed ending in the final quarter were less satisfying. Overall, it was a compelling read with a few minor flaws.",

The framing device of an opening from *The Wasteland* book is followed by three limited-person perspectives: Marya Antonovna Fyodorova, WeiWei, and Henry Grey.  \n  - The story is set on the Great Trans-Siberia Train from Beijing to Moscow, traveling through the Wastelands of Greater Siberia. The historical context of the Wastelands is unclear, but it adds to the intrigue.  \n  - The last quarter of the book abandons subtlety for obvious allegory and a hasty wrap-up, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The main characters are well-drawn: Marya seeks answers about her father’s death, WeiWei is a sixteen-year-old born on the train, and Henry Grey is a disgraced scientist seeking redemption.  \n  - The side characters, though briefly drawn, are interesting and serve their roles well. For example, the Countess and her maid, Vera, provide amusing comic relief.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Pacing:**  \n  - The author, Brooks, excels at building atmosphere. The pacing is slow but enjoyable, with a gradual escalation of tension.  \n  - The ambivalent strangeness kept me guessing whether the story was leaning toward horror or weird fiction, which added to my anticipation.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - Brooks writes like a visual artist who loves language, creating vivid and evocative descriptions.  \n  - Occasionally, the writing becomes heavy-handed, especially in the latter part of the book, but I found it overall forgivable.  \n\n- **Themes and Allegory:**  \n  - The novel explores themes of truth, perception, and the unknown, particularly through the Wastelands sickness and the characters’ journeys.  \n  - The allegory becomes too obvious in the final quarter, which detracts from the earlier subtlety.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivered exactly what I wanted, with a plot reminiscent of *Annihilation*.

However, they ultimately come across as one-dimensional, lacking depth and connection. Their cultural backgrounds are underdeveloped, leaving me unable to fully engage with them. Although the concept of a linguistic blend between Russian and Chinese is intriguing, it isn’t explored effectively within the narrative.

The narrative focuses on the first journey since a dangerous incident forced operations to halt, with the Trans-Siberia Company shrouding all details in secrecy. However, the world-building did not quite meet my expectations; it felt more like magical realism than true fantasy.

The writing is dense but engrossing, blending historical fantasy, science fiction, and horror. The narrative orbits primarily around WeiWei, whose relationship with the Wastelands is central to the story.\n\n- **Horror:**  \n  The book carries a persistent sense of unease and foreboding, starting around the first third and lasting throughout. While the descriptions are more haunting than gruesome, elements like bugs, tendrils, and predator/prey observations contribute to the eerie atmosphere. The horror aspect is understated but effective, making it a surprising yet integral part of the story.\n\n- **Setting (The Train + The Wastelands):**  \n  The train and the Wastelands are essentially characters themselves, with the train’s pulse likened to a heartbeat and the Wastelands’ connections compared to veins. The setting is essential to the story, creating a living, breathing environment that feels both dangerous and unknowable. The comparison to *Piranesi* is apt in terms of the setting’s significance, though the language and plot differ.\n\n- **Audiobook Adaptation:**  \n  The audiobook features two narrators (male and female) who voice their respective characters even during the other narrator’s POV chapters. While the female narrator’s performance can feel a bit rote, especially for Marya, the overall adaptation is decent and enhances the experience of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of historical fantasy, science fiction, and horror, with a richly developed setting and a haunting atmosphere.

            "The story tracks three POV characters journeying from Beijing to Moscow on the eve of the 20th century and a universal exhibition. While the premise is intriguing, I found the plot to be rather dull and predictable. The character roles and narrative direction felt clichéd, which dampened my engagement with the story.",
            "The characters exhibit distinct motivations, yet some actions appear inconsistent with the perilous environment. For instance, Weiwei becomes friends with Elena, the castaway, even as she grows aware of the latter's true nature. Additionally, crew members accept bribes to open the train and later allow others to re-enter, which contradicts the established fear of contagion.",
            "The writing is commendable, showcasing a vibrant and intricately crafted fantasy world. Set in an alternate Trans-Siberian landscape, the novel explores a wasteland of Siberia teeming with peculiar magic.",
            "The novel features unexpected thematic parallels with another 2024 release, *Alien Clay*, yet it explores these themes through a distinct lens and sensibility. While I favored *Alien Clay*, I found this novel to be more accessible and enjoyable to read.",
            "This novel stands out in a genre often overwhelmed by exaggerated romantic fantasies, offering a refreshing departure from the norm. While I believe that subtle romantic or sexual undertones could have enhanced the characters' motivations, the story remains romantic in its breathtaking scenery, atmosphere, and grandeur. Though marketed as adult fantasy, it possesses significant crossover appeal with YA fantasy, evoking a style reminiscent of Frances Hardinge. The dynamics between the two main characters—a teen and a young woman in her early twenties—along with the straightforward plot, contribute to this youthful appeal."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a well-written debut novel with a vivid world and intriguing premise. While I found the plot predictable and some character actions inconsistent, the novel’s refreshing lack of romantic tropes and its crossover appeal to YA readers are strengths. The audiobook narration had its highs and lows, but the story itself is worth exploring. I’m rounding up my 3.5-star rating to 4 stars and will keep an eye out for the author’s future works.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing is objectively good, with a vibrant and well-defined fantasy world. The novel is set in an alternate trans-Siberian world where Siberia is a wasteland filled with strange magic.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The story follows three POV characters traveling from Beijing to Moscow on the eve of the 20th century and a universal exhibition. While the premise is intriguing, I found the plot somewhat boring and predictable. The roles of the characters and the direction of the story felt too familiar, which made it less engaging for me.  \n\n- **Character Motivations and Consistency:**  \n  The characters have distinct motivations, but some of their actions felt contradictory to the dangerous setting. For example, Weiwei befriending Elena the castaway despite the growing awareness of her true nature, or crew members being bribed to open the train and later allowing people back in, seemed inconsistent with the established fear of contagion.  \n\n- **Themes and Comparisons:**  \n  The novel shares surprising thematic similarities with another 2024 book, *Alien Clay*, though it approaches these themes from a completely different perspective and sensibility. While I preferred *Alien Clay*, this novel is easier and more pleasant to read.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The novel is not a romantic fantasy, which is refreshing in a genre saturated with over-the-top romantasy. However, I felt that some romantic or sexual undertones could have added depth to the characters' motivations. That said, the story is romantic in the sense of its impressive scenery, mood, and grandeur.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Style:**  \n  While marketed as an adult fantasy, the novel has a lot of crossover appeal with YA fantasy, reminiscent of Frances Hardinge’s style. The two main characters—a teen and a young woman in her early 20s—along with the straightforward plot and concepts, contribute to this YA feel.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  I listened to the audiobook narrated by Katie Leung and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith. While Kobna’s narration of the guidebook quotes at the beginning of chapters was excellent, his role was limited. Katie Leung narrated the three POVs beautifully, with distinct accents and character differentiation. However, her staccato and hurried delivery during descriptive passages made it difficult for me to follow crucial details. I recommend either reading the print version or listening to a full sample before committing to the audiobook.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a well-written debut novel with a vivid world and intriguing premise. While I found the plot predictable and some character actions inconsistent, the novel’s refreshing lack of romantic tropes and its crossover appeal to YA readers are strengths. The audiobook narration had its highs and lows, but the story itself is worth exploring. I’m rounding up my 3.5-star rating to 4 stars and will keep an eye out for the author’s future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded up to 4 stars)."

The Wasteland itself was a missed opportunity, as so much more could have been expanded upon to make it more immersive and impactful.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The main characters—Marya, Weiwei, and Henry Gray—had potential, but their development and interactions fell short.

Henry Gray was particularly underwhelming; he felt like an unnecessary main character who added little to the narrative. I wish The Professor had been given a more central role instead.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot had moments where it seemed like it could become something special, but these were fleeting.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Premise:**  \n  The book is a mix of genres, primarily steampunk fantasy with some sci-fi elements. The premise is unique, and I particularly loved the setting of a train journeying through a mysterious land. The wastelands evoked strong similarities to Area X from Jeff VanderMeer’s *Annihilation*.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  Unfortunately, the book was quite boring for the most part, with only a slight improvement in the second half. The story lacked dynamism, which made it difficult to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The story features a variety of people, with a focus on three main characters. However, these characters felt flat, and I couldn’t connect with or invest in their journeys.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has an intriguing premise and a unique setting, its slow pacing, lack of dynamic storytelling, and underdeveloped characters made it a less engaging read overall. It’s not a bad story, but it didn’t fully capture my interest.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The absence of a clear resolution or explanation for the Wastelands’ mysteries may frustrate some, though this ambiguity appears intentional.",

The atmosphere evokes a sense of wonder akin to works like *The Night Circus* by Erin Morgenstern. The author's meticulous worldbuilding is a standout feature, effectively crafting the train’s history, an intriguing fictional travel guide, and the haunting ambiance of the Wastelands.

She incorporates the concept of a \"green apocalypse,\" where wildlife and nature grow wild, with evocative and unnerving descriptions of the wastelands. The layer of cosmic horror surrounding these forms of life becomes increasingly unsettling as the story progresses. One particularly memorable scene involves the train being followed by \"trains,\" which was genuinely eerie.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narration by Katie Leung was outstanding. I was only familiar with her as Cho Chang from the Harry Potter movies, but her performance here was impressive. She skillfully handled voices, accents, and emotional tone, which is crucial for audiobooks. Her voice is well-suited for narration, and her ability to convey emotion elevated the listening experience.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Impact:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and found its world and story thought-provoking.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The premise of a magical wasteland in Siberia and a sophisticated steam train that doesn’t need to stop for fuel or water is intriguing.  \n  - However, the world is described in vague terms, lacking vivid imagery or depth to make it feel alive and immersive.  \n  - Examples like the ruins of an old train covered in magical creatures (described as thousands of pink crabs) are mentioned but not explored in detail.  \n  - The steampunk elements, such as the train’s complex network of pipes and recovery systems, are underdeveloped and fail to enhance the world’s believability.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters are not compelling or interesting.  \n  - The narrative spends too much time on their internal thoughts, which detracts from the potential of the story.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  - The plot loses momentum and becomes unengaging, particularly when it focuses on technical details like the train’s water recovery systems.  \n  - The lack of a strong, driving narrative makes it difficult to stay invested in the story.  \n\n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n  - The book fails to meet the expectations of its genre, particularly in terms of creating a vivid, immersive world.  \n  - The steampunk and magical elements are not sufficiently explored or described to make the world feel real or captivating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel has a promising premise with its magical wasteland and advanced steam train, but it falls short in execution. The world-building is vague and underdeveloped, the characters are uninteresting, and the plot lacks momentum. The book fails to deliver the immersive experience expected from its genre, making it a disappointing read despite its potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

The book is description-heavy, with meticulous details about the train, setting, and characters, which immerses the reader in the world. The lack of heavy dialogue is handled successfully, adding to the atmospheric nature of the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The novel features a large cast of characters, but Sarah focuses on a handful to provide depth and focus. Marya, a woman in mourning, stands out as the dominant character with a compelling story. Henry Grey, a naturalist seeking redemption, is intriguing but can come across as blasé and rude.

Each character has a fascinating background and purpose.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The Wastelands are a central element, almost becoming a character themselves. The fear and mystery surrounding them are subtly woven into the narrative, creating suspense without explicit horror. Snippets from the \"Cautious Travellers Guide to the Wastelands\" enhance the world-building, though some readers might desire more early details about the Wastelands themselves.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book strikes a perfect balance in length (380 pages), neither too long nor too short. The story unfolds gradually, with action and adventure emerging after the halfway point. This pacing allows for rich character development and scene-setting, though some readers might prefer a quicker start to the action.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The novel blends historical fiction, fantasy, adventure, thriller, mystery, horror, and a hint of romance. It defies easy categorization, offering a unique reading experience that is more than just a basic plot or storyline.\n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  The book is highly engaging and difficult to put down. The immersive descriptions and suspenseful atmosphere keep the reader hooked, often leading to late-night reading sessions. Despite occasional confusion about the plot, the overall experience is captivating and memorable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel by Sarah is a masterfully crafted, atmospheric, and immersive story that defies genre conventions. With rich character development, meticulous world-building, and a suspenseful narrative, it offers a unique and unforgettable reading experience. While some readers might desire more early details about the Wastelands or a quicker start to the action, the book’s strengths far outweigh these minor critiques.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5-5 stars."

However, the second half accelerates dramatically as events unfold and truths are revealed. Both segments are satisfying: the first half captivates with its character exploration, while the second half provides a rewarding payoff.",

Each character is multi-dimensional, complete with their own loyalties, goals, aspirations, and unique backstories, which makes them engaging to follow. The exploration of their connections to the train and the wastelands adds depth to the narrative.

Although I appreciate platonic relationships in literature, this dynamic felt as if it carried the weight of something more.",
            "The treatment of languages stood out as a minor drawback. While all languages, including the fictional Railhua, were translated into English for accessibility, this diminished the story's authenticity. Incorporating examples of Railhua or other languages would have added richness. Furthermore, the historical context of the wastelands was somewhat vague, though the backstory of the train and the nations' responses to the wastelands were well-developed.",

The richly detailed setting blends diverse cultures, wastelands, and intricate train mechanics seamlessly. The author’s incorporation of Asian mythology, where nature and the supernatural intertwine, adds depth and authenticity to the narrative."

It leans into the steampunk genre without overdoing it, which I appreciated. The world is richly detailed, and the mix of cultures, the wastelands, and the train's mechanics were executed very well. The author’s integration of Asian mythology, where nature and the supernatural are one, added depth and authenticity to the world.\n\n- **Characters:**\n  - The characters are intriguing and well-developed. They are a diverse mix, with some intentionally insufferable, others mysterious, but all felt whole and multi-dimensional. Each character had their own loyalties, goals, aspirations, and unique backstories, which made them engaging to follow. The exploration of their connections to the train and the wastelands was particularly compelling.\n\n- **Relationships:**\n  - While there is no romance, there is a strong platonic friendship between Weiwei and another character. However, the dynamic felt more like a sapphic romance that was later adjusted to be a friendship. While I appreciate platonic relationships in books, this one seemed to carry undertones of something more.\n\n- **Pacing:**\n  - The pacing is slower than average, especially in the first half, which focuses on character development and world exploration. The second half picks up dramatically as events unfold and truths are revealed. Both halves were satisfying, with the first half keeping me engaged through the characters and the second half delivering a rewarding payoff.\n\n- **Language and History:**\n  - The handling of languages was a minor downside. All languages, including the fictional Railhua, were translated into English, which made the story accessible but took away some authenticity. I would have liked to see examples of Railhua or other languages to add flavor. Additionally, the history of the wastelands was somewhat unclear, though the history of the train and the countries’ reactions to the wastelands were well-explored.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this is an incredibly strong debut novel with a unique story, rich worldbuilding, and well-crafted characters. Despite minor issues with language handling and historical clarity, I highly recommend it, especially for fans of steampunk and intricate storytelling.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

The first part explores the daily life aboard the train and delves into the personal stories of its travelers, slowly gaining momentum as the narrative progresses. This story transcends a mere investigation of a supposed suicide or a groundbreaking scientific discovery; it's ultimately about deciphering the world's hidden language.",
            "The story unfolds through three primary perspectives:  \n1. **Marija Petrovna:** A young widow, she adopts a false identity to uncover the truth behind a tragic incident involving her late husband and family.  \n2. **Henry Grey:** A disgraced naturalist on a quest for redemption, he pursues a groundbreaking discovery, heedless of the associated dangers.  \n3. **Weiwei Zhang:** Known as the \"daughter of the train,\" she possesses a unique bond with the train on which she was born and raised.  \n\nAdditionally, there’s Elena, a stowaway intimately connected to the desolate lands, driven to discover the source of her homeland's tremors.",

The mysterious illness is characterized by unknown origins and symptoms that induce a trance-like state, ultimately leading to madness and death. To safeguard cities, towering walls have been constructed, and the only means to cross the perilous terrain is aboard a specially engineered train that makes the journey from Beijing to Moscow in just fifteen days. Passengers are cautioned to avoid looking out the windows, as the enchanting landscape may draw them into peril.",

It emphasizes the importance of embracing change rather than fearing it and advocates for finding a new equilibrium with the natural world.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Cover and Initial Appeal:**  \n  I was drawn to the book by its striking cover, with its beautiful contrast of ochre, black, and white, and by the plot, which reminded me of an Agatha Christie mystery set on a Snowpiercer-like train, but more contained, with the adventurous and exploratory spirit of Jules Verne’s works.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story is set in 1899, at the end of the century, in a Siberia struck by a mysterious plague. The cause and symptoms are unknown, but it induces a trance-like state, leading to madness and death. To protect cities, high walls have been built, and the only way to traverse the wild lands is via a specially engineered train that travels the Beijing-Moscow route in just fifteen days. However, passengers are warned never to look at the outside landscape, as it could enchant and lure them into danger.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book carries an unsettling, unnatural atmosphere, but I wouldn’t classify it as horror or fantasy. It feels more like a work of fiction that reimagines history with elements of magical realism. It rewrites a small portion of history while reflecting on our lives, our world, our relationship with nature, and the invisible connections within it and within us.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel explores a green apocalypse, an event that threatens human society but allows nature to reclaim its central role in the world. It emphasizes embracing change rather than fearing it and finding a new equilibrium with nature. It’s also a journey to uncover hidden truths, driven by fear and perhaps ignorance.  \n\n- **Characters and Perspectives:**  \n  The story is told through three main perspectives:  \n  1. **Marija Petrovna:** A young woman mourning the loss of her husband and family, using a false identity to uncover the truth behind the cover-up of the last journey.  \n  2. **Henry Grey:** A disgraced naturalist seeking redemption through a new discovery, indifferent to the dangers.  \n  3. **Weiwei Zhang:** The “daughter of the train,” born and raised on the moving rails, with a special connection to the train itself.  \n  Additionally, there’s Elena, a stowaway connected to the desolate lands, seeking to understand what is causing her homeland to tremble.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The slow start might bore some readers and tempt them to abandon the journey, but perseverance is key. The first part introduces the train’s daily life and delves into the personal stories of the travelers, gradually building momentum as the narrative unfolds. The story isn’t just about uncovering the truth behind the last journey, a supposed suicide, or a new scientific discovery—it’s about understanding the secret language of the world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating journey that blends mystery, adventure, and introspection. It challenges readers to reflect on humanity’s relationship with nature and the importance of embracing change. While the slow start requires patience, the payoff is a richly layered narrative that reveals profound truths about the world and ourselves.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Style:**  \n  - The novel is described as a unique blend of genres, including uchronie, steampunk, fantastique, and hallucinatory nature writing.  \n  - It is compared to works like *Snowpiercer* and *Annihilation*, with a potential cinematic adaptation by Miyazaki suggested.  \n  - The story’s atmosphere is likened to Studio Ghibli films such as *Spirited Away* and *Princess Mononoke*.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  - The story is set in an isolated Siberia during the 19th century, featuring a train journey through a mutated landscape.  \n  - The plot revolves around mysterious mutations, a dangerous \"mal,\" and the secrets of the Compagnie.  \n  - Key characters include Weiwei, Henry Grey, and Marya, each with their own motivations and backstories.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  - The narrative starts slowly, almost too slow for the reader, making it challenging to find a comfortable reading rhythm.  \n  - Despite the slow start, the reader remains intrigued by the unfolding story.  \n\n- **Ending and Themes:**  \n  - The ending is described as magnificent, bursting with poetic and dreamlike naturalist morality.  \n  - The novel conveys a universal message that resonates deeply, making it a strong candidate for an animated film adaptation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Comment voyager dans les terres oubliées* is a genre-defying novel that blends uchronie, steampunk, and fantastique into a hallucinatory journey through a mutated Siberia. While the slow pacing initially challenges the reader, the story’s intriguing plot, rich atmosphere, and poetic ending make it a memorable and thought-provoking read. Fans of Studio Ghibli films and unconventional narratives will likely find this book captivating.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The train emerged as a constant companion, almost a ghostly figure propelling itself toward an unknown destination. The Wastelands provided an unyielding backdrop of ‘otherness,’ evoking fear and the need for protection. This slightly eerie undertone throughout the book enriched its distinctive atmosphere.",

I’m grateful he did, as it’s a book I likely wouldn’t have picked up on my own. Venturing outside my comfort zone often yields surprising rewards.

I’m glad he did, as this was a book I probably wouldn’t have picked up myself. Sometimes, it’s good to venture outside one’s comfort zone. I went into the book completely blind, without reading the blurb or knowing anything about it, though I half-expected a ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ kind of story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Structure:**  \n  I loved the writing style, which follows different passengers on the train, each with their own reasons for being there and doing what they’re doing. Toward the end, all these individual threads are neatly woven together, creating a satisfying and cohesive narrative.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The train itself felt like a constant companion, almost like a ghostly figure in its own right, moving relentlessly forward toward an unknown destination. The Wastelands served as a relentless backdrop of ‘otherness,’ something to be feared and guarded against. The book had a slightly eerie undertone throughout, which added to its unique atmosphere.  \n\n- **Ending and Impact:**  \n  I particularly enjoyed the ending, which had a very old-school cinematic feel and wasn’t what I expected at all. It left me pondering certain things, though revealing them would spoil the experience.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  I can see why people say that if you enjoy authors like Chloe Gong and Rachel Gilling, you might find this book intriguing as well.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful departure from my usual reading preferences. Its unique writing style, eerie atmosphere, and cinematic ending made it a memorable read.

These include basic contradictions in continuity, inconsistencies in characters' locations, and a phrase in the epilogue that appeared to be a copy editor's note left in the final proof. Given that this book was published by an imprint of one of the Big Five publishers, which has the resources to ensure high-quality, polished work, these oversights are disappointing. It’s unclear whether this was due to someone dropping the ball or systemic issues within the publishing industry, but it’s an insult to both the author and the readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a captivating premise and engaging character arcs, but its uneven focus and significant editing flaws detract from the overall experience.

Towards the end, it took on a steampunk-style reminiscent of Vandermeer’s *Annihilation*, though this shift felt somewhat abrupt and out of place.  \n\n- **Ambition and Scope:**  \n  The book felt overly ambitious, as if it was trying to encompass too much. It could have benefited from an additional 200 pages to flesh out the world-building and provide more backstory for the large cast of characters, many of whom felt underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Repetitive Language:**  \n  The repeated use of phrases like “Child of the train” and “Man of the train” became annoying over time. While I understood the idea behind it, the repetition detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing concept and setting, its ambition and lack of depth in world-building and character development held it back.

While I was eager to read *The Cautious Traveller’s Guide to the Wastelands*, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect due to the comparisons to *Piranesi* (which I love) and *The Midnight Library* (which I loathe).  \n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The book had a slow start for me, and it took a little while to get into it. However, once I found my groove, it was easy to sink into the story.  \n- **Characterization and POVs:**  \n  I think Brooks did a good job balancing the POVs, and I enjoyed her writing as a whole.  \n- **Fantasy Elements:**  \n  I found the fantasy aspects to be a little lighter than I’d anticipated, and at some points, the story felt almost too ambitious in scope.  \n- **Atmosphere:**  \n  The atmosphere was somewhat claustrophobic, but I mean this in the most positive way possible (after all, you’re on a train with secrets!).  \n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I liked the audiobook a lot. Having two narrators was fun, and I appreciated that one narrator would voice the dialogue for their characters even during the other POV. This definitely helped keep me engaged, especially during the beginning when I was still struggling to find my footing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Cautious Traveller’s Guide to the Wastelands* worked well for me despite its slow start and lighter-than-expected fantasy elements.

However, the actual content fell far short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story spans 300 pages but lacks any significant plot development.

There’s no mystery, and nothing substantial happens throughout the book.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my broad reading tastes, I found this book extremely unengaging and disliked it intensely.

            "The pacing of the story mirrors the slow journey of the train, creating a calm atmosphere. While lacking dramatic twists, the intriguing characters and persistent tension keep me engaged. However, the emphasis on atmosphere occasionally overshadows plot development, which can be frustrating but also ignites the reader's imagination. Set against the backdrop of the first journey of the Trans-Siberian Express after a tragic accident, the narrative blends gothic fantasy, steampunk, historical fiction, and Agatha Christie-style mystery. It touches on themes of progress and its environmental costs, though I felt this aspect could have been explored more deeply. While the looming danger outside the train and the enigma surrounding the Company add layers of suspense, the wealth of atmospheric detail sometimes eclipses the plot, leaving several questions unresolved.",

Meanwhile, Zhang Weiwei, a 16-year-old orphan born on a train, offers a distinctive viewpoint. Naturalist Henry Grey and other passengers further enrich the narrative's emotional depth. Additionally, the evolving friendships among the characters enhance the story's compelling nature.",

            "This novel unfolds in late 19th-century Siberia, a harsh and desolate realm where bizarre mutations hinder human life and travel, leaving the Trans-Siberian Express as the sole means of escape. The train is almost a character in its own right, richly depicted through its compartments, history, and an inventive travel guide that enhances the setting. The oppressive Siberian landscape, coupled with the claustrophobic nature of the train, crafts a distinctive and immersive atmosphere."

            "The pacing of the story presents a minor issue, particularly in the early chapters, where lengthy character expositions often bring the narrative to a halt. Characters dedicate two full pages to recounting their pasts, and much of this could have been trimmed without sacrificing depth. Thankfully, this problem diminishes as the book progresses. However, the ending abruptly shifts to Marya's perspective, a secondary character who has not significantly influenced the main storyline. This transition feels jarring and unnecessary; a narrative solely from Weiwei’s viewpoint would have been equally, if not more, engaging.",
            "I appreciate the story and its characters on an abstract level. Their lengthy backstories are intriguing, and each offers a unique motivation for their journey. However, in practice, the characters feel somewhat flat.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Setting:**  \n  The premise is absolutely fantastic—a man-made train that runs through a fantastical wilderness with a mind of its own. The descriptions of the settings are quite well done.  \n\n- **Story and Characters (Abstract):**  \n  I like the story and the characters in an abstract sense. Their backstories, albeit overly long, are interesting, and each of them has a unique and compelling reason to undertake the journey.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The story pacing is a smaller complaint. Long stretches, especially in the beginning, are devoted to flowery character exposition. Characters often stop the story cold to spend two whole pages explaining their past, and these descriptions could have been halved without losing substance. This issue is less apparent later in the book, so it’s not a dealbreaker.  \n\n- **Character Interactions and Development:**  \n  In practice, the characters fall a little flat. They don’t interact with each other in particularly interesting ways, and it sometimes feels like they spend a lot of time talking and not a lot of time doing.  \n  The exception is Weiwei and Elena, who are by far the most compelling characters. They instigate a lot of the action, and their interactions drive both story moments and character growth. I would argue they are the \"main\" characters.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  Elena and Weiwei have a deep bond that feels undeniably romantic. They frequently put themselves at risk to save each other, and their actions and emotions suggest a strong romantic connection. However, the author denies this, labeling their relationship as platonic and even employing a \"no homo\" trope and a \"bury your gays\" moment, which was disappointing and confusing.  \n  In contrast, Marya’s heterosexual romance with her bland boyfriend feels uninspired and lacks emotional depth. Their bond revolves around Marya’s dead father’s glassmaking skills, which is hardly compelling.  \n\n- **Perspective and Narrative Focus:**  \n  The ending suddenly switches perspectives to Marya, a tertiary character who hasn’t significantly impacted the broader story. This choice feels jarring and unnecessary. The story could have been entirely from Weiwei’s perspective, which would have been equally, if not more, interesting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I don’t regret reading this book. The premise is fantastic, and there are parts I really enjoyed, particularly the dynamic between Weiwei and Elena. However, the slow pacing, flat character interactions, and strange narrative decisions, especially regarding romantic subplots and perspective shifts, detract from the experience. It’s a fine novel, but not one I’ll likely reread.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 out of 5 stars."

The train passes through a massive wall and traverses the Siberian plains, encountering an eerie and threatening environment known as the Wastelands. The atmosphere is dark and unsettling, evoking the strangeness of the unknown and the void.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The story introduces a diverse cast of passengers, including a nature scientist, an orphan, a stuck-up Countess, and someone traveling under false pretenses. These characters are drawn to the world outside their hermetic carriages, and their interactions and discoveries slowly reveal the unsettling events of the eastbound journey.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The narrative explores the consequences of human hubris in attempting to conquer the untameable Siberian expanse. It delves into the fear of the unseen, the pull of the unknown, and the idea that the Wastelands might be a living entity far larger than the train itself. The story is more about entertainment than conveying a specific theme or message, though it touches on speculative fiction elements reminiscent of \"The Forbidden Planet\" and \"Solaris.\"  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The novel is written in an easily readable present tense, which creates an immediate and engaging narrative. The style is classy and historical, with a frequent use of words like \"whilst,\" adding to the Victorian tone. The storytelling is immersive, successfully blending speculative fiction with historical fiction.  \n\n- **Cultural References and Comparisons:**  \n  The novel draws comparisons to \"Snowpiercer\" (minus the class issues), \"The Forbidden Planet,\" and the first \"Solaris\" movie. These references highlight the themes of human arrogance, subconscious monsters, and the vast, unknowable nature of the Wastelands.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis dark, speculative fiction novel effectively captures the strangeness of the unknown and the fear of the unseen. It is highly entertaining, with a well-crafted setting, engaging characters, and an immersive writing style.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The novel revolves around Weiwei, who has spent her entire life on the Trans-Siberian Express, a train that traverses the dangerous land of \"Los Baldíos,\" inhabited by strange creatures. The train is considered the only safe place, but passengers are warned not to look out the windows due to a mysterious illness. The latest journey is delayed, and the protective rituals are skipped, heightening Weiwei's anxiety. The story kept me hooked from start to finish, as I wanted to uncover the secrets of Los Baldíos and understand what happened during the last journey. However, the plot became increasingly confusing and strange, with vague explanations, especially regarding the living organism concept of Los Baldíos. The lack of clarity about how and why the land transformed into this state left me unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are as peculiar as the plot. They include a young woman seeking justice, a disgraced professor who is fanatical and reckless, a wealthy Russian countess, and Weiwei, who was born and raised on the train. While the characters are unique and add depth to the story, their development felt overshadowed by the bizarre and unexplained events.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author's writing style did not fully convince me. While the narrative was engaging and reminiscent of *Murder on the Orient Express* in its structure and plot, the storytelling became increasingly odd and vague as the story progressed. The explanations for key elements, such as the nature of Los Baldíos, were insufficient and left me with more questions than answers.  \n\n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was entertaining and kept me hooked throughout. The suspense and mystery surrounding Los Baldíos and the train's journey were compelling. However, the confusing and strange elements of the story left me unsure about whether I truly enjoyed the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a suspenseful and engaging read that keeps you hooked with its mysterious plot and unique characters. However, the vague explanations, bizarre developments, and lack of clarity about key elements, such as Los Baldíos, detract from the overall experience. While it entertains, it leaves the reader with unanswered questions and a sense of uncertainty about their enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5/5"

            "The book reads like a continuous saga about trains, with characters frequently discussing the wastelands rather than exploring them. This focus made the story predictable and less engaging. Additionally, the narrative relied too much on telling instead of showing, which weakened the overall impact of the plot.",
            "I found my connection to the characters varied significantly. Marya felt deep and relatable, while others, like Elena and Weiwei, came across as overly dramatized. Overall, I struggled to connect with most of the characters. The cat’s inclusion also felt unnecessary, acting merely as a convenient plot device at one point in the story.",
            "The author's writing style is a standout feature, evoking a sense of visual artistry. The descriptions of magic and mystery are masterfully crafted, with striking lines like, “the shadows rearrange themselves into arms and legs, the face into high cheekbones and watchful eyes, the slithering sound into the rustle of silk.” The interwoven narratives of the passengers, set against convincingly depicted time periods, effectively unfold open questions, including the identity of Artemis.",
            "The novel features minimal romance, but its subtle romantic tone enriches the narrative. I was drawn in by the premise of a train journey to the unknown, yet I was surprised to find that the anticipated wastelands weren't the destination. Instead, the train itself became the central focus, which felt anticlimactic. Nevertheless, the core idea remains captivating, and I commend the author for their innovative contribution to the fantasy genre."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the book had some redeeming qualities, particularly the author’s refined writing style and the unique premise. However, the execution fell short, with predictable plotlines and uneven character development. Despite its flaws, I believe the author has potential and will be keeping an eye out for her future work.",

However, the wastelands, which I initially thought were the destination, turned out not to be. Instead, the train itself became the focal point, which felt anticlimactic. The underlying idea of the story still fascinates me, and I appreciate the effort to create something unique in the fantasy genre.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  My connection to the characters varied.

The inclusion of the cat seemed unnecessary, serving only as a convenient plot device at one point in the story.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The book felt like an ongoing saga about trains, with characters spending much of their time talking about the wastelands rather than venturing into them. This made the story predictable and less engaging. The narrative leaned too heavily on telling rather than showing, which diminished the impact of the plot.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s writing style was a highlight, often resembling visual artistry. Descriptions of the magic and mysteries were particularly well-crafted, with lines like, “the shadows rearrange themselves into arms and legs, the face into high cheekbones and watchful eyes, the slithering sound into the rustle of silk.” The intertwining stories of the passengers and the believable time periods in which they solved open questions (such as the identity of Artemis) were also well-executed.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  While the novel had limited romance, the underlying romantic tone of the writing style and story progression was intriguing and added depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had some redeeming qualities, particularly the author’s refined writing style and the unique premise.

            "As a train enthusiast, I found the novel's setting, inspired by the Trans-Siberian Express, fascinating. However, I was disappointed by the absence of a map detailing the train’s journey—this would have been a valuable addition, even if not strictly necessary. The Wastelands are intriguingly mysterious, with layers of complexity that reveal that nothing is quite as it seems. The gradual unveiling of the previous disastrous journey of the train enriches the world-building and adds depth to the narrative.",

While the setting is unique and the premise is interesting, the execution lacks the depth and complexity needed to fully immerse the reader.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential:**  \n  *The Cautious Traveller's Guide to the Wastelands* is a book that I liked but did not love. It offers a unique setting and an interesting premise, but the execution lacks the world-building, character development, and narrative complexity to fully capture the reader. Sarah Brooks has crafted a story with enormous potential, and while the journey is enjoyable, it feels like there are more stories left to be told and more depths to be explored within this world.  \n\n- **Audio Narration:**  \n  I loved the audio narration of this story, which added to my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is a solid read for fantasy readers, although it leans more toward magical realism than pure fantasy. It’s a journey worth taking, even if it doesn’t quite reach the heights it aims for.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for my advance copy of the book."

It poignantly challenges the notion that anything different or born from chaos is inherently negative.",

As the story progressed and tension mounted, the characters underwent significant evolution, with none remaining completely indifferent. They all felt authentic, embodying a mix of virtues, flaws, and regrets. Weiwei and Elena stood out to me for their humanity and genuine desire to understand one another—an often rare dynamic. The captain was another character I found to be well-developed; however, she ultimately fell short of her potential.

The whirlwind of emotions made the journey feel perfect.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around a mutated, mysterious, and dangerous portion of land called \"los baldíos.\" A company attempts to conquer it by creating a train that traverses it, connecting continents. The narrative explores the travelers, the darkness of the baldíos, lies, the unknown, and humanity's fear-driven need to fit everything into preconceived notions. It challenges the idea that just because something is different or born from chaos, it must be bad.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved how distinct each character was and how they confronted the baldíos in different ways.

No one remained entirely indifferent, and they all felt real, with their virtues, flaws, and regrets.  \n\n- **Favorite Characters:**  \n  Weiwei and Elena were my favorites, with their humanity and deep desire to understand each other, which is rarely seen.  \n\n- **Character Critique:**  \n  The captain was a character I felt was heavily developed throughout the book but ultimately didn’t fulfill her potential. She seemed so important that she could have done more, though I also felt she was constrained and did her best with what she had.  \n\n- **Philosophical Exploration:**  \n  The author delves into the concept of boundaries—not between continents, but between beings and nature. Questions like \"Where do I end, and you begin?\" and \"To what extent are we one but appear as two?\" fascinated me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is both strange and magical, offering a perfect blend of emotions, thought-provoking themes, and well-developed characters.

WeiWei, a child born on a train, grapples with her loneliness and believes she has found companionship in a stowaway.

While there is a fantasy element with the wastelands and the creepy “changed” area the train crosses, the overall story feels more like Gothic horror. There’s a sense of ominous dread and a few “jump scares,” though nothing too horrific or graphic.  \n\n- **Originality and Themes:**  \n  The story has some unique, creative ideas. My favorite part was the commentary on dealing with change. The concept of the train as the only safe haven in a tainted, magical landscape was captivating. It’s a “strangers on a train” story with an “Orient Express” feel, where you don’t know what each character might be hiding.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The train is truly on its own in the Wastelands, and the fact that no help is coming if something goes wrong adds to the tension throughout the story.  \n\n- **Characterization and Pacing:**  \n  The story follows three different passengers, and I generally liked the multiple perspectives. However, there were times when I wished we got a little more or less of various characters. Early on, some characters make incredibly foolish choices without good reasoning, which felt a bit frustrating.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution and Clarity:**  \n  The story didn’t wrap up as neatly as it could have. I was left with some questions about what exactly happened on the prior train journey that everyone is mysteriously silent about. We never get a straight answer on what is going on in the wastelands, which might be intentional, but I personally would have liked a little more clarity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a unique and engaging story that blends historical fantasy with Gothic horror. Despite some pacing issues and unresolved questions, it’s definitely worth a read for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story unfolds through various POV characters aboard an alternate history Trans-Siberian railroad traversing a mysterious Siberian wasteland. Each character has a unique reason for being on the train, with the plot centering on the enigmatic wasteland and its effects on travelers, along with unsettling echoes from a previous disastrous journey. While the pacing is generally strong, some later events can become a bit confusing. Nevertheless, this minor issue does not significantly detract from the overall reading experience, culminating in a satisfying, if strange, conclusion.",
            "Each character's point of view is distinct and compelling, providing unique—and occasionally twisted—insights into the unfolding events. Their motivations and interactions enrich the narrative, deepening the intrigue throughout the story.",
            "The author masterfully crafts a captivating world brimming with both wonder and dread. The train setting is especially compelling, evoking a strong sense of space and claustrophobia. The vividly depicted wasteland and its mysteries further enhance the book's immersive atmosphere.",
            "This story merges 18th-century class divides with a powerful colonial trade company, all set against a surreal, dystopian backdrop reminiscent of *Snowpiercer* and *Annihilation*.",
            "This book presents a peculiar alternate history adventure aboard a train navigating an otherworldly landscape. While it’s marketed as a mix of *Piranesi* and *The Midnight Library*, it actually resembles a fusion of *Murder on the Orient Express*, *Snowpiercer*, and the unique styles of modern weird fiction authors like Jeff VanderMeer and China Miéville."

The pacing was very slow until the last 20%, where events unfolded so quickly that it was hard to keep track of everything.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook version was excellent, with narrators who did a fantastic job.

Marie assumes a false identity to uncover truths about a prior expedition that has faded from memory. Dr. Henry Grey, a disgraced scientist, seeks redemption for his tarnished career. Weiwei, born and raised on the train, embodies a unique connection to the journey itself. The author crafts fabulously drawn characters, with their individual narratives intricately woven into the train's overarching story.

While I usually appreciate slow-burn narratives with rich world-building, this story felt sluggish without delivering the depth I expected. The pace remained consistently unhurried, lacking any significant momentum. The plot was confusing and offered little in terms of character motivation. Many key events seemed avoidable had the characters made rational choices. The central premise—that allowing anything from outside the train would lead to disaster—was undermined by the illogical and reckless decisions of the characters, ultimately rendering the story frustrating and unconvincing.",

            "The plot unfolds slowly and contemplatively, lacking the tension needed to fully engage the reader. It is marred by repetitive scenes, such as Weiwei running through the train and Marya fretting over her false identity. This slow pacing detracts from the overall suspense. The final fifth of the novel feels rushed and chaotic, with minimal explanation about the Wastelands despite earlier hints. The hurried conclusion leaves the story feeling incomplete and unsatisfying. Other works, such as Jeff VanderMeer's *Annihilation*, have handled similar themes more effectively.",
            "The characters do not live up to the intriguing concept. They come across as archetypal and lack nuance, reminiscent of those in an Agatha Christie novel, but without a solid plot to support them. The only intriguing figures are Weiwei, a crew member, and the enigmatic cartographer, Suzuki; the others feel underdeveloped and lack compelling backstories.",
            "The premise of this story is captivating, set in late 19th-century continental Eurasia, where a stretch of land from Moscow to Beijing has turned into an alien landscape. The concept of a protected train traveling through The Wastelands, with passengers and crew navigating a delicate coexistence, is intriguing. Unfortunately, the execution falls short of realizing this rich potential."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The premise is incredibly cool and rich with promise. The late 19th-century setting in continental Eurasia, where a swath of land from Moscow to Beijing transforms into an alien landscape, is intriguing. The idea of a protected train traversing \"The Wastelands\" with passengers and crew living in uneasy harmony is compelling. However, the execution does not fully deliver on this potential.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters fall short of the intriguing concept. They are archetypal and lack nuance, resembling those from an Agatha Christie novel but without the support of an airtight plot. The only characters I found interesting were Weiwei, a crew member, and Suzuki, the enigmatic cartographer. The rest felt underdeveloped and lacked compelling backstories.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is slow and pensive rather than tense and gripping. It is bogged down by repetitive scenes, such as Weiwei dashing through the train or Marya worrying about her false identity being discovered. The pacing fails to maintain the tension needed to fully engage the reader.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Visuals:**  \n  The novel lacks a strong visual component, which is crucial for building atmosphere. I struggled to visualize the train, the passengers, or even the Wastelands itself. While Brooks' writing is strong, it is not evocative enough to instill fear or a sense of wonder about the Wastelands, diminishing the impact of the story's tension.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The final fifth of the novel feels rushed and messy. Despite hints being dropped throughout the story, very little is explained about the Wastelands. The attempt to wrap up the story quickly leaves it feeling unfinished and ultimately unsatisfying. Similar concepts, like Jeff Vandermeer's *Annihilation*, have executed this better.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel boasts an incredibly cool premise and a promising setting, it falls short in execution. The characters lack depth, the pacing is slow, and the atmosphere is not vividly realized. The rushed and unresolved ending further detracts from the overall experience, leaving the story feeling incomplete and unsatisfying.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

An author’s recommendation on Instagram further solidified my interest in reading it.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The novel is a blend of historical fantasy, gothic horror, and mystery. It carries a fantastical yet eerie tone, with an undercurrent of unease that persists throughout the story.\n\n- **Characters and POVs:**  \n  The story is told through three main perspectives: Marya (a woman posing as a grieving widow with hidden secrets), Weiwei (the child of the train), and Dr. Grey (a disgraced naturalist seeking redemption). While Dr. Grey was my least favorite character, this didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment of the book.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is lush and immersive, with vivid descriptions of the landscape, the train, and the interactions between characters. It was a standout aspect of the novel for me.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The story is set in an alternate history where the stretch of land between Beijing and Moscow becomes strange and surreal, necessitating the construction of a railway. The Wastelands are haunting, surreal, and occasionally confusing, as the book doesn’t fully explain their finer nuances. This ambiguity, however, added to the story’s charm for me.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending might be a bit confusing for some readers, but I personally loved it. It left me with a faint sense of hope and a lingering impression of the book’s weird, wonderful, and creepy atmosphere.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a delightful, thought-provoking read that masterfully blends genres and creates a haunting, surreal world. While it may be divisive due to its ambiguity and unconventional elements, I found it to be a weird, wonderful, and deeply engaging novel that I’ll likely reflect on for some time.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They are intriguing but lack a tangible presence, which adds to the novel's dreamlike quality.  \n\n- **Plot and Clarity:**  \n  The story follows a journey on the Trans-Siberian Railroad from China to Siberia, controlled by the Company, with an interloper aboard. However, details are often obscured, making it challenging to fully grasp the narrative and find one's footing.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  Despite the disorienting elements, the journey itself is compelling and worth the experience.

It’s a book that feels difficult to fully capture in a description, as its impact is best experienced firsthand.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI loved *The Cautious Traveller’s Guide* for its immersive setting, engaging plot, and relatable characters. The Wastelands and the mysterious railroad journey create a captivating atmosphere that lingers long after finishing the book. It’s a story that defies easy description and is best experienced without too much prior knowledge.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The narrative and its setting evoke more of the eerie atmosphere found in Jeff VanderMeer's *Annihilation* trilogy than traditional steampunk. It presents an alternate early 20th-century world, where life outside the Wastelands mirrors Victorian times.

I suspected it would be my kind of story, and it was.\n\n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n  Some say steampunk science fiction, but I disagree. The locomotive of the Trans-Siberian Express is necessarily steam-powered, but otherwise, the story and its setting are far more reminiscent of *Area X* in Jeff VanderMeer's *Annihilation* trilogy, and no one would ever call that steampunk. The world is an alternate version of the early 20th century, with life and society outside the Wastelands resembling Victorian times, though Beijing and Moscow seem to be the dominant seats of civilization, with London a close third.\n\n- **Characters and Engagement:**  \n  The Train Girl got her hooks in me right off and pulled me in, as did Marya, and later Elena, the Not Quite Girl of the Wastelands. This, in turn, reminded me of Pullman's *His Dark Materials* trilogy.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Every page, train-like, pulled me on to the next. The suspense is built into the scenario—a 15-day crossing of Siberia, a terra incognita where mysterious changes are constantly occurring.

The cursed Wastelands and the mysterious characters haunting the journey create a compelling atmosphere. The thematic elements of the train and the surrounding nature are super interesting and add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The pacing is slow, particularly in the first half of the book. The story feels more like an exhibition of the people on the train, reminiscent of Agatha Christie’s *Murder on the Orient Express*. However, it takes too long for the plot to become engaging, which may deter readers who prefer fast-moving narratives.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a promising concept and a captivating setting, its slow pacing and lack of character-driven action in the first half make it a less exciting read. The thematic elements and atmosphere are highlights, but the plot and character development fall short of expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The confined train setting contrasts beautifully with the expansive, dangerous, and mysterious world outside, which is masterfully developed. The author's world-building immerses readers in its vastness and intrigue, with Weiwei's perspective providing a deep exploration of this environment.

The \"Wastelands\" are a centuries-old aberration where the laws of physics, biology, and geomorphology have been bent and twisted. The Russian Empire and China have each walled off their realms from the Wastelands as security against the creeping contamination. The train, heavily fortified, moves between these two realms, defying the touch of the Wastelands. On each trip, a number of passengers succumb to crippling psychic attacks brought on by too much viewing of the horrors outside the train.

The narration gave it a cozy feel, though the story itself might not fully align with that description.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story unfolds gradually as the characters go about their individual lives, eventually coming together through the plot. By the end, all the threads woven throughout the narrative converge in a satisfying way.  \n\n- **Perspective and World-Building:**  \n  I loved that the story was told from multiple perspectives, allowing us to see the culture on the train from all angles. It was fascinating to explore both the crew's behind-the-scenes efforts to make the train journey work and the experiences of the first-class passengers.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I will definitely be recommending this book to others. It’s a unique and enjoyable read, especially in audiobook format.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a unique and engaging novel that blends multiple genres and storytelling styles. The excellent narration, multi-perspective approach, and gradual unfolding of the plot make it a standout read. While it has some darker elements, the overall experience is both immersive and satisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25 to 4.5 stars (subject to slight adjustment after further reflection)."

I found the idea so intriguing that I wished it had been executed by a more proficient author.  \n\n- **Execution of the Concept:**  \n  Despite the promising premise, the book failed to fully utilize its cool concept. It ended up doing very little with it, which left me feeling disappointed and let down.  \n\n- **Worldview and Tone:**  \n  The book’s worldview felt very juvenile, to the point where it started to resemble a young adult (YA) novel. This tone detracted from the potential depth and complexity the story could have achieved.  \n\n- **World Building:**  \n  The world building was inconsistent and half-baked. The author frequently forgot the rules of her own world, which made the setting feel underdeveloped and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Tension and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story had the potential to be a claustrophobic, surreal locked-room narrative, but it didn’t lean into the weirdness or maintain the tension effectively. As a result, it fell short of creating a gripping atmosphere.  \n\n- **Character Consistency:**  \n  The characters’ reactions to events were inconsistent with their personalities, backstories, and the established world building. This lack of coherence made it difficult to connect with or believe in the characters.  \n\n- **Adaptation Potential:**  \n  While the book didn’t fully succeed, I think the concept has potential for adaptation. If Netflix were to auction the rights and hand it to a veteran scriptwriter, it could be transformed into something much more compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had a fantastic concept but failed to deliver on its promise due to inconsistent world building, juvenile tone, and lack of tension. While it was an enjoyable read in parts, it ultimately left me feeling let down.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe book probably deserved 3 stars, or a generous 4 stars for the enjoyable aspects, but its shortcomings significantly impacted my overall impression."

Despite these shortcomings, it’s a captivating read that beautifully renders its magical and slightly menacing world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n*No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.*"

I loved both of those books, and I loved this one too, but they have nothing in common with each other or this book.  \n  - I would recommend this book to fans of *The Night Circus* (though this isn’t as magical), *Snowpiercer* (for the setting and the idea of the train being the world), and *Babel* (because of the complexity of the characters and their motivations).  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The vibe of this book is just so good. I have a thing for train-based stories (I blame *Snowpiercer*, which I’m obsessed with, both the show and the movie), and this one was excellent.  \n  - The train travels through a wasteland so dangerous that you shouldn’t even look through the windows, lest you lose your mind.  \n\n- **Characters and Their Motivations:**  \n  - The travelers on the train all have different reasons for being there, and some aren’t doing a very good job of following the rules.  \n  - The complexity of the characters and their reasons for doing things is one of the book’s strengths.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  - I still have a couple of questions at the end—maybe I missed a detail—but honestly, I love when the ending isn’t tied up in a neat little bow.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a captivating and atmospheric novel with a unique setting and complex characters.

If you enjoy weird, eerie stories, this one delivers.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are written well enough, but they can feel a bit one-dimensional at times. However, this didn’t detract from my enjoyment of the story. In fact, their lack of depth seemed to enhance the overall sense of weirdness and disconnectedness.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is original and intriguing, though it moves at a slower pace. This isn’t necessarily a negative, as it allows the atmosphere to take center stage.\n\n- **Atmosphere and World-Building:**  \n  The atmosphere is the standout element of this book. Brooks creates a creepy, unsettling world that I found utterly captivating. The Wastelands are richly detailed, and I was eager to explore every aspect of this strange environment. Brooks excels at writing weirdness, and it’s clear she has a talent for crafting immersive, eerie settings.\n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  I was so impressed by Brooks’ ability to create such a unique and unsettling world that I’ll definitely be on the lookout for more of her work in the future.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a slow-paced, atmospheric novel that leans heavily into its eerie and unsettling tone.

It evoked themes similar to other works that explore entities overtaking parts of the world, yet it maintained its own distinct flavor.

Ultimately, the story centered more on the characters and the train than on the wastelands, but it was still an engaging read.",

Each perspective enriches the narrative, creating an engaging and captivating story.",

Each narrative added depth to the story, making it engaging and riveting.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  I enjoyed the weirdness of the story and the mystery surrounding the wastelands and what they were doing. It reminded me of Jeff Vandermeer’s *Southern Reach* series, as both explore something taking over sections of the world, though this story felt distinct and not as weird. While I enjoyed it, I expected more to happen. The mystery seemed less about the wastelands and more about what happened on the last crossing.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  - The novel is set in an alternative 19th century aboard the Trans-Siberian Express, a steam train with distinct class divisions: a luxurious first class for wealthy international passengers, a spartan third class for the lower class, and basic crew quarters.  \n  - The train travels through the ‘Wasteland,’ a dangerous and mysterious region between Beijing and Moscow, seemingly representing Siberia.  \n  - The Wasteland’s threat to human life is hinted at but never fully explained, creating an atmosphere of tension and secrecy.  \n  - The train is owned and operated by a sinister English Company, reminiscent of the East India Company, adding a layer of colonial critique.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story is told from multiple perspectives, shifting between characters as the train progresses.  \n  - The journey is described as very long and slow, with the narrative failing to maintain my attention.  \n  - While there is an undercurrent of secrecy and tension, the pacing felt sluggish, making the story drag.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The novel features some interesting characters, but their development felt insufficient to fully engage me.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  - The book blends steampunk elements with an increasing atmosphere of horror, which I found unappealing as I do not typically enjoy the horror genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its promising premise and intriguing setting, *The Cautious Traveller’s Guide to the Wasteland* failed to captivate me. The slow pacing, lack of clarity about the Wasteland’s dangers, and the horror elements detracted from my enjoyment. While the characters and steampunk aspects had potential, they were not enough to sustain my interest throughout the long journey.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars"

            "The story's slow pace undermines its overall momentum, and the anticipated horror elements ultimately disappoint.

The setting is beautifully written and infused with a sense of dread, creating a strong atmosphere.  \n- **Pacing:**  \n  The story is slow-moving, which detracts from its overall momentum.  \n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The focus is more on setting and atmosphere than on characters or plot. The friendship between Weiwei and the stowaway, one of the primary relationships driving the plot, never felt authentic or fully realized.  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The horror elements the story builds up to are ultimately a letdown. Instead of delivering on the promised horror, the primary effects of the Wastelands manifest as the train coming alive, filling with lush nature, and breaking down class barriers, resulting in an anti-capitalist allegory rather than a horror narrative.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the novel is good, and I enjoyed reading it. However, it did not fully meet my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis historical fantasy offers a compelling concept and a beautifully crafted setting, but its slow pacing, underdeveloped characters, and unexpected thematic shift from horror to allegory left me somewhat disappointed.

The atmosphere is tense, as if something is always *almost* going to happen, keeping the reader on edge.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Imagery:**  \n  The writing style is reminiscent of *Annihilation*, with its weird, almost psychedelic imagery that leaves a lasting impression. The story unfolds in a way that feels like a slow unraveling of sanity, both for the characters and the reader. The imagery is vivid and unsettling, contributing to the overall sense of unease.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The novel is a slow burn, with a deliberate pace that builds tension and mystery.

The train, which serves as the only safe passage through this dangerous landscape, is vividly described and adds a unique layer to the story. The strange and immersive landscape the train traverses was particularly enjoyable and well-crafted.\n\n- **Characters and Plot:**  \n  The story follows three main characters: Weiwei, a member of the train's crew; Marya Petrovna, who seeks to uncover the train's secrets; and Henry Grey, who is determined to discover the miracles hidden within the wasteland. The interplay between these characters and their individual motivations drives the narrative forward.\n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The novel explores the theme of transformation, both in terms of how individuals can change and how they are changed by the world around them. This thematic depth adds a layer of introspection to the story.\n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Performance:**  \n  The audiobook features two narrators, one voicing the characters and the other reading excerpts from the in-world book, *The Cautious Traveller's Guide to the Wastelands*. Both narrators delivered strong performances, enhancing the listening experience.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  The reviewer received an Advanced Reader Copy (ARC) from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a wonderfully crafted novel with a richly imagined setting, compelling characters, and thought-provoking themes. The audiobook narration is excellent, and the story’s exploration of transformation and the interplay between humans and their environment is both engaging and memorable.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There was a creepy vibe throughout that reminded me of *Area X* from Jeff VanderMeer’s *Southern Reach* books. The mysterious Wastelands added an intriguing layer to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was strong and engaging, blending fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery elements seamlessly. The author’s debut novel showcased a lot of potential.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were intriguing and well-developed, though a lot were introduced early on, making it hard to keep track at first. The story is more centered around the people and their journey than the destination.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The story isn’t fast-paced; it takes its time to build the atmosphere and explore the characters. While this added depth, it also made it a bit slow to get into initially.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  The plot was quite complex, with secrets unraveling and whispers about the train’s safety. There were whimsical moments that added charm to the overall mystery.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a good read with a lot to like, including the strong setting, writing, and characters. While it took some time to get into due to the slow pacing and large cast of characters, the blend of fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery made for an intriguing and atmospheric journey.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The metaphor of a train is central to this theme, symbolizing the suppression of chaos, disorder, and life itself.

I am eager to read more of Ms. Brooks' work and have added her to my watch-list.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is an almost-masterpiece with a powerful critique of corporate greed and a compelling central metaphor.

The setting, the Trans-Siberian Railway from Beijing to St. Petersburg, is both familiar and transformed, adding a unique layer to the story.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  While some critics argue that the characters are flat and one-dimensional, I disagree. The three narrators—Marya, Weiwei, and Henry Reed—are archetypes representing Russia, China, and England, respectively. They symbolize poor overlords of a land that resists subjugation. The true main characters are the train and the wastelands, whose interactions drive the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Conflict:**  \n  The story is a classic battle of mech versus magic, invention versus imagery, as the train and the wastelands struggle for survival and dominance. This conflict is central to the novel and creates a compelling dynamic.  \n\n- **Literary Comparisons:**  \n  The book reminded me of Stephen King’s short stories, particularly “The Raft” and “Mrs. Todd’s Shortcut,” as well as Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper.” These comparisons highlight the novel’s ability to evoke a sense of eerie familiarity and psychological depth.  \n\n- **Immersive Experience:**  \n  The novel is highly immersive. Sinking into its world allows readers to be transported into its richly crafted atmosphere and narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel masterfully blends gothic mysticism with a transformed setting, using archetypal characters to explore deeper themes of conflict and dominance.

I even ordered a booklight specifically for this book because I hated putting it down.  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The story has such a feeling of world-building that I’m disappointed to think that it’s the only story we have of this world. I hope the author comes up with more adventures for cautious travelers!  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is descriptive and enthralling, pulling you into Weiwei's world from the start, and making all of the characters your friends.  \n- **Genre Appeal:**  \n  If you enjoy a story that’s somewhere right on the line of sci-fi and fantasy, with just a hint of steampunk, you’ll enjoy this one!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a captivating read that kept me hooked from start to finish. The immersive world-building, engaging writing style, and unique blend of genres made it a standout experience. I eagerly hope for more stories set in this world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, despite its strengths, the execution of the plot fell short of my expectations, leaving me somewhat disappointed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Despite its readability, the book failed to engage me fully.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The imagery evoked by the words felt like it had a \"patina\" over it, lacking vividness.\n\n- **Plot and Character Choices:**  \n  Many plot decisions and aspects of the characters' lives felt banal.

This implies there must be at least a small hole through which the feared air could enter, either through the gun barrel(s) or another opening, which undermines the established logic.\n\n- **Pacing and World-Building:**  \n  The slow pacing at the beginning and the lack of a clear vision of the external world were not major issues for me personally, though they might be for other readers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I wanted to love this book, its reliance on telling rather than showing, the banal plot and character choices, and the logical inconsistencies hindered my enjoyment.

The imagery of the luxury train carriages, reminiscent of the Orient Express, combined with fantasy and horrific occurrences, set the stage for an intriguing story.\n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**  \n  While the buildup and explanations about the potential dangers in the wasteland were extensive, the finale didn’t quite meet the expectations I had developed. The anticipation was high, but the resolution felt somewhat underwhelming.\n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  The story shares some similarities with the Netflix series *Snowpiercer*, where humanity is confined to a constantly moving train, overcoming external challenges. In *Snowpiercer*, the issue was freezing cold, whereas this novel introduces supernatural difficulties, including monstrous creatures and the ability to alter people’s brain activity.\n\n- **Genre and Personal Preferences:**  \n  I don’t typically read fantasy books, and while there were fantastical elements in this story, I found myself enjoying the more naturalistic parts more than the monsters in the wastelands.\n\n- **Adaptation Potential:**  \n  I think this book would make a great TV series. The detailed descriptions of the train and its passengers lend themselves well to visual storytelling. A TV adaptation could also expand on the surrounding countryside and the wasteland, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Publication Details:**  \n  I read an early copy of the book on NetGalley UK. The book is published in the UK on June 20, 2023, by Orion Publishing Group. This review will appear on NetGalley UK, Goodreads, my book blog (bionicsarahsbooks.wordpress.com), and Amazon UK after publication.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel has a strong opening and an intriguing premise, but the finale didn’t fully deliver on the buildup.

Even Weiwei, my favorite of the bunch, was still flat. If the characters’ motivations or end goals had been more aligned with each other, it would have worked better in my opinion.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Style:**  \n  I loved the bits of atmosphere and whimsical nature.\n\n- **Author Potential:**  \n  Despite my disappointment, I will check out the author’s future works.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The novel had very interesting premises, especially since it was described as a mix between an Agatha Christie novel and a fantasy novel. However, these expectations were not met.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is not very fluid and feels rigid, making the descriptions of the landscapes somewhat boring at times.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are never fully developed, leaving their arcs and motivations incomplete.  \n\n- **Plot Cohesion:**  \n  The entire story feels disjointed, lacking a clear and cohesive narrative flow.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and World-Building:**  \n  The novel creates a fascinating and dangerous world, blending steampunk and gothic elements to build an atmosphere rich in suspense and mystery. The Desolate Lands, an inhospitable and enigmatic setting, add to the tension and danger faced by the characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel presents an intriguing premise and a captivating atmosphere, it falls short in execution. The rigid writing style, underdeveloped characters, and disjointed plot prevent it from living up to its potential. Despite its flaws, the world-building and suspenseful tone offer moments of engagement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their choices—whether to gaze out the window or plan a stop—propel the plot and amplify the stakes.",

            "Set in an alternate Victorian steampunk world, the novel follows the Trans-Siberian Express as it journeys through the perilous Wastelands of Siberia. This environment teems with terrifying monsters and bizarre creatures, instilling a sense of perpetual danger. The immersive atmosphere is heightened by ominous warnings: \"Don't step off the train, don't look out the window for too long, and don't breathe the lichen-sprinkled outside air.\" These elements combine to create an exhilarating tension throughout the story."
