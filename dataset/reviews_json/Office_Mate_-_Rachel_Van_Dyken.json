            "This book is a quick read, but its pacing can feel scattered at times, leading to moments of confusion. Some details blend together, making it difficult to track certain plot points. A more polished structure would have enhanced clarity. The story concludes with a satisfying happy ending for readers who appreciate closure, though the resolution feels somewhat abrupt, leaving a desire for more development in the final moments. Centered around the Emory Games, the narrative features Max Emory orchestrating a second-chance romance between Ace Harvey, the VP at Emory Hotels, and Bri, a new intern and his ex-girlfriend. Their forced proximity and unresolved tension create a compelling dynamic. Fans of the series will enjoy the familiar setting, Max's signature humor, and Dustin's return, which adds to the overall fun.",

Max Emory shines as a standout character, infusing humor and mischief into the plot. Dustin's return adds an enjoyable twist, though his character feels somewhat underutilized. The romance between Ace and Bri is marked by tension and lingering affection, and their forced proximity compels them to confront their past and decide whether to rekindle their relationship or move on. While their chemistry is palpable, the resolution feels rushed, diminishing the depth of their reconciliation.",
