            "Amelia and Topher's love story was enjoyable, and Topher was an intriguing character. However, their relationship felt rushed, as it was limited to this final book. It was difficult to fully invest in a love interest who appeared only briefly and lacked significant development throughout the story.",
            "Amelia stands out as the only character with meaningful development throughout the story. In contrast, supporting characters like Viktor and Celeste, who played crucial roles in the first two books, felt underutilized and inconsistent in this final installment. Although Celeste's actions significantly influenced the plot, her limited presence was disappointing.",
            "The plot was decent but didn't fully engage me. While it provided a satisfactory conclusion to Amelia's story, it lacked the emotional resonance I had anticipated."

Additionally, the romance between Amelia and Tothers feels forced, lacking the natural chemistry present in her previous relationships.
