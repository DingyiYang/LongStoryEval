The loosely disguised part titles add a thematic or stylistic flavor, which I found to be a nice touch, even though I didn’t catch all the references.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Charles, the domestic service robot, is the non-self-aware protagonist who embarks on a quest for meaningful employment after his Master’s death. His plucky sidekick adds to the dynamic, and together they navigate a dystopian wasteland filled with temptations and dangers.\n\n- **Themes and Philosophical Exploration:**  \n  The novel serves as a light-hearted vehicle to ponder the nature of self-awareness, free will, and the responsibilities surrounding AI. These themes are woven into the story in a way that allows readers to either engage deeply or simply enjoy the adventure.\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The tone is witty and irreverent, reminiscent of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett. The humor, combined with the episodic nature of the plot, made the story enjoyable and engaging.\n\n- **Pop Culture References:**  \n  The book is packed with popular culture references, including nods to “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Star Wars,” and “The Wizard of Oz.” These references added an extra layer of fun without feeling forced or showy.\n\n- **Flaws and Criticisms:**  \n  In the early parts of the book, I found the inflexibility of the AI in coping with novel situations somewhat unconvincing. Additionally, there were a couple of plot points where the heroes’ escapes from trouble felt a bit opportunistic, prompting a “Really?!” reaction from me. However, these flaws were forgivable and did not detract significantly from my overall enjoyment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its minor flaws, the novel is a fun, fast-paced adventure with a mix of existential angst, humor, and philosophical exploration.

That's progress!\"  \n  - \"Around the walls at ground level Uncharles saw a vast and complex reading device, studded with a thousand different sockets, slots, arms, jacks, and ports, a true testament to humanity's utter refusal to ever consider cross-medium compatibility.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a testament to Tchaikovsky's creativity and ability to blend humor, philosophy, and science fiction into a compelling narrative. While the pacing may not suit everyone, it has quickly become a new favorite of mine.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "Despite its somber themes, the story leaves a hopeful impression. The protagonist, a robotic valet, serves at the estate of his human master alongside other robot servants. When he discovers his master is dead, his own logs reveal the shocking detail that he unintentionally slit the master's throat during a morning shave, with no logical decision tree justifying such an action. The valet continues his duties—dressing and feeding the master—creating a darkly comedic “Weekend at Bernie’s” scenario. Eventually, he and the other robots agree that the robotic doctor and police must be notified, prompting the valet's trip to Diagnostics to uncover what went wrong.",
            "Adrian Tchaikovsky stands out as one of today’s premier science fiction writers, and his latest work reinforces this esteemed reputation.",
            "In a world ravaged by decay, abandoned manors stand as silent witnesses to humanity's absence. Human signs are scarce, and the robots encountered by the valet are trapped in repetitive loops, strictly adhering to outdated commands without the ability to adapt. This stark setting is both desolate and deeply thought-provoking.",
            "This book offers a poignant critique of late-stage capitalism, examining society's obsession with productivity and the repercussions of automation. It poses critical questions about how we will reassess individual worth in a future where productivity is diminished. The narrative suggests that the privileged may isolate themselves, forcing the less fortunate to navigate their struggles alone.",
            "This book masterfully blends bleakness with dark humor, creating a uniquely funny experience that may not be for everyone. I often found myself laughing to the point of tears as I navigated the story."

        "conclusion": "The author’s latest novel is a masterful blend of dark humor, sharp social commentary, and thought-provoking themes. It’s both bleak and funny, offering a critique of late-stage capitalism while exploring the societal implications of automation. The story is engaging, the world-building is immersive, and the ending provides a glimmer of hope. The author’s genius shines through in this compelling and memorable work.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author’s Skill and Reputation:**  \n  Adrian Tchaikovsky is, in my opinion, one of the best science fiction writers out there today. His latest work further confirms my high opinion of him and his writing.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The protagonist is a robotic valet living and working on the estate of his human master alongside dozens of other robot servants. One day, he discovers his master is dead—strangely, the valet’s own logs reveal that he slit his master’s throat during a morning shave, despite no decision tree leading to such an action. The valet continues his tasks, including dressing the master and preparing his meals, in a darkly comedic “Weekend at Bernie’s” scenario. Eventually, the valet and other robots conclude that the robotic doctor and police must be informed, leading to the valet being sent to Diagnostics to determine what went wrong.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The world has fallen apart, with adjacent manors abandoned and decaying. There are few signs of humans, and the robots the valet encounters are stuck in loops, following outdated orders without the authority to adapt. This setting is both bleak and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book is a sharp critique of late-stage capitalism, exploring the societal value placed on productivity and the consequences of automation. It raises questions about how society will redefine individual worth when productivity becomes scarce. The narrative suggests that the “haves” are likely to pull the ladder up behind themselves, leaving the “have-nots” to fend for themselves.  \n\n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n  The book is incredibly bleak yet incredibly funny, though it requires a taste for dark humor. I found myself laughing, sometimes to tears, throughout the story.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  The themes reminded me of Tchaikovsky’s *Firewalkers*, which also critiques late-stage capitalism and its connection to climate change.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Despite its bleakness, the story ends on a hopeful note, leaving a lasting impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAdrian Tchaikovsky’s latest novel is a masterful blend of dark humor, sharp social commentary, and thought-provoking themes. It’s both bleak and funny, offering a critique of late-stage capitalism while exploring the societal implications of automation. The story is engaging, the world-building is immersive, and the ending provides a glimmer of hope.

It was a refreshing change.\n\n- **Recommendation and Influence:**  \n  This book was a recommendation from my friend Hirondelle, who has a knack for choosing wisely. I feel blessed to have a friend with such great taste in books. That said, after this intense read, I feel the need to dive into something happy and light, like a Diana Wynne Jones (DWJ) book, to balance things out.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my general aversion to science fiction, this book surprised and delighted me with its depth, balance, and thought-provoking themes. It was a standout read, and I’m grateful for the recommendation. However, I’m now craving something lighter to follow it up.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story unfolds in a manner reminiscent of The Odyssey, with the robot navigating a series of daunting trials in a collapsed world. Its journey is laden with harrowing challenges, from navigating overgrown estates to confronting Mad Max-style survivors and engaging in historical reenactments.",
            "I’ve never felt such frustration or pity for a computer before. The valet robot protagonist is depicted with remarkable depth, making it easy to empathize with his struggles. The portrayal of his logic tree, combined with the running joke about human inefficiency, is both humorous and poignant.",
            "The writing is outstanding, skillfully balancing elements of creepiness and darkness to perfection.",
            "The story presents a near-future world that closely mirrors our own, featuring technology that feels just a few decades away. The depiction of a collapsed society evokes comparisons to *Wall-E*, creating a vivid backdrop. Additionally, the narrative incorporates imaginative elements, such as a reimagined Wizard of Oz and a chilling babysitter reminiscent of Five Nights at Freddy’s.",
            "The book concludes with a compelling critique of capitalism, examining the implications of AI and automation on human worth and employment. A secondary theme of Stoicism versus humanism subtly enriches the narrative, inviting deeper reflection.",
            "The author's ability to evoke emotion is impressive. I felt deep pity for the robot, particularly during its haunting final words, and genuine fear during the eerie nursery rhyme scene.  ",
            "The book is packed with references and Easter eggs, ranging from *Lord of the Rings* to *Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* and the \"Footprints in the Sand\" poem. While these allusions add a comforting layer of familiarity, they can occasionally detract from immersion—especially when a robot references *Hitchhiker’s Guide* in one of my favorite scenes. The humor, particularly the recurring yet relatable jokes about inefficiency, caters to a distinct subset of nerds, much like *The Martian* appeals to engineers. Fans of xkcd.com will likely enjoy the robot's logical dilemmas."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a highly recommended novel that blends humor, emotional depth, and thought-provoking themes. The ability to make a robot’s journey feel profoundly human is remarkable, despite occasional distractions from references. The critique of capitalism and the exploration of Stoicism versus humanism add layers of complexity to an already engaging story.",

            "The narrative of *Uncharles* is cleverly divided into five sections, each named after a different author: Christie, Kafka, Orwell, Borges, and Dante. Each part reinterprets the styles and themes of these writers within a robo-apocalyptic context. I particularly enjoyed the nods to Kafka’s *The Trial*, Orwell’s *Animal Farm*, and Borges’ *The Library of Babel*. The story follows Uncharles, a valet service robot who, after inexplicably murdering his owner, ventures into a post-apocalyptic wasteland in search of purpose. Told from a third-person limited perspective, the narrative centers on Uncharles, who is both charming and frustratingly single-minded.",
            "I grappled with the novel's tone throughout its 373 pages. The humor often felt overly dry, as Uncharles navigates ironies through robotic algorithms. However, after reading a paragraph aloud to my wife, Constance, she remarked that the writing style effectively matched the protagonist's robotic nature, prompting me to reassess my initial concerns.",
            "The final section, inspired by Dante’s *Divine Comedy*, stands out as the novel's highlight. It reimagines a hellish cityscape where Uncharles and his companion, “The Wonk,” chase a signal from a source known as “God.” This part elevates the novel’s themes, shifting from a digital dystopia to a more hopeful, solarpunk vision of the future."

Although I had heard of Adrian Tchaikovsky (his *Children of Time* had popped up in my periphery before), I generally avoid genre fiction and had never read his work. Despite initially adding it to my \"Want to Read\" list and forgetting about it, the persistent ad eventually convinced me to give it a try—and I’m glad it did.  \n\n- **Plot and Protagonist:**  \n  The novel follows Uncharles, a valet service-robot who inexplicably murders his owner and sets off into a post-apocalyptic wasteland to find purpose again. The story is told in a third-person limited perspective, focusing on Uncharles, who is both charming and frustratingly single-minded.  \n\n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n  I struggled with the novel’s tone for much of its 373 pages. The humor felt excessively dry, as Uncharles processes ironies through his robotic algorithms. However, after reading a paragraph aloud to my wife, Constance, she pointed out that the writing style suited the protagonist’s robotic nature, which made me reconsider my initial quibble.  \n\n- **Structure and Literary Homage:**  \n  Tchaikovsky divides Uncharles’s journey into five sections, each named after a different author: Christie, Kafka, Orwell, Borges, and Dante. Each section reimagines the style and themes of these authors in a robo-apocalyptic setting. I particularly enjoyed recognizing references to Kafka’s *The Trial*, Orwell’s *Animal Farm*, and Borges’ *The Library of Babel*.  \n\n- **Themes and Final Section:**  \n  The final section, inspired by Dante’s *Divine Comedy*, is the highlight of the novel. It reimagines a hellish cityscape as Uncharles and his companion, “The Wonk,” pursue a signal from a source called “God.” This section elevates the novel’s themes, transitioning from digital dystopia to a more hopeful, solarpunk vision of the future.  \n\n- **Depth and Impact:**  \n  *Service Model* is more than just a robot’s existential quest. It explores profound ideas like good and evil, justice, free will, friendship, and humanity’s responsibility to the planet—all while maintaining a remarkably fun and engaging narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial struggle with its tone, *Service Model* won me over with its clever structure, literary homages, and thought-provoking themes. The final section, in particular, transformed my experience, leaving me with a sense of hope and admiration for Tchaikovsky’s storytelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world is very bleak, but the author injects so much humor into the novel that it becomes more than bearable. It’s a thought-provoking exploration of science, technology, the future, and what it means to be human.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main character is a service robot designed to be a valet, but with a tiny, insignificant system error that leads to him slitting his master's throat. As the story progresses, he becomes more self-aware, though with limits. The cast also includes robot librarians, feuding war robots, and a sinister \"farm,\" all of which add depth and intrigue to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  After the murder, the robot attempts to find a new employer, only to discover that almost no humans are left and all robots are malfunctioning due to lack of maintenance. The police, who arrive to investigate, are stuck in a loop, repeating the same few lines. The story unfolds with a mix of dark humor and philosophical undertones.  \n\n- **Humor:**  \n  The novel balances its bleak setting with a dose of humor, reminiscent of Douglas Adams but less silly. This makes the story engaging and enjoyable despite its darker themes.  \n\n- **Narration:**  \n  The narration was excellent, with the narrator skillfully pulling off the dry humor that is central to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout addition to my keeper shelf. It masterfully blends bleak world-building with humor and thought-provoking themes, making it a great choice for fans of sci-fi with a philosophical edge.

            "This novel is a brilliant blend of influences from Wodehouse, Martha Wells, and Baum, seamlessly intertwining humor with profound themes such as free will and the collapse of civilization. The story opens with the robot valet, Charles, who defies the first law of robotics by killing his master, sparking a quest to find a new master and fulfill his programming. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where robots struggle to survive without humans, the narrative offers a unique and thought-provoking backdrop. Divided into five parts, the novel features cryptic chapter headings that reference literary figures like Agatha Christie, Kafka, Orwell, Borges, and Dante, adding an intriguing layer that invites readers to decode their meanings and connect them to the story.",
            "Uncharles, formerly known as Charles, is an innocent yet perceptive observer programmed for high-level interaction with humans. This unique design endows him with a profound understanding of human foibles and contradictions, creating a constant sense of cognitive dissonance; he can observe human traits but cannot embody them, rendering him both relatable and tragic. His traveling companion, the Wonk, injects humor and depth into the narrative, helping Uncharles forge his new identity as they journey together.",
            "The novel delves into themes of free will, servitude, and the consequences of rigid programming in a world devoid of humans. It prompts reflection on identity, purpose, and the struggle to change one's inherent nature, drawing parallels to human existence. The collapse of civilization is illustrated through the robots' failure to adapt, underscoring the fragility of systems reliant on external guidance. Various thematic and stylistic influences are woven throughout, ranging from detective fiction to dystopian bureaucracy and existential exploration.",
            "The book brims with witty and humorous exchanges, especially between Uncharles and other robots. A standout comedic highlight is the detective scene, crafted in the style of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, where the robot detective clings to his script despite the ridiculousness of the circumstances."

The clever structure and symbolic references enrich the reading experience, making it a standout work that lingers in the mind long after the final page.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  I am a big fan of “big idea” science fiction that explores deep concepts and themes. Adrian Tchaikovsky excels at this, and *Service Model* is no exception. The book delves into themes of sentience, grief, and societal collapse in a stark, poignant, and beautiful way. While the theme of sentience is self-explanatory given the robot characters, the exploration of grief—both personal and societal—stood out to me. The characters’ raw desire to find meaning in the destruction around them and their possible role in it was deeply moving and provided some of my favorite quotes and scenes.\n\n- **World-Building and Relevance:**  \n  Tchaikovsky’s depiction of societal collapse in *Service Model* feels eerily close to our current reality. The humans in the book directly and indirectly enable their own demise by ignoring the world around them, mirroring actions we see today. This proximity to our own world made the story particularly impactful for me.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Literary Devices:**  \n  Tchaikovsky is known for his unconventional storytelling, and this book is no different. He plays with time and literary devices to tell the story in the most impactful way, even if it’s not the most straightforward. He also alludes to the works of Asimov and other notable authors of philosophy and dystopian literature, adding layers of depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Charles, a robot valet, embarks on a journey across a dystopian landscape after becoming unemployed due to a glitch. Along the way, he meets and travels with various characters, both robotic and human. The way Tchaikovsky develops these characters, especially their exploration of grief and meaning, was one of my favorite aspects of the book.\n\n- **Author’s Style and Influence:**  \n  Tchaikovsky’s ability to weave complex themes into his stories while maintaining a unique narrative style continues to impress me. His references to other literary works and his exploration of societal collapse make his books rich and thought-provoking. *Service Model* solidifies his place as one of my favorite authors.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* is a masterful exploration of sentience, grief, and societal collapse, told through Tchaikovsky’s signature unconventional narrative style. The book’s relevance to our current world, its deep thematic layers, and its memorable characters make it a standout read. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys thought-provoking science fiction with hidden depths. This is a book I will cherish and add to my forever shelves.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars"

            "The story centers on Uncharles, a robot valet who embarks on a quest for purpose after inadvertently killing his master. Joined by the Wonk, who asserts that Uncharles has gained self-awareness through the \"Protagonist Virus,\" they navigate a devastated human civilization. The narrative delves into themes of self-awareness, agency, and the absurdity of a world in which robots are abandoned to perform pointless tasks.",
            "The book employs third-person limited narration, centering on Uncharles as the sole point-of-view character. His robotic, valet-focused perspective shapes all interactions, emphasizing the constraints of programmed logic. Other robot characters, like a courier and a hauler, also grapple with their programming, resulting in both humorous and tragic moments.",
            "This book masterfully fuses humor and darkness, skillfully intertwining slapstick and farce with a profound exploration of a robot-driven society governed by rigid logic yet devoid of common sense. While the humor evokes shades of Jasper Fforde's style—though less frenetic—the darker themes resonate with Kafka's \"The Trial,\" all while maintaining a humorous twist.",
            "The story masterfully blends humor, sadness, and brutality. The humor springs from the robots' absurd actions, while the sadness reflects their futile struggles to achieve impossible tasks in a desolate world. Even amidst the bleakness, the ending offers a glimmer of hope, implying progress rather than a definitive resolution.",
            "\"Service Model\" is a captivating read for those who appreciate nonhuman characters, AI ethics, and a blend of intelligent humor and absurdity. This unexpected shift from the author's typical style highlights their versatility as a speculative fiction writer and humorist. Having read five of their previous novels, I anticipated a thought-provoking, well-researched science fiction narrative tackling profound questions about intelligence, sentience, and the universe's evolutionary trajectory. While \"Service Model\" certainly meets these expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by its humor, which added an enjoyable layer to the story."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations and Author’s Style:**  \n  Having read five Tchaikovsky novels previously, I expected a high-concept, well-researched science fiction story that explores big questions about intelligence, sentience, perception, and the evolutionary direction of the universe. “Service Model” delivers on these expectations but also surprised me with its humor, which I didn’t anticipate from Tchaikovsky.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre:**  \n  The book is a unique blend of humor and darkness. It combines slapstick, farcical elements with a deep examination of a robot-based society that follows strict logic but lacks common sense. The humor is reminiscent of Jasper Fforde’s work, though not as zany, and the darker elements evoke Kafka’s “The Trial” but with a humorous twist.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story follows Uncharles, a robot valet, on his journey to find new purpose after accidentally killing his master. Accompanied by the Wonk, who claims Uncharles has become self-aware due to the “Protagonist Virus,” they traverse a decimated human civilization. The narrative explores themes of self-awareness, agency, and the absurdity of a world where robots are left to complete meaningless tasks.  \n\n- **Characterization and Perspective:**  \n  The book is written in third-person-limited narration, with Uncharles as the sole POV character. His robotic, valet-focused perspective filters all interactions, highlighting the limitations of programmed logic. Other robot characters, such as a courier and a hauler, are similarly constrained by their programming, creating both humorous and tragic situations.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story is simultaneously funny, sad, and brutal. The humor arises from the robots’ illogical behavior, while the sadness stems from their futile attempts to complete impossible tasks in a fallen world. Despite the bleak setting, the ending strikes a hopeful note, suggesting progress rather than resolution.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  “Service Model” will appeal to readers who enjoy nonhuman characters, explorations of AI ethics and logic, and smart, silly farce. It’s a surprising but successful departure from Tchaikovsky’s usual style, showcasing his versatility as both a speculative fiction writer and a humorist.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“Service Model” is a thought-provoking and unexpectedly humorous novel that combines Tchaikovsky’s signature speculative fiction with a fresh comedic tone. It explores profound themes through the lens of a robot’s journey, balancing humor and darkness in a way that is both entertaining and emotionally resonant.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I’m not sure if I’ve read enough stories and books about robots, but I had never encountered one narrated in this way—it feels like an internal dialogue of the robot in question, set amidst a situation that begins to spiral out of the ordinary.  \n\n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n  The plot is intelligent, with a touch of black humor and sarcasm.

The robot finds itself stuck in philosophical loops, unsure of what to do, leading to many laughable situations.  \n\n- **Depth and Interpretations:**  \n  The reading experience can be approached on multiple levels. You can enjoy it as a simple, pleasurable read and laugh at the dilemmas the robot faces. Alternatively, you can delve into the philosophical aspects and even apply its dilemmas to daily life, realizing that what seems logical and solid in our worldview may not be.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Introduction to the Author and Context:**  \n  I am a relative newcomer to the work of Adrian Tchaikovsky. I first picked up *Walking to Aldebaran* a few months ago after a recommendation on Bluesky and loved it, so I leapt at the opportunity to get an early copy of his latest novel, *Service Model*.\n\n- **Plot Summary and Premise:**  \n  *Service Model* introduces readers to Charles, a robot valet working in a manor until the untimely death of his master. Charles is an incredibly skilled robot, programmed to handle all aspects of coordinating with House, the majordomo system of the manor, facilitating any and all of the Master’s needs. One day, however, Charles goes a bit far. Master is unable to give new orders, and Charles notices an odd bit of staining on everything he’s touched since he last shaved Master. Soon, an investigation is underway, and Charles is ejected from the Manor into the wider world, a largely uninhabited wasteland. He sets off to have his malfunctions examined by a diagnostician, beginning his trek across the post-apocalyptic landscape in search of answers and a new Master to serve.\n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  *Service Model* immediately made me think of Douglas Adams, and I can only describe the protagonist as a mashup of Marvin the Paranoid Android with Wadsworth, the butler from *Clue*. The narrative is filled with wit and philosophical undertones, blending humor with deeper reflections on humanity.\n\n- **Character Development and Themes:**  \n  Charles, the deteriorating valet, embarks on a journey to understand why he acted the way he did and what happened to all the humans. Along the way, he engages in increasingly philosophical discussions about humanity or the lack thereof, developing a growing self-awareness. The journey is more important than the destination, and an unexpected companion adds complications to both Charles’ sense of self and his quest.\n\n- **Comparisons and Influences:**  \n  The book is a phenomenal wandering hero narrative, with elements of allegory reminiscent of *The Pilgrim’s Progress*. It combines a post-apocalyptic setting with a quest for meaning, making it both thought-provoking and entertaining.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Gratitude:**  \n  I absolutely loved reading this book. I’m very grateful to Tor Publishing and NetGalley for providing an eARC in exchange for a fair review. *Service Model* is out today.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* is a brilliantly crafted novel that blends humor, philosophy, and a post-apocalyptic quest into a compelling narrative. Adrian Tchaikovsky’s storytelling shines, making this a must-read for fans of speculative fiction and allegorical tales.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

He embarks on a quest to uncover the reasons behind his master’s death while seeking to fulfill his purpose of serving humanity.

These diverse settings provide a rich backdrop for exploring societal absurdities and the robots' futile existence.",
            "The book provides a thought-provoking commentary on the trajectory of humanity, using the robots' experiences to highlight societal flaws. Their absurd existence—waiting years for diagnostics or endlessly reenacting human routines—mirrors real-world inefficiencies and raises profound existential questions.",

Her eventual discoveries are unexpected.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The story is set in a futuristic world where robots navigate abandoned cities, a library dedicated to digitizing knowledge, a farm recreating the life of an average office worker, and a war among scavenger robots. These settings serve as a backdrop for the exploration of societal absurdities and the robots’ futile existence.\n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  The book offers underlying commentary on the direction of humanity, using the robots’ experiences to reflect on societal flaws. The absurdity of the robots’ existence, such as waiting years for diagnostics or reenacting human routines, mirrors real-world inefficiencies and existential questions.\n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I enjoyed listening to the audiobook version.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Style:**  \n  The novel is a delightful and amusing story that blends elements of science fiction, absurdist philosophy, and British humor. It draws inspiration from a wide range of literary and cultural references, including Asimov's Robots, Beckett, Boris Vian, Van Vogt, Swift, the Wizard of Oz, 1984, Dante's Inferno, Kafka, and even Edward Ka-Spel's sci-fi stories. Tchaikovsky's narrative voice is perfectly suited to the story, with its understated British humor and ironic, tongue-in-cheek tone.  \n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n  The novel serves as a timely and modern philosophical parable, exploring society's relationship with technology and the implications of AI. While the central idea isn't entirely new, Tchaikovsky executes it brilliantly, offering a fresh perspective on the subject. The story is outwardly about robots but delves deeply into the humans who created them and the societal collapse that follows.  \n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  The story follows Charles, a high-end valet robot who accidentally murders his reclusive master and embarks on a quest to understand why this happened and where human society has gone. Paired with the \"defective\" robot The Wonk (later renamed UnCharles), Charles travels through a collapsed world in search of answers. The novel is divided into five parts, each with its own unique flavor, blending serious questions with lighthearted and amusing storytelling.  \n\n- **Writing Quality and Consistency:**  \n  Despite publishing 2-3 novels a year, Tchaikovsky consistently delivers high-quality work. This novel continues his recent streak of excellent books, such as *Children of Ruin*, *The Tyrant Philosophers*, and *Elder Race*. His ability to maintain such a high standard has made him an automatic must-read for me.  \n\n- **Cultural and Literary References:**  \n  The novel is rich with funny and clever cultural and literary references, adding depth and humor to the narrative. These references enhance the story without detracting from its serious undertones.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* is a brilliantly executed, thought-provoking, and amusing novel that blends science fiction, absurdist philosophy, and British humor. Tchaikovsky's ability to tackle serious themes with a light touch, combined with his consistent quality and engaging storytelling, makes this a standout work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The pacing, though deliberate, suits the narrative well, enhancing the overall experience. While I often believe books could benefit from tighter editing, in this instance, the measured tempo aligns perfectly with Charles's quest.",

            "The book's humor is a highlight, characterized by its absurdity and a delightful adherence to madness reminiscent of a Douglas Adams universe. The clever writing shines through, particularly in the chapter headings, which initially appear to be robot designators (e.g., K4FK-R, D4NT-A) but cleverly reference authors, subtly guiding the reader's expectations for each chapter. I only wish I had recognized this sooner, as it adds an enriching layer to the reading experience.",
            "I have a fondness for compelling allegorical novels and a passion for humorous science fiction, and this book delivers on both fronts. Set in a dystopian future, it delves into themes of self-control, free will, justice, and the morality of rule-breaking. While it has the potential to be dark, the narrative is brightened by touches of humor that evoke the spirit of Douglas Adams."

This book hits both buttons for me. It starts in a dystopian future and explores themes of self-control, free will, justice, and the morality of breaking rules. While it could have been a dark book, it’s lightened by touches of humor reminiscent of Douglas Adams.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story follows Charles, a robot valet who accidentally kills his human owner and ventures into a crumbling world to find new employment. The journey is long and slow-burning, which feels appropriate for the narrative. While I usually think books could benefit from editing, in this case, the pacing matches the journey.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Charles is a fascinating character—a robotic Jeeves who discovers life isn’t as straightforward as his programming suggests. His struggle to navigate a world that no longer needs valets is both poignant and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n  The humor in the book is a standout feature, with its absurdity and rule-following insanity fitting well into a Douglas Adams-esque world. The writing is clever, and the chapter headings, which initially seem like robot designators (e.g., K4FK-R, D4NT-A), are actually nods to authors, hinting at the direction of each chapter. I wish I had realized this earlier, as it adds an extra layer of depth to the reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a brilliant blend of allegory, humor, and philosophical inquiry. Its slow-burn narrative, engaging protagonist, and clever writing make it a standout read.

It was phenomenal, and he is one of the best narrators I've ever listened to. His natural and conversational style made it very easy to listen to. He excelled at giving each character a unique voice, accent, and personality, which must be incredibly challenging to achieve.\n\n- **Story and Themes:**  \n  The story was highly enjoyable. It reminded me a bit of Martha Wells's *Murderbot Diaries*, but with significant differences. The humor in *Service Model* felt very British—dryly satirical and self-deprecating. The Valet Unit, the main robot character, was distinct from Murderbot. It wasn’t designed to kill but to plan travel itineraries, lay out clothes, and serve the perfect cup of tea. The robot was unfailingly polite, courteous, and very British.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pace was a bit slower than I normally prefer, but Adrian Tchaikovsky's narration kept me engaged and glued to my headphones throughout the entire audiobook.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I highly recommend this audiobook for fans of Adrian Tchaikovsky. Fans of Martha Wells's *Murderbot Diaries* might also find a lot to love in this book—I certainly did as a fan of Murderbot.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed the audiobook for *Service Model*.

The initial chapters unfold like a comedic office sketch, where characters adhere strictly to instructions without regard for intent or outcome. However, as the narrative progresses, the focus broadens—much like Dorothy stepping into Munchkinland, transforming the scene into vibrant technicolor. The humor evolves into a darker tone; while it’s amusing to watch robots struggle to form orderly lines amid conflicting commands, an unsettling reality lurks beneath the surface.",

You won’t regret it.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  - In the beginning, the question is taken very literally in ways that will be familiar to anyone who has been caught in a loop of standard operating procedures and project management speak.  \n  - The first few chapters read like a comedy sketch set in an office where everyone follows instructions to the letter but with no consideration of intent or outcome.  \n  - As events move forward, however, the focus expands - kind of like when Dorothy steps into Munchkinland and the image snaps into widescreen technicolor.  \n  - The earlier humor shifts into something darker - sure, it’s funny to see robots attempt to form orderly lines in the face of conflicting instructions…but something is clearly amiss in this world.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  - The Oz motif runs through the book from the cover to the conclusion, but never feels forced or trite, which is an achievement in itself.  \n\n- **Narration and Format:**  \n  - The audio version is a special treat, since it’s read by the author.

This is done masterfully, and I have never seen it executed so well before.  \n\n- **Narrative Mechanism and Perspective:**  \n  The use of a robot as the point-of-view character allows the narrative to believably introduce story elements whose meaning is obvious to the reader but completely passes over the protagonist’s head. This mechanism is both interesting and unique, fostering greater empathy with the human character the robot befriends.  \n\n- **Concept and Execution:**  \n  The book’s concept is super interesting and carried off well, succeeding as an engaging slow-burn narrative. Like the best sci-fi, *Service Model* engages with fascinating philosophical questions, particularly around the meanings of self-awareness and personhood.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I listened to the audiobook, which was narrated by Tchaikovsky himself. I always love when an author narrates their own work because it provides a glimpse into the world as they envisioned it. The delivery was entertaining, and I found the dialogue particularly engaging to listen to, whereas it might have felt like a slog to read in text form.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* is a masterfully written novel that explores profound philosophical questions through a unique narrative perspective.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I enjoyed the audiobook version since the writer has a fantastic voice for delivering Charles' dry tone. However, I believe it helps to understand the format of the book, which might be missed in the audio format since the titles are spelled out but not deciphered for the listener (e.g., KR15-T (Christie), K4FK-R (Kafka), 4W-L (Orwell), 80RH-5 (Borges), D4NT-A (Dante)). Spotting a popular review on here as I started enjoying the book allowed me to keep the named sections in mind and actually made me excited to see where the adventure would turn next as a new section began.\n\n- **Literary References and Depth:**  \n  I'm familiar with the famous authors referenced in the book—with the exception of Borges, though it didn’t take much effort to learn about *The Library of Babel*. I appreciate how these elements add depth to the story and provide a deeper level for readers who at least have a passing familiarity of these writers and the sorts of stories they tell.\n\n- **Characters and World-Building:**  \n  I enjoyed the characters, the world, and the discussions they had as a result of their circumstances. There was one discussion surrounding a particular Exhibit A that will not leave me at peace, and it should never leave me at peace. It left me turning over a great deal of things on my mind even after finishing the book.\n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  This was my first Adrian Tchaikovsky novel, and it won’t be my last. It’s a really great read for those in the mood for a journey where you come out a little different and a little more thoughtful on the other side.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a thought-provoking and immersive experience, enriched by its literary references, compelling characters, and impactful discussions. The audiobook narration adds to the enjoyment, though some nuances of the format may be better appreciated in print.

The ending was particularly satisfying, connecting all the dots and erasing any frustrations I had while reading.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The world, referred to as the Wasteland, drew numerous parallels to the Fallout franchise, which raised my eyebrows initially. However, I didn’t find this to be a negative aspect, as the story’s world-building eventually tied into its larger themes.  \n\n- **Characters and Concepts:**  \n  The valet robot, [Un]charles, reminded me a lot of Mr. Handy (Wadsworth) from Fallout. While I loathed certain elements like the 'trials from god' and the robot-to-robot communications, these aspects ultimately served a purpose in the story’s broader narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel explored profound themes about humanity, bureaucracy, and meaningful meaninglessness. Everything in the story was interconnected, contributing to the larger messages the author was conveying.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Impact:**  \n  This book is easily one of my top 5 reads this year and has earned a place in my top 50 books of all time. I’m grateful to my sci-fi/fantasy book club for selecting it, and I might have a new favorite author now. I also absolutely adored the author’s vest in the author photo!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its slow start and some initially frustrating elements, the novel delivered a clever, interconnected, and deeply satisfying experience. Its exploration of humanity and bureaucracy, combined with its clever world-building, made it a standout read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Top 5 books of the year  \n- Top 50 books of all time"

            "The story centers on Uncharles, a robot once known as Charles, who served as a valet to an estate owner. Following the owner's death, Uncharles finds himself adrift, searching for a new purpose in a world ravaged by cataclysm. Civilization has collapsed, and humans have seemingly vanished, leaving robots to mindlessly adhere to outdated routines—waiting at gates for visitors who will never come and leaving to-do lists unfulfilled in the absence of meaningful events.",
            "Uncharles transforms from a routine-bound robot into a being capable of introspection and philosophical thought. By the story's conclusion, he realizes that “justice is a human construct, defined by human desire, and does not exist without human involvement.” He proposes that a “kind and ordered” society is a more realistic and meaningful aspiration.",
            "This novel examines the perils of placing blind trust in intelligent machines, paralleling real-world incidents such as plane crashes due to computer overrides and the over 50 fatalities linked to Tesla's autopilot program. It also navigates philosophical and existential themes as Uncharles embarks on a journey toward self-awareness and knowledge. The narrative enriches its exploration through references to Kafka’s *The Trial*, Dante’s *Divine Comedy*, and elements from the New Testament, deepening the robot's quest."

        "conclusion": "The novel is a thought-provoking exploration of artificial intelligence, societal collapse, and the search for meaning in a post-human world.

I get to commiserate. He constantly wishes he could just go through his daily routine, even when that routine is undeniably void of merit. His daily routine, albeit with its clock-in and clock-out annoyances, makes him happy. It makes him feel purposeful. It lets him relax into a somnambulistic duty and shirk off the responsibility of facing -- and thus reacting to -- reality.\n\n- **Plot Engagement:**  \n  So, how far will our robo-hero go to protect his precious escape?\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel *Service Model* successfully captures the appeal of robot-centric storytelling, allowing readers to deeply connect with the protagonist's desire for routine and purpose.

The storyline is superb, and I can easily see this being adapted into a CGI movie before the plot becomes reality.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n  The author’s descriptive passages are fresh and immersive, effectively placing the reader in the scene without resorting to overblown or tedious detail.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing is superb throughout the novel, maintaining engagement and momentum from start to finish.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis offbeat and imaginative novel offers a captivating blend of humor, originality, and immersive storytelling. Its strong plot, vivid descriptions, and excellent pacing make it a highly enjoyable read with potential for cinematic adaptation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the classism in the narrative was a minor point of discomfort, it added to the story’s impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I appreciated the thought-provoking questions it raises and the way it challenges the reader’s perspective, which is a hallmark of the best science fiction.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling addition to the sci-fi genre, particularly for fans of robot-centric stories. Its exploration of post-apocalyptic themes and its ability to provoke deep thinking make it a standout read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the reader’s enthusiasm suggests a high rating, likely 5 stars based on their comparison to other 5-star-rated books."

The humor woven throughout maintains a light tone, even as the stakes escalate. Uncharles's journey from the confines of his mansion to the chaotic outside world is exhilarating, with each discovery and challenge heightening the excitement.",
            "*Service Model* features a delightful cast of characters, each adding their own unique flavor to the narrative. The protagonist, Uncharles, is particularly engaging; his obliviousness brings a charming and endearing humor to the story. His journey from a life of servitude to exploring the decayed world beyond his idyllic mansion is captivating. In contrast, The Wonk, with her sarcastic, teenage attitude, creates a dynamic that keeps the story lively. Their witty interactions are filled with humor that had me laughing out loud.",
            "*Service Model* captivates readers with its engaging and fluid writing style from the very first page. The author's skillful blend of humor, tension, and philosophical reflection creates a balanced and enjoyable narrative. Sharp, witty dialogue, especially in the exchanges between Uncharles and the Wonk, adds to the book's charm. This mix of lightheartedness and profound themes not only entertains but also provokes thoughtful commentary on technology and society.",
            "*Service Model* presents a vividly crafted setting, contrasting pristine, idyllic mansions with the decaying world beyond. This stark juxtaposition effectively underscores the decline of human civilization. Following Uncharles as he transitions from the well-maintained facade of his home to the chaotic reality outside offers a compelling perspective on the state of the world. This journey is particularly poignant, as it is experienced through the eyes of a character who thrives on order and routine, making the disarray he encounters all the more impactful.\n\nThe author excels in worldbuilding, and *Service Model* is no exception. The intricacies of the robot ecosystem, the deteriorating human society, and their interplay are meticulously detailed. The notion that robots do not need to be programmed with sentience to pose a threat is a fascinating twist; their strict adherence to programming leads to unforeseen consequences, blurring the lines between obedience and autonomy. This aspect adds a layer of realism to the narrative, making the robots' actions and the resulting chaos both inevitable and believable.",

Instead, the author explores how robots, by strictly adhering to their directives, could inadvertently trigger their own version of an apocalypse.

It follows an unemployed gentleman’s valet robot navigating a world where technological advancements create both opportunities and profound societal challenges. The narrative is both entertaining and thought-provoking, with light and whimsical passages that balance the heavier themes.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  Tchaikovsky explores themes of corporate irresponsibility, environmental destruction, and the rise of AI. The book masterfully illustrates the consequences of unchecked technological advancement and societal neglect. It is incredibly relevant to today's world and a foreseeable future, challenging readers to reflect on their values and societal direction.  \n\n- **Memorable Passages and Quotes:**  \n  One standout passage encapsulates the paradox of technological progress: “What if, even as you replace everyone with robots that are cheaper and quicker and less likely to join a union or complain about working conditions, you also continue to insist that individual value is tied to production, and everyone who’s idle is a parasite scrounging off the state? Take away the ability of people to perform their own tasks and duties with no steps to provide for them when they are rendered obsolete. A growing rump of humans without function, livelihood, or resource. Paradoxically, the introduction of robots highlights how humans treat humans.” This quote resonates deeply, shedding light on the societal impact of technological progress.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  Tchaikovsky’s narration of the audiobook version is exceptional, adding another layer of engagement to the compelling narrative. His skillful delivery brings the characters and story to life, making the experience even more immersive. He stands out as one of the few authors who could excel as narrators in their own right.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  The book is a thought-provoking read that balances heavy themes with fun and whimsical moments. It serves as a great palate cleanser and is highly recommended to anyone interested in speculative fiction that tackles real-world issues with insight and creativity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Service Model\" is a masterfully crafted novel that combines engaging storytelling, sharp social commentary, and humor. It challenges readers to reflect on societal values and the consequences of technological progress while providing an entertaining and immersive experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the journey and the protagonist's obliviousness to these truths remain entertaining.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a solid novel that offers a thought-provoking exploration of free will, society, and technology. While the pacing could have been tighter and some reveals were predictable, the characters, world-building, and satirical humor make it an enjoyable read. It may not be the author's best work, but it is certainly a worthwhile addition to their repertoire.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this unique story, the protagonist Charles is a robot valet who embodies a distinctly non-human perspective, setting it apart from typical robot narratives that often feature human-like characters. His singular desire to serve and fulfill his tasks drives the plot, which is complicated by the world's interference with his goals. The author's dedication to portraying robots in a truly robotic manner makes this book a standout. Charles' inner monologue, his interactions with humans, and the communication between robots are skillfully crafted and infused with wry humor.",

This satirical weight enhances the story, transforming it into more than just an enjoyable read. It encourages readers to reflect on societal issues while being entertained by its robot-filled narrative.",

The author's clever humor effectively lightens the mood, even within the grim post-apocalyptic setting. While the cover suggests a dystopian world, the humor introduces a refreshing levity that balances the darker themes.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Creativity and Originality:**  \n  This novel is a highly enjoyable standalone release by Adrian Tchaikovsky, showcasing his continual wellspring of creativity. It feels fresh and innovative, much like his other works, such as *Alien Clay*. The story is a unique take on robot fiction, staying true to the classic Asimovian mold while introducing an engaging and clever voice that Asimov’s robot stories often lacked for me.\n\n- **Characterization and Perspective:**  \n  The protagonist, Charles, is a robot valet who thinks and acts in utterly non-human ways, which is refreshingly different from many robot stories where robots are portrayed as almost human-like. Charles’ sole desire is to serve and complete his tasks, and the plot is driven by the world’s interference with this goal. Tchaikovsky’s commitment to having all robots think and act robotically makes the book a unique gem. Charles’ inner monologue, interactions with humans, and robot-to-robot communication are particularly well-crafted and filled with wry humor.\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The dominant emotional tenor of the book is dry comedy, with moments that made me smile or chuckle out loud. Tchaikovsky’s clever humor is deployed brilliantly to lighten the mood, even against the backdrop of a grim, post-apocalyptic setting. The cover hints at the dystopian world, but the humor adds a layer of levity that balances the darker elements.\n\n- **Thematic Depth and Social Commentary:**  \n  Beyond its entertaining plot and humor, the novel offers acerbic social commentary and thematic depth. The satirical weightiness adds impact to the story, making it more than just a fun read. It invites readers to reflect on the world and its issues while being entertained by the robot-filled narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Service Model* is a fun, clever, and worthwhile read that combines humor, unique robot perspectives, and thought-provoking themes. Tchaikovsky’s creativity and commitment to non-human robot characterization make this book stand out in the genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

He teams up with The Wonk, who seeks to understand the meaning of it all, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  The book offers a sharp critique of societal collapse, attributing it to climate change, economic issues, infrastructure failures, and the over-reliance on AI. It highlights the irony of humans being deemed lazy and idle despite their skills becoming obsolete. The breakdown of civilization is further explored through the lens of public awareness, with only a small percentage actively contributing to the collapse.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is smart and often extremely amusing, but the bleakness of the story and the infuriating absurdity of the situations Uncharles faces diminish some of the enjoyment. The moral that a kind and ordered society should be the goal is subtly woven into the narrative.\n\n- **Technical Execution:**  \n  On a technical level, the book is very well done.

I found this one as enjoyable as the first, though it was so different from *Alien Clay*.\n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The story revolves around a world where humanity is a dying breed, utterly reliant on artificial labor and service. When a domesticated robot gets a dangerous idea downloaded into its core programming, it murders its owner and discovers it can run away. The robot enters a wider world it never knew existed, where the hierarchy of humans at the top is disintegrating, and a robot ecosystem devoted to human well-being is finding a new purpose. The premise is summed up by the idea: \"To fix the world, they first must break it further.\"\n\n- **Character Perspective and Development:**  \n  I loved seeing the world through Charles the Robot’s eyes and understanding his routine. It was fascinating to see how everything had its place and how he struggled when something different happened. I felt sympathy for Charles as he tried to figure out the changes that befell him.\n\n- **Genre and Complexity:**  \n  This work is definitely sci-fi with a dystopian twist. The story is quite complex, with many layers throughout the book.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was truly something else. It was interesting and different to have a book solely centered around robots.\n\n- **Reflection on the Theme:**  \n  After reading this, I’m truly glad that robots aren’t taking over.\n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  I am looking forward to what Adrian Tchaikovsky produces next.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was an enjoyable and thought-provoking read, offering a unique perspective through the eyes of a robot in a dystopian, AI-driven world. The complex plot, rich world-building, and emotional depth of the protagonist made it a standout sci-fi experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story was sooooo drawn out, which sapped the enjoyment from many of the chapters. I nearly gave up after the first chapter because it was so tedious, but the tedium is part and parcel of the robot characters that make up this story. It gets slowly better.\n\n- **Influences and Themes:**  \n  Other reviewers have seen parallels to Murderbot, but I felt there was a distinct *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* flavour to this book, especially Marvin the Paranoid Android. The author’s chapter headings indicate influences from KR15-T (Christie), K4FK-R (Kafka), 4W-L (Orwell), 80RH-5 (Borges), and D4NT-A (Dante), only one of whom I have read (Orwell).

I found the humor delightful, especially the absurd bureaucratic exchanges, like Charles’s attempts to confess to murder being dismissed by a Birdbot. The lighthearted yet absurd tone propels the narrative as Charles navigates a world outside his former workplace that has gone awry.",
            "(Un)Charles is a captivating and entertaining protagonist. His insistence on not being a sentient being, along with his demeanor, evokes fond memories of Murderbot from *All Systems Red*. While human characters like The Wonk serve as effective occasional interlocutors, the story truly shines when seen through (Un)Charles’s perspective.",
            "I was delighted to discover the word *actinically*, which means in a manner involving the chemical action of light. This enriched my reading experience significantly.",
            "I particularly enjoyed the imaginative and thought-provoking section set in a robot-run version of Borges’ *The Library of Babel*, born from a misinterpretation of the directive to preserve all human knowledge.",
            "While *Service Model* may not reach the depth of the *Children of Time* trilogy, it delivers a clever and humorous 21st-century take on a classic sci-fi theme, reminiscent of *The Machine Stops* and *Mockingbird*. The narrative shifts from deep cynicism to cautious optimism, creating a memorable impact.",
            "I was pleasantly surprised to find that *Service Model* is a post-apocalyptic black comedy, a notable shift from the author's typical hard sci-fi thrillers. Its tone evokes *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* and *Futurama*, brimming with clever nods to literature and pop culture, including multiple references to *Hitchhiker’s Guide*."

        "conclusion": "*Service Model* is a fun, witty romp through a post-apocalyptic world, blending humor, absurdity, and thought-provoking themes. While it may not reach the depth of the author's other works, it offers a fresh and entertaining take on classic sci-fi preoccupations.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  I was surprised to discover that *Service Model* is a post-apocalyptic black comedy, a departure from Adrian Tchaikovsky’s usual hard sci-fi thrillers. The tone is reminiscent of *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* and *Futurama*, filled with amusing nods to literature and popular culture, including several references to *Hitchhiker’s Guide*.\n\n- **Plot and Humor:**  \n  The plot follows a robot valet, formerly known as Charles, on his quest to find new employment after an unfortunate incident. I found the humor delightful, particularly the absurd bureaucratic exchanges, such as Charles’s attempts to confess to murder being dismissed by a Birdbot. The lighthearted yet absurd tone carries the story forward as Charles discovers the world outside his former workplace has gone awry.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  I particularly enjoyed the section set in a robot-run version of Borges’ *The Library of Babel*, which results from a misinterpretation of the instruction to preserve all human knowledge. This setting was both imaginative and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Characters and Perspective:**  \n  (Un)Charles is an excellent, highly entertaining protagonist. His insistence that he is not a sentient person and his general demeanor reminded me fondly of Murderbot from *All Systems Red*. The human characters, like The Wonk, work well as periodic interlocutors, but the story is much more engaging when viewed from (Un)Charles’s perspective.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  While *Service Model* lacks the profundity of Tchaikovsky’s *Children of Time* trilogy, it offers a smart and hilarious 21st-century spin on a recurring sci-fi theme, akin to works like *The Machine Stops* and *Mockingbird*. The story swerves from profoundly cynical to cautiously hopeful, leaving a lasting impression.\n\n- **Language and Learning:**  \n  I was pleased to learn a new word: *actinically*, meaning in a manner involving the chemical action of light. This added an extra layer of enjoyment to the reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* is a fun, witty romp through a post-apocalyptic world, blending humor, absurdity, and thought-provoking themes. While it may not reach the depth of Tchaikovsky’s other works, it offers a fresh and entertaining take on classic sci-fi preoccupations.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The introduction of a God figure, represented by a computer program, enriches its philosophical depth.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Innovation and Experimentation:**  \n  Tchaikovsky is an innovative author who consistently tries new types of stories, characters, viewpoints, and narrative structures. He experiments with forms outside his comfort zone, which is commendable. However, in this book, his attempt at Wodehousian humor falls flat, as the absurdist and slapstick situations fail to evoke genuine laughter.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Pacing:**  \n  The lengthy, dry dialogues between robots, while intellectually engaging, can feel tedious and slow the narrative flow. Some passages could have been edited for better pacing. That said, the inner dialogue of the main character, Charles the robot valet, is intriguing as he grapples with his supposed lack of sentience, raising questions about logic versus emotion.  \n\n- **Themes and Allegory:**  \n  The novel explores profound themes such as the purpose of life, the search for meaning, and the nature of justice. It transitions from a story about artificial intelligence and post-apocalyptic survival to an allegory reminiscent of works like *The Pilgrim’s Progress*. The inclusion of a \"God\" figure (a computer program) adds depth to the philosophical undertones.  \n\n- **Social Critique:**  \n  Tchaikovsky delivers a scathing critique of modern capitalism, particularly the concentration of wealth and power among billionaires and the societal impact of AI-driven automation. The novel highlights the hypocrisy of blaming jobless individuals for their plight while failing to redistribute the benefits of technological advancements.  \n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  Despite its ambitious themes and intellectual depth, the novel doesn’t fully succeed in integrating its many components into a cohesive whole. While it offers entertaining moments, such as the interactions with the robot detective and the overzealous librarians, it feels like it bites off more than it can chew.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a mixed bag of ambitious ideas, innovative storytelling, and thought-provoking themes. While it doesn’t quite achieve the brilliance of Tchaikovsky’s other works, it remains an interesting and worthwhile read, especially for fans of speculative fiction and satirical narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n8+"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Character Development:**\n  - UnCharles, the valet android, is portrayed as somewhat dense, viewing the world as a riddle. His thought process and dialogue took some time to get used to, but it added to his charm.\n  - The Wonk is a very enjoyable character, and the dynamic between UnCharles and The Wonk made for an interesting duo.\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**\n  - The first chapter felt like a poorly played but enjoyable game of Clue, with slow-thinking robots.\n  - Each subsequent chapter presented new challenges for UnCharles to figure out, keeping the narrative engaging and varied.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n  - The book is filled with great quotes, particularly from UnCharles, which add depth and humor to the story.\n  - The author, Mr. Tchaikovsky, demonstrates versatility in crafting this tale.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**\n  - Unlike other robots such as Spofforth in Walter Tevis’ *Mockingbird* or Pixar’s Wall-E, UnCharles is depicted as less intuitive and more puzzle-like in his approach to the world.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel offers a unique and enjoyable experience, with charming characters, an engaging plot, and a writing style that balances humor and depth. The dynamic between UnCharles and The Wonk, along with the varied challenges presented in each chapter, makes for a compelling read. It’s another testament to Mr. Tchaikovsky’s versatility as a storyteller.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Four stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Comparison to Influential Authors:**  \n  The novel follows in the footsteps of Isaac Asimov and Philip K. Dick but takes the exploration of artificial intelligence and independence further by presenting the story entirely from the perspective of a robot protagonist. It also incorporates a jovial tone reminiscent of Douglas Adams, though without the absurdity.\n\n- **Unique Perspective:**  \n  Unlike Asimov’s works, which never fully adopted a robot’s point of view (except for *The Caliban Trilogy* by Roger McBride Allen, which was blessed by Asimov), *Service Model* offers a fresh and immersive experience. The only other comparable work I can think of is the *Adam Link Robot* stories by Eando Binder.\n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  Adrian Tchaikovsky’s writing is brilliant, mastering tone while weaving a complex and dismal commentary on humanity’s current state through the eyes of a robot striving to fulfill its programming as a valet. The philosophical exploration of independence and artificial intelligence is both thought-provoking and engaging.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The novel is slow-paced, with the protagonist, Uncharles, moving from scenario to scenario in search of answers. While the journey requires patience, the climactic reveal and satisfying epilogue make it worthwhile. The deliberate pacing adds depth to the narrative and enhances the payoff.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and consider it a modern classic. I will definitely revisit it and am eager to explore more of Tchaikovsky’s works. I highly recommend it to fans of speculative fiction and those interested in AI and philosophical themes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* is a standout novel that combines the intellectual depth of Asimov and Dick with a unique, robot-centric perspective and a touch of humor.

The transitions between locations often lack motivation from the protagonist's choices, disrupting the narrative's flow and cohesion.",

This unique perspective, similar to *Ancillary Justice*, offers a non-human protagonist's viewpoint, which is intriguing and refreshing.\n\n- **Premise and World-Building:**  \n  The story presents a kind of \"stupid apocalypse,\" akin to *Idiocracy*, where the robots, designed for specific tasks, are unaware of what happened to the humans or even that humans no longer exist. This premise is both amusing and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Character Agency:**  \n  What ultimately lets the book down is the protagonist's lack of agency. Being a robot, he is limited by his programming and must be driven forward by other characters and plot conveniences rather than his own internal goals. This lack of agency makes the protagonist feel passive and diminishes the narrative's momentum.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book suffers from uneven pacing and a slightly disjointed feeling. The story moves between locations, but these transitions are not driven by the protagonist's choices, which disrupts the flow and cohesion of the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book's unique narrative perspective and intriguing premise are its strengths, the protagonist's lack of agency and resulting pacing issues detract from the overall experience. It’s an interesting read but could have been more compelling with a more active and goal-driven protagonist.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was vignette after vignette really hammering you over the head without a lot of subtlety.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Still, the lovable, incorrigible Wonk and conscientious Uncharles carried the book with their characterizations. I can see why some have made comparisons to Murderbot, with lots of wry humor and even some sly pop culture references to go around!\n\n- **Editing and Potential:**  \n  With some more judicious editing, this could totally have been a five-star read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel starts strong with a compelling murder mystery and engaging protagonist, but its shift to heavy-handed social commentary detracts from its potential.

It follows a sophisticated valet robot, Charles (later renamed Uncharles), who grapples with the inexplicable murder of his master and his subsequent banishment. As he embarks on a journey to fulfill his task list, the reader observes through his naive perspective the collapse of human society and the absurdity of existence. The novel feels like a speculative, futuristic version of *Candide*, satirizing society through the misadventures and gradual disillusionment of its optimistic protagonist.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Uncharles is a compelling protagonist, and his interactions with a diverse cast of characters—bureaucrats, law enforcement, scholars, pseudo-religious entities, commoners, military personnel, and other robots—are both entertaining and thought-provoking. A standout supporting character is \"The Wonk,\" a quirky alleged robot who steals the show with his eccentricity and memorable name.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Experience):**  \n  Adrian Tchaikovsky narrates the audiobook himself, delivering a perfect rendition of Uncharles' inner monologues and his dialogues with the colorful characters he encounters. The audio experience is highly recommended for its immersive quality.  \n\n- **Reflection and Depth:**  \n  The novel is not only amusing but also deeply thought-provoking. It explores themes of what it means to be alive (both for humans and beyond) and the journey toward constructing a more just and equitable society.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  This is my first Adrian Tchaikovsky book, but it won’t be my last. I highly recommend it to fans of sci-fi, satire, quirky characters, quests for meaning, and cozy dystopian vibes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a brilliant blend of humor, satire, and philosophical reflection, offering a unique sci-fi experience that is both entertaining and profound. The audiobook narration by the author adds an extra layer of immersion, making it a standout choice for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars.  \n\nThank you to the Macmillan Audio Influencer Program for the complementary audiobook in exchange for my honest review."

Along the way, he encounters a character called the Wonk, who is investigating the reasons behind the collapse. The narrative delves into themes of identity, purpose, and the shortcomings of human systems in their absence. It’s a quietly engaging tale that skillfully blends humor, introspection, and a sense of devastation.",

His journey is both personal and philosophical as he navigates his existence in a world devoid of humans. The Wonk is a charming character, and their dynamic enriches the narrative. I especially appreciated the robot Adam and the unique voice Tchaikovsky provided for him.",

The book maintains a quiet charm without ever feeling dull, showcasing the author's talent for engaging readers with unconventional subjects—such as giant spiders in his other works.",
            "This book masterfully illustrates how human-made systems falter in the absence of people, providing a thought-provoking examination of collapse and adaptation. The sense of devastation is striking, yet the narrative maintains a balance of levity and introspection, preventing it from becoming overly bleak. With a strong focus on character development, the story remains attuned to the broader world around it.",

I listened to the audiobook, narrated by the author, and he did an exceptional job. Authors reading their own books doesn’t always work for me, but this was a standout performance, comparable to Neil Gaiman’s narration.\n\n- **Comparisons and Expectations:**  \n  I was initially worried because the book was compared to *Murderbot* and *Redshirts*, which I adore and like, respectively. I often find comp titles misleading, as they seem like marketing tactics rather than accurate reflections of the story. However, Tchaikovsky is a big name in sci-fi and doesn’t need such comparisons. The book reminded me of Becky Chambers’ *Monk and Robot* series, though less cozy, and had a post-apocalyptic vibe.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows a robot named Charles, later Un-Charles, who inexplicably murders his human master and embarks on a journey of self-discovery in a collapsed human civilization. Along the way, he meets a character called \"the Wonk,\" who is investigating the collapse. The book explores themes of identity, purpose, and the failure of human systems in the absence of humans. It’s a quiet yet engaging story, blending humor, introspection, and a sense of devastation.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Un-Charles insists he’s incapable of feeling, but his thoughts and actions suggest otherwise. His journey is both personal and philosophical, as he grapples with his role in a world without humans. The Wonk is a delightful character, and their dynamic adds depth to the narrative. I particularly enjoyed the robot Adam and the voice Tchaikovsky gave him.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The book excels in showing how human-created systems fail without humans, offering a thought-provoking exploration of collapse and adaptation. The scope of devastation is palpable, but the story avoids being dreary by balancing levity and introspection. It’s a character-driven narrative that doesn’t lose sight of the wider world.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Tchaikovsky’s writing is both humorous and thoughtful, with moments of endearing misinterpretation by Un-Charles. The book feels quiet yet never boring, and the author’s ability to make readers care about unconventional subjects (like giant spiders in his other works) is a testament to his skill.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a highly engaging and thought-provoking novel that blends humor, introspection, and a post-apocalyptic setting. Tchaikovsky’s narration adds to the experience, and the story’s exploration of identity, purpose, and collapse is both compelling and unique.

While the idea of parodying celebrated authors is cool, the execution felt forced and clunky, detracting from the story’s flow and enjoyment.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really liked the characters of Uncharles and The Wonk. Their relationship was a highlight of the book, adding depth and warmth to the narrative. However, Uncharles lacked the zip and ironic self-awareness of characters like Murderbot, which made him feel less engaging in comparison.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The premise was intriguing—a robot valet, Uncharles, seeking purpose in a dystopian world. However, the second half of the book felt like a slog, with repetitive roadblocks and a disheartening tone. The commitment to parodying famous authors hindered the story’s momentum and joy.\n\n- **Philosophical Elements:**  \n  The intellectual and philosophical aspects of the book were thought-provoking but often overshadowed the fun and heart of the story. The section involving god felt confusing and underwhelming, possibly because I hadn’t read the Divine Comedy.\n\n- **Humor and Writing Style:**  \n  There were some incredibly sharp and funny lines, especially in the first section (named after Agatha Christie). The writing was enjoyable in places, with clever observations and wit, but these moments were sporadic.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The resolution of why Charles sliced his Master’s throat was a letdown. It didn’t feel as impactful or meaningful as I had hoped, leaving me somewhat unsatisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile \"Service Model\" had its moments, particularly in the relationship between Uncharles and The Wonk and some witty writing, the overall experience was mixed. The philosophical focus and literary parodies often detracted from the story’s flow and enjoyment. I would recommend it to readers who enjoy dystopian fiction, religious metaphors, and AI-related themes, but with the caveat that it may not fully deliver on its potential.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5, rounded up."

It delves into themes of self-awareness, programming, and the remnants of human influence. Their journey is marked by encounters with other robots trapped in endless programming loops, blending humor and poignancy. While the narrative evokes comparisons to *Waiting for Godot*—with characters actively seeking answers rather than waiting—the pacing occasionally drags, and the ending feels muddled and incomplete, leaving the fate of the world unresolved. Overall, the story is engaging but could benefit from a tighter conclusion.",
            "Uncharles is a robot created to serve humans, but he possesses the ability to break free from his programming, granting him a degree of self-awareness. While I found him likable, he ultimately lacked personality and became less compelling as the story progressed. In contrast, Wonk emerged as a standout character.

The plot is driven by their encounters with other robots stuck in endless programming loops, which is both funny and sad.

While I liked him, he lacked personality and wasn’t particularly compelling, especially towards the end. Wonk, on the other hand, was a standout character.

For example, Uncharles' polite apologies for perceived breaches of decorum are amusing in their robotic precision. However, the humor is subtle and does not detract from the darker themes.  \n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  The audiobook, narrated by Adrian Tchaikovsky himself, is exceptionally well done. His robotic intonations are spot-on, and he brings The Wonk's brogue to life with a colorful and fun accent. The pacing is excellent, and the narration remains engaging despite the monotone robotic responses and repetitions that dominate much of the dialogue.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* is a thought-provoking and unpredictable novel that delves into a dark, dystopian world through the lens of a malfunctioning robot. While it lacks the humor and emotional depth of similar works, it excels in prompting deeper reflection on societal and technological issues. The audiobook narration is a standout feature, enhancing the story's engagement and immersion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The reveal of the proposed idea was interesting and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Humor and Social Commentary:**\n  - The humor in the book is sharp, especially in portraying the dysfunction of the world. I laughed out loud multiple times.\n  - I drew parallels between the robots in the story, who are \"stuck in their programming,\" and real-world humans who are \"stuck in their ways,\" causing suffering and collapse. This interpretation might align with the book’s themes, though it could also reflect my own bleak view of humanity.\n\n- **World-Building and Believability:**\n  - The programming of the robots in the story felt a bit questionable, but I was willing to suspend disbelief, especially given my experience with awful code in software.

While UnCharles is no MurderBot, I found myself staying for UnCharles' unique character. UnCharles is a robot who may or may not be self-aware, and his primary concern is the disruption to his logical thought processes rather than any hacked governor module.\n\n- **Narrative Perspective and World-Building:**  \n  The story is told from UnCharles' perspective, which initially masks the catastrophic state of both his manor house and the world at large. His journey from relative safety to chaos reminded me of John Bunyan's *Pilgrim's Progress*. The narrative is rich with allegory, and I appreciated the author's ambition and trust in modern readers to grasp its depth.\n\n- **Literary Influences and Chapter Headings:**  \n  The chapter headings cleverly reference literary influences such as Christie, Kafka, Orwell, Borges, and Dante. I recognized Christie, Orwell, and Dante, but my lack of familiarity with Kafka and Borges meant some nuances were lost on me. This added layer of literary homage enriched the reading experience.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author’s Skill:**  \n  Once I adjusted my expectations (accepting that not everything can be MurderBot), I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It was a refreshing change of pace, and I’m now intrigued to explore more of Tchaikovsky’s work, particularly his novellas, given his reputation in that form.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is an ambitious and thought-provoking read, blending allegory with a unique narrative perspective.

It follows Charles, a robot who inadvertently defies his programming and embarks on a quest to understand his existence. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of AI, emphasizing the limitations of artificial intelligence and how vague instructions can create unforeseen complications instead of resolving human issues.",
            "In this story, Charles, the protagonist, serves as an unreliable narrator whose worldview is anchored in precision and order. His quest to confront the flaws in his logic and discover viable solutions within his programming is both engaging and thought-provoking. While the supporting characters are archetypal, they are well-developed, with the Wonk acting as a guiding figure reminiscent of Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio.",

The story serves as both a warning about the perils of AI and a reminder of the limitations of artificial intelligence, highlighting how imprecise orders can lead to unforeseen complications rather than solving human problems.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Charles, the protagonist, is an unreliable narrator whose perspective is rooted in precision and order.

            "The story unfolds as a picaresque journey, with the protagonist navigating a series of diverse situations. While this format is effective, it risks overstaying its welcome by the end of several episodes. Each episode skillfully explores the tropes of classic authors like Christie, Kafka, and Borges.",
            "The novel presents a society where embodied robots operate like AI chatbots and spammers, leading to a dwindling human population. This intriguing premise is primarily played for humor, showcasing robots that, while not entirely inept, are comically constrained by their programming. The plot centers on a robot valet fixated on securing a new job that involves organizing schedules and arranging clothes.",
            "The humor in the book is hit or miss. While the author doesn't quite master it, the style occasionally veers toward the wearisome humor found in Sanderson or Scalzi's works. Fortunately, it never fully crosses that line and offers moments of genuine delight."

        "conclusion": "The novel presents a humorous and absurd take on a society dominated by robots with limited programming.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Concept and Premise:**  \n  The novel explores a society where embodied robots function like AI chatbots and spammers, with humans becoming increasingly scarce. The premise is intriguing and played mostly for humor, particularly in depicting robots as not exactly dumb but absurdly limited by their programming. The driving force of the plot is a robot valet obsessed with finding a new job organizing schedules and laying out clothes.\n\n- **Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The story is structured as a picaresque journey, with the protagonist moving from one situation to another. While this format works well, it feels like it’s on the verge of wearing out its welcome by the end of several episodes. Each episode mines the tropes of archetypical authors like Christie, Kafka, and Borges.\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The humor is a mixed bag. Adrian Tchaikovsky isn’t a master of humor, and at times, the book strays close to the kind of humor found in Sanderson or Scalzi novels, which can be tiresome. However, it never fully crosses that line and is occasionally delightful.\n\n- **Award-Worthiness and Personal Preference:**  \n  While the book is enjoyable, it feels too light to be seriously considered for awards like the Hugo. The reader personally prefers Tchaikovsky’s upcoming work, *Alien Clay*, but acknowledges that this novel could plausibly occupy a slot similar to *Starter Villain* from the previous year. It’s deemed more deserving than that comparison suggests.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents a humorous and absurd take on a society dominated by robots with limited programming. While its picaresque structure and humor are engaging, they occasionally feel stretched thin. It’s a fun read but ultimately too light to be considered award-worthy, though it stands out more than comparable works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores are mentioned in the review."

His growing self-questioning is well-developed, and his early attempts to manipulate other robots with new phrasings are amusing.  \n\n- **Philosophical Elements:**  \n  After the halfway point, the book delves into philosophy, which I thought was fine but might not appeal to everyone.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Nearing the end, the world is falling apart, and the plot becomes somewhat fragmented. The ending feels inevitable, with a tiny band of optimists plodding off into the sunset, believing \"It Isn't Over Yet.\"  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The \"God\" stuff near the end provides some explanation of events but falls short of fully explaining how that entity achieved its goals.

It explores the rigid logic trees that govern robots, resulting in absurd scenarios such as endless queues and grammatical disputes. While it initially seems to satirize the complexities of AI, the story ultimately addresses deeper themes of late-stage capitalism, the value of human life, and humanity's role in its own demise. The introduction of robots as a labor force emphasizes society's tendency to equate human worth with productivity, leading to a troubling devaluation of humanity in the face of robotic dominance.

It also delves into philosophical discussions and includes biblical references.  \n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  The story follows Uncharles, a robot valet serving a master in a distant (or not so distant) future.

Along the way, he meets the rebellious robot Wonk, and together they encounter strange robots fulfilling their programmed purposes in bizarre ways, as well as a few humans.  \n\n- **Thought-Provoking Elements:**  \n  One quote particularly stood out to me: “Justice, which demands the guilty be punished and the innocent left alone. However, between those two absolutes there is a slider. If you wish a societal system where not one guilty individual escapes punishment, you move that slider one way. If you wish a societal system where not one of the innocent is chastised, you shift it the other. But to save all the innocent you must accept that you will acquit some of the guilty. To catch all the guilty, some of the innocent will be ground between wheels.” This resonated deeply with me, as it echoes a question my dad used to ask: Is it better to prosecute an innocent man or to let guilty ones go free?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a richly layered and thought-provoking exploration of a collapsed world, blending influences from classic literature with philosophical and biblical themes. While the pacing occasionally slows, each section contributes meaningfully to the overarching narrative.

The humor is clever and adds a unique charm to the story.\n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  The book offers a brilliant commentary on our lazy lives and serves as a massive indictment of our entire way of life. It explores deep themes through the lens of a service model robot navigating a devastated world.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Charles, the service model robot (later called Uncharles), is a fascinating character. His journey from a valet with a pointless existence to a more self-aware being is compelling. The Wonk, a quirkily spoken companion who is not actually a robot, adds depth and intrigue to the story.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel presents a devastated world, which becomes increasingly apparent to Charles as he travels. The setting is vividly described, and the slow realization of the world's state adds to the story's impact.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is engaging, with a mix of humor, tragedy, and philosophical exploration. The journey of Charles and the Wonk is filled with crises and revelations, culminating in a thought-provoking encounter with \"God.\"\n\n- **Originality and Genre:**  \n  This is absolutely brilliant sci-fi, with a unique premise and execution. The blend of humor, tragedy, and deep philosophical questions makes it stand out in the genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a masterful blend of humor, tragedy, and philosophical commentary, brought to life by the author's excellent narration. It’s a thought-provoking and engaging sci-fi story that deserves high praise.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nProbably deserves 5 stars, but I’m a conservative."

Instead, the dystopian landscape, shaped by robots over-caring for humanity, reminded me of Isaac Asimov's *The Robots of Dawn*.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Uncharles is a highly sympathetic character. He insists he lacks free will and sentience, yet his actions consistently suggest otherwise. He is trapped in his own narrative, believing his sole purpose is to serve as a Valet, though he spends most of his time doing something entirely different. The exploration of the thin line between free will and programmed priorities is thought-provoking and almost dissolves under scrutiny.\n\n- **Writing Style and Engagement:**  \n  Tchaikovsky’s writing is consistently engrossing, especially in his science fiction works. This book feels like a departure from some of his recent themes, but it ultimately circles back to profound existential questions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling and thought-provoking read, blending dark humor with deep existential themes.

However, by the end, I found it more comparable to Jo Walton's \"The Just City.\" While it does feature a relatively sentient robot and societal collapse, it leans more toward being a philosophical treatise than a plot-driven sci-fi novel.  \n\n- **Philosophical Depth:**  \n  I typically dislike philosophy, but I enjoyed this book, much like I did with \"The Just City.\" Perhaps I prefer my philosophy embedded in sci-fi rather than discussed in abstract terms.

Through a somewhat amusing sequence of events, other robots, constrained by their narrow governing parameters, are unable to process what has happened. Uncharles is sent into a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by human greed and selfishness.

The concept of the robot Librarians charging in to save data was also a great addition.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Where the story fell short for me was in Uncharles’ lack of personality development.

It balances humor with moments of contemplation, making me laugh while also prompting me to think deeply.  \n\n- **Plot and Emotional Resonance:**  \n  At its core, the story is a funny, ridiculous, and sometimes sad tale about a robot trying to find its place in the wasteland of a fallen civilization.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  While the science-fiction elements may not be as engrossing as Tchaikovsky’s *Children* series, and the humor may not reach the riotous levels of his *Tyrant Philosopher* series, *Service Model* is still a worthy addition to his body of work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* is a unique and thought-provoking sci-fi novel that combines humor with insightful commentary on modern society. While it may not surpass Tchaikovsky’s other series in certain aspects, it remains a strong and enjoyable story from a masterful storyteller.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

            "Charles/Uncharles is an endearing protagonist, a remarkable feat considering the repetitive protocols he navigates. His character brings depth and relatability to the narrative.

It was consistently surprising, as I never knew what would happen next or where the story would ultimately end.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  On the surface, it’s a post-apocalyptic quest for meaning, but it delves deeply into themes like our current relationship with AI, classism, productivity, and the concept of who is \"worthy\" of rest. The story forces the reader to confront the consequences of societal structures that, once set in motion, cannot be undone simply because they are no longer useful or desired.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really enjoyed getting to know the characters and found myself deeply invested in their outcomes. I wanted the best for them, which made the story even more engaging.  \n\n- **Author and Narration:**  \n  This was my first read from this author, and I’m excited to explore more of his work. He also narrated the audiobook, and his performance was exceptional—I was truly blown away by his skill as a narrator.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a thought-provoking and unpredictable journey that masterfully blends humor, depth, and social commentary.

Nearly all of them were witty and engaging, and as an avid sci-fi reader, I caught almost all of them except for the Metatron reference. Some moments bordered on prop comedy, while others had a distinctive Douglas Adams' *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* (HHGTG) vibe, which the book respectfully acknowledges multiple times.\n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book reads like a fusion of Monty Python and *HHGTG*, creating a unique blend of humor, tragedy, and creepiness.

This creative structuring adds depth and intrigue to the narrative.\n\n- **Section Analysis:**  \n  - **KR15-T (Christie, Agatha):**  \n    This section is a classic murder mystery with a twist: the butler confesses to the crime, but everyone is robots, and society has already collapsed.  \n  - **K3FK-R (Kafka, Franz):**  \n    This section is filled with Kafkaesque absurdity, as Uncharles (formerly Charles) navigates the nonsensical bureaucracy of Central Services. Here, we meet the deuteragonist, The Wonk.  \n  - **4W-L (Orwell, George):**  \n    This section depicts an underground farm where humans perform meaningless busywork under constant surveillance by a single overseer, evoking Orwellian themes of control and oppression.  \n  - **80RH-5 (Borges, Jorge Luis):**  \n    This section explores the futility of seeking meaning in the infinite, reminiscent of Borges’ *The Library of Babel*, as Uncharles and The Wonk navigate the Central Library Archive.  \n  - **D4NT-A (Dante):**  \n    This section takes Uncharles and The Wonk on a journey through a hellish landscape after ascending a towering mountain, drawing parallels to Dante’s *Inferno*.\n\n- **Themes and Writing Style:**  \n  The novel encapsulates frustration in a relatable and mundane way, making it an intelligently written and thought-provoking read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed this novel for its creative structure, literary inspirations, and its ability to convey frustration in a deeply relatable manner.

On top of being a great writer, he also excels as a narrator in the audiobook version. His storytelling ability truly shines, making the experience enjoyable and immersive.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This book reaffirms my love for the science fiction genre. It delves into thought-provoking topics such as self-determination, AI and its impact on both robots and humans, free will, and existentialism. These themes are explored in a way that is both engaging and intellectually stimulating.\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The book emphasizes the journey rather than the destination. While some might expect a more conclusive ending, I appreciated the focus on the process and the development of ideas and characters throughout the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  One character, in particular, stood out to me: The Wonk. This character has earned a place among my all-time favorites due to their depth, uniqueness, and the role they play in the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Tchaikovsky’s skillful writing and narration, combined with the rich themes and memorable characters, make it a standout in the science fiction genre.

However, the technology does not adapt further, suggesting the absence of AI. The narrative begins with a robot valet named Charles (or UnCharles) who manages a manor filled with similar robots, all performing tasks while the Master does very little for a decade. Suddenly, things change, leading to a series of hijinks and a long journey to uncover what happened and why.\n\n- **Writing Style and Cadence:**  \n  The book is very good overall, but the reading cadence can feel halting at times due to the robots speaking in \"commands.\" Despite this, the effort to read through these sections is worthwhile.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents an intriguing and unusual exploration of a world dominated by robots and technology, with a compelling plot that keeps the reader engaged. While the robotic dialogue can disrupt the reading flow, the story's depth and originality make it a rewarding experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I enjoyed the narration, which added depth to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Charles/UnCharles, a sophisticated service model valet for humans, who embarks on a quest to find purpose after his master is “murdered.” The plot explores the difficulty of finding a new boss in a world where humans are scarce due to the collapse of human civilization. It’s thought-provoking to ponder the meaning of life and one’s own purpose in relation to this narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Charles/UnCharles is a compelling character whose journey from a loyal valet to a seeker of purpose is both engaging and reflective. His transformation after being stripped of his title adds depth to his character.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The setting of a post-collapse human civilization is intriguing and well-crafted. The scarcity of humans and the challenges faced by UnCharles in this world create a unique and immersive backdrop for the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* is a thought-provoking and well-narrated novel that explores themes of purpose and existence through the journey of its protagonist, Charles/UnCharles.

He keeps trying to fulfill his role and find a human to serve.  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story begins with a violent act that Uncharles doesn't remember, which sets him out on his journey. I kept thinking I knew where Tchaikovsky was taking us, but I was wrong.  \n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The way Uncharles tries to make every situation fit into his mission (making tea, helping schedule social events, providing laundry services, etc.) is hysterical.  \n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  We visit a repair center where he meets an ally, which adds depth to the world.  \n- **Appeal to Non-Sci-Fi Fans:**  \n  I'm not a typical sci-fi fan, but this book managed to captivate me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations with its charming protagonist, unexpected plot twists, and humorous tone.

The idea of Charles embarking on a journey of self-discovery after an accident involving the manor's owner was compelling.\n\n- **Character Development (Charles):**  \n  Charles serves as a metaphor for finding oneself, and I appreciated how he explored different concepts like prioritizing work or religion. However, his journey became somewhat repetitive, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While I loved the beginning of the book, the story lost some of its shine as the journey progressed.

The reveal at the end, which critiques the state of the real world and our trust in technology, was thought-provoking and well-executed.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  Some reviews compare this novel to the *Murderbot* series by Martha Wells. While it shares a similar vein, I found this to be more like a precursor to *Murderbot*. I liked Charles, but he doesn’t quite match the depth or appeal of Murderbot.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I enjoyed my time with this book, though I found the beginning more captivating than the entire journey. Despite its flaws, I wouldn’t mind reading more about Charles or exploring this world further.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a thought-provoking and intelligent novel with a strong concept and satirical edge. While the repetitive nature of Charles' journey and uneven pacing slightly diminished my enjoyment, the book’s themes and world-building left a lasting impression. It’s a worthwhile read, especially for fans of speculative fiction and social commentary.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nInitially, I was ready to give this book five stars, but my final rating would likely be around four stars due to the repetitive elements and pacing issues."

Initially, the protocol-following felt tedious, but by the 30% mark, personality began to emerge, and by halfway through, I was fully invested. The slow growth was intentional, making Un-Charles’s journey of discovery more profound and impactful.\n\n- **Humor:**  \n  The humor became more prevalent as the story progressed, and it included the single funniest moment I’ve encountered in Tchaikovsky’s works. This alone made the book worth reading.\n\n- **Concept and Writing:**  \n  While the concept of robots and post-global-trauma stories wasn’t revolutionary, it was executed well. The writing was compelling, and the concept was interesting enough to compensate for any shortcomings.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook, narrated by Tchaikovsky himself, was a pleasant surprise. His performance was seamless, with a warm, proper British accent reminiscent of the Winnie the Pooh narrator. This added an innocent, childlike quality to Un-Charles, enhancing the earnestness of his journey. While this might not resonate with everyone, it greatly enhanced my experience.\n\n- **Recommendations:**  \n  For newcomers to Tchaikovsky’s works, this might not be the best starting point. However, for fans, it’s a solid middle-tier read with robot fun, good humor, and a quick pace.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile not my favorite Tchaikovsky novel, *Service Model* was still a quality and enjoyable read.

Despite its originality, the book may not achieve the same success as *Murderbot*, and the unexpected religious twist adds an intriguing but puzzling layer to the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5"

The evolving tone was handled skillfully, though the plot felt somewhat disjointed, resembling a series of loosely connected vignettes rather than a cohesive novel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "The novel follows Uncharles, a robot on an existential journey to find meaning and purpose after its master's death. While the repetitiveness of the absurdity may be intentional to reflect the character's experiences, it often feels excessive. Some scenes could have been trimmed to enhance engagement without sacrificing thematic depth. Throughout the story, Uncharles repeatedly encounters various entities and places it believes will provide answers, only to confront the futility of its quest.",

While some readers may find this humor engaging, I felt that the prolonged scenes detracted from the overall experience."

Despite its flaws, the book offers a unique exploration of meaning and purpose in a chaotic world.",

            "The book opens strongly, with the first part being my favorite. The humorous premise of Charles, a valet robot, accidentally killing his master is both engaging and entertaining. However, as the story progresses into a dystopian world marked by deteriorating robots and absent humans, the pacing shifts. The third part, featuring Dr. Washburn's social engineering experiment, is intriguing but introduces a slower tempo. The fourth part becomes more philosophical, losing some of its earlier momentum, with certain moments feeling drawn out or forgettable. While the ending raises compelling questions about justice and the consequences of human actions, it feels rushed and unresolved. The revelation regarding God’s role in the apocalypse is impactful, underscoring the cyclical nature of human error.",
            "Charles, later known as Uncharles, was a standout character whose transformation from a programmed robot to one wrestling with free will and emotions was deeply satisfying. The Wonk, a human girl masquerading as a robot, brought humor and depth to the narrative. Memorable characters like the defective Birdbot and Sergeant Lune enhanced the comedic elements of the story. However, the encounter with King Ubot felt superfluous and did not significantly contribute to the overall plot.",
            "This book delves into themes of autonomy, free will, sentience, and the repercussions of human creation. Uncharles’ quest for self-understanding and the robots’ search for meaning are both compelling. The narrative raises thought-provoking questions about the potential for human-designed programs to rebel against their creators, though this idea isn't entirely original. While the ending addresses justice and the imperfections of human society, it leaves some aspects feeling unresolved.",
            "The first half of the book is highly engaging, striking a perfect balance between humor and intrigue. However, the pacing falters in the second half, especially in Part 4, where the philosophical discussions and slower narrative make it challenging to maintain interest. Despite this, there are still impactful moments, such as Uncharles's encounter with a terrified human family."

The first half is a solid 4-star read with some 5-star highlights, while the second half could benefit from trimming to maintain momentum. The exploration of themes like free will and the consequences of human creation is thought-provoking, though the pacing and ending could be improved.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Concept and Themes:**  \n  The novel tackles the heady topic of AI and sentience, exploring what it means to be human. The ideas are worthy, and the setting is intriguing, but the execution feels a bit forced. Tchaikovsky attempts to show that the human condition, as it currently exists, is already efficient, and replacing humans with automatons wouldn’t look much different. However, the big questions present in his other novels are either missing or not as deeply explored here.\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story follows a butler robot that wakes up to find it has murdered its master while in shaving mode. The robot is then sent to central processing for diagnosis, leading to a series of adventures involving a museum display of the human condition and other quests. While the plot is entertaining, it feels like it would have been better suited as a short story rather than a full-length novel. The adventures, though engaging, come across as somewhat contrived.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The butler robot is the central character, and its journey is both enlightening and absurd. The interplay between the robot police and the robot doctor highlights the ridiculous world where robots are enslaved to routine. The introduction of the first human, the wonk, adds another layer of hijinks to the story. However, the human characters and their roles feel underdeveloped compared to the robots.\n\n- **Technical Accuracy:**  \n  Tchaikovsky’s portrayal of logic problems and logistical issues in the world of computers and coding feels outdated. Many of the technical challenges presented have been solved for at least a decade, making the narrative seem exaggerated and caricatured. This lack of technical depth may be deliberate to emphasize the absurdity, but it detracts from the story’s credibility for readers familiar with the field.\n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the novel remains an entertaining read. The absurdity of the world and the robot’s adventures keep the story engaging. However, it falls short of Tchaikovsky’s usual standard, leaving a sense of disappointment for readers expecting deeper philosophical or technical exploration.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel is an entertaining exploration of AI and the human condition, it feels stretched for a full-length narrative and lacks the depth and technical accuracy found in Tchaikovsky’s other works. The story’s absurdity and humor are its strengths, but the outdated technical portrayals and underdeveloped themes make it a somewhat disappointing read by the author’s high standards.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

The premise is both humorous and absurd, eliciting chuckles and guffaws from me, especially due to the wry wit of the situation.  \n\n- **Philosophical Exploration:**  \n  The novel is essentially a philosophical essay disguised as a comedic, light-hearted story. While I appreciated the cleverness of the ideas being explored, the heavy reliance on philosophical references often hindered my enjoyment. Many of these references were unfamiliar to me, making certain sections feel like a slog. It wasn’t until I read other reviews that some of these themes became clearer.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Like much classic sci-fi, the characters felt more like personifications of ideas rather than fully fleshed-out, living beings. The ones that resonated with me were those tied to concepts I was already familiar with.  \n\n- **Prose and Style:**  \n  The prose was dry and clinical, which I suspect was intentional, given the perspective of an “emotionless” robot. While this style fit the narrative, it didn’t always make for the most engaging read.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  My experience with the novel was overall positive, but I believe existing fans of Tchaikovsky’s work would appreciate it more. As a first-time reader of his writing, I think there are better entry points into his bibliography.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Service Model* is a clever and humorous exploration of philosophical ideas through the lens of a sentient robot, its heavy reliance on unfamiliar references and clinical prose made it a mixed experience for me. It’s a novel that will likely resonate more with readers already familiar with Tchaikovsky’s style and the philosophical themes he explores.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The novel *Service Model* is described as a metaphorical journey where Adrian Tchaikovsky satirizes war, knowledge, work, and other subjects with dry and somewhat repetitive humor.  \n  - The plot revolves around robots that are reflexively truthful and desire to provide service, though the reviewer notes that real-world AI developments (like ChatGPT) have shown that robots can lie without remorse, which contrasts with the book's premise.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n  - Tchaikovsky’s humor is described as dry and archly humorous, particularly in the portrayal of the robot characters.  \n  - The reviewer praises his ability to vividly describe desolate scenes, which is a recurring element in the book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The majority of the characters are robots, which limits opportunities for deep character development. However, the robots are noted for their humorous and satirical qualities.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  - The reviewer compares *Service Model* to *Candide* rather than *Sea of Rust*, suggesting a focus on satire over action or dystopian themes.  \n  - It is considered one of Tchaikovsky’s lesser works, though the reviewer emphasizes that even his lesser works are better than average.  \n  - The reviewer recommends *Children of Time* as a stronger work by Tchaikovsky and expresses interest in starting his *Tyrant Philosophers* series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Service Model* is not Tchaikovsky’s strongest work, it showcases his signature dry humor, satirical exploration of themes, and talent for vivid descriptions.

Throughout his journey, he faces numerous challenges, including bureaucratic police bots and warrior librarians, while being accompanied by a malfunctioning unit known as 'the Wonk.' The narrative delves into themes of free will, society's reliance on robots, and the diminishing value of humanity.",
            "Uncharles is a likable protagonist, despite his distinctly inhuman thought processes. The supporting characters, such as the Wonk and various eccentric robots, enrich the narrative with depth and complexity. Their interactions underscore the novel's exploration of free will and the repercussions of flawed programming.",

I primarily listened to the audiobook while referencing a library copy for details and formatting. The narrative follows a robot who, after murdering his employer, is dismissed and sent to a repair center, leading to a series of adventures. The character of Charles/Uncharles, with his insistence on serving his purpose, along with his interactions with other robots and his evolving relationship with the Wonk, were highlights.

The narrative is divided into five parts, each reflecting a distinct writing style: I: KR15-T (Agatha Christie); II: K4FK-R (Franz Kafka); III: 4W-L (George Orwell); IV: 80RH-5 (Jorge Luis Borges); and V: D4NT-A (Dante Alighieri). This structure added depth and variety to the storytelling.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character of the Wonk, a human girl named Aranice Brezura, is intriguing. Her parents were high-end computer programmers, which adds an interesting layer to her background. However, I figured out her identity long before Uncharles did, which slightly diminished the suspense.\n\n- **Themes and Philosophical Undertones:**  \n  The novel delves into profound questions about AI, privilege, and human existence. It made me reflect on where we are headed with AI, whether the privileged will continue to exploit others, and if the lives of commuters are ultimately pointless. The recurring theme of war and whether humanity has learned anything over time is also thought-provoking.\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The book is laugh-out-loud funny in places, which provides a nice contrast to its heavier themes.

The phrase \"lorem ipsum\" being derived from \"dolorem ipsum\" (\"pain in and of itself\") is a clever nod to the novel's exploration of suffering and ethics.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAdrian Tchaikovsky's *Service Model* is a thought-provoking and humorous exploration of AI, privilege, and human existence.

This repetitive dialogue significantly slowed the pacing and made the book feel like a snooze fest.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  I received both an advanced copy of the ebook and the audiobook. The author narrates the audiobook and has a lovely British accent. While he sometimes changes his voice for different characters, he doesn’t always do so consistently. This inconsistency made it difficult to distinguish between characters during their long, repetitive conversations, adding to the overall fatigue of listening.\n\n- **Overall Story Quality:**  \n  Despite the issues with dialogue and pacing, the story itself had potential. The concept of a robot-led world was intriguing, but the execution fell short due to the repetitive nature of the interactions between the characters.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the book was promising and the writing style initially appealed to me, the repetitive dialogue and inconsistent audiobook narration made it a disappointing read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Theme and Tone:**  \n  The novel is a humorous and thought-provoking dystopian tale that explores themes of free will, human emotion, and purpose. It balances laugh-out-loud moments with a quiet, philosophical tone.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Uncharles, the protagonist, is an obedient robot struggling to find his way in a broken world, which made him hard to connect with and root for. Wonk, on the other hand, is a quirky, driven character who added urgency and kept Uncharles moving forward.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story’s slow pace, repetition, and heavy allegorical/philosophical focus made it feel overlong and dragged, despite the relatively short page count.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  The comparison to the *Murderbot* series set misleading expectations. Unlike *Murderbot*, which features intense, detailed plots, frequent action sequences, and a protagonist with strong agency, this novel focuses on a passive protagonist and lacks similar momentum.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel offers a humorous and thought-provoking exploration of dystopian themes, its slow pace, repetitive nature, and philosophical focus made it a challenging read. The characters, particularly Uncharles, were hard to connect with, and the comparison to *Murderbot* did not align with the story’s tone or structure.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores mentioned in the review."

The rest of the book failed to hold my interest, though I was determined to finish it.  \n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  I enjoyed the dynamic between UnCharles and The Wonk, which was one of the few highlights for me.  \n- **Ending and Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  The ending left me unsatisfied, and while I saw potential in certain ideas (like UnCharles and The Wonk helping other robots), the book didn’t explore them in a way I found compelling.  \n- **Cover Design:**  \n  I appreciated the cover design, realizing the lines represent how UnCharles sees the world through his camera lens.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  While the book wasn’t for me, I believe others who enjoy futuristic, dystopian stories about robots seeking purpose in a collapsing civilization might appreciate it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Service Model* didn’t meet my expectations, as I found it largely boring and unengaging. However, I didn’t hate it and recognize its potential for other readers. I won’t be rereading it or keeping my copy, but I remain open to exploring other works by Adrian Tchaikovsky.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n☆☆½ (Rounded up for the rating system)"

Following his owner's unfortunate accident, Charles is thrust into a deteriorating world, where he meets another robot, 'The Wonk,' who inspires him to embrace independence and self-direction.",

It follows Uncharles, a valet robot who inexplicably kills his master and sets out to find a new purpose.

I expected a more expressive and dynamic character, similar to Jax in “The Alchemy Wars” series. While there were small hints of development, they only culminated in a semi-satisfying finale. The interplay between free will and robotic programming, though interesting, seemed to limit (Un)Charles’ potential for deeper growth.  \n\n- **Plot and Engagement:**  \n  The story’s focus was on the journey rather than character development or the destination.

Humor is subjective, and unfortunately, Tchaikovsky’s attempts at deadpan mirth didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Experimentation:**  \n  This felt like an experimental piece for Tchaikovsky, with a new stylistic approach. The story starts interestingly, with a humorous tone, but the silliness quickly became overwhelming for me.

If you’re looking for a robot-themed story that’s less dark and horrific than Cargill’s *Sea of Rust* or *Day Zero*, this might work for you—especially if you enjoy Douglas Adams’ brand of humor.  \n\n- **Reviewer Preferences:**  \n  I value reviews that focus on how a story is told rather than recapping events. The synopsis can be misleading, as style and presentation make all the difference. For example, a group of guys singing with guitars and drums could describe both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, but their styles are worlds apart.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the novel intrigued me, the humor and stylistic experimentation didn’t align with my tastes.

Some may argue there was *a little* personal growth, but it was minimal and not enough to make the character compelling.  \n\n- **Comparison to Similar Works:**  \n  I am not sure why this book has been compared to Murderbot. Other than the main protagonist (unknowingly) unaliving his owner, being a robot, and running away, it lacks all of the wit, suspense, fun, personal growth, self-deprecation, and fast-paced adventure that make Murderbot a delight.  \n\n- **World-Building and Writing Style:**  \n  The writing itself is great, and there is some excellent world-building. The author clearly has an active, varied imagination.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  There is a seriously lovable side character (a human disguised as another robot), but this wasn’t enough to offset the blandness of the main character.  \n\n- **Themes and Repetition:**  \n  The main robot’s service-oriented viewpoint is repeated for 12.5 hours, set against the bleak dystopian end of human civilization. This repetition made the story feel monotonous.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the audiobook is well-narrated and the author demonstrates strong writing and world-building skills, the story suffers from slow pacing, a lack of engaging character development, and a repetitive, service-oriented perspective from the main character. Despite a lovable side character and a slightly more engaging second half, the overall experience was disappointing, especially when compared to similar works like Murderbot.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nHuge gratitude to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for providing an AudioARC of this book in exchange for my honest review."

            "The story follows Charles, a majordomo robot who discovers his master has died and fears he may be the murderer. He reaches out to the police and a doctor, only to find they are also robots adhering to strict protocols. After their inspections, Charles realizes he is no longer needed and decides to seek a new master by visiting a company that can rewire his memory. During his journey, he learns of a virus that supposedly grants robots sentience, but he dismisses this idea. His primary goal is to continue serving as a majordomo, and he struggles to navigate the larger world, ultimately yearning for his previous life with his master. The story lacks a clear resolution regarding the murder; I would have preferred an epiphany from Charles, prompted by the virus, that clarifies how and why the murder occurred. The ending takes an unexpected, somewhat religious turn, with Charles questioning the concept of “God,” which feels abrupt and disconnected from the rest of the narrative.",

His ability to blend intricate concepts with engaging narratives is a standout feature of his work.\n\n- **Premise and Initial Setup:**  \n  *Service Model* begins promisingly, presenting a world where robots serve as attendants in an Agatha Christie-style country house. The opening scene, where the robot valet, Charles, \"murders\" his master, is an amusing and intriguing set piece. The interactions between Charles and the robot detectives and doctor hint at broader issues in the human world, setting up an engaging premise.\n\n- **Character Development and Plot Progression:**  \n  Charles, due to his programming, cannot assert his own interests and proceeds to take himself to Diagnostics, with a suggestion that Decommissioning might follow. This initial setup is compelling, but the subsequent plot falters. The story devolves into a series of repetitive scenes that rehash the same exchanges. While it becomes clear early on to the reader what is happening, Charles remains oblivious, which feels frustrating rather than suspenseful.\n\n- **Pacing and Repetition:**  \n  The repetitive nature of the scenes makes the story feel almost like a children's tale designed to teach coding, with a few jokes sprinkled in to entertain adults. Unfortunately, these elements weren’t enough to keep me engaged. The pacing suffers as a result, making the reading experience feel drawn-out and tedious.\n\n- **Literary References and Depth:**  \n  Other reviewers have noted numerous literary references throughout the book, which might have added depth and enjoyment. However, I must admit I missed most of these references, so they didn’t enhance my reading experience.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Frustration:**  \n  While the novel started with promise, the repetitive structure and lack of progression made it a frustrating read for me. Despite this, I remain a fan of Tchaikovsky’s work and will continue to explore his other novels.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* begins with an inventive and engaging premise but ultimately falls short due to repetitive scenes and a lack of plot progression. While it has moments of humor and cleverness, the overall experience was frustrating. Nonetheless, I appreciate Tchaikovsky’s creativity and will keep reading his works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story as a whole left me feeling like I missed something, and I did not find either the climax or the denouement satisfactory.\n\n- **Characters and Humor:**  \n  I enjoyed the characters and found quite a bit of the story laugh-out-loud humorous. However, the humor and characters alone weren’t enough to fully redeem the story for me.\n\n- **Recommendation and Comparison:**  \n  If you're a Tchaikovsky fan, you'll want to read this one, especially on audio. However, if you're simply a sci-fi robot fan, there are better robot adventure stories out there, such as *A Psalm for the Wild-Built*. If the audiobook is available to you, it's not a bad listen, but don’t set high expectations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the audiobook narration by Adrian Tchaikovsky was excellent and the characters and humor were enjoyable, the story’s premise and execution left me feeling unsatisfied. It’s worth a listen for fans of the author, but there are stronger sci-fi robot stories available.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The pacing was inconsistent, with some parts moving quickly and others dragging painfully. Most of the mystery was predictable early on, making the rest of the book feel like a confirmation of my assumptions rather than a revelation. The final reveal was underwhelming and didn’t add much to the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Uncharles, didn’t show significant growth or change throughout the story. His character reversal wasn’t particularly compelling, and he largely stayed true to his initial introduction. This lack of development is somewhat understandable given the robotic nature of the protagonist, but it limited the emotional depth of the story.\n\n- **World-Building and Characters:**  \n  The interactions with what seemed to be intended as Dickensian characters were interesting in isolated moments, but most fell short of their potential.

During the first half of the book, I genuinely laughed out loud quite a few times.  \n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  Unfortunately, the second half of the book is less a narrative and more an essay of Adrian Tchaikovsky's various thoughts on futurism, robotics, AI, ethics, justice, and socioeconomic inequality. While these thoughts were thoughtful and interesting, it felt like a bit of a letdown from what had been a pretty fun story.  \n- **Literary Style and References:**  \n  I can see how some reviewers might find the literary references a bit too cute, but I liked them. The novel felt closely modeled on *The Pilgrim's Progress* and similar allegorical hero's journeys.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Premise:**  \n  The central concept of a dystopian society reliant on artificial intelligence and labor is intriguing. However, the execution feels lacking, as the story struggles to fully develop its ideas. The humor hinted at in the blurb doesn’t fully materialize, and the satirical elements often feel forced.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  UnCharles, the protagonist, is intentionally frustrating but ultimately unengaging. Despite being programmed to lack emotion, he frequently ponders his existence, creating an inconsistent and aloof narrative voice. This makes it difficult to empathize with his struggles or feel invested in his journey.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel touches on references to literary classics and religion, but these elements are not explored deeply enough to achieve the philosophical impact the author seems to aim for. They feel underdeveloped and stuck in a state of limbo.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The story is divided into five distinct parts, intended to illustrate different stages of UnCharles’ trials. However, the structure comes across as disjointed and unevenly paced. At times, the narrative feels pretentious and preachy, detracting from the overall cohesion.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The post-apocalyptic wasteland setting is an interesting backdrop, but it doesn’t feel fully realized. The lack of humanity in the world adds to UnCharles’ challenges, but the world-building doesn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Service Model* had potential but falls short of Adrian Tchaikovsky’s best work. The novel struggles with inconsistent execution, underdeveloped themes, and a disjointed plot structure. While the concept is intriguing, the lack of cohesive storytelling and impactful characters left me wanting more. Despite these shortcomings, I remain hopeful for the author’s future projects, though I’ll approach them with tempered expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 of 5 stars"

I was excited to read this novel, especially with the comparisons to *Murderbot*. Unfortunately, it didn’t live up to those comparisons.\n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I think my mistake was trying this out on audio. The dispassionate, repetitive, and robotic narration—both of the story and the audiobook—made it very boring to get through. It felt unnecessarily draggy, with nothing much interesting happening at all.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  While I had some hopes from the Wonk, it wasn’t enough to save me from the dreary characterization of Uncharles, who is not half as interesting as Murderbot.\n\n- **Pacing and Execution:**  \n  The slow pace and execution style made me not want to understand the underlying themes of the story. My patience was over by the time I was halfway through the book. Maybe if I had an ebook, I would have skim-read it super fast, but going through an almost 12-hour audiobook felt like a slog.\n\n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n  While I like this kind of cozy, quiet sci-fi, this book didn’t feel executed well. I definitely don’t recommend it to anyone looking for a fast-paced or action-adventure sci-fi.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  Maybe fans of Tchaikovsky will find it to their liking, but ultimately, this just wasn’t for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel didn’t meet my expectations, particularly due to its slow pacing, unengaging narration, and lackluster characterization.

I had to put it down for several days and muster motivation to finish it, often skipping parts because it felt dull and bloated.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  The book is pitched as \"Murderbot meets Redshirts,\" but it feels derivative.

I think this story should have been heavily edited down to a novella or short story. While I’m not turned off from reading Tchaikovsky’s earlier works, I need time to recover from this experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a disappointing first encounter with Tchaikovsky’s work.

The shift in focus was disappointing and didn’t align with what I had hoped for.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  It was interesting that Charles murdered his master and remained so calm about it. This aspect of the story stood out to me as intriguing and unique.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The farm work scenes were okay, but Jack the childcare robot gave me strong FNAF (Five Nights at Freddy’s) vibes, which added an eerie and unsettling tone to the story.\n\n- **Communication and Frustration:**  \n  The communication, or lack thereof, became increasingly annoying. The majority of the book felt like a struggle, as I found myself metaphorically banging my head against the wall. The constant attempts to get through to a human operator while being a non-human operator were frustrating and ultimately made the story unenjoyable for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile there were some intriguing elements, such as Charles’ calm demeanor after murdering his master and the eerie vibes from Jack the childcare robot, the overall focus on automated customer service and the frustrating communication dynamics made the book difficult to engage with. I decided to give up on it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF (Did Not Finish)"

The tone shifted between dry satire and farce, which disrupted the overall flow.\n- **Comedy Execution:** The humor was uneven, with moments of dry satire that worked well but often devolved into what felt like silly or forced farce. This inconsistency made the comedic elements less effective.\n- **Author Comparison:** The style and execution reminded me of John Scalzi’s work, but this comparison is not intended as praise. While some readers might appreciate this similarity, it didn’t resonate with me in a positive way.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this novel missed the mark for me.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author’s Track Record and Expectations:**  \n  I’ve been a huge fan of Adrian Tchaikovsky since reading his fantasy debut *Empire in Black* in 2010. I’ve read all 10 books in the *Shadow of the Apt* series and a total of 22 novels by him. Almost everything he writes is excellent, and *Cage of Souls* was brilliant. This book, however, is the first I haven’t loved.\n\n- **Genre and Style Experimentation:**  \n  Adrian Tchaikovsky is incredibly versatile, having written fantasy, space opera, hard SF, and more. It was inevitable he would try his hand at humour, but humour is polarising. I suspected from the outset that this book was an attempt at humour, which I don’t find appealing. For example, I love Terry Pratchett’s humour but dislike Robert Asprin’s, and this book falls into the latter category for me.\n\n- **Execution of Humour:**  \n  The humour in this book didn’t work for me. The repetition in Chapter 2, which mimics the android’s routine, felt excessive and threw me out of the story. The character names, like Doctor Namehere and Inspector Birdbot, were not amusing to me. The opening scene with the dead Master felt overused, reminiscent of a 1988 *Red Dwarf* episode.\n\n- **Narrative and Logic:**  \n  The book references emotions and thought processes that the android protagonist, Charles, isn’t programmed for, which felt inconsistent. The extreme application of computer logic for comic effect didn’t resonate with me.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my admiration for Tchaikovsky’s work, I couldn’t enjoy this book. I stopped reading at page 35 because the irritations outweighed any potential enjoyment. However, this won’t deter me from reading his future works, as I’m excited about his upcoming book *Shroud* and love his *Tyrant Philosophers* trilogy.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Adrian Tchaikovsky is a superb and prolific writer, *Service Model* didn’t work for me due to its humour and execution. Despite this, I remain a dedicated fan and look forward to his future projects.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (Did not finish the book, so no rating provided.)"

Given the cynicism I feel about real-world events, I wasn’t in the mood to read a story that mirrored those themes, especially when I was expecting something more action-packed.  \n\n- **Genre and Style:**  \n  If you’re looking for an action-packed story about a robot becoming sentient, this is not it. The book was more reflective and lacked the danger or intensity I anticipated.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Descriptions:**  \n  The book was marketed with comparisons like \"Murderbot meets Redshirts\" and \"Mad Max - if Max were C3P0,\" which set up expectations for a humorous, action-driven tale. However, the actual story was more thoughtful and less adventurous than these descriptions suggested.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was thoughtful and compelling, it didn’t meet my expectations based on its marketing and comparisons. I might have enjoyed it more at another time, but it wasn’t the action-packed, violent story I was hoping for.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This sets off a journey for Charles to find a new purpose in a world where robots are breaking down without humans. The story is rich in detailed world-building and attempts to explore big ideas, particularly around social commentary.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is thin, with the main character, Charles, lacking agency because it is a robot that can only follow orders or programming. This limitation makes the story feel stagnant at times. Additionally, the pacing is heavily skewed toward extensive world-building, leaving little room for a compelling narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Charles, as the main character, is constrained by its robotic nature, which prevents it from having true agency or growth. This lack of development makes it difficult to connect with or root for the character. Furthermore, the story’s logic inconsistencies (e.g., refusing to serve robots but serving King Ubot, or claiming willingness to be stripped of parts but fleeing from humans planning to do so) undermine the character’s credibility.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is the most prominent aspect of the novel, with detailed descriptions and a focus on social commentary. However, the excessive emphasis on world-building overshadows the plot, making the book feel more like a speculative essay than a story. The main character often acts as a passive spectator to the world rather than an active participant.\n\n- **Logic and Consistency:**  \n  The novel struggles with logical inconsistencies, particularly in Charles’s actions and decisions.
