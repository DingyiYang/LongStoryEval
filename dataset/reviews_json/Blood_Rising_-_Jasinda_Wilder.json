            "The premise that immortal beings—fae, vampires, and shifters—have never produced hybrid children, despite the biological possibility, is unconvincing. The rationale that fear of the unknown deters hybrids falters, particularly in light of interracial marriages. Additionally, the lack of awareness among centuries-old immortals about other races’ behaviors and energy manipulation seems inconsistent with their extensive history of interaction, conflict, and intermarriage. The book feels more like a novella than a full-length novel, with a significant portion of its pages devoted to a lengthy recap of prior events, which detracts from the core narrative.",
