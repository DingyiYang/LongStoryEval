No, you don’t have to go on a “massive” run because you had an indulgent dinner.  \n   - You don’t need to force your friend to share a pint of ice cream so you don’t “gain a million pounds.”  \n   - You don’t need to say “2,000 calories later” after another meal, or feed into your friend’s issues of being “wedding ready” by going to a spin class.  \n   - This book had nothing to do with weight or body image, yet it was overrun by these remarks that added nothing to the story and really haven’t been done in books in years.  \n   - I read over a hundred books a year and can’t remember the last time I saw this much diet culture nonsense.  \n\n- **Unacknowledged Drinking Problem**  \n   - The second issue was her unacknowledged drinking problem.  \n   - Drinking one and a half bottles of wine, or the equivalent, frequently is a problem.  \n   - Knowing you are on the verge of “blackout” and drinking more is a problem.  \n   - Once she stopped complaining about calories, she turned to copious amounts of alcohol.  \n   - Repeatedly getting drunk did not contribute to the plot.  \n   - This was way beyond a young twenty-something having fun in the city.  \n\n- **Insta-Love and Lack of Relationship Development**  \n   - The first day was cute, but then the chemistry got weird and fell flat.  \n   - Her 180 later in the story was unfounded and annoying.  \n   - Nothing was really built on lies, and the weird “cell phone number” thing was ridiculous.  \n\n- **Toxic Relationships**  \n   - Her BFF? Kinda self-involved.  \n   - Co-workers? Bitchy.  \n   - Guy she almost dated? A real jerk in the end.  \n   - Chloe? Finding fault in any way, shape, or form over someone spending time with a dying loved one is unforgivable.  \n   - Overall, not a fan of Chloe, or any of the characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started with a cute and original premise, it quickly devolved due to toxic diet culture, an unacknowledged drinking problem, poorly developed relationships, and a cast of unlikable characters.

I found Addison unlikable, and the book-sharing aspect felt awkward given their lack of genuine friendship. Additionally, Jack's irritation toward Chloe struck me as unfounded, particularly considering they had only spent a few brief moments together."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the novel had a charming romantic adventure with a strong emphasis on fate and relationships. While I enjoyed the dynamic between Ben and Chloe and adored Kit and Chloe’s bond, the story left some plot holes and lacked deeper exploration of key relationships. Certain characters, like Addison and Jack, detracted from the experience. Despite these flaws, the story was engaging and heartfelt.",

            "The impact of the FMC's sister's death is frequently referenced, yet its connection to the main storyline remains unclear. While the subplot of the MMC's mother in palliative care is significant, the FMC's frustration with the MMC for prioritizing his dying mother feels unjustified and undermines her likability.",
            "The FMC's estrangement from her parents following her sister's death is introduced but lacks sufficient explanation or justification. The dynamic between the FMC and MMC is inconsistent, with the MMC's commitment to the relationship wavering and the FMC's abrupt change in feelings feeling unrealistic. Her behavior at her best friend's engagement party—leaving because the MMC isn't present and then reacting dramatically upon his arrival—is frustrating and hard to empathize with. Most characters in the book are unlikable or lack redeeming qualities, with the exceptions of the MMC's nephew, his mother, and possibly his sister/SIL. The FMC's behavior, particularly her lack of empathy toward the MMC's situation with his mother, is inexcusable and undermines her character's appeal."

            "I found myself half-expecting a playful author’s note from Chloe’s coworker at the end, curious about the story's publication status. The conclusion prompted me to reflect on Chloe’s journey and her flawed yet relatable character. The narrative follows Chloe as she enjoys a perfect day in New York City with Jack, featuring brunch at a cleverly named restaurant, a visit to the MET, boat racing in Central Park, and a picnic with secret beers and street food. However, the plot takes an emotional turn when Jack's responses become unexpected, and Chloe repeatedly encounters him and his ex-girlfriend throughout the city. This book is a rollercoaster of emotions, exploring themes of sibling loss and a parent in hospice care.",

At times, I felt frustrated by how she was treated, yet I also wished to shake her and urge her to be more empathetic. I recognized aspects of myself in Chloe, especially her tendency to flee from what she truly desires and loves.",

I appreciated the clever pun-filled title competitions but was taken aback by the 90% closed-door romance, especially given the otherwise playful tone. It reminded me of the TV show *Felicity*, which I felt inspired to revisit after finishing the story.",

The beginning was great, and the big twist hooked me, making me eager to keep reading every time I put it down to see what happened next.  \n\n- **Character Development (Main Character - Chloe):**  \n  Unfortunately, the main character, Chloe, was infuriatingly dumb. She made one awful choice after another, took no accountability until it was almost too late, and then overcorrected with another abysmal decision. Her lack of growth and poor decision-making really detracted from the story.  \n\n- **Character Development (Supporting Characters):**  \n  The supporting characters were not great either. Chloe’s coworkers were unlikable, especially Addison. Jameela was decent, but her Bridgerton obsession felt strange and out of place. The only characters I genuinely liked were Kit and Theo, but they didn’t get enough page time. Ben was okay, and I found myself on his side most of the time, though he also made some poor choices.  \n\n- **Plot Execution and Pacing:**  \n  After the initial twist, the story went downhill for me. The drama involving Ben’s ex was particularly off-putting and gave me a big ick. The plot felt poorly executed, which was disappointing because the book had so much potential.  \n\n- **Overall Potential vs. Execution:**  \n  Overall, I feel like this book had great potential but was too poorly executed. It’s a shame because it could have been a fantastic read with better character development and plot execution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise and beginning of the book were strong, the story ultimately fell flat due to frustrating character decisions, underdeveloped supporting characters, and a poorly executed plot.

Despite its potential, the story failed to captivate me, resulting in an early decision to stop reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

Chloe’s happily-ever-after (HEA) was okay.  \n\n- **Themes and Conflict:**  \n  - I disliked how Ben repeatedly lied to Chloe and used his mom’s illness to justify his actions.  \n  - Chloe’s selfishness in her relationships, especially with her best friend, was frustrating.  \n  - The work situation felt unrealistic, with overly harsh outcomes for mistakes and unrealistic expectations from the employer.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Length:**  \n  - The book felt unnecessarily long, and the story could have been more concise.  \n  - If you enjoy long character studies, this might suit you, but it’s not ideal for a quick romance read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some decent elements, such as a likeable protagonist and a fine romance, it was ultimately let down by its pacing, excessive length, and frustrating character dynamics. Ben’s constant lying and Chloe’s selfishness made it hard to fully enjoy the story. If you’re a fan of Katie Wicks’ previous work and enjoy detailed character studies, this might work for you, but it’s not a quick or particularly satisfying read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- *Hazel Fine*: 4 stars  \n- *This book*: Lower rating (exact score not specified, but implied to be less than 4 stars)."

The setting added a charming, Serendipity-like feel to the story.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The supporting characters were fun, especially Chloe's work colleagues. Jameela's devout obsession with Bridgerton was amusing, even though I don’t watch the show. Chloe's job in the book marketing industry was relatable to me, as I work in the same field. The chemistry between Chloe and her dating companion was off the charts, and their banter was fantastic. I felt just as disappointed and flustered as Chloe when she couldn’t find him afterward.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  I appreciated Katie's handling of grief in this novel, as it is mentioned quite often, especially in relation to Chloe's tragic loss at a young age. This added emotional depth to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  Some parts felt slow because Chloe kept going back and forth about what she wanted, which made it hard to feel sorry for her at times. I also wish it had taken longer for Chloe to find her lost date, as the search was a lot of fun, and I loved how she retraced her steps to uncover more answers. That said, there was plenty of drama when she finally found him.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  This novel has a similar feel to the show *Felicity*, and Chloe reminds me a lot of Felicity Porter. I recently started watching *Felicity* and would recommend reading this book after watching the series—or if you have no plans to watch it at all. There was a spoiler revealed in the book that I didn’t care much about at the time, but now I’m trying to forget it!  \n\n- **Casting Suggestions:**  \n  For a potential movie adaptation, I’d cast AnnaSophia Robb as Chloe, Joe Keery as Chloe’s date, Ashley Park as Kat, and Taylor Misiak as Rachel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Chloe Baker's Lost Date* is a cute, romantic story with a Serendipity-like charm, set in the vibrant backdrop of New York City.

They didn’t click for me, which made it hard to invest in their relationship.  \n\n- **Character Likability (Chloe):**  \n  The female lead, Chloe, lacked empathy, was very self-centered, and highly unlikable.

She was insensitive to the fact that Ben was going through a difficult time with his dying mother.  \n\n- **Character Development (Chloe):**  \n  Chloe’s behavior worsened as the story progressed. After Ben finally agreed to a relationship, she quickly changed her mind, citing that the relationship was “too much” for her. Her reasons—constantly comparing herself to Ben’s ex and being unable to spend every second with him—were shallow. Her lack of empathy and refusal to respect Ben’s earlier decisions made her even more unlikable.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  I expected a fun rom-com with lighthearted antics, but instead, I found a story dominated by Chloe’s selfishness and poor decision-making. Her tendency to blame Ben for her mistakes and her unsubstantial excuses further detracted from the plot.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  Chloe’s lack of empathy and her inability to support Ben during his mother’s illness made it impossible for me to enjoy the love story.

I found him super detestable, and after that first lie, he had no chances with me.  \n\n- **Strengths and Highlights:**  \n  I really enjoyed the friendship aspects of the story, as well as the parallels to *Serendipity* and some of the side plot scenes. These elements stood out and added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Author and Future Interest:**  \n  Despite my critiques, I’m definitely interested in trying out this author again in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, without the editing feedback I had, this was a pretty average romcom. While the concept and certain elements were enjoyable, the excessive dialogue, clunky transitions, and unlikable love interest held it back for me. Still, I appreciated the nods to *Serendipity* and the friendship dynamics, and I’m open to reading more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
