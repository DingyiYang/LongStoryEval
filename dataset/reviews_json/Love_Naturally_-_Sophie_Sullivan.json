I was completely invested in the story and the characters.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story begins with Presley planning a vacation surprise for her boyfriend, but everything goes wrong, leading her to a fishing resort alone. The pacing of her romance with Beckett is perfect—sweet, swoony, and just the right speed.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The side characters are perfection, adding depth and charm to the story. I’m especially eager to see if Jill and Greyson will get their own stories in the future.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The town and resort setting are delightful, providing just enough background and texture without overwhelming the main narrative. It’s fun and immersive.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n  Sophie Sullivan’s writing is fantastic, and I highly recommend her other books, like the Jody Holford series, to anyone who enjoyed this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is my new favorite from Sophie Sullivan. It’s a heartwarming, well-paced romance with lovable characters, a charming setting, and a story that keeps you hooked from start to finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this story, the main character, Presley, appears quite codependent. After exiting one relationship, she embarks on a solo trip only to quickly start a new romance with Beckett within 24-48 hours. This rapid transition feels unrealistic and forced. Their relationship lacks depth, coming across as insta-love that ultimately feels unromantic and fails to resonate with me.",

            "The book suffers from a lack of movement, conflict, and surprises, particularly in its ending. The storyline is bland and forgettable, with predictable and uninspired plot developments.",
            "The romance between Presley and Beckett comes across as abrupt and lacking genuine passion. Their interactions are described with a technical focus on physical positioning, overshadowing any emotional connection. Additionally, the romance is diminished by the characters' preoccupation with lodge projects and guest requests. While Presley is relatable in her disappointments, her character development remains stagnant. Beckett, though likable, is often reduced to clichéd descriptions like \"hot mountain man,\" which feel overdone and inconsistent with the story’s setting.",

It may appeal to readers who prefer clean romances, but for those seeking depth and passion, this book may not meet expectations.",

However, for readers unfamiliar with Michigan, this shouldn’t be an issue.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The story felt slightly slow at times, but it didn’t significantly impact my overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This was the perfect summer read, and I can’t wait for the world to fall in love with Beckett like I did. \"Love, Naturally\" is set to be released on January 16, 2024.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Love, Naturally\" is a charming and dreamy novel with a heartwarming love story, an enchanting setting, and lovable characters. Despite minor pacing issues and a few inaccuracies about Michigan, it’s an enjoyable and swoon-worthy read that feels like a perfect escape.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their instant attraction, lively banter, and palpable tension were electrifying, even as their relationship occasionally felt taboo. Additionally, Beckett’s family introduced a warm, found-family element that further enriched the narrative.",

The story explores not just romance but also the love and sacrifices between siblings who own the lodge, as they support each other in realizing their dreams.  \n\n- **Setting and Descriptions:**  \n  Sullivan's vivid descriptions of the Michigan island and the lodge are so immersive that they made me want to vacation in Michigan, something I never considered before reading this book. Her talent for setting the scene is remarkable, almost akin to a travel writer.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are well-developed, with Presley's reluctance to embrace the outdoorsy lifestyle providing both humor and growth. The siblings' dynamic adds depth to the story, showcasing their love and sacrifices for one another.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Sullivan's writing is engaging and easy to read, making the book a delightful experience. Her ability to balance humor, romance, and deeper themes is commendable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSophie Sullivan's *Love, Naturally* is a charming and heartwarming read that combines humor, romance, and family dynamics.

            "Although insta-love isn't typically my favorite trope, it worked surprisingly well in this story. Even though the romance unfolded in just ten days, the emotional connection between Beckett and Presley felt genuine and heartwarming. Both characters experienced significant growth throughout the narrative, especially Presley, who repeatedly stepped out of her comfort zone by trying new activities like biking, fishing, and four-wheeling. Beckett's determination to prioritize Presley's happiness was incredibly touching, as was her commitment to him. The warmth and depth added by Beckett's family, especially Ollie, enriched the story, while Jillian and Grayson’s intriguing backstories left me eager to learn more about them.",

The pacing of the relationship development is spot-on, showcasing a gradual emotional growth that feels both authentic and organic. Moments of humor and emotion abound, as seen in Beckett's rise as an internet sensation (#hotmountainman) and Presley's commitment to fully embracing the lodge's offerings.",

Her intense focus on personal and professional achievements often blinds her to reality. In contrast, Beckett is empathetic and kind, encouraging Presley to embrace change. Although he resists transformation himself, he yearns for more from life, which creates an intriguing internal conflict. Their relationship feels natural and fulfilling, as they perfectly complement one another. The sibling dynamic between Beckett, Grayson, and Jill is heartwarming, reflecting a strong family-first ethos. The endearing secondary characters enrich the story, and I hope to see Grayson and Jill find their own happily-ever-afters in future installments.",

The plot and small-town setting were engaging, although some elements felt realistic while others fell into clichés, like the insta-love trope.",

In contrast, others, such as the they/them hairdresser and the neighbor who appears to be on the spectrum, seemed to serve more as tokens for diversity rather than as meaningful additions to the plot.",

While the premise of Presley taking the camping trip after her breakup was refreshing, the pacing could have been tighter to maintain engagement.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Beckett and Presley are both likable and relatable characters. I appreciated Presley’s decision to go on the vacation she had planned for her ex-boyfriend, even though it wasn’t her idea of a good time. However, their relationship felt surface-level, and the insta-love between them felt rushed and out of place. I wanted to feel a deeper connection between the two main characters.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The ‘fish out of water’ trope was executed well, and I enjoyed the small-town atmosphere and the quirky side characters. These elements added charm and depth to the story.  \n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  Some of the dialogue was cringey, which detracted from the overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Romance Style:**  \n  This is a light-hearted, closed-door romance with a Hallmark-style vibe. It’s perfect for readers who enjoy quick, feel-good romances without explicit content.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The audiobook was enjoyable to listen to, and Julie Rogers did a great job as the narrator.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Love, Naturally* is a fun, light-hearted romance with charming elements like the small-town setting and quirky characters. While the slow pacing, rushed romance, and occasional cringey dialogue were drawbacks, it’s still an enjoyable read for fans of closed-door, Hallmark-style romances.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- **Overall Rating:** 3 stars  \n- **Steam Level:** Closed-door"

The plot was intriguing, and the protagonist's presence in the small town significantly enhanced the workload and other elements of the narrative. I appreciated how the setting contributed to the overall story.",
            "The female lead frequently referred to their relationship as a brief fling, which felt inconsistent given her constant thoughts about him. I doubt she would have left if he had asked her to stay in his small town. The male lead's fear of abandonment, rooted in his past with his high school sweetheart, added depth to his character, and I found him quite likable. However, the relationship felt rushed; they should have taken more time to develop their connection. Their quick decision to return to their normal lives instead of pursuing a relationship felt unrealistic.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Impression and Setting:**  \n  I was very curious about *Love, Naturally* when I first read its synopsis, and I’m very pleased to have found a lovely romance upon reading it. The town of Smile felt so charming and inviting that I wanted to head back and make myself at home again.  \n\n- **The Leads:**  \n  Presley and Beckett are incredible leads. I admired how Presley stepped out of her comfort zone to experience something seemingly unnatural to her, only to discover how natural it felt and how she found her true home. Beckett, on the other hand, is all about home and family, and I loved how his arc showed him learning that it’s okay to put himself first sometimes and forge his own independent path. The supporting characters, especially Beckett’s siblings and niece, added so much life to the story. I hope the siblings get their own stories!  \n\n- **The Romance:**  \n  Based on the blurb, I expected a grumpy, reluctant male lead paired with a bubbly, sunshine-y heroine. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by an instantly and mutually smitten pair. While the story unfolds over ten days (technically instalove), it didn’t feel like it. Instead, it was a well-paced slow burn that simmered beautifully before reaching a full boil. The chemistry between the leads was palpable, and the romance felt believable, heartwarming, and swoon-worthy.  \n\n- **The Story:**  \n  My only qualm was with the middle portion of the book, which dragged on a bit too long for my personal preference. I found my attention waning and even picked up other books before returning to finish this one. However, once I got past that hurdle, the ending was absolutely gorgeous. It delivered a poignant quote that I think will be shared and reshared many times—a sentiment about not wanting to say goodbye to the person you always want to say hello to.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  Reading this romance felt like coming home. It was effortless to root for the leads, and their story filled my heart with joy and love. The book excels not only with a solid romance but also with a charming supporting cast. I’m so glad to have read this one!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Love, Naturally* is a heartwarming romance with well-developed leads, a charming setting, and a supporting cast that brings the story to life. While the middle portion felt a bit long-winded, the ending was beautifully executed, leaving a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story dragged, particularly as the romance developed too quickly—by day four—without adequate buildup. Presley's rapid descent into love with Beckett felt rushed and unrealistic, leaving me disengaged from their relationship. By the halfway point, I had lost interest in the outcome.",
            "In this story, Presley, a city girl, finds herself at a remote island retreat following a breakup. Beckett, her love interest, is part of the retreat's owning family. However, his internal struggle over whether to pursue a new job or start his own business comes across as trivial and repetitive. Additionally, the inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters feels forced, particularly the mention of a they/them character in the parking lot. Representation should be organic and seamlessly woven into the narrative, rather than feeling like a checkbox for inclusivity."

            "I found Beckett, the male main character, more appealing than Presley, the female lead. Beckett is sweet and charming, but his internal struggle about revealing his passion project to his family becomes repetitive. On the other hand, Presley felt less relatable; after breaking up with her boyfriend, she quickly falls for another guy. While the supporting characters at Get Lost Lodge are well-intentioned, I struggled to connect with them or care about their individual stories.",

            "*Love, Naturally* is a charming romantic comedy that explores the classic fish-out-of-water and opposites-attract themes. The story centers on Presley Ayers, a city girl and social media influencer, who finds herself at Get Lost Lodge after her boyfriend breaks up with her. There, she meets Beckett Keller, an outdoorsy assistant manager at a sporting goods store, who is caught between helping his siblings enhance the lodge and pursuing his own career ambitions. The central conflict arises from their undeniable attraction, set against the backdrop of their stark differences and the looming question of what will happen when Presley’s 10-day trip comes to an end.",
            "Presley is a relatable, hardworking city girl who, despite her lack of camping experience, leverages her social media skills to support the lodge. In contrast, Beckett is a kind, outdoorsy man with a strong sense of loyalty to his family and aspirations of starting his own business. The well-developed supporting characters, including Beckett’s siblings Grayson and Jillian, enrich the narrative and add depth to the story.",
            "The story is told from a third-person perspective, which feels awkward, particularly when it shifts between Presley’s and Beckett’s viewpoints within the same paragraph. I believe the narrative would have been more effective in first-person with dual narrators.",
            "The setting of Get Lost Lodge and its surroundings is vividly portrayed, providing a charming backdrop for the story. The contrast between Presley’s urban lifestyle and the rustic lodge enhances the fish-out-of-water humor.",
            "This novel is filled with hilarious moments, making it a delightful read. I found myself emotionally invested in the characters, cheering not just for Presley and Beckett, but also for Grayson and Jillian as they seek their happily-ever-afters."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Love, Naturally* is a delightful opposites-attract romantic comedy with likable characters, humorous moments, and a charming setting. While the third-person POV feels awkward at times, the story is engaging and leaves me rooting for the characters’ happily-ever-afters. I hope to see more stories, particularly for the supporting characters.",

            "This book offers a heartwarming tale centered on self-discovery, the importance of not settling, and the value of trying new things. While the story unfolds over a brief period, it often feels unnecessarily prolonged due to repetitive prose that detracts from its overall impact.",
            "Presley and Beckett's relationship is characterized as insta-love, lacking chemistry, passion, or genuine connection. Their pairing feels contrived, influenced by proximity and Presley's recent breakup. Additionally, Beckett's unfamiliarity with common online abbreviations and pop culture references, such as Christian Grey, comes across as unrealistic and absurd.",

            "The story begins slowly, making it challenging to fully engage at first. However, the ten-day timeline is filled with sweet, romantic moments that skillfully balance humor with deeper reflections on life and change.

            "The story follows Presley as she attempts to bond with her boyfriend, Emmett, by planning a camping trip. When he declines, she decides to go solo and encounters Beckett. Unfortunately, the pacing is sluggish, leading to moments of boredom. The incessant internal monologues about their limited time together become frustrating, as the same point is reiterated excessively.",
            "I found Presley and Beckett to be likable characters. Presley was charming and deserved better than Emmett, while Beckett's sweetness, especially in his interactions with his niece Ollie, brought a smile to my face. However, their chemistry was lacking; there was no tension or passion between them. In fact, I found Beckett's relationship with Ollie more engaging than his connection with Presley. The romance felt forced, as if they were paired together simply because the author intended it. There was no sense of them fighting for each other or genuinely wanting to be together, which made their relationship unconvincing.",
            "The writing style was enjoyable, and the themes of self-discovery and healing from heartbreak were evident. However, the execution left me wanting more. While fans of authors like Lauren Layne or Christina Lauren may appreciate it, I found it less impactful than the author’s debut novel."

        "conclusion": "While I appreciated the individual characters and some of the relationships (like Beckett and Ollie), the lack of chemistry between Presley and Beckett, the repetitive internal monologues, and the unconvincing romance made this book a miss for me. It didn’t live up to my expectations after enjoying the author’s previous work.",

            "The story flows smoothly overall, though some character choices and a lack of communication lead to minor frustrations. The fake dating trope kicks off when Beckett’s sister, Jill, claims they are dating to shield him from predatory women. Presley and Beckett agree to a temporary relationship, fully aware it will end when she leaves, yet neither truly wants it to. Their fears of rejection and differing life circumstances hinder them from expressing their true feelings. \n\nWhen Presley returns home feeling unappreciated, believing Beckett doesn’t care enough to ask her to stay or reach out, her friend Riley points out her own lack of initiative. Meanwhile, Beckett’s siblings help him realize that his love for Presley outweighs the importance of staying close to family. Encouraged by his brother, he decides to visit Great Falls to source bikes and reconnect with her. \n\nIn a heartfelt moment, Beckett uses Instagram Live to confess his feelings and travels to see Presley. They reunite at her workplace, share their emotions, and choose to be together. The epilogue hints at a future proposal and marriage, leaving me satisfied with a happy ending.",

Her independence and self-sufficiency make her a hardworking and reliable character. Beckett, who works at a sporting goods store and helps manage Get Lost Lodge, is equally well-developed.

However, the frequent repetition of her full name, Pressley Marie Ayers, quickly became tedious.

Overall, the characters came across as unrealistic, resembling caricatures rather than fully developed individuals.",

            "This story was a delightful and easy-to-read romcom, just what I was in the mood for. However, the relationship timeline felt rushed; Presley and Beckett bypassed the early dating phase and quickly acted like a long-term couple, which seemed unrealistic.",

Presley breaks up with her boyfriend, meets Beckett the very next day, and they quickly plunge into a romance. By the end, she quits her job and moves to the island for him, which felt rushed and unrealistic. The story would have been stronger with a slow-burn approach instead of such an intense relationship developing so rapidly.",

This charming romance emphasizes family and personal growth. Initially, Presley sacrifices her own needs for a partner who offers little in return, but she ultimately chooses to leave him behind. This decision marks a pivotal moment in her life as she embraces the adventure she had envisioned.",
            "Presley's character undergoes significant growth throughout the story. Initially overly accommodating and bound to a plan that doesn't serve her, she eventually takes charge of her life and finds her place in an unexpected setting. Beckett and his family are pivotal to her journey. Despite their struggles, they are dedicated to reviving their lodge and quickly welcome Presley, who brings her hospitality expertise. Beckett, in particular, forms a deep connection with her, leading to a heartwarming \"fauxmance\" that captivates readers. The relationships in the novel shine, especially the strong bond among Beckett and his siblings, which adds warmth to their interactions with Presley. The inclusion of Beckett’s niece, Ollie, and other lodgers enriches the narrative, fostering a sense of family and belonging for Presley. The romantic relationship between Beckett and Presley is well-developed, and their chemistry is truly engaging.",

While conflict is essential to a good narrative, the ones presented here were skillfully executed, steering clear of the clichéd, avoidable confrontations often found in books.",
            "The first chapter is crucial as it sets the stage for Presley's growth and transformation throughout the story. Understanding her background reveals why she has a distorted view of love, shaped by emotionally distant parents who prioritized her physical needs over emotional connection. This context clarifies her struggles with communication and relationships. The love story extends beyond the two main characters, featuring a charming found-family dynamic, including a clever and humorous little girl, albeit written a bit older than her years. The male lead is a lovable \"cinnamon roll,\" always caring and incredibly sweet, with well-crafted flaws that add depth to his character.",
            "I ultimately loved this book, but my initial reaction was mixed. After the first chapter, I found myself dreading the rest of the story. The female main character seemed weak, easily manipulated, and somewhat clueless—traits I typically dislike. However, as the narrative progressed, my perspective shifted."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Impressions and Engagement:**  \n   - I truly loved this book, but not immediately. After finishing the first chapter, I was slightly dreading having to read the whole book. The FMC appeared weak, easily taken advantage of, and quite clueless, which I am NOT a fan of.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The first chapter was very important as it highlighted Presley's growth and transformation throughout the story. After learning about her history, it became understandable why she had a skewed view of love, shaped by emotionally distant parents who only took care of her physical needs. This made it clear why she struggled with communication and relationships.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - The love story wasn’t just about the two main characters. There was a delightful group of found-family, including a clever and funny little girl (though she was written a bit old for her age).  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n   - I loved that there was no third-act “blow up.” The conflicts in the story felt natural and not contrived, which was a pleasant surprise. While a good story needs conflict, the ones here were well-executed and avoided the typical avoidable fights I often see in books.  \n\n- **Male Main Character:**  \n   - The male main character was a big, fat cinnamon roll—always caring for those around him and incredibly sweet. He had flaws, but he was very well-written.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful read, with strong character development, natural conflicts, and a heartwarming found-family dynamic. Despite my initial reservations about the FMC, her growth and the well-crafted story won me over. I highly recommend this book and will absolutely be rereading it!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was so captivating that I even put down my Christmas romances, which I’ve been obsessed with lately, to fully enjoy it.  \n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The romance between Presley and Beckett was adorable and wholesome. Their connection had me swooning. Despite being from different worlds—city vs. small town, hiking enthusiast vs. non-hiker—their differences created a well-balanced and engaging romance.  \n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The book went beyond just romance. It explored themes of self-discovery and courage, as both characters encouraged each other to step into new experiences and pursue what they truly wanted in life. The found-family trope was beautifully executed, with moments highlighting the importance of family and creating your own.  \n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  Beckett’s niece, Ollie, was a standout character who brought immense joy to the story. Her presence added depth and charm to the narrative.  \n- **Integration of Social Media:**  \n  Surprisingly, I enjoyed the inclusion of social media, which is usually something I shy away from. Presley, a small-scale influencer, used her platform in an adorably hilarious way to promote Beckett’s family resort. The integration felt organic and didn’t detract from the plot.  \n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book is light on spice but full of tension, making it a perfect blend of swoon-worthy moments and entertainment. It’s an excellent choice for fans of contemporary romances.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSophie Sullivan’s *Love, Naturally* is a delightful and heartwarming read that combines a swoon-worthy romance with deeper themes of self-discovery and found family.

            "The breakup with Emmett was handled well, but his character and the heroine's initial decision to date him felt inconsistent. Additionally, the subplot involving the heroine's Instagram presence was unrealistic; it seemed implausible for someone with 50K followers to be surprised by the attention they received.",
            "The hero and heroine are likable characters, making them easy to root for. The hero's family, particularly Ollie and Adam, adds charm to the story. However, Emmett, the heroine's ex, comes off as a self-absorbed character that feels out of place, leaving readers questioning why the otherwise wonderful heroine would date him. While the romance is sweet, it leans too heavily on the G-rated side, lacking passion with only kisses and fade-to-black scenes. This made it feel somewhat dull compared to other romance novels I've read.",
            "The book fell short of the polish I typically seek in love stories. The cover art felt amateurish, featuring flat characters and oddly shaped noses, which nearly dissuaded me from reading it. However, the editing was satisfactory.",

It didn’t make sense why the seemingly wonderful heroine would date someone like him.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n   - The town of Smile and the concept of \"Get Lost\" were charming. It felt like the perfect place to fall in love, and I wanted to move there myself.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n   - The breakup with Emmett was fine, but his character and the heroine’s initial choice to date him felt out of place.  \n   - The heroine’s Instagram subplot was unrealistic. Having 50K followers as a hobby and being surprised by the response felt dumb.  \n\n- **Writing and Editing:**  \n   - The book lacked a certain level of polish that I prefer in love stories.  \n   - The cover art was amateurish, with flat characters and weird noses. It almost deterred me from picking up the book, though the editing itself was fine.  \n\n- **Romance and Tone:**  \n   - The romance was sweet but leaned too heavily on the G-rated side. It was light on passion, with only kissing and fade-to-black scenes. It felt dull compared to other romance novels I’ve read.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I truly liked the setting and the charm of the story but didn’t love the book as a whole. I would consider reading another story by this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a sweet, G-rated romance with likable characters and a charming setting, but it lacked polish and depth.

            "This is my favorite book by the author. Presley's well-planned vacation takes an unexpected turn when her boyfriend reveals he doesn't want to spend it with her. Undeterred, she decides to go alone and meets Beckett, a ruggedly handsome worker at Get Lost Lodge and the owner's brother. As Presley pushes herself out of her comfort zone through hiking, fishing, and biking, she finds herself falling for Beckett. He is a cinnamon roll character who cherishes everything Presley brings to his life and family. While the central love story unfolds between Presley and Beckett, the heart of the narrative lies in Presley's journey to find her place within Beckett's loving and supportive family, ultimately realizing how much she has diminished herself for others. This sweet tale beautifully weaves together themes of forced proximity, found family, and opposites attracting.",

While Michigan does have mountains, they aren't located on an island, and the size of the lodge's island felt implausible.

The author's loose interpretation of geography was difficult to overlook, even if it may seem like a minor issue.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  Presley plans a surprise vacation for her boyfriend's birthday, choosing a remote Michigan island fishing lodge despite not being outdoorsy herself. When her boyfriend refuses to go, she decides to go alone. On the way, she meets Beckett, a handsome stranger whose brother owns the lodge. Forced proximity leads to sparks flying between them.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romance between Presley and Beckett feels rushed, bordering on \"ultra insta-love.\" Presley goes from being in a relationship to kissing Beckett within two days, which felt unrealistic. However, outside of the insta-love, their relationship is enjoyable, especially how they support each other outside their comfort zones.  \n\n- **Setting and Authenticity:**  \n  The story is set on a remote Michigan island, but some details about the location felt inaccurate. As a native Michigander, I found the references to Mackinaw City amusing, as it doesn’t have a mall or a commercial airport, contrary to what the book suggests.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Perspective:**  \n  The book is written in dual POV, which I appreciated. However, I noticed a few phrases that made it clear the author is not American, which slightly took me out of the story.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  Julie Rogers narrates the audiobook. While her performance was decent, I wished there had been a second narrator for Beckett’s perspective. Additionally, her long pauses after sentences were frustrating, and speeding up the playback didn’t resolve the issue.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the rushed romance and minor inaccuracies, I enjoyed the story. It’s a clean romance with a charming premise, and I appreciated the character growth and the way Presley and Beckett supported each other.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a light, clean romance with a charming premise and enjoyable character dynamics, though the insta-love and some inaccuracies in the setting detracted from the overall experience. The audiobook narration had its flaws, but the story itself was engaging enough to keep me listening.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While Presley is skilled at planning for the future, she must confront what truly matters to her.

            "In this story, the female main character, Presley, is a determined city girl who embraces nature—though she’s not a fan of hiking. The male lead, Beckett, is fiercely loyal, and their slow-burn romance is truly rewarding. Bernie, a supporting character, adds charm with her chatter, wisdom, and delightful surprises, making her a standout favorite. The romance between Presley and Beckett is beautifully crafted, with a genuine connection that shines through despite the brief timeline. Their absence from the page together is palpable, as their budding relationship is captivating.",

I also loved that she went solo on vacation after dropping her ex like a hot potato.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics and Realism:**  \n  As with any 'insta-relationship' storyline, I was interested to see how the relationship would progress over six days. The characters had a mature recognition of the length of time they knew each other and didn't have unrealistic expectations from the start. While I had to suspend a little reality to accept that knowing someone for a week could lead to rearranging life goals, the storyline was crafted in a way that didn't feel completely outside the bounds of potential reality.  \n\n- **Audio Narration:**  \n  The audio narration was very well done. The only thing that could have been interesting to explore was having separate narrators for each of the MC POVs. Hearing the MMC POV in a male voice can be really enjoyable.

Their personalities complement each other beautifully—Presley describes herself as someone who goes all in, and Beckett, though initially unaware, shares this trait. The romance is both realistic and well-paced; despite the story unfolding over just ten days, it avoids the pitfalls of instalove.

I enjoyed his personality but wished for more development and screen time.\n   - **Presley:** A strong character who proves she can move on from her ex and find love again. Her development throughout the book was well-executed and satisfying.\n   - **Side Characters:** They were caring and added depth to the story, enhancing Presley’s journey.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The romance was a friends-to-lovers and instant-love trope, which was cute and well-done but lacked deeper emotional stakes or memorable moments.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The book was well-written, consistent with the author’s previous works, which I’ve enjoyed in the past.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - I enjoyed the book as a light, easy read, particularly as a beach read. However, it didn’t stand out as a memorable romance due to the lack of significant conflicts or events.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis was a well-written, cute romance with a charming small-town setting and likable characters. While I enjoyed the story and the characters’ development, the lack of major conflicts or memorable events made it feel somewhat basic. It’s a good choice for a light, easy read, but it doesn’t stand out as a particularly impactful romance.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The storyline about Beckett leaving without expressing his feelings for Presley until it was \"too late\" frustrated me. It didn't feel truly \"too late,\" given that they eventually reconcile. I couldn't understand why he waited until she was home to finally be mature and discuss his emotions. This reflects a common trope of \"miscommunication,\" where characters fail to accept their feelings despite being adults, and it's a trope I really dislike.",

            "The story follows Presley Ayers, who surprises her boyfriend with a trip to a fishing lodge, only to be heartbroken when he dumps her. Undeterred, she decides to go alone, despite her aversion to the outdoors. At the lodge, she meets Beckett Keller, and they quickly form a deep connection. Over the course of their 10 days together, they navigate personal challenges while making the most of their time. The premise of opposites attracting in a small-town romance with a closed-door relationship is both engaging and heartwarming. Surprisingly, the insta-love trope, which I typically dislike, works well here due to the strong chemistry between the characters.",

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the sweet romance and found the pacing just right. The engaging plot kept me captivated from start to finish.",
            "The main characters were delightful. Presley, a city girl navigating a new environment, was both fun and caring. Her willingness to step out of her comfort zone to try activities like fishing and camping made her relatable and endearing. Beckett, a charming and helpful small-town man, served as the perfect counterpart to Presley. His commitment to assisting his siblings with the lodge added depth to his character. The supporting cast truly enriched the story; they were fun, likable, and contributed to the sense of a found family, enhancing the narrative's sweetness. Although I typically don't prefer insta-love romances, I found this one cute and heartwarming. The execution was well done, though I wished for more focus on the couple's time together rather than Beckett's responsibilities at the lodge. The opposites-attract and found-family tropes were enjoyable and added to the story's charm.",

While physical attraction and instant chemistry are understandable, the deep emotional connection they developed within hours of meeting felt unrealistic and unconvincing. The characters' self-awareness about their quick connection (\"How can I be feeling so connected to this person after so short of time?\") only made it worse for me, as it didn’t add depth or believability to their relationship.  \n\n- **Appeal to Romance Readers:**  \n  Despite my personal reservations, I recognize that this book will likely appeal to some romance readers who don’t mind or even enjoy the insta-love trope.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Acknowledgment:**  \n  I am grateful to the author, NetGalley, and Macmillan Audio for providing me with a free copy of the audio ARC in exchange for my honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a cute premise and likable characters, the insta-love and unrealistic emotional intimacy between the protagonists made it a miss for me.

I was thrilled when this aspect emerged in the narrative.",

However, it became clearer as the story progressed.  \n   - Another great book by Sophie Sullivan.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartwarming and engaging read with well-developed characters, a believable narrative, and a charming setting reminiscent of *Gilmore Girls*. While there was a minor hiccup in understanding Gray’s backstory initially, the overall experience was delightful, leaving me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I was halfway through the book, and it was only day two of Presley being in the lodge.  \n  - The story was repetitive, often repeating the same things over again.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - I liked the characters, especially Becket, who was such a sweet guy.  \n  - I could relate to Presley’s desire for a family that cared for and loved her, and I enjoyed the found family aspect of the story.  \n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  - Some of the dialogue felt cringy, particularly when Becket used “hashtag.”  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  - The book read like a Hallmark movie, which had both good and bad qualities.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had its charms, particularly in its characters and the heartwarming found family theme. However, the slow pacing, repetitive nature, and occasional cringy dialogue made it a less enjoyable read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Uncharacteristically, she decides to take the trip herself.  \n   - In the small town of Smile on Lake Michigan, she meets Beckett, an outdoorsy man whose brother owns the lodge. Their differences—Presley in designer clothes and Beckett in plaid—create an interesting dynamic, but they balance each other well as the story progresses.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - Sophie Sullivan’s writing style is easy to read and immersive, allowing me to get fully absorbed into the story right away.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The setting of the lodge and the outdoorsy vibe added a sense of adventure to the story. It reminded me of another book I loved, *The Suite Spot* by Trish Doller.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n   - Presley and Beckett’s contrasting personalities and lifestyles create a compelling dynamic, making their relationship feel genuine and well-balanced.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - *Love, Naturally* is an endearing and warmhearted read. I enjoyed it thoroughly and hope there might be a spin-off featuring some of the side characters.  \n\n- **Author’s Future Work:**  \n   - I’m looking forward to reading more books by Sophie Sullivan.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Love, Naturally* is a charming and immersive novel with a delightful mix of romance, adventure, and character-driven storytelling.

            "The rapid transition from city life to wilderness living in just ten days felt unrealistic, making the story less believable.

It is very reminiscent of the very broad structures and setups for her previous stories, so it just didn’t really give me anything new or exciting.  \n\n- **Character Enjoyment:**  \n  However, I enjoyed the characters.  \n\n- **Story Tone and Appeal:**  \n  The story was still the cute, fluffy, easy story I wanted it to be.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  Probably not my favorite of her books though.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book met my expectations for a cute and fluffy rom-com, it didn’t stand out as particularly original or exciting compared to the author’s previous works. I enjoyed the characters and the lighthearted tone, but it didn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5 stars)  \n*Note: The review mentions \"closed door / no spice,\" indicating the absence of explicit content.*"

However, the slow pacing and repetitive writing style held it back from being a higher-rated read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 to 3.5 out of 5."

Beckett was a particularly likable character, and I found him easier to connect with compared to Emmett.  \n- **Conflict and Drama:** I appreciated that there wasn’t a major drama separating the main characters, as it made the story feel more grounded and relatable.  \n- **Romantic Elements:** While I wouldn’t have minded an open-door scene, I understand that not every reader enjoys such elements, and their absence didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is my favorite Sophie Sullivan novel to date!

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the romantic leads, Presley and Beckett. Both characters were delightful, and I appreciated getting inside their heads. Presley, an optimistic city girl, often overlooked red flags in her relationships and work. Her journey to Get Lost served as a relatable exploration of stepping out of her comfort zone and discovering her true self, adding depth to the story. Beckett, with his heart of gold, was hesitant to take risks, often sacrificing his own needs for his family's sake, which made him a sweet and endearing romantic lead. The Keller family felt like a wonderful found family, bringing unexpected joy to the narrative. Jill, Grayson, and Ollie were particularly charming, and Ollie reminded me so much of my daughter that she brought a smile to my face every time she appeared.",

            "The story opens with Presley, a city girl who plans a surprise vacation for her boyfriend, Emmett, only to be heartbroken when he declines. Undeterred, she decides to embark on the trip alone, despite her lack of outdoor experience. The narrative shifts dramatically when she meets Beckett, a rugged outdoorsman, and their instant connection transforms her journey. The story delves into themes of self-discovery, love, and the delicate balance between pursuing personal dreams and making sacrifices for others. The beginning is strong and engaging, while the ending delivers a powerful emotional impact. However, the middle section meanders, focusing too much on side characters and their stories, which detracts from the main plot and slows the pacing. Overall, the ending is satisfying and resonates deeply.",
            "In this story, Presley undergoes a profound transformation as she learns the true meaning of love and self-worth, refusing to settle for less. Meanwhile, Beckett evolves from a risk-averse individual bound by routine to someone who embraces change and prioritizes his own dreams. The side characters, including Beckett's family and the town of Smile, significantly enrich the narrative, although their arcs occasionally overshadow the main plot. The connection between Presley and Beckett is immediate and compelling, with their contrasting personalities—Presley's affinity for change versus Beckett's preference for stability—adding depth to their relationship. Their love story is further complicated by the time constraints of their relationship and the sacrifices they may need to make to be together.",
            "The small town of Smile serves as a character in its own right, boasting a close-knit community and a charming, outdoorsy atmosphere. While this setting adds to the story's appeal, the excessive focus on the town and its side characters occasionally detracts from the main narrative."

            "I absolutely loved Presley; she’s a wonderfully developed character. Beckett is equally charming, and their dynamic is simply adorable. As an accomplished concierge, Presley is more familiar with luxury than outdoor adventures, making her relatable and endearing. In contrast, Beckett is rugged and driven, focused on his dreams for the lodge, which highlights their compelling differences. Presley’s willingness to try activities Beckett enjoys—despite ending up with bandaid-covered feet—demonstrates her growth and desire to step outside her comfort zone. Their undeniable attraction is palpable, even though they are complete opposites: he’s all rough stubble and plaid shirts, while she’s in high heels and designer outfits. Their romance strikes a perfect balance—not too rushed or overdone—offering just the right mix of sweetness and tension.",

As the narrative unfolds, she becomes unexpectedly drawn to Beckett, the lodge owner's son. This novel showcases an opposites-attract, forced-proximity romance infused with small-town charm and a fade-to-black style. Although the third-act breakup is predictable, it serves the plot well and is executed effectively. Beckett's grand gesture to win Presley back feels both fitting and contemporary.",
            "Presley is a relatable protagonist who pushes herself beyond her comfort zone, even after her initial motivation to impress her ex fades. Beckett is more than just a rugged mountain man; his complexity, coupled with Presley's guilt over her initial stereotypes, adds depth to their relationship. The supporting characters—Jill, Ollie, Grayson, and Rylee—are well-developed and enrich the narrative, with Ollie standing out as particularly adorable and memorable.",

The novel features an opposites-attract, forced-proximity, insta-love romance with small-town vibes and a fade-to-black approach. The third-act breakup, while predictable, felt necessary for the plot and was well-executed.

Beckett is more than just a \"hot mountain man\"; his depth and Presley's guilt over stereotyping him added layers to their dynamic. The side characters, including Jill, Ollie, Grayson, and Rylee, were well-developed and added richness to the story. Ollie, in particular, was adorable and memorable.  \n\n- **Writing Style and POV:**  \n  The story is told in dual third-person POVs, but the distinction between Presley and Beckett's perspectives wasn't strongly felt. Despite this, the narrative flowed well and kept me engaged. The audiobook narration was excellent, enhancing the overall experience.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The small-town and lodge setting created a cozy, Hallmark-movie vibe that was charming and immersive.

I would love to see more stories featuring this family, as they were a highlight of the novel. The book has the potential to be adapted into a Hallmark movie, given its tone and themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a delightful read with a charming premise, well-developed characters, and a cozy small-town atmosphere. While the dual POVs could have been more distinct, the story was engaging and heartwarming.

Her immediate connection with Beckett raises the question of whether their bond can deepen in the limited time they have together.

The inclusion of a #hotmountainman social media frenzy added a humorous and engaging twist to the story.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Beckett and Sophie share a sweet and endearing romance. Sophie’s lack of outdoorsy experience is balanced by her enthusiastic \"try-anything\" attitude, which Beckett respects and admires. Their dynamic is both charming and relatable.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The book is described as a fun and enjoyable read from start to finish, with moments that made me laugh out loud. The lighthearted tone and humor made it a perfect escape for a hot weekend.  \n\n- **Author and Future Interest:**  \n  This was my first book by this author, but the experience was so enjoyable that I am eager to explore more of their work in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful and entertaining romance, combining humor, charm, and a unique premise. The characters were well-developed, and the story kept me engaged throughout. It was the perfect read for a relaxing weekend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 1/2 stars.  \n*AI voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book.*"
