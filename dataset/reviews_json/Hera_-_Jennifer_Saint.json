            "I thoroughly enjoyed this retelling, which offered a refreshing and honest perspective. The author presents a nuanced view that challenges the often one-sided narratives I encountered growing up. This fresh approach is both compelling and thought-provoking.",
            "I would love to share a cup of tea with Hera—if only she could take a gentler form to spare me from her fiery radiance. I would express my empathy for her sorrows and bitterness, and assure her that at dawn, I’ll help her bring Zeus to justice. Beyond the treachery she has endured time and again, the story beautifully showcases her remarkable personal growth. We witness her nurturing certain creatures and her longing to be among those who revere her, as she seeks earthly experiences that drive her transformation.",
            "In this retelling, a woman, regardless of her power, is reduced to a mere tool for others' gains. The narrative boldly highlights the patriarchal structures that have shaped history, illustrating how even a goddess must know her place and never challenge Zeus—or any man. It starkly reveals the lengths to which society has gone to subdue women.",

Even a goddess knows her place and should never cross Zeus, let alone any man.\"  \n   - How far things were taken to subdue women in general.  \n\n- **Character Development (Hera):**  \n   - I wanted to sit down and have tea with Hera, granted she take a more delicate form as to not burn me alive with her radiance.  \n   - I would tell her I understand her sorrows and her hate, and let her know I'll meet her at dawn and burn Zeus to the ground.  \n   - Aside from the treachery this poor woman endured over and over, we also get to see her make leaps and bounds in her personal growth.  \n   - Caring for certain creatures. Glinting desires to be among those who worshiped her. To gain earthly experiences guiding her changes.  \n\n- **Storytelling and Engagement:**  \n   - The storytelling itself was well done and had my attention the entire time.  \n   - I really felt for quite a few characters in this story.  \n   - I learned some new lore and deepened my understandings of others.  \n\n- **Memorable Moments and Insights:**  \n   - There are other ways to rule. Sometimes the true power is in the shadows, someone who stays out of the light and watches others shrivel and burn in its glare.  \n   - The monsters are here, clad in beautiful immortal flesh.  \n   - I'll never see peacocks the same again (Flashback to Hercules show, you'll get it).  \n   - Her own name, as justification for rape... (Referring to Hera. When you get there, it's such an insulting smack).  \n   - We're the ones who need their offerings now. We thrive on what they give us. Without their worship, without their belief, we would shrivel away. Become no more than spirits haunting the earth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a refreshing and honest retelling of mythology, particularly through the lens of Hera, providing deep social commentary on patriarchal structures and the subjugation of women. The storytelling is engaging, and the character development, especially Hera's, is compelling. The book not only entertained me but also deepened my understanding of mythology and its themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "Hera emerges as a complex and unapologetically ambitious goddess, driven by a ruthless desire for power, recognition, and retribution against Zeus. While her actions are often brutal and unfair, the novel skillfully unravels her vulnerabilities and contradictions, portraying her as a well-rounded character. Hera's motivations extend beyond mere jealousy; they encompass pride, love for her children and monsters, and a longing to retaliate against Zeus.\n\nCentral to the narrative is Hera's tumultuous relationship with her godhood and her role as the goddess of marriage. Insulted by her designation, she fiercely protects her worshippers, particularly women. The story delves into the essence of female strength and power, revealing how women express their authority in diverse ways. Hera’s bitterness is rooted in her brothers' usurpation of the power that rightfully belonged to her and her sisters.\n\nThe novel also emphasizes the significance of female relationships, such as Hera's bond with Hestia, her mother-daughter connection with Gaia, and her evolving relationship with Ekhnida. Other compelling dynamics are explored, like Demeter's love for her daughter and Artemis's care for her mother. The goddesses are depicted as equally powerful as their male counterparts, each playing a crucial role in the fabric of humanity.\n\nSupporting characters are richly developed, with Hestia standing out for her kindness and quiet strength. Artemis, Ares, Dionysos, and Hephaestus are also portrayed with depth and nuance, enhancing the story's exploration of various abusive dynamics and the cyclical nature of trauma. Overall, the novel presents a nuanced examination of female power and relationships in a world shaped by divine complexity.",
            "The author skillfully weaves together diverse myths into a cohesive and captivating narrative. With its exquisite prose, the novel centers on themes of revenge, godhood, and power. Notably, the author undertakes the bold challenge of portraying the notoriously complex character of Hera. The ending is especially poignant, as Hera discovers freedom and fulfillment after centuries of turmoil. The final lines resonate with her immortality and her capacity for reinvention."

            "In this compelling story, Hera transforms from a newlywed goddess focused on building Olympus into a vengeful wife and formidable war leader, ultimately emerging as an individual defined beyond Zeus and Olympus. Her tumultuous marriage drives her to cruel actions, yet she finds solace in embracing the earth's monsters. Hera’s curiosity about mortals leads her to seek understanding and integration with the world around her, rather than perpetual separation. The dynamic between Zeus and Hera is central, highlighting how Zeus’s infidelity and mockery undermine her sense of self. Hera’s internal conflict—torn between her love for Zeus and her need for self-preservation—is poignantly depicted. Moments of connection, like her silent communion with her sister, offer glimpses of peace and sanctity amid the chaos.",

In contrast, Hera's immortal existence stretches across centuries or even millennia, giving the narrative a unique depth. The brief appearances of other mythological figures, like Atalanta, further highlight the vastness of Hera’s life, as these legendary characters are reduced to mere sentences or pages.",

This book provides a fresh perspective on Hera, a figure often overlooked in Greek mythology, depicting her as a wronged and neglected individual whose potential and ambition have been unjustly sidelined.",

A powerful moment occurs when she witnesses Heracles, the “glory of Hera,” slaying her own grandchildren—Typhon's offspring—while attaining greatness in her name.

            "The author effectively portrays Hera as a sympathetic character while preserving her traditionally jealous traits, primarily aimed at thwarting Zeus rather than mere jealousy. Her character development before her marriage to Zeus and during the ascent of the Olympians adds significant depth. The exploration of her survival instincts, her responses to trauma—particularly Zeus’s assault and their forced union—and the resulting effects on her relationships with other gods and her children are compelling. It’s particularly poignant that Gaia, who initially appears willing to assist Hera, ultimately abandons her when she needs support the most.",
            "This story effectively explores power dynamics, the absence of solidarity among the goddesses, and Hera's isolation. The evolution of the gods over time adds a compelling layer to the narrative. The melancholic ending resonates well and offers a satisfying conclusion to Zeus's arc."

        "conclusion": "This novel offered a compelling and sympathetic take on Hera, delving into her backstory, trauma, and evolution as a survivor. The exploration of power dynamics, the passage of time, and the gods’ changing roles added depth to the narrative. While I wished for more support from Hera toward mortal women, her detachment felt consistent with her character.

            "I appreciated how the author recontextualized Hera's actions and motivations, moving past the typical depiction of her as a jealous and vindictive wife. Hera's frustration arises from being denied her birthright as Kronos's daughter and being coerced into a marriage with Zeus, who belittles her role as a queen. While Hera's ego and questionable treatment of humans are acknowledged, her character is rendered more nuanced and justified in this retelling. Additionally, Hestia, often sidelined in traditional myths, is richly developed here. The portrayal of Athena and the conflict between Hera and Dionysus also adds intriguing depth to the narrative.",
            "The author reimagines the myth of Typhon, depicting him as the offspring of Hera rather than Gaia, which introduces an intriguing twist to the chronology of these myths. I appreciated the interconnected sequencing of the stories, despite the original myths lacking a clear timeline."

The creative reimagining of myths, combined with strong character development, makes it a standout.

The author adds nuance to her motivations, moving beyond the typical jealous wife stereotype. Hera's backstory—co-conspirator with Zeus in overthrowing their father and later sidelined by her brothers—deepens her character. Her contradictions, such as rejecting domesticity while nurturing monsters and seeking family support while refusing to sacrifice herself, make her both relatable and complex.",

It was incredibly easy to follow, making it an engaging read.  \n\n- **Character Development (Hera):**  \n  The author excelled in portraying Hera’s transformation from her early days as a goddess to her evolution throughout the Olympian rule. Her complex personality, including her disdain for Zeus as a ruthless dictator and her eventual descent into becoming what she hated most, was vividly depicted. Her jealousy and rage were central to her character arc.  \n\n- **Mythological Accuracy and Storytelling:**  \n  The author did a great job retelling Greek myths, such as those involving Heracles, Achilles, and the Trojan War. The narrative also explored how the gods decided their roles, providing a rich and immersive experience. It felt as though I was on Mount Olympus, observing the gods and goddesses interact.  \n\n- **Ending and Themes:**  \n  The ending was particularly satisfying, as it grounded Hera’s character. The realization that “the gods created humans, but now Hera is seeing humans create gods…in their artworks, in their poems and plays, in their philosophizing” [Page 383] was a profound and thought-provoking conclusion.  \n\n- **Re-readability and Emotional Impact:**  \n  I would read this book again to re-immerse myself in Hera’s character and her struggles during her reign on Mount Olympus. The emotional depth and complexity of her journey left a lasting impression, and I now understand why she is known as the Queen of the Gods.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is an amazing read that masterfully blends Greek mythology with compelling character development and thought-provoking themes. The author’s ability to bring Hera’s story to life, along with the vivid retelling of classic myths, makes this book highly recommendable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Hera may be the last goddess anyone thought would be the focus of a book. Typically, retellings spotlight characters like Medusa and Briseis, who are clearly wronged, or those tangled in problematic romances, like Persephone. Hera is often portrayed as a possessive, vengeful figure, known for ruthlessly punishing her husband's illegitimate children and their mothers. While this characterization is present in the book, it offers a deeper exploration of her complexity.",
            "Having read all of the author's previous works, I can confidently say this one is my favorite. It's cleverly crafted, seamlessly weaving together pivotal and minor legends to enhance the character's motivations.",
            "This book explores themes of loss of power and autonomy, the quest for revenge, and the journey toward moving on rather than remaining trapped in the past. The author does not shy away from depicting the darker aspects of Hera's character as portrayed in mythology—such as sending snakes to kill a baby or deceiving a girl into a fatal situation. Instead, the narrative provides insight into the motivations behind these actions, illustrating their alignment with the nature of an Olympian god.",
            "An outstanding read!"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Skill and Writing Style:**  \n  I have read all of Jennifer Saint's previous books and liked them all, but this one is definitely my favorite. I found it to be very cleverly put together. Saint has covered all the most pivotal (and many minor) legends and organized them within a story in a way that perfectly works for her character's motivations.  \n\n- **Accessibility for New Readers:**  \n  If you know nothing about Greek mythology, this could be a good entry point. The book is structured in a way that makes it easy to follow and understand, even for those unfamiliar with the myths.  \n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n  Hera herself is probably the last Goddess anyone had been expecting a book about. It is usually the obviously wronged characters (Medusa, Briseis) or the ones with problematic romance (Persephone) that are given attention in retellings. Hera has always had a bad reputation as the possessively jealous, vengeful, proud, and imperious figure who would brutally prosecute her husband's illegitimate kids and their mothers. And she is exactly that in this book. But she is also a whole lot more.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The whole book carries the theme of the loss of power and autonomy, of seeking revenge, and eventually learning to move on instead of being stuck. Saint does not paint any of the horrible things assigned to Hera by the myths in pink (that includes sending snakes to kill a baby, deceiving a girl in order for her to burn to death, etc.), but it tells you why and why it is in character for an Olympian god.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  Really, really good.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book stands out as my favorite among Jennifer Saint's works. It is cleverly structured, accessible for newcomers to Greek mythology, and offers a nuanced portrayal of Hera, delving into her motivations and the broader themes of power, revenge, and moving forward.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Approach and Challenge:**  \n  I can’t imagine how daunting it was to write a book about Hera, a goddess often seen as vindictive and ruthless, and not necessarily a feminist icon. I was very excited to read *Hera* when Saint announced her fourth book would focus on her. I always enjoy retellings about gods or goddesses, and Hera has always intrigued me. I trusted Saint to write a beautiful story, and she didn’t disappoint. I was curious when Saint mentioned she had to scrap her original draft, and I wonder what wasn’t working in that version. Writing about an immortal goddess who has existed for eons must have been challenging—deciding who to include, what to focus on, understanding Hera’s motivations, and figuring out how to end a story about an immortal being. Saint succeeded brilliantly in addressing all these aspects.\n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n  This might be my favorite of Saint’s books, though I tend to say that about all her works. I loved how complex she made Hera. She provided explanations for Hera’s actions and motivations, portraying her as the embodiment of female rage and a woman scorned, whose power was stripped away by a man. I appreciated Hera’s journey of coming to terms with her long life and relearning what it means to be powerful.\n\n- **Narrative and Themes:**  \n  The retelling was unique, especially in how it described the “downfall” of the Greek gods and the transformation of their image over time. I also loved the callbacks to Saint’s other books, which made me wonder if she included Easter eggs in this one that might hint at her next project.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Impact:**  \n  This book is definitely a favorite of mine this year. It was a beautifully crafted story that resonated deeply with me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJennifer Saint’s *Hera* is a masterful retelling that delves into the complexities of a goddess often misunderstood. Through rich characterization, a unique narrative, and thoughtful exploration of themes, Saint has created a compelling and memorable story. It’s a standout addition to her works and a personal favorite for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I absolutely adored this perspective on Hera, where she’s not some jealous and possessive wife, but a powerful woman desperate to stand in her own right rather than in Zeus’s shadow.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Themes:**  \n  The story was in fact pretty heartbreaking at times, painting her as far more of a victim of Zeus’s wants and needs, taken advantage of in much the same way as the human women we read about. It’s easy to feel enraged whilst reading, but thankfully there were strong bonds of sisterhood and unexpected tender moments towards her own children which brought some light and hope to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n  As always, it’s beautifully written and compelling.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I truly loved that satisfying ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAnother triumph from one of my favourite authors! This novel offers a fresh and emotionally resonant take on Hera, blending heartbreak, empowerment, and hope in a beautifully crafted narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nActual rating: 4.5."

            "I appreciated the fresh perspective on Hera in this retelling of Greek mythology. Traditionally one of my least favorite goddesses, often depicted as hateful, vengeful, and jealous, this portrayal offers a deeper understanding of her character. While she retains those traits, they are presented in a way that feels justified. This interpretation allowed me to see her as more than just the jealous wife of the King of the Gods, revealing her complexity and depth.",

She is one of (my) most disliked Greek goddesses, always portrayed as hateful, vengeful, and jealous...which, she still is in this book, but rightly so in my opinion. I never really gave myself a chance to look at things from her perspective, and in this interpretation, she is so much more than the jealous wife of the King of the Gods.\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:** I'm really glad I picked up this book.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nJennifer Saint delivers another compelling read, offering a fresh and nuanced perspective on Hera, a character often misunderstood and disliked.

            "The main critique is the insufficient exploration of Hera's life before and during the Titan war, which would have clarified what she was compelled to sacrifice.",
            "The portrayal of the gods, particularly Hera, is refreshingly complex, embodying both the grandeur and dysfunction of the Olympian deities. Hera emerges as a multifaceted character—a heroine in the war against the Titans, a victim of assault, a vengeful wife, a protector of women, and a champion of heroes. The author refrains from whitewashing Hera's actions, instead providing nuanced motivations that elevate her beyond the stereotype of a jealous wife or wicked stepmother. She is depicted as a woman trapped in an unwanted role, which drives her to target Zeus' illegitimate children and the women he harms. The novel skillfully avoids reducing female characters to mere archetypes of helplessness or power; instead, it imbues them with depth and humanity. Even secondary characters are vividly drawn, displaying unique strengths, challenges, and dynamic relationships with Hera. These women can be mentors, rivals, friends, enemies, or allies, with their roles shifting fluidly based on the circumstances."

        "conclusion": "The author's *Hera* is a standout Greek mythology retelling that breathes new life into the often-vilified goddess.

While I wished for more backstory on Hera's early life, this did not detract from my overall enjoyment. It’s a five-star read that I highly recommend.",

I was eager to see how she would be portrayed, hoping the book would restore her dignity rather than perpetuate the distorted image many have of her.\n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**\n   - The author did an excellent job portraying Hera as a morally ambiguous character, showcasing her strengths, flaws, highs, and lows. She was depicted with respect and reverence, particularly in her constant struggle for power and freedom against Zeus.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story’s timeline was well-constructed, from the confrontation with the Titans to the rise of Olympus, the births of Zeus’s illegitimate children, and the culmination of the Trojan War. The pacing and organization were strong, though some transitions, like the sudden shift to Atlas’s perspective during Hera and Zeus’s wedding, felt abrupt and unnecessary.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**\n   - The settings were vividly described, from the elegance of Olympus’s halls to the nostalgia of Oceanus’s domain, the chaos of Pheme’s hall, the wildness of the mortal world, and the darkness of Ekhidna and Typhon’s cave. Each location was distinct and memorable.\n\n- **Narrative Choices and Missed Opportunities:**\n   - The absence of Rhea was disappointing, as her disappearance was mentioned early on but never resolved. Additionally, the handling of Persephone’s abduction felt poorly executed, with unnecessary confusion and missed opportunities to highlight Zeus’s antagonistic role. Athena’s proposal for a compromise between Demeter and Hades felt out of place and underdeveloped.\n\n- **Surprising Elements and Depth:**\n   - I was pleasantly surprised by the inclusion of Hera being saved by Gaia and raised by Tethys and Oceanus, which added depth to her character. Her role as the mother of Typhon and her relationship with her monstrous grandchildren were also fascinating. The portrayal of Hera as more than just a jealous and vengeful goddess—showing her as a warrior, queen, mother, sister, and survivor—was a highlight.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The book evoked strong emotions, particularly in four key moments: Asteria’s love for Leto, Hera aiding the women of Argos after Dionysus’s attack, her farewell to Hephaestus, and her final liberation, where she becomes independent and true to herself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I adored this book for its rich portrayal of Hera, its well-constructed timeline, and its vivid world-building.

Spanning from the dawn of Mount Olympus to the end of the palatial period and the emergence of Athenian democracy, the story immerses readers in a vivid ancient world.

Without altering the mythic canon or changing Hera's personality, Saint immerses readers in her experience, illuminating her profound rage and discontent toward mortals. Rather than being evil or vindictive, Hera emerges as a figure who is deeply wronged and trapped in a perpetually painful marriage. This nuanced portrayal renders her both relatable and compelling.",

            "This book delves into power dynamics and intersectional identities, critiquing oppressive systems and the cyclical nature of power. It powerfully conveys that overthrowing Zeus would only swap one ruling elite for another. Additionally, the portrayal of Hera’s understandable yet flawed actions adds depth to the narrative.",

Having read all of Saint's previous work, I was curious to see how things would change when she was writing about a goddess, rather than a mortal—and if anything, I enjoyed this even more.\n\n- **Appreciation for Classical Retellings:**\n   - I've been doing a university module on classical retellings, and it's definitely made me appreciate just how much life a novelization can bring to the overlooked women of Greek myth—and this is no exception.\n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**\n   - Saint's Hera draws on the complexity of her myths—her status as a queen, wife, and mother, and how she can fit this with her own sense of self.\n\n- **Use of Mythology:**\n   - Different myths are drawn in from across the canon, and as a classicist, it was really fun to see how she built on and subverted some of them, without relying on the reader to have studied them before. My only complaint would be that there are a few myths I wish had been in there too!\n\n- **World-Building and Immortality:**\n   - The world of the Greek gods she builds is rich and complicated, and she's clearly considered the effects of immortality on the minds and morals of these timeless beings.\n\n- **Characterization of Other Deities:**\n   - I particularly enjoyed her characterization of Athena and Hestia (but then again, I've always had a soft spot for Hestia!).\n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**\n   - There's so much I want to say about this book—about how I absolutely tore through it when I had plenty of other things that needed doing, and that ending—but I'm trying to fight the urge to spoil it.\n\n- **Recommendation and Comparable Works:**\n   - If you're looking for a new mythology fix, this is definitely worth a try. Books with similar vibes include *Atalanta* by Jennifer Saint, *Circe* by Madeline Miller, *Winter Harvest* by Ioanna Papadopoulou, *Clytemnestra* by Constanza Casati, and *The Penelopiad* by Margaret Atwood.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a standout in Jennifer Saint's body of work, offering a rich and complex retelling of Greek mythology through the lens of Hera. It masterfully balances character depth, world-building, and mythological innovation, making it a compelling read for fans of classical retellings.

By highlighting the mistreatment of women by male gods, the story provides a refreshing perspective on Hera’s often-misunderstood traits of cruelty and jealousy.",

            "The novel delves into themes of vengeance, power, and the mistreatment of women, reminiscent of stories like *Maleficent* that unveil the motivations behind a character’s actions. A striking quote—*“All she knows is that he leaves a trail of broken women in his wake, and she is the most broken of them all,”*—captures the emotional essence of Hera’s journey.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - As a huge fan of historical fiction and mythology, I was thrilled to receive an early copy of *Hera*. The book delivers on its promise of gods, monsters, mythology, and Greek history.  \n  - The unspeakable actions of the gods are a central theme, adding depth and intrigue to the story.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - Hera is not portrayed as a likable character, but the book humanizes her, making her more relatable.  \n  - I was particularly intrigued by her life before becoming Zeus's wife—a fate she resisted but was forced into. Her plight evokes empathy, especially from one woman to another.  \n  - However, her spiteful and wrathful actions, particularly toward Zeus's other victims and innocent children, are hard to excuse, even with her backstory.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The book covers a vast span of history, which means it sometimes speeds through events or jumps rapidly in time.  \n  - Given that the gods' lives span thousands of years, this pacing feels appropriate and didn’t detract from my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Immersion:**  \n  - Jennifer Saint’s writing is immersive, and I felt fully transported into the world of the gods.  \n  - I was particularly captivated by how the gods interfered with and manipulated the lives of the humans they created.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Appeal:**  \n  - Jennifer Saint has once again delivered a compelling story. Fans of her previous works are sure to love this one.  \n  - I highly recommend *Hera* to anyone who enjoys mythology and historical fiction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Hera* is a captivating exploration of Greek mythology, offering a nuanced portrayal of a complex and often unlikable character. Despite its rapid pacing and time jumps, the story remains engaging and immersive. Jennifer Saint’s skillful storytelling makes this a must-read for fans of her previous works and mythology enthusiasts alike.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐️"

Unlike many retellings that emphasize her jealousy over Zeus's affairs, this book explores her emotions, motivations, and the rationale behind her actions. Hera's voice is authentic, allowing readers to truly engage with the mind of the Queen of Olympus.",

I count myself lucky to have been selected to read this book early.  \n\n- **Familiarity with the Subject Matter:**  \n  Hera's story isn't one I'm overly familiar with. I only knew snippets of her exploits from other myths, so it was great to have a book dedicated solely to her story.  \n\n- **Narrative Scope and Structure:**  \n  The book takes us from the very beginning of Hera's (and the other original Olympians') birth and follows her journey for thousands of years, until the Greek Gods fade as human society evolves.  \n\n- **Character Perspective and Depth:**  \n  It was refreshing to hear the story from Hera's perspective. Many retellings focus on her jealousy regarding Zeus's conquests, but this book delves deeper into her feelings, motivations, and the reasons behind her actions. Hera's voice felt authentic, and I loved exploring the mind of the Queen of Olympus.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  This was a fantastic book, and I would highly recommend it (and any of Jennifer Saint's other works) to anyone with an interest in Greek mythology.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a rich and immersive retelling of Hera's story, providing depth and authenticity to her character.

While she commits many terrible acts, the narrative fosters compassion and a deeper understanding of her motivations. The book delves into Hera's challenges as Queen of the Gods, highlighting her experiences of betrayal, disrespect, and dismissal from those closest to her.

However, the author presents Hera in a fresh light as a strong, independent goddess who plays a vital role in defeating the Titans, only to be sidelined in the division of the realms. Initially, after Zeus assaults her, she feels powerless and naively assumes that marrying him will bind them equally. As the narrative unfolds, Hera evolves from a bitter, scheming wife into a complex character, and by the end of the book, I found myself truly appreciating her depth and transformation.",

After reading this book, I feel much more connected to Hera.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I think this may just be one of my favorite myth retellings to date.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to Headline for providing me with an ARC to read and review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a fresh and emotionally resonant perspective on Hera, transforming her from a traditionally vilified figure into a complex and relatable character. Jennifer Saint's storytelling shines, making this one of the most compelling Greek myth retellings I've encountered.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated how the novel delved into Hera's intricate mythology, addressing nearly all of her key myths. The portrayal of her agency diverged slightly from the traditional canon, enriching her character. I found it particularly compelling to witness her journey of self-awareness as she recognized the flaws in her actions and motivations. Additionally, Athena's cold and calculating demeanor seemed to enhance Hera's character, creating a striking contrast that lingered in my mind. If this juxtaposition was intentional, it was executed thoughtfully and provoked deeper reflection.",

Her agency was slightly different from the mythological canon, which added depth to her character. It was particularly compelling to see her realize that some of her actions and motivations were wrong, adding a layer of self-awareness and growth.  \n\n- **Thematic Depth and Historical Alignment:**  \n  The arc of the waxing and waning of the gods' power aligning with the Bronze Age collapse was a fascinating and creative take. It added a rich historical and thematic layer to the story, making it feel both grounded and epic.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Ending:**  \n  The ending was incredibly powerful and left a lasting impression on me. It was so moving that I cried a little, especially since I finished it late at night.  \n\n- **Character Contrasts (Hera vs. Athena):**  \n  I found it interesting that Athena was described as cold and calculating, which seemed to fit Hera's character even more. This contrast stuck with me, and I wonder if it was intentional. If so, it was well-executed and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a stunning reimagining of Hera's mythology, blending her complex character with a fascinating historical backdrop.

            "The author’s portrayal of Hera transformed my perception of her, evoking both sympathy and admiration. She emerges as a complex character, embodying female rage and the pain of being scorned and stripped of power by Zeus. Rather than demonizing her, the book delves into the reasons behind her anger, making her actions understandable. Hera is depicted as more than just a jealous wife or vengeful stepmother; she is a strong woman with a rich history, including her lineage as Cronus’s daughter and her victories in war.",
            "The gradual decline of the gods' world following Hestia's departure is both intriguing and melancholic. The notion of humanity becoming strong enough to outgrow the gods is a unique and thought-provoking concept. The author's skill in immersing readers in the divine realm before grounding them in reality is beautifully executed.",
            "Hera's dedication to protecting her worshippers and her profound emotional connection with them moved me to tears. Her journey of rediscovering true power, joy, and love is both deeply emotional and inspiring."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The author’s retelling of Hera’s story is a powerful, feminist exploration of one of Greek mythology’s most misunderstood goddesses. Through masterful characterization, emotional depth, and thought-provoking themes, the book transforms Hera from a figure of scorn to one of empathy and admiration. The novel’s exploration of power, freedom, and the decline of the gods’ world is both poignant and satisfying, leaving a lasting impact on the reader.",

Hera is a character I’ve encountered before, but mostly as a secondary figure. This book gave me the opportunity to delve deeper into her story, which I found brilliant and highly satisfying.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n   - The story started off a bit slow, but this allowed for a solid foundation to be built, exploring Hera’s history, her relationships with Zeus, her children, and her siblings. The gradual buildup of momentum kept me engaged and invested in her journey.  \n\n- **Character Development (Hera):**  \n   - My opinion of Hera changed significantly after reading this book. I felt a sense of sadness for her, especially as she navigated her complex relationships and struggles. I warmed up to her as she spent more time with humans and protected those who worshipped her. Hera is portrayed as strong, smart, and strategic, which made her a compelling protagonist.  \n\n- **Exploration of Relationships:**  \n   - Hera’s relationship with Zeus was far from ideal. Despite helping him overthrow their father, Cronus, she soon realized Zeus was power-hungry and possibly worse than Cronus. Hera believed she and her siblings would rule Mount Olympus together, but Zeus relegated her to the role of his wife, stripping her of agency. Her determination to destroy Zeus added depth to her character.  \n   - Hera’s relationship with her children was also intriguing. Initially, she saw them as tools to overthrow Zeus, but this plan didn’t unfold as she expected. Her dynamic with Hephaestus stood out, as he was the only child who genuinely cared for her, despite her initial disregard for him.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The book explores themes of power, betrayal, and resilience. Hera’s journey evoked a mix of emotions, from admiration for her strength to sympathy for her struggles. The exploration of her internal conflicts and her evolving relationships added emotional depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterful retelling of Hera’s story, offering a fresh and nuanced perspective on a character often relegated to the background in Greek mythology. The pacing, character development, and exploration of relationships make it a highly engaging and emotionally resonant read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Highly recommended for fans of Greek mythology and retellings."

I appreciated the prominent role of Hestia, a character often overlooked in Greek mythology, and loved the inclusion of Iris, the goddess of rainbows and the first messenger. It was fascinating to see how Hera's traumatic experiences with Zeus shaped her decisions, humanizing her character and highlighting the often-ignored sexist undertones in Greek myths.",

This raises the question: why are the sisters overlooked? I found the author's exploration of Hera's children particularly compelling. Ares, born from Hera's rage and revenge, embodies the chaos of war and bloodshed. In contrast, Hephaestus reflects Hera's insecurities about Zeus and their marriage, portraying him as weaker and eager to please. Overall, the book is a profound journey of healing, growth, and reclaiming one's power.",
            "This may be my favorite book by the author. I knew within the first few pages that it would earn a 5-star rating. I was curious about which aspect of Hera's story she would focus on, and I was pleasantly surprised to see her start from the very beginning."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Initial Impression:**  \n  - This might be my favorite Jennifer Saint book. I knew within the first few pages I’d be giving it 5 stars.  \n  - I wasn’t sure what story of Hera she’d center this book around, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that she started right from the beginning.  \n\n- **Characterization and Depth:**  \n  - She wove in so many well-known stories and provided insight into Hera’s thoughts and reasonings for her actions.  \n  - I loved that Hestia was such a vital character because we rarely ever hear about her in stories about Greek myth.  \n  - LOVE that Iris was heavily featured as well, the goddess of rainbows and the first messenger god.  \n  - It was so interesting to see how Hera used her experience of being raped by Zeus and the injustices imparted on her by him motivated her to make the decisions she did.  \n  - This book humanized her and pointed out so many sexist undertones we ignore in Greek myth.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  - For instance, Hera, Hestia, Demeter, Poseidon, Hades, and Zeus are all siblings, yet only the three brothers are considered rulers of domains. Why not the sisters?  \n  - I was also so interested in how the author explains why Hera’s children are the way they are. Ares is the product of rape and was conceived when Hera was in a state of rage and revenge, hence him being the god of war and bloodshed.  \n  - Hephaestus encompasses Hera’s anxieties regarding Zeus and her marriage, hence why he is seen as weaker and wanting to please everyone.  \n  - The whole book is a journey of healing, growth, and taking back your power.  \n\n- **Narrative Connections and Easter Eggs:**  \n  - I love how the author also mentioned characters from her previous books in this one as well and gave little nods to those stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a deeply engaging and thought-provoking exploration of Hera’s story, offering fresh perspectives on Greek mythology while addressing themes of power, injustice, and healing. Jennifer Saint masterfully weaves together well-known myths with insightful characterizations, making this a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

It’s not about redeeming her but understanding her motives and the harsh realities of her existence.  \n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  - The narrative is a potent commentary on the patriarchy and the often-unseen struggles of women, even in mythology. It explores themes of power struggles, godly conflicts, and feminist retellings, making Hera’s story resonate deeply.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - Jennifer’s writing is evocative and lyrical, capturing the turmoil and emotional depth of Hera’s journey. While some scene transitions felt a bit disjointed, the overall effect was still compelling.  \n\n- **Accessibility for Non-Mythology Fans:**  \n  - As someone who’s not a mythology buff, I found this retelling to be accessible and engaging. Jennifer’s portrayal made me rethink and empathize with Hera’s complex narrative.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  - The book includes heavy themes such as rape, sexism/misogyny, and incest, which are important to note for potential readers.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  - The ending was a whirlwind of emotions—devastating yet hopeful, perfectly encapsulating the highs and lows of divine existence.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite not being a fan of mythology, I appreciated the depth and nuance Jennifer Saint brought to Hera’s story.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n   - Hera is portrayed as a complex and compelling character. She is not likable, filled with self-importance, rage, and simmering emotions that manifest in cruel ways.  \n   - Despite her flaws, the reader is drawn into her desperate plight, understanding her perspective and the justification for her actions.  \n   - Hera is depicted as more than just a scorned or vengeful queen; she is a warrior and a fighter, showcasing her tenacity to survive.  \n\n- **Portrayal of the Gods and Their Dynamics:**  \n   - The Gods are not portrayed as \"nice\" characters; they take what they want without regard for others.  \n   - The power struggles and family dynamics among the Gods, particularly between Zeus, Hera, and others, are a highlight of the story.  \n   - The relationships between the Gods, especially Hera and her sister Hestia, are well-developed and compelling.  \n\n- **Narrative and Pacing:**  \n   - The pacing of the story works well for the most part, but the final third of the book feels rushed after a long buildup.  \n   - The ending could have been more satisfying if it explored Hera striking out on her own and her new role in a world free from the influence of the Gods.  \n\n- **Engagement with Greek Mythology:**  \n   - The retelling effectively recenters the narrative to show Hera's side of the story, highlighting her losses and struggles.  \n   - The drama and power struggles among the Gods, a key appeal of Greek mythology, are captured well by Jennifer Saint.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Hera* is an engaging retelling that delves into the complexities of its titular character and the intricate dynamics of the Gods. While the pacing falters slightly towards the end, the novel succeeds in presenting a fresh perspective on Greek mythology, with compelling relationships and a nuanced portrayal of Hera.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "After Zeus ascends to power with the help of Hera and the other Olympians, Hera grows increasingly concerned that he may become a tyrant like their father and grandfather. Determined to prevent this, she takes matters into her own hands. While I can empathize with some of her choices—especially given that her power was stripped away and she was left with a mere placeholder title—I believe her actions, particularly her resorting to murder, are unjustifiable. Hera's feelings of being belittled by Zeus do not excuse her drastic measures.",
            "This novel reimagines Hera, often cast as a jealous wife, wicked stepmother, or victim of patriarchy, as a powerful queen who balances ruthlessness with compassion, strategy, and ambition. While I appreciate the deeper insight into her character—something I knew little about—I find myself conflicted about Hera. Despite the feminist angle of this retelling, she often comes across as petulant and childish, which can be frustrating. As the story progresses, I found her increasingly insufferable, yet this did not deter me from wanting to read the book in its entirety. Ultimately, the narrative offers a more nuanced understanding of Hera as both a person and a character.",
            "I was pleasantly surprised by how much I learned about Greek myths while reading Katee Robert's Dark Olympus novels. I appreciated the opportunity to explore the original myths rather than a modern reinterpretation."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this novel offers a fresh and classical retelling of the Greek myth of Hera, portraying her as a complex and powerful figure. While I found her character to be somewhat petulant and childish at times, the book provided valuable insights into her motivations and actions. The descriptive elements, particularly those related to nature, were a highlight for me. Despite some personal reservations about Hera’s character, I found the book to be an enjoyable and educational read, especially for those interested in classical mythology.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Access and Initial Experience:**\n   - I checked this book out through my local public library via Libby since they had it available for rental.\n   - I got bored with this one when I first tried it and didn’t get very far before I put it down. I’m a mood reader so I sometimes just am not in the mood for certain genres. This seems to be the case with Greek myth just like anything else.\n   - I decided to give this one a second try after completing my yearly reading goal for 2024 and I’m glad I did. I wasn’t bored this time so I suppose I’m in as close of a Greek myth retelling as I’ll ever be.\n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**\n   - Even though she is typically seen as a jealous wife, wicked stepmother, or a victim-blaming instrument of the patriarchy, this novel portrays Hera as a powerful queen who uses ruthlessness as needed but is also compassionate, strategic, and ambitious.\n   - I’m not sure how I feel about Hera, though I’m glad for the insight into how she thinks since I knew next to nothing about her.\n   - The one draw-back I have on this retelling is that even though this is more of a feminist retelling, in my opinion, I still find Hera to be quite petulant and childish. I suppose that’s more of a nod to people’s public perception of her but I still find it a bit annoying.\n   - I found Hera to be insufferable as we dive further into the book but that didn’t stop me from wanting to read this book in its entirety. I will say that this book does give me more insight into Hera as a “person” and as a character.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - After Zeus takes over as ruler with the assistance of Hera and the other Olympians, Hera begins to suspect that Zeus is going to turn into a tyrant like their father and grandfather before him. She now tasks herself with a way to prevent this from happening.\n   - That’s not to say I don’t understand some of the choices she made or why she made them. Her power was taken from her and she was given a placeholder title just to placate her. I understand that she felt like Zeus was making a fool of her title but that’s no real excuse for murder.\n\n- **Descriptive Elements:**\n   - I’m happy with the amount of description used for the nature in this novel since I’ve always been a huge lover of nature. I love spending time outdoors whenever I can, which is sometimes difficult since I work night shifts for my employer.\n\n- **Educational Value:**\n   - I didn’t realize that I would be learning as much about the Greek myths as I have through reading Jennifer’s books and I’m glad for it, especially when diving into the Dark Olympus novels by Katee Robert. I have enjoyed reading the actual myths rather than a modern take on it.\n\n- **Recommendation:**\n   - Seeing this original take on Hera has been an enjoyable read, now that I’m in the mood for it. I would definitely recommend this book if you’re looking for a more classical retelling of the myth without the modern-day touches that a lot of retellings have. I promise it’s worth your time!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this novel offers a fresh and classical retelling of the Greek myth of Hera, portraying her as a complex and powerful figure. While I found her character to be somewhat petulant and childish at times, the book provided valuable insights into her motivations and actions. The descriptive elements, particularly those related to nature, were a highlight for me.

            "The book's flow feels somewhat disjointed, as Greek mythology comprises numerous stories with significant time gaps between them. At times, it seems to merely go through the motions of including each tale featuring Hera. However, this structure ultimately provides valuable insight into how Hera may have experienced and reacted to these famous events.",
            "This feminist retelling centers on Hera, the Goddess of Marriage and Wives, and the Queen of the Gods. My prior knowledge of Hera, shaped by Greek plays and Stephen Fry's non-fiction, left me with a negative impression of her as a jealous wife obsessed with power and control over Zeus. However, this novel presents Hera as a complex character—both a goddess and a woman with genuine feelings and emotions. We witness her love, hate, flaws, and strengths, ultimately revealing her humanity. I found this portrayal refreshing and deeply enjoyable.",

She has always been portrayed as nothing but a jealous wife obsessed with power and having Zeus under her control.  \n  - In this novel, Hera is a goddess, yes, but a woman all the same, with feelings and emotions.  \n  - We see her love, her hate, her flaws, her strengths. We see a woman, and I really enjoyed it.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Flow:**  \n  - I wouldn't say the book flows naturally. Greek Mythology is made of many different stories with many time lapses between them, so at times, I felt as though the book was slightly disjointed and could be seen as going through the motions to include each tale Hera was prevalent in.  \n  - However, there is no other way it could have been done, and actually, what it gives us is a view of how Hera may have dealt with and felt about each of the famous events.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Appreciation:**  \n  - I devoured this!  \n  - I really enjoyed it.

Her bitterness stems from being denied her share of the spoils after the Olympians' victory over the Titans.

However, her cruelty is rooted in trauma, which contextualizes her hatred and makes it both understandable and relatable.",

            "In the end, I felt that Hera's quest for revenge against Zeus lacked impact. I wished she had a stronger influence over him in this retelling. Each time she attempted to confront him, she was repeatedly overpowered, which elicited sympathy for her character.

Her desire for freedom and her resentment of Zeus's actions make her both sympathetic and detestable at times.  \n\n- **Hera's Relationship with Zeus:**  \n  Zeus steals the power and position Hera believes is rightfully hers, assaults her, and manipulates her into marriage. Hera resents the throne he forces her into, especially as the goddess of marriage whose husband openly cheats on her. She becomes determined to bring Zeus down, using her children as weapons against him and targeting his victims and illegitimate children. However, her lack of self-awareness is evident when she fails to recognize her own cruelty and blames others instead of Zeus.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The novel explores themes of power, betrayal, and revenge. Hera's actions reflect her deep-seated pain and desire for retribution, but they also highlight her moral complexity.

Her fierce competitiveness with Zeus was a central theme, and her lack of integrity was evident in her actions.  \n\n- **Themes (Patriarchy vs. Matriarchy, Power Dynamics):**  \n  The novel explores the clash between patriarchy and matriarchy, with Hera's long-term strategy to rise above Zeus serving as a driving force. The power struggles and scheming among the Olympians were gripping, though their hedonistic, egotistical, and power-hungry nature made it hard to sympathize with any of them.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was heavily focused on Hera's plotting and her rise to power.

While the feminist retelling of myths is not groundbreaking, the emotional depth and exploration of human-like perseverance in the face of tragedy make it a captivating read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This retelling transforms her from a mere jealous wife into a determined woman who will stop at nothing to end the cycle of unnecessary cruelty inflicted upon her people.",

Her work is always soaked in history, and you can tell she loves what she writes, which makes me enjoy it all the more.  \n\n- **Character Development and Feminist Perspective:**  \n  Hera reclaims the story of Zeus’ long-suffering wife as a feminist hero’s tale. Hera is often portrayed as Zeus’ equally cruel and violent partner, but Saint pulls apart what we know about the goddess and poses the question: what other choices does she have? Saint transforms her character from a jealous wife we’ve all heard harrowing stories about to a woman who will stop at nothing to end the cycle of unnecessary cruelty of her people.  \n\n- **Exploration of Power Dynamics:**  \n  The power imbalance between the rulers of Olympus is a very interesting dynamic that this book explores.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Immersion:**  \n  *Hera* is a beautifully written book (not that I suspected anything less!). However, having read the author’s other work, I do find that all of her books read very similarly. Even when something exciting is happening, I often feel like I’m being told and not shown—events feel more reported to the reader instead of being immersive.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Expectations:**  \n  I love Greek mythology retellings, and I can always rely on this author to live up to my expectations. I definitely wasn’t expecting to be a Hera-apologist, but here we are.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJennifer Saint’s *Hera* is a beautifully written, feminist retelling of Greek mythology that reimagines Hera as a complex and determined heroine.

Hera's journey involves questioning her role, her relationships, and her children as she strives to overthrow Zeus and establish a more just world.",
            "Hera is a strong, complex, and resilient character whose internal struggles and growth are central to the narrative. In contrast, Zeus represents the dominant and oppressive patriarchal structures of Olympus.",

A pivotal scene depicts Zeus forcefully asserting his authority over Hera, a moment that, while true to the mythos, is deeply unsettling and underscores her mistreatment. The birth of her half-snake, half-human child serves as a powerful symbol of her pain and anger, manifesting the silent suffering she endures as a result of her oppression.",

            "Hera is portrayed as an imperfect and occasionally unlikable character, often exhibiting aggressive behavior. However, the story offers a nuanced perspective that allows readers to empathize with her motives. Her loyalty to Zeus feels coerced, especially as he engages in numerous affairs, prompting her to seek revenge on his lovers. This retaliation serves as a means of striking back at Zeus himself. Rather than merely depicting Hera as a vindictive and jealous wife, the narrative redefines her character, revealing her as a complex figure whose actions arise from a loss of influence and autonomy.",

I think I had more interest in the main character coming into it, likely because I have a soft spot for canonically vilified women getting a chance to tell their own story.  \n\n- **Characterization and Dimensionality:**  \n  The book gives the protagonist dimensionality that I feel she’s not afforded elsewhere. While it doesn’t justify all her actions (which I think is a good thing), it provides a more nuanced portrayal of her character.  \n\n- **Pacing and Detail:**  \n  The story relies a little too much on the idea that “mortal lifespans are over in the blink of an eye” as an excuse to skim over details. This is particularly noticeable in the last third of the book, where the focus shifts more firmly toward the gods’ interference with the mortal realm.  \n\n- **Clarity of Powers and Abilities:**  \n  I never got a good sense of what the protagonist’s power distilled down to, other than a nebulous idea of power itself.  \n\n- **Ending and Themes:**  \n  The ending felt a little heavy-handed. While it leaned into the fact that she’s a very flawed character, I think it could have been more subtle. Additionally, the book affirmed my preexisting belief that men are basically garbage.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this book engaging and appreciated the nuanced portrayal of a canonically vilified character.

            "This book explores Hera's journey, from her involvement in the Titan War to her tumultuous relationship with Zeus and her quest for revenge. The creation of Typhon and the monsters—Chimera, Hydra, and Cerberus—as part of Hera's retribution was captivating, although Echidna's role in raising them felt somewhat excessive. The climactic battle between Typhon and Zeus, along with Hera's punishment of being suspended above Chaos, heightened the tension and drama. The surprising and satisfying ending, where the gods fade away and Zeus turns to stone, allows Hera to finally gain the freedom to roam among mortals.",
            "I’ve never been a fan of Hera in Greek mythology, often viewing her as hateful and selfish. However, this book changed my perspective by portraying her as a complex character—daughter of Chronos, Queen of the Gods, and Goddess of Marriage. Her struggles and motivations came to life, particularly her anger at being sidelined by Zeus and her sisters, who received titles but wielded no real power. The forced marriage to Zeus after his betrayal, coupled with her feelings of embarrassment and self-consciousness, added significant depth to her character. Her desire for revenge against Zeus, especially following his infidelity, made her more relatable and human.",

It prompted me to reassess my views on Zeus, revealing him as even more manipulative and cruel than I had imagined. Hera's emotional journey—from anger and hatred to a sense of freedom—left me with a bittersweet mix of sadness and hope."

Told from her perspective, it challenges the traditional portrayal of Hera as a jealous wife and victim of patriarchy. Instead, she emerges as a powerful queen—ruthless when necessary, yet also compassionate, strategic, and ambitious. This retelling offers a fresh and nuanced view of a complex character.",

Zeus, in particular, is depicted as a figure who disregards consent, repeatedly forcing himself on women, often leading to their further suffering. I empathized with Hera, yet I found myself conflicted by her choices in seeking revenge against innocents. Will her pursuit of power lead to her own downfall, or can she carve out a better world for herself?",

The constant drama, retribution, and shady behaviors of the characters create a compelling narrative that keeps me engaged."

They are really interesting retellings.\"  \n   - \"Although 'enjoy' seems the wrong word at times for some of the shocking stuff they get up to!\"  \n   - \"Constant drama, retribution, skulduggery, and overall shady behaviors by most, if not all of them, but it does make for interesting reading.\"  \n\n- **Characterization and Perspective:**  \n   - \"This book is about Hera and how she is left with no choice but to accept Zeus and his marriage proposal.\"  \n   - \"Hera is the main character, and this is from her viewpoint and interactions with the others.\"  \n   - \"Traditionally portrayed as a jealous wife, a wicked stepmother, and a victim-blaming instrument of the patriarchy, Hera is ripe for a retelling that shows her as a powerful queen—ruthless when she needs to be, but also compassionate, strategic, and ambitious.\"  \n\n- **Moral Complexity and Themes:**  \n   - \"The Gods are not very nice people. Zeus comes off terribly in this; he doesn't know the word 'no' or 'consent.' He forces himself on females more than once, and often they then suffer again after his initial assault.\"  \n   - \"Hera, I really felt for, but at times, her choices with her revenge/vengeance against innocents—I struggled at times with her and her choices.\"  \n   - \"Will assuming her power mean that Hera loses herself, or can she find a way to forge a better world?\"  \n\n- **Writing Style and Adaptation:**  \n   - \"With Hera, beloved and bestselling author Jennifer Saint delivers another epic and enthralling reimagining of a Greek heroine we only thought we knew.\"  \n   - \"As I have little knowledge of the originals, I am not sure how much is different, but I do enjoy them.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis retelling of Hera's story offers a fresh and compelling perspective on a traditionally maligned goddess, portraying her as a complex and powerful figure. While the constant drama and morally questionable actions of the gods can be shocking, they make for an engaging and thought-provoking read. Jennifer Saint's writing brings depth and nuance to Greek mythology, making it accessible and intriguing even for those unfamiliar with the original tales.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

            "This retelling skillfully intertwines various myths, offering a cohesive and fresh perspective on Hera's role in Greek mythology. It is both introspective and thought-provoking, prompting readers to contemplate the deeper significance of Hera's actions and legacy.",
            "In this retelling, Hera transcends her traditional portrayal as Zeus's vengeful and jealous wife, revealing a more nuanced character. While her power rivals that of her siblings, it is often suppressed by Zeus's control and manipulation. Hera's narrative echoes the pain and suffering of many women, exploring themes of betrayal, abuse, and coercion. Despite her flaws, her resilience and cunning in seeking freedom render her a complex and compelling figure.",
            "The novel explores the oppression and imperfections faced by women through Hera's story, reflecting broader societal issues. It examines the cycles of abuse and reactive abuse, providing a stark yet realistic portrayal of these dynamics. Hera's characterization as a villain is re-evaluated, uncovering the deeper societal and personal struggles that drive her actions.",

            "This book offers a straightforward character analysis of Hera, exploring her insensitivity towards Zeus' victims and Hephaestus. However, it adds little to the familiar narratives. I appreciated Hera's complex and somewhat alien emotions regarding other gods, ambition, purpose, and mortals. Her evolving perspective on mortals—from viewing them as unworthy to harboring hatred, and ultimately reaching a place of understanding—was a standout aspect. Notably, her choice to forsake her virtuous Goddess status for a mortal was particularly compelling.",
            "The story features intriguing perspectives and thoughtfully crafted dialogues, particularly between Hera and Hephaestus.",
            "I've long wanted to explore the author's works, as I have a deep appreciation for Greek mythology, and her books appear to be among the finest in this genre. The stunning covers by Micaela Alcaino are an added bonus. This book is a great choice for those looking to learn about Greek mythology or seeking a refresher. However, for readers with a strong grasp of the subject who desire a more cohesive narrative than a character analysis, it may not fully meet their expectations."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While *Hera: Female Rage* offers a deep dive into Hera’s character and her complex emotions, it largely sticks to familiar mythological stories without adding much new material. The exploration of her relationship with mortals and the stellar narration by Naomi Frederick stand out, but the book may not satisfy readers seeking a more innovative or consistent retelling of Greek mythology.",

Her decision to abandon her virtuous Goddess status for one mortal was particularly noteworthy.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style**  \n   - There were a couple of interesting viewpoints and some well-considered dialogues, especially between Hera and Hephaestus.  \n\n- **Narration (Audio Version)**  \n   - Naomi Frederick’s narration was stellar, and she was an incredible choice for Hera.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Suitability**  \n   - For people who hope to learn more about Greek mythology or need a refresher, this would be a worthwhile read.  \n   - For those with solid knowledge of Greek mythology who want something more consistent than a character analysis, this might not be an ideal journey.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Hera: Female Rage* offers a deep dive into Hera’s character and her complex emotions, it largely sticks to familiar mythological stories without adding much new material.

While some readers may find her unlikeable, I saw her as a woman fiercely fighting for what is rightfully hers. Constantly overlooked and humiliated, her anger is both understandable and relatable. Although she sometimes misdirects her rage, her emotions resonate deeply. Hera's reactions to Zeus' infidelities are particularly compelling, showcasing her quiet yet explosive rage at his disrespect. Additionally, the exploration of the gods' perspectives on humans, their kingdoms, and their relationships adds significant depth to the narrative.",

This version of Hera might come across as unlikeable to some readers, but I found her to be a woman who is fighting for what is rightfully hers. She’s constantly overlooked and humiliated, which fuels her anger. While she sometimes directs her rage at the wrong people, her emotions felt justified to me.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n  Hera’s reactions to Zeus’ infidelities were fascinating and well-executed. Her quiet (and sometimes explosive) rage at his disrespect was both compelling and, at times, terrifying. The exploration of the gods’ perspectives on humans, their kingdoms, and their relationships added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  The central plot takes a while to get going, and the story is more character-driven than plot-driven. However, I was so engrossed in Hera’s journey that the slower pacing didn’t bother me.  \n\n- **Themes and Content Warnings:**  \n  The novel tackles heavy themes, including rape, kidnapping, death, murder, violence, sexual assault, and child death. These elements are integral to the story but may be triggering for some readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Greek mythology retelling offers a fresh and compelling perspective on Hera, delving into her struggles, emotions, and relationships.

While she attacked Zeus’ illegitimate kids, it wasn’t solely out of jealousy or possessiveness. She was a deity, the goddess of marriage, and Zeus, her brother and husband, humiliated her by casting her aside, disrespecting her, and undermining her title. The book portrayed her fury as stemming from humiliation, not jealousy, which I found compelling. It highlighted her motherly side, her desire to protect her children, and her rightful claim to respect and power. Hera’s POV in the book was well-constructed, and I appreciated every minute of it.\n\n- **Narrative Focus:**  \n  The book focused on Hera’s perspective, emphasizing her feelings of humiliation and her struggle to maintain her title and dignity. It delved into her motivations, showing her as more than just the “crazy wife” Zeus portrayed her to be. This focus on her inner world and her justified anger was a strong point of the story.\n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  The book attempted to create a detailed genealogy of Greek mythology deities, which was ambitious but overly long and, at times, impossible to follow.

They felt well-developed and compelling, adding depth to the story.\n\n- **Mythological Adaptation:**  \n  The book fleshed out Greek myths that I was already familiar with, offering a fresh and engaging perspective on these timeless stories.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I really liked this book! It was my first Jennifer Saint novel, but it certainly won’t be my last. The story left me excited to explore more of her work, and I’m eager to buy another of her books.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a captivating introduction to Jennifer Saint’s writing. Her vivid storytelling, strong female characters, and creative adaptation of Greek myths made for an enjoyable and memorable read. I’m looking forward to diving into more of her works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This one was no exception!  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Background:**  \n  I grew up watching the 1981 *Clash of the Titans* on VHS as many times as my parents would rent it from Curtis Mathes, which was what our town had before Blockbuster was a thing. That movie portrays Hera as very cruel and unforgiving. I also love the *Percy Jackson* series, so I had a pretty good knowledge of the stories from all the other perspectives.  \n\n- **Character Perspective and Empathy:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed hearing all of the stories related to Hera from her perspective, which helped me understand why she might have made some of the decisions she did. It definitely gave me empathy for Hera that I had never had before.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  Trigger warnings for rape/abuse, but that should be obvious if you have read any Greek mythology before.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Specific):**  \n  The narrator, Naomi Frederick, did a great job of giving an empathetic voice to Hera.  \n\n- **Author’s Future Work:**  \n  I can’t wait to see what other retellings Jennifer Saint comes up with in the future.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Special thanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for the advanced copy of the audiobook in exchange for my honest opinion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel provided a fresh and empathetic perspective on Hera, a character often portrayed as cruel in other adaptations.

While I empathize with Hera due to her repeated betrayals and mistreatment by Zeus, she remains a challenging character to like. Her actions often appear petty and spiteful, particularly when she targets Zeus’s children and their mothers, many of whom are also victims of his actions.",

The ending, though, is thought-provoking and satisfying, focusing on the evolving relationship between gods and mortals and the consequences of divine inflexibility.\n\n- **Themes and Originality:**  \n  The novel effectively highlights the appalling misogyny of the Olympian gods and offers a fresh perspective on Hera's story. It demonstrates that there is still room for innovation in feminist retellings of Greek mythology, despite the challenges of creating something new in this genre.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Overall Impression:**  \n  Despite some pacing issues, the book is a very enjoyable read. It provides a fresh take on Hera's story and leaves the reader with a satisfying and thought-provoking conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJennifer Saint's retelling of Hera's story is a compelling and original addition to the genre of feminist Greek mythology retellings. While the middle section feels slow, the strong beginning and thought-provoking ending make it a worthwhile and enjoyable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel opens with a captivating retelling of the War of the Titans and Hera's initial defiance against Zeus. However, the middle section falters, becoming a disjointed list of Hera's mythological accomplishments that lacks cohesion. Fortunately, the ending regains its strength, particularly in its exploration of Hera's adaptation to a world where the power of the Olympian gods is diminishing.",
            "Hera is portrayed as a complex character who initially resists Zeus's advances, seeking authority on her own terms rather than through marriage. The narrative explores her transformation from a determined leader to a vengeful goddess, emphasizing her frustration and rage towards Zeus and the patriarchal system. Hera's internal struggles—shame, fear, and her eventual adaptation to a changing world—are thoughtfully examined. Hestia's character is also well-developed, providing a compelling contrast to Hera's volatility. The world-building is robust, featuring vivid descriptions of the divine realm and the interactions between gods and mortals. Additionally, the novel offers insightful reflections on power, creation, and the roles of goddesses and Titanesses.",
            "This novel tackles themes of sexual violence, patriarchy, and the systemic oppression of women, echoing contemporary issues. Hera's narrative powerfully conveys the anger of women who have endured patriarchal systems, rendering these themes both timeless and relevant. The exploration of power dynamics—both divine and mortal—serves as a central focus, with Hera's journey mirroring the broader struggles for autonomy and respect."

            "The author reimagines Hera not as a traditional jealous wife, but as a formidable warrior who fought alongside Zeus to overthrow Cronus. Her anger and bitterness stemming from Zeus's betrayal and her forced marriage provide a fresh perspective on her motivations. Although the author strives to make Hera relatable, her contradictions and harsh treatment of Zeus's victims create a complex character who isn't entirely sympathetic. In contrast, Hestia, Demeter, and Athena are skillfully portrayed, each displaying unique qualities and strategies. Hestia, in particular, emerges as a deeply engaging and admirable figure. The interactions among Hera, her siblings, and Zeus's offspring add intriguing layers to the narrative, enhancing the overall story.",

The narrative reveals the gods as flawed and power-hungry, embodying ancient mindsets where men dominate and women are often treated as mere playthings. The exploration of Hera's roles as a mother, wife, sister, and queen highlights her possessiveness, jealousy, and quest for independence.",

Hera's character is complex; she is depicted as both misunderstood and fiercely jealous, often unleashing her wrath on Zeus's lovers.

Overall, the story is engaging and emotionally resonant, making it a compelling read.",

Zeus's abusive, controlling, and unfaithful nature elicits strong feelings of anger and frustration. Additionally, her strained relationships with her sisters and children deepen her character and amplify her sense of isolation.",

I found her misdirected anger and punishments towards women and children troubling. The author attempts to frame these actions as a way to keep Zeus in check and strengthen the divine family. Although Hera fought alongside Zeus against the Titans, he ultimately divided the realms among himself and his brothers, sidelining her. He designated her as the goddess of marriage and childbirth while continuing to humiliate her with other women and children. Hera is trapped in a painful dynamic with Zeus, with mortals suffering as unwilling participants.

This contradiction fuels her rage and violence.  \n   - The narrative explores how Hera's actions, though seemingly destructive, may have inadvertently strengthened the Olympian family.  \n   - Hera realizes that the Olympian family is fragmented, and she must find her own place in the world as it is.  \n\n- **Human and Divine Interaction:**  \n   - The gods created humans, but now Hera sees humans creating gods through their artworks, poems, plays, and philosophies.  \n   - Hera wonders where humans see her—hopefully in rebellious wives, powerful queens, and resilient girls who find the strength to keep going.  \n\n- **Transformation and Adaptation:**  \n   - Hera moves through the world now, not above or apart from it, and she changes along with it.  \n   - Everything will change, and it will always bring loss, but Hera adapts and evolves.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a profound and emotional exploration of Hera's character, reimagining her story with depth and complexity.

            "The story opens with a compelling depiction of the aftermath of the Titanomachy and the Olympians' initial agreement to rule together. However, the pacing falters around the three-quarters mark as Hera's exploits slow down, leading to an extended focus on her internal musings about the gods' waning power. The Trojan War is briefly mentioned, which feels like a missed opportunity for deeper exploration. While the book is a favorite among the author's works, celebrated for its fresh perspective on Hera's character, the final section—centered on her reflections and the decline of the gods—becomes tedious and detracts from the overall pacing.",
            "The author skillfully reimagines Hera, traditionally viewed as a loathed figure in mythology, into a more nuanced and relatable character. The narrative traces her evolution from a hopeful, defiant goddess to the bitter, vengeful figure familiar in myths. It clarifies her motivations, revealing that her actions are driven by embarrassment and a desire to provoke Zeus, rather than the jealousy often attributed to her.",
            "The book compellingly illustrates the gods' apathy, save for their pride and thirst for power. It underscores the systemic marginalization of goddesses, especially Hera, as Zeus consolidates his dominance. The bittersweet ending captures the pervasive lack of justice in Greek mythology, though I yearn for a more satisfying resolution.",
            "At first, I empathized with Hera and cheered for her to challenge Zeus. However, as her bitterness grew and her actions became increasingly misguided, my sympathy faded. The ending, though appropriate for Greek mythology, left me yearning for a more just resolution."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development (Hera):**  \n   - The author successfully transforms Hera from a character often loathed in mythology into someone more nuanced and understandable.  \n   - The story explores how Hera evolves from a hopeful, defiant goddess into the bitter, vengeful figure we know from myths.  \n   - Her motivations are clarified: her actions stem from embarrassment and a desire to annoy Zeus, not jealousy as commonly portrayed.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story begins strongly, detailing the aftermath of Titanomachy and the initial agreement among the Olympians to rule collectively.  \n   - The pacing falters around the 3/4 mark, where Hera’s exploits slow down, and the narrative lingers on her internal reflections about the fading power of the gods.  \n   - The Trojan War is glossed over too quickly, which feels like a missed opportunity for deeper exploration.  \n\n- **Themes and World-Building:**  \n   - The book effectively portrays the apathy of the gods, with exceptions for pride and power.  \n   - It highlights the systemic marginalization of the goddesses, particularly Hera, as Zeus consolidates power.  \n   - The bittersweet ending reflects the lack of justice often found in Greek mythology, though the reader expresses a desire for a more satisfying resolution.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - Initially, the reader sympathizes with Hera and roots for her to succeed in defying Zeus.  \n   - Over time, as Hera becomes more embittered and her methods more misguided, the sympathy wanes.  \n   - The ending, while fitting for Greek mythology, leaves the reader longing for a more just conclusion.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n   - The book is the reader’s favorite by the author, praised for its fresh take on Hera’s character.  \n   - The final section, focusing on Hera’s reflections and the decline of the gods, feels tedious and unnecessary, detracting from the overall pacing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel successfully reimagines Hera as a complex, sympathetic character, exploring her transformation from a hopeful goddess to a bitter figure. While the pacing stumbles in the latter part of the book and the ending feels unsatisfying, the story remains engaging and thought-provoking, offering a fresh perspective on Greek mythology.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review."

            "The pacing of the story kept me engaged, and I quickly finished the book, eager to witness Hera’s transformation. The ending was satisfying in its own way, with Hera returning to her essence—stripped of titles and domains yet powerful in her own right. However, I wished for clearer resolution regarding Gaia’s intentions for Hera and a more definitive conclusion to her role as Queen and sister. The ending was heavy and thought-provoking, showcasing Hera's strength in allowing Zeus to be his own downfall. While I appreciated the poetic nature of Hera concluding the story as she began—simply as Hera, without titles—I longed for a more triumphant resolution where she remained on the throne as a Queen, sister, and warrior.",
            "I was deeply engaged with Demeter, Hestia, Hera, and Artemis, especially in their quest for power and protection. Hera's journey to reclaim her crown and balance her roles as Queen of the Gods and a mother was particularly compelling. Hephaestus' vulnerability and resilience made him a relatable character. The goddesses' passions transcended mere enjoyment, highlighting their struggle for survival and adding depth to their portrayals.",
            "This book provides a refreshing take on Greek mythology, revealing aspects of the legends that are often overlooked. The concept that gods and goddesses discover their passions rather than being born into their roles is particularly intriguing. Additionally, the exploration of how a deity's power is linked to their emotional state and self-perception adds a compelling layer to the mythology.",
            "This book captivated me with its themes of autonomy and independence. The emotional journey of the goddesses, especially Hera, was both gut-wrenching and enthralling. It prompted me to reconsider Greek mythology, challenging my previous male-centric perspective. The portrayal of the goddesses' struggles and transformations was profoundly moving, particularly Asteria’s story, which emphasized the link between a god’s power and their emotional state."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book was a powerful exploration of autonomy, independence, and the emotional struggles of the goddesses in Greek mythology. It offered a fresh perspective on familiar legends, making me question my previous understanding of these stories. While the ending was fitting in its own way, I wished for a clearer resolution to Hera’s journey. Overall, it was a captivating and thought-provoking read.",

            "I wanted to like Hera, and initially, I did. As she faced numerous tragedies—many self-inflicted—I hoped to see her grow as a character. However, her ambition and cruelty ultimately felt less compelling than I had anticipated. I was pleased to witness a transformed Hera, one with a healed spirit, who finally found acceptance through the irony of her losses.",
            "The author is a talented writer, and I would gladly explore more of their vivid descriptions and beautiful imagery in future works.",
            "I won't reiterate the numerous trigger warnings that other reviews have mentioned. I nearly stopped reading after the first 82 pages due to the graphic scenes of sexual assault. While I understand the author's intent in detailing these moments, I would have preferred their omission. The book often frustrated me, particularly because of the deities' cruel injustices toward humans and lesser gods, which is, perhaps, to be expected in a story about Greek mythology. I appreciated the portrayals of Hera and the other gods. Although some readers may not enjoy the cameo appearances and extensive backstory, I found them delightful, much like the Easter eggs in video games and references in films.",
            "This story evoked sympathy for Hera, a character whose pain often inflicts suffering on others. A particularly poignant moment that nearly brought me to tears was her reunion with someone she had claimed to never love, only to realize, over time, that she truly does."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n  The book explores themes of women’s oppression under patriarchal rule, with Zeus depicted as a dictator. It also delves into the emergence of the mortal race and the dynamics of power among the Olympian gods and goddesses. The story is a battle against patriarchy and dictatorship, told through the lens of Greek mythology.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Hera is a multi-faceted character, embodying both inspiration and flaws. She is passionate, stoic, and fiery in her revolts against patriarchy, advocating for the equality of goddesses with gods. However, she is also portrayed as jealous, egoistical, vengeful, and heartless, often disregarding those she deems unimportant.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is fast-paced, with events unfolding in quick succession, creating a constant sense of drama. This pacing reflects the concept of mortal time being a mere blink of an eye for the gods. Despite the rapid progression, the story remains cohesive and engaging.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mythology Integration:**  \n  The book is a lavish masterpiece, interweaving countless Greek mythological stories into the plot. The retelling of these myths from Hera’s perspective adds depth and a fresh take on familiar tales. The language effectively sets scenes and atmospheres, immersing the reader in the world of the Olympians.  \n\n- **Educational and Inspirational Value:**  \n  As someone with limited prior knowledge of Greek mythology, I found the book both enthralling and educational. It provided a comprehensive introduction to many gods, goddesses, and mythological stories, sparking my interest in exploring more of this genre.  \n\n- **Constructive Feedback:**  \n  While the book is well-researched and richly detailed, the sheer volume of characters—gods, goddesses, demi-gods, and nymphs—can be overwhelming. An index of characters or a family tree would have been helpful for readers less familiar with Greek mythology.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating blend of Greek mythology and a powerful narrative about resistance against patriarchy. Jennifer Saint’s storytelling is immersive, with well-developed characters, a fast-paced plot, and rich mythological detail. Despite the complexity of the mythological world, the book is accessible and inspiring, leaving me eager to explore more in this genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel sometimes reads like a travelogue, recounting events with minimal character development. The ending, featuring the gods' withdrawal from the mortal realm, feels tonally inconsistent and fails to provide a satisfying resolution for Hera's arc.",
            "The author reimagines Hera, a goddess frequently vilified in myths, as a complex figure grappling with shame and betrayal after Zeus's assault. While she elicits sympathy, Hera is not entirely likable; her attempts to reclaim her pride by targeting Zeus's lovers ultimately fall short. Her character arc feels somewhat unfulfilled, as her growth beyond bitterness seems more a product of resignation than genuine self-discovery.",
            "The novel delves into themes of abuse, pride, and vengeance, centering on Hera's struggle against Zeus. Although her eventual escape is triumphant, it contrasts sharply with the pain she has caused others, leaving her redemption arc feeling unresolved."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The author's *Hera* offers a compelling and sympathetic portrayal of the goddess, though it falls short of the heights achieved in *Elektra*. While the novel excels in its adaptation of Greek mythology and audiobook performance, its narrative pacing and resolution of Hera's character arc leave room for improvement. Despite these flaws, it remains an engaging and thought-provoking retelling.",

            "This book weaves together classic tales such as Jason and the Golden Fleece, Hercules, and the Iliad, with a central focus on Hera's role in linking these narratives. Rather than providing detailed retellings, it offers an outline of the myths while emphasizing Hera’s character development. Through a feminist and nontraditional lens, the book presents Greek myths from Hera’s perspective, highlighting her struggles within a patriarchal framework where she is often marginalized. The narrative spans the entirety of Greek mythology, from the rise of the Olympians to the decline of their worship, all seen through Hera’s eyes.",
            "Hera is portrayed as a multifaceted character, breaking away from the typical image of a vengeful wife found in myths. The book explores her struggles with Zeus's double standards, her anger at being sidelined, and her attempts to reclaim her power. It also candidly addresses her flaws, including her rejection of her son Hephaestus and her mistreatment of other women in retaliation against Zeus.",
            "The author is commended for their skill in reinterpreting Greek myths from new angles, as demonstrated in their earlier work, *Ariadne*. While the book is intentionally niche, making it an excellent fit for certain readers, it may not resonate with a broader audience.",
            "To fully appreciate this book, a basic understanding of Greek mythology is essential. Readers with only a casual familiarity may find it confusing, as the narrative assumes some prior knowledge of the myths. While there is enough detail to help those who may have forgotten certain stories, newcomers to Greek mythology might struggle to keep pace."

            "This novel offers a refreshing perspective by centering on Hera, a character often overlooked in Greek mythology retellings. The portrayal of Hera is complex, depicting her as more than just a jealous wife or wicked stepmother; she emerges as a figure striving to create a better world. However, I struggled to sympathize with her, as her narrative of subjugation by a man felt derivative and unengaging.",

            "While the story is well-written, I found it dull and struggled to stay engaged. This may be due to my recent reading of *Mythos* by Stephen Fry, which covers many of the same characters and events, making this retelling feel repetitive. The absence of action or compelling events made it difficult to root for any character. In contrast to the author’s previous novel, *Atalanta*, which featured dynamic storytelling and followed the Argonauts, this work felt like events unfolded around Hera without much agency or excitement.",

            "I wished for greater emphasis on Hera’s successes, particularly her support for Jason in his quest for the Golden Fleece. Her achievements seemed overlooked, and I longed for more focus on her joy during those moments. The inevitable decline of the Olympians’ world added a poignant touch to the narrative.",
            "Reading Hera’s story from her perspective was profoundly moving. Often depicted as malevolent, angry, or jealous, this book reveals how she was wronged by her husband, Zeus. It’s ironic that while Zeus makes her his wife, he engages in affairs with mortal women, goddesses, and titanesses, leaving Hera bound to a marriage from which she cannot escape. The narrative underscores the struggles of women, even goddesses, who face violence and injustice. The portrayal of the bond between Hera and her sister Hestia is particularly touching, highlighting their support and deep connection. Additionally, the evolving relationship between Hera and Athena adds significant depth to the story.",
            "This story powerfully highlights women's experiences, illustrating that even divine figures are not immune to oppression. It critiques the historical tendency of male authors to depict gods committing violence against women, often to rationalize similar behaviors in the mortal realm. The narrative underscores the necessity of amplifying women's voices, a need that modern retellings are beginning to address.",
            "This story evokes a deep sense of sadness for Hera, who experiences far fewer victories than Zeus. It is gratifying to witness her find peace through her children's happiness, rather than resorting to revenge—a common trope. The exploration of feminine rage is compelling, and it’s refreshing to see Hera’s character examined, if not entirely justified."

While I wished for more focus on her triumphs, the narrative effectively humanizes her and provides a fresh perspective on a traditionally vilified character. The themes of feminine rage, resilience, and the importance of women’s voices make this a compelling read.",

The themes of feminine rage, resilience, and the importance of women’s voices make this a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot traces Hera's transformation from a hopeful co-ruler to a woman ensnared by Zeus's ambition and lust for power. The ending is remarkable and refreshingly unique, diverging from typical mythological retellings. While the author takes some liberties with the original myths, these alterations effectively highlight the theme of a truth rewritten by men, lending them a sense of justification.",
            "Hera emerges as a fierce and independent warrior goddess, transcending the role of Zeus's vengeful wife. She stands as his equal and co-conspirator in the overthrow of Cronos, united in their dreams of freedom and equality. Her bitterness and anger are portrayed as reactions to Zeus's oppressive and narcissistic behavior, rather than simple jealousy over his infidelities. The author skillfully avoids making Hera entirely likable or excusing her actions, which adds depth and complexity to her character.",
            "This story delves into themes of patriarchy, sexism, and the systemic oppression of women. Hera's rage is aimed at a system that compels women to take extreme actions for self-protection while simultaneously vilifying them for resisting injustice. The narrative reexamines Hera's traditional portrayal as a villain, proposing that her story has been reshaped by men to fit their agenda."

        "conclusion": "This retelling of Hera’s story is a brilliant and refreshing take on a well-known mythological figure. The author masterfully reimagines Hera as a complex and powerful character, exploring themes of patriarchy and oppression while staying true to her mythological roots. The narrative is engaging, the ending is unexpected, and the liberties taken with the myths feel justified. This may be the reader’s new favorite book by the author.",

            "The portrayal of Hera is both intimate and immersive, offering a nuanced character study of a figure often seen as a jealous wife. By delving into Hera's thoughts and feelings, the narrative provides a fresh perspective on her motives and actions. Her quiet resistance against male dominance adds depth to her character. While many side characters lack depth, this choice feels intentional and aligns with the historical depiction of Olympian gods, particularly the men, who are often cold and self-serving. In contrast, the female characters, especially Athena and Hestia, shine brightly. Hestia infuses warmth into the story, while Athena emerges as a formidable presence. Two key scenes featuring these women are particularly memorable, showcasing the author’s skill in narrating women’s stories within Greek mythology."

            "The first two parts, and to some extent the third, were the highlights of the story for me. They effectively depicted Hera’s villain origin story, portraying her first as a victim and then as the vengeful, jealous wife we all recognize. This transition was beautifully executed. However, the narrative began to lose its momentum in the fourth and fifth parts, where Hera’s lack of control over her god-subjects became increasingly apparent. The ending felt predictable and lacked the impact I had hoped for. I was expecting a powerful conversation between Hera and Zeus in the final part to resolve their issues, but that never materialized. Additionally, the book downplays Zeus's fear of angering Hera, which I found disappointing. While the story started strong, it ultimately fell short of delivering the powerful conclusion I anticipated.",
            "I loved how Hera is introduced as a fierce warrior, determined to showcase her strength and achievements. I appreciated the interpretation of her marrying the enemy to undermine him from within, and I enjoyed witnessing her repeated failures, which align with the myths. However, I felt her portrayal of strength was somewhat lacking. While the scene where she is chained by Zeus explains her reluctance to rebel against him, there was no clear reason for her not to fully confront him earlier. In the myths, Hera is often depicted as dangerous and easily provoked, making other gods wary of her. In this book, I found it unconvincing that the gods mock her from the outset."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Content Warnings and Themes:**  \n   - The book includes heavy themes such as rape, sexism/misogyny, and incest, which are important to note for potential readers.  \n   - The portrayal of Zeus and his actions is particularly frustrating for me, as it aligns with the problematic aspects of Greek mythology.  \n\n- **Focus on Female Characters:**  \n   - I appreciate how the author, Jennifer Saint, highlights the powerful and often overlooked female figures in Greek mythology.  \n   - The book provides a deeper exploration of Hera’s story, offering empathy for her struggles and shedding light on her life before her \"villain arc.\"  \n   - I hope the author continues to write about these heroines, as their stories are compelling and deserve more attention.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - The narrator was a good fit overall, and I could imagine her voice as Hera’s.  \n   - However, I found the pronunciation of some names, like Athena and Demeter, a bit off-putting. I’m unsure if this was intentional or a personal choice by the narrator.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - The storyline was captivating, and I was fully immersed in Hera’s world from the very beginning.  \n   - Despite the book being 13 hours long, it felt much shorter—like 5 hours—because I was so engrossed and enjoyed it thoroughly.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n   - I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves Greek mythology and wants to explore the stories of powerful female figures.  \n   - When the book is published, I encourage readers to grab it immediately—whether they choose to sprint or fly to get it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it to be a refreshing take on Greek mythology, particularly in its focus on strong female characters like Hera. The engaging storyline and immersive experience made it a standout read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review, but the tone is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a high rating.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to Netgalley for providing me with the opportunity to read this book. #Hera #Netgalley #JenniferSaint #GreekMythology"

            "The book races through numerous events over an extensive timeline, resulting in a rushed feel. By prioritizing events over character development, the story comes across as shallow. A deeper exploration of the events and their emotional effects on Hera would have enriched the narrative. While I loved the ending, its emotional impact could have been heightened if these issues were addressed.",
            "I would have appreciated more time spent on Hera's character development at the beginning of the book, prior to Zeus's betrayal. Without a deeper understanding of who she is, it was challenging to connect with her. Hera's anger and rage towards Zeus's actions lacked sufficient exploration, which diminished the impact of her subsequent choices. The narrative should have more effectively built up her emotions to create a more compelling character. Additionally, the other characters felt one-dimensional, as the focus was primarily on events rather than their personal experiences and growth.",

            "Unlike the author's previous novels, *HERA* shifts its focus from mortals caught in the machinations of gods and men to the gods themselves. The narrative intricately weaves together multiple myths, creating a rich tapestry of power struggles and transformation. Rather than centering on a single myth, it presents a broader exploration of ambition and change. The ending is particularly noteworthy, diverging from the typical triumphant conclusions of Greek mythology retellings. Instead, it delivers a hollow victory that challenges Hera's worldview and highlights the fragility of power.

Despite her many flaws, Hera remains a compelling character; her motivations are relatable, even if her actions are not."

While this doesn't necessarily make her more likable, it provides a deeper understanding of her motivations. The portrayal of Hera as both divine and almost human, especially when mortals begin turning away from the gods, adds complexity to her character. I found myself able to laugh, cry, and even scream at her actions, particularly when she punished women who were victims rather than willing partners of Zeus.\n\n- **Sympathy for the Monsters:**  \n  My sympathies gravitated towards the monsters, particularly Typhon's children, who were portrayed as trying to survive in the shadows, avoiding the attention and wrath of the gods. This contrasted sharply with the self-important and manipulative behavior of the Olympian gods, who often played with mortals for their own amusement.\n\n- **Engagement with Mythological Events:**  \n  I enjoyed how the novel explored major mythological events, such as the search for the Golden Fleece and the Trojan War, from the perspective of the gods. Seeing these events through their eyes added a fresh and intriguing layer to the familiar stories.\n\n- **Impact of Mortals Turning Away from the Gods:**  \n  One of my favorite aspects of the story was how the gods, particularly Hera, were affected when mortals began to turn away from them. This shift made Hera feel more relatable and human, adding depth to her character.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  This is another excellent re-telling by Jennifer Saint, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Her struggles resonate with many women, making her relatable. Additionally, Hera's own hurtful actions toward others highlight the cycle of pain, illustrating how patriarchy can drive women to harm one another rather than confront the men who cause their suffering.",
            "This is my first experience with a Greek retelling, and I was captivated by the premise: even among the gods, women grapple with patriarchy.

She desires respect but questions the foundations of that respect.  \n   - She grapples with the cruelty of the gods, particularly Zeus, and finds herself torn between restoring her place and wanting to destroy Olympus.  \n   - Hera must confront who she is outside of her divine status and how she can find meaning beyond the binary that both marginalizes and privileges her.  \n\n- **Resolution and Hope:**  \n   - For Zeus, it might be too late to change, but for Hera, there is still hope.

While I empathize with her struggles—her world being upended, her sense of power undermined, and her frustration with the lack of transparency—she remains relatable yet difficult to like.",
            "The final line of the book is truly exceptional: “Immortal and ageless, reinvented a thousand times, remade for a thousand narratives, throne-less and wandering, but forever the ruler of her own destiny.” Its impact is so profound that I’m tempted to get it tattooed or printed on a Kindle sticker.",

The narrative highlights the limited options available to Hera compared to those of modern women, emphasizing that even the most powerful figure of her time—the queen of the gods—was ultimately victimized by a man.

While it was clear that Hera experienced sexual violence, she did not feel overly redeemable or heroic in the same way other protagonists of Saint’s have.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n   - After reading on, I realized that the story is meant to be different, and the themes explored offer deeper and more nuanced perspectives on power systems.  \n   - At the heart of the story is a critique of “girl boss” culture, exploring how power structures rooted in patriarchy will never truly allow for the liberation of women.  \n\n- **Character Development (Hera):**  \n   - Hera only finds peace when she stops dismissing mortals as beneath her.  \n   - Although she views herself as better than Zeus and is, in many ways, becoming the ruler of the gods would not be inherently liberating.  \n   - She believes she would be a more equitable leader and wants to share power among the Olympians, but she would still be a ruler, perpetuating a system of power.  \n\n- **Exploration of Power Dynamics and Feminism:**  \n   - The book delves into what it means to be the “perfect victim” (Asteria) and the pitting of women against one another (Hera and Athena, as well as most other women in the book).  \n   - Hera isn’t meant to be a feminist icon to be looked up to; instead, she highlights how different systems of power interact and the importance of collective liberation.  \n   - The story emphasizes that giving destructive power to privileged women only further exploits other women and people they view as beneath them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel challenges traditional narratives and offers a thought-provoking critique of power structures, patriarchy, and the limitations of individual empowerment within oppressive systems.

While the book’s ambitious scope occasionally leads to rushed storytelling, it succeeds in portraying Hera as a complex and relatable figure. The themes of resentment and identity resonate deeply, making it a compelling read, especially for those familiar with Greek mythology.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly stated, but the reviewer implies a rating slightly below 5 stars due to pacing issues."

The novel portrays her as a more sympathetic character, though not entirely justified in her actions—she is a god, after all. It felt like a fresh perspective on her story, making her more relatable while still acknowledging her flaws.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and POV:**  \n  The story spans from the War of the Titans to beyond the Trojan War, told entirely from Hera’s perspective. This approach felt immersive, as if I were experiencing time as a goddess would. However, it felt less like a retelling and more like a “telling from Hera’s POV,” which might not appeal to readers deeply familiar with Greek mythology.  \n\n- **Accessibility for Non-Experts:**  \n  As someone with only a basic understanding of Greek mythology, I appreciated the background on mythological names and events. It helped me connect with the story, though I can see how more knowledgeable readers might find it less engaging.  \n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  The narrator’s voice was enjoyable, but the pronunciation of character names was confusing and inconsistent. A quick search confirmed I wasn’t the only one puzzled by this.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book explores themes of power struggles, being wronged as a woman, and Hera’s perspective on jealousy. It’s a story of shadows and resilience, with a tone that balances sympathy and divine complexity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a compelling and sympathetic portrayal of Hera, blending Greek mythology with a fresh perspective.

The author’s poignant retelling of Hera’s story presents a powerful, feminist portrayal of the goddess. Often vilified for her jealousy and vengeance, the narrative reveals that Hera’s wrath is rooted in profound pain, particularly following Zeus’ betrayal. This retelling humanizes Hera’s struggle with subjugation and betrayal while refraining from excusing her actions.",

Jennifer Saint’s poignant retelling of Hera’s story is a stunning, feministic portrayal of the Greek goddess. Often vilified for her jealousy and vengeance, Saint paints a picture where it’s clear that Hera’s wrath stems from deep pain, especially after Zeus’ betrayal. Saint’s retelling humanizes Hera’s struggle with subjugation and betrayal without excusing her actions.  \n\n- **Themes and Message:**  \n  The novel explores Hera’s internal conflict, questioning whether ruling means perpetuating a cycle of violence or breaking it to create a better world. It offers a nuanced view of Hera and Greek mythology, providing a powerful narrative for women who’ve faced oppression, betrayal, and injustice.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Jennifer Saint’s prose is beautiful, revealing Hera’s complexity beyond the jealous wife and vengeful stepmother. However, there are some disjointed transitions that slightly detract from the flow of the story.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The novel includes themes of rape, sexism/misogyny, and incest, which should be noted with trigger warnings prior to the start of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJennifer Saint’s *Hera* is an epic and enthralling retelling of an often-misunderstood Greek goddess.

            "The transition of time in the interpretation of Hera's myths can be somewhat jarring, yet the book covers a vast array of her stories. While focusing on a single event might have provided clarity, it would have restricted the narrative's scope. Conversely, a series format may not have been necessary either.",
            "Hera's character is both complex and layered, leaving us uncertain whether to sympathize with her or cringe at her failures. Her struggle to hold onto her role as a means of coping with trauma—especially Zeus's assault—adds a compelling dimension to her narrative. The karmic events, including her perceived child enemy destroying her grandchildren, further enrich her story.",
            "This book beautifully captures the phrase \"dust to dust,\" illustrating Gaia's emergence from nothingness and Hera's eventual departure from Olympus, symbolizing her return to the void. The cyclical nature of creation and destruction serves as a central theme throughout the narrative."

The book could have focused on one particular event, but that would have limited its scope. However, it didn’t need to be a series either.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The book evokes the phrase “dust to dust,” reflecting Gaia’s origin from nothing and Hera’s eventual return to nothing by leaving Olympus. The cyclical nature of creation and destruction is a central theme.  \n\n- **Character Development (Hera):**  \n  Hera’s character is complex and layered. It’s unclear whether we’re meant to sympathize with her or cringe as her plans fail. Her attempts to cling to her given role as a way to make sense of her trauma—particularly Zeus’s assault as a means to claim her—are compelling. The karmic sequence of events, such as her assumed child enemy destroying her grandchildren, adds depth to her story.  \n\n- **Exploration of Power and Impotence:**  \n  Hera’s impotence within her sphere of influence—marriage—is a recurring theme. The book explores how she struggles with her role and the limitations imposed on her.  \n\n- **Transformation and Growth:**  \n  The interpretation of Hera’s transformation is fascinating. When she was given a “soft” role, she was nearly a monster, but when she let go of that “purity,” she learned and grew to embody softness. Her journey is one of self-discovery, as she derives her own worth and contentment from herself.  \n\n- **Moral Ambiguity:**  \n  The book doesn’t aim to absolve Hera or make the reader forgive her. Instead, it presents her as a desperate woman who evolves over eons, reflecting the long learning curve of a goddess.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a rich and nuanced exploration of Hera’s myth, delving into her trauma, power struggles, and eventual growth. While the narrative structure can feel uneven at times, the thematic depth and character development make it a compelling read. The book doesn’t seek to justify Hera’s actions but instead portrays her as a complex figure striving to find her own worth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  I enjoyed the book until the end, but I felt like the ending dragged on and on without getting to the point. The story begins after the siblings have defeated Cronus and the Titans, bringing about the rule of the Olympians. However, the pacing in the latter part of the book felt slow and unresolved.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book is full of unlikeable characters, with Zeus and Hera being the worst of them. Zeus takes and takes without regard for others, while Hera seeks revenge on him by taking it out on Zeus’ victims, lovers, and children. Neither character is portrayed as a victim; both are self-centered and only care about how they appear or how things affect them.\n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  I appreciated learning about the Olympians and their origin stories, such as Apollo, Ares, Aphrodite, and Athena. The mythological backdrop was engaging and well-developed, providing a rich context for the story.\n\n- **Themes and Conflict:**  \n  The central conflict revolves around Hera’s feelings of betrayal after Zeus divides the world among their brothers, leaving her and her sisters out. Her repeated attempts at revenge against Zeus drive much of the narrative, though these efforts ultimately feel futile.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the issues with pacing and the unlikeable characters, I found the book to be good overall. The exploration of Greek mythology and the dynamics between the Olympians kept me engaged.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its flaws, particularly in pacing and character likability, it was an enjoyable read overall. The rich mythological world and the exploration of the Olympians’ origins made it worthwhile.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "In this story, we explore how Hera, the immortal goddess and daughter of the ancient Titan Cronos, aided her brother Zeus in overthrowing their tyrannical father to seize control of the world. As they establish their reign on Mount Olympus, Hera grows suspicious that Zeus may be as ruthless and cruel as their father, prompting her to question her role by his side. Traditionally depicted as a jealous wife and wicked stepmother, the author seeks to provide insight into Hera's motivations. While she effectively presents Hera's perspective, it’s challenging to feel sympathy for this angry and often irrational goddess. Although I enjoyed the dramatic narrative, I found it difficult to connect with any of the immortals introduced; they all appeared self-absorbed, cruel, and petty, unworthy of the immense power they wielded over one another and the human world."

Saint successfully brings to life the strange and vengeful world of the gods, goddesses, and monsters of ancient Greece.  \n\n- **Character Development (Hera):**  \n  We learn how Hera, immortal goddess and daughter of the ancient Titan Cronos, helped her brother Zeus to overthrow their tyrannical father so that they could rule the world. As they establish their reign on Mount Olympus, Hera suspects that Zeus might be just as ruthless and cruel as their father was, and she begins to question her role at his side. Traditionally portrayed as a jealous wife and a wicked stepmother, Saint attempts to flesh out the reasons why Hera behaves as she does. I think she successfully shows us Hera’s viewpoint, but it’s hard to feel much sympathy for this angry and often irrational goddess.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Immortal Characters:**  \n  While I loved the dramatic tale, I didn’t like any of the immortals we were introduced to. They all seemed to be self-obsessed, cruel, petty, and undeserving of the great power they wielded over each other and the human world.  \n\n- **Narrative Quality:**  \n  That said, this is a dramatic, epic, and engaging story and a fascinating re-telling of the world of the ancient Greek deities.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJennifer Saint’s retelling of Hera’s story is a captivating and dramatic exploration of ancient Greek mythology. While the portrayal of the gods and goddesses highlights their flaws and makes them difficult to sympathize with, the narrative itself is engaging and well-crafted.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story would likely have benefited from a first-person perspective rather than third-person narration. The latter created a sense of a historical overview of Olympus's rise and fall, rather than offering a deep exploration of Hera's character. I wanted to delve more into her thoughts and emotions, but the narrative often lacked tension, making the stakes feel disappointingly low. This detachment made it read more like a retelling of a myth than an engaging story. On a positive note, I appreciated the mythological accuracy, particularly Hera's tendency to direct her anger at others instead of Zeus, which was true to the original myths. However, this accuracy sometimes left me questioning whether I should just revisit the actual mythology instead.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Uniqueness and Originality:**  \n   - This novel is unlike any myth retelling I have read before.  \n   - Saint takes on the ambitious task of reimagining Hera, a figure often demonized in mythology as merely the jealous and spiteful wife of Zeus.  \n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n   - Hera is portrayed as a complex character thrust into an existence she never desired, forced to be the ever-faithful wife while Zeus abuses his authority and mocks her values.  \n   - Her constant struggle for power, as she gains and loses it throughout the story, is compelling.  \n\n- **Exploration of Themes:**  \n   - The latter part of the novel delves into the relationship and codependency between the Gods and mortal worship, which I found particularly intriguing.  \n   - The story serves as a reminder that the Gods are not meant to be likable characters, and Saint effectively separates the reader emotionally from them.  \n\n- **Empathy and Moral Complexity:**  \n   - While we can empathize with Hera's mistreatment, we also witness the terrible atrocities she commits, adding layers of moral complexity to her character.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - Saint's beautiful prose breathes life into Hera, a figure whose story has never been fully told, creating a hopeful narrative of resilience and enduring change.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n   - Many thanks to the publisher for providing a copy for review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a unique and ambitious retelling of Hera's story, offering a fresh perspective on a mythological figure often reduced to a one-dimensional role. Saint's masterful prose and exploration of complex themes, such as power, resilience, and the relationship between Gods and mortals, make this a compelling read. While the characters are not likable, their depth and moral ambiguity add richness to the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The ending was both satisfying and skillfully executed, with the lightning bolt scene serving as a particularly symbolic and impactful moment. By the conclusion, I gained a deeper understanding of Hera, even if I ultimately didn’t like her.",
            "The author boldly embraces Hera's traditional image as a jealous and vindictive goddess while also delving into her backstory. The narrative explores Hera's life before Zeus and how his actions influenced her transformation into the goddess we recognize. I found myself sympathizing with Hera and rooting for her, particularly given her challenging position on Olympus. I appreciated her relationships with Hestia and Typhon's monsters, which added depth to her character. Additionally, the book expands on Hera's family, introducing her daughters and extended monster offspring—a refreshing change from other retellings that focus solely on Ares and Hephaestus."

I adore the tales of the ancient Gods and Goddesses and their interactions with mortals, in whose lives they meddle for their own entertainment.  \n\n- **Character Perspective (Hera):**  \n   - I have always had a tricky relationship with Hera, whom I have always viewed as rather vindictive and spiteful – taking her frustrations with Zeus out on the (often unwilling) objects of his infatuation.  \n   - I went into this novel hoping to see another side of Hera – something that would make me see her in a new light or give her some kind of redemption arc.  \n   - While the novel does explain some of Hera’s backstory and show how she became the way she did, there is only so much the author can do with the source material.

I’d give it 4.25 stars, which is higher than I rated Jennifer Saint’s previous works, *Elektra* and *Ariadne*.  \n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n  I don’t usually like Hera as a character, but this book was well done in my opinion. Hera’s flaws, strengths, vengeance, and hopes were all examined here, and I appreciated the depth of her portrayal.  \n\n- **Narrative Scope and Perspective:**  \n  The book covers a huge span of time in the immortal, Olympian world. I gained a new perspective from Hera’s story and appreciated the honesty with which Olympian (and mortal) women’s stories were portrayed.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Content:**  \n  There are trigger warnings, but I felt the sensitive content was not included for shock value. It was handled thoughtfully and with purpose.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jennifer Saint did better with character development in this book than I’ve seen her do before. Hera’s complexity was particularly well-executed.  \n\n- **Areas for Improvement:**  \n  I marked the book down slightly because I wish the stories of the mortal (and Olympian) women harmed by Zeus and Hera had been given more detail and compassion. While the story is told from Hera’s perspective, this left some gaps in the narrative for me.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  This may be my favorite of Jennifer Saint’s works. It’s at least on par with *Atalanta* for me!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it to be a standout in Jennifer Saint’s repertoire.

Her identity as the goddess of marriage and childbirth is persistently undermined by him. The book skillfully explores the origins of Hera's reputation as a jealous and obsessive wife.",

Saint doesn’t rewrite her history but instead allows Hera’s viewpoint to shine, revealing her struggles and emotions.  \n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n  Hera is portrayed as a complex figure, forever shunned by her siblings and trapped in a manipulative, unlovable marriage to Zeus. Her identity is tied to being the goddess of marriage and childbirth, roles that Zeus continually undermines. The book effectively highlights how Hera’s reputation as a jealous and obsessive wife came to be.  \n\n- **Exploration of Themes:**  \n  The novel delves into themes of power dynamics, identity, and the constraints of societal roles. It examines how Hera’s purpose is stripped away and how she navigates her place among the gods.  \n\n- **Engagement with Greek Mythology:**  \n  The book serves as a digestible and enjoyable way to learn more about Greek mythology, particularly Hera’s story, which may not be as widely known.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Connection:**  \n  While the book is well-written and insightful, it didn’t evoke as strong an emotional response as other retellings.

It feels more like a long-winded summary of Hera’s life rather than a deep exploration. I almost wish the author had picked one or two key events, like her grandchildren and Heracles or the Trojan War, and done a deep dive into those instances instead of this shortened creative biography. Everything important seemed too glossed over or rushed.  \n\n- **Endings:**  \n  The author continues to struggle with lackluster endings for me. Her strongest ending remains *Ariadne*. In this book, as with others, there’s a lot of middle-story excitement, but the ending just kind of fades to black.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the issues, I still very much enjoy the author’s writing.

While I wished for more detailed worldbuilding and a stronger portrayal of Zeus as a villain, the novel succeeded in providing a compelling perspective on a traditionally misunderstood figure.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There are much more compelling characters in Greek mythology, and Hera has always been one of my least favorites.  \n\n- **Critique of Hera's Character in Mythology:**  \n  Hera has always struck me as petty and unjust. Imagine having a husband who goes around raping mortal women and then punishing the mortals for *his* actions. Hera sucks.  \n\n- **Understanding Hera's Perspective:**  \n  After reading this book, I understand her better. She’s a powerful goddess, but she’s still a woman living in a world of subjugation and control. Zeus, as the king of gods, was a rapist, and his word was law. The entire structure of Olympus is flawed and corrupt from the top down.  \n\n- **Sympathy for Hera's Suffering:**  \n  Hera suffered too, but her lashing out at mortals because she was effectively powerless against her husband’s rule was still insanely wrong and petty.  \n\n- **Appreciation for the Book and Hera's POV:**  \n  Despite my reservations, this book was good, and I enjoyed seeing her perspective.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I initially doubted Hera as a protagonist and still find her actions problematic, this book provided a deeper understanding of her character and the oppressive world she lived in.

It was frustrating to see her relegated behind Zeus, so it was time to see her in all her complexity. Saint achieved this. Hera might not be the most likable character (Hestia and Hephaestus get that title here), but her pain and righteous anger were relatable.  \n- **Relationships and Dynamics:** I loved her relationships with her sisters and Gaia.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development (Hera's Arc):**  \n  Hera's character arc is not necessarily likable, but it is deeply understandable. She represents powerful women who are forced into constrained roles, embodying the struggle of inherent wild freedom suppressed by societal expectations. Her story evokes both admiration and sorrow, especially for the monsters who symbolize the cost of being different and the freedom to be oneself.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The novel explores the enduring struggles of women within patriarchal systems, offering a raw and unflinching portrayal of their suffering. It serves as a powerful representation of goddess mythology, reflecting the ways women are twisted into shapes they never wished for and the journey toward healing.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book is beautifully written, with prose that is both evocative and thought-provoking. It challenges readers to confront uncomfortable truths while maintaining a compelling narrative.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The story comes with trigger warnings for the various ways women suffer under patriarchal systems. It is not \"cosy reading\" but rather a profound and sometimes harrowing exploration of these themes.  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  The novel is a worthwhile read, leaving a lasting impression. It is haunting and thought-provoking, offering a unique perspective on goddess mythology and the resilience of women.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a powerful and beautifully written novel that delves into the struggles of women within patriarchal systems, using Hera's story as a lens. While it is not an easy read due to its heavy themes, it is deeply impactful and thought-provoking, making it a worthwhile experience for those seeking a profound exploration of goddess representation and women's endurance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I was slightly disappointed by *Atalanta*, her other books have been excellent, and this one is no exception.  \n\n- **Character Interpretation and Sympathy:**  \n  Saint takes the story of Hera, one of Greek mythology's most unjustly hated goddesses, and presents it in a way that may finally help readers sympathize with her seemingly unjustifiable actions. It's about time people stopped automatically despising Hera and considered the other side of her story.  \n\n- **Faithfulness to Source Material vs. Creative Vision:**  \n  Saint does a phenomenal job of sticking to the basic myths while adding an entirely new perspective. She stays true to the original stories without sacrificing her unique vision for the character.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Myth Retellings:**  \n  Among contemporary writers retelling ancient myths, Saint is one of the best at balancing the fine line between creating a fresh narrative and preserving the integrity of the original myths.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Recommendations:**  \n  If you enjoy retellings of Greek myths, stories about powerful women, or simply want to explore a different perspective on Hera's motivations, this book is highly recommended.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJennifer Saint delivers another compelling retelling, this time focusing on Hera, a goddess often misunderstood and vilified.

Hera's narrative resembled a collection of short stories, likely due to her presence in numerous Greek myths.

Instead, she was humanized, offering a refreshing departure from traditional portrayals. This version of Hera is often selfish and vengeful, but she is also a woman betrayed, fiercely determined to reclaim her power.",

Hera, as an immortal goddess, daughter of Cronos, and sister/wife of Zeus, is a complex figure. While she can be vengeful, she also shows compassion and embodies the power of a queen of the gods. This retelling delves into her story, offering insight into her actions and motivations, which makes her more relatable on a human level. Although she isn't redeemed, her character is explored with depth and nuance.",

It boldly embraces the darker facets of Greek mythology. As a fan of retellings in this genre, I found the intrigue, betrayal, and vengeance in Hera’s narrative to be immensely satisfying and in line with my expectations. Having previously enjoyed the author’s *Atalanta* and Rosie Hunt’s *Medea*, I was eager to dive into *Hera*, and it did not disappoint; it felt like a natural progression in my reading journey. While I don’t scrutinize the accuracy of modern retellings against classical myths, I find the genre compelling and thoroughly entertaining."

She is vengeful when necessary but also compassionate and, most importantly, an all-powerful queen of the gods.\n   - Hera’s story provides a deeper understanding of her actions and motivations, making her more relatable from a human emotion perspective. While she isn’t redeemed in this retelling, her character is explored in a way that adds depth and nuance.\n\n- **Engagement and Themes:**\n   - The novel is engaging, filled with drama, cruelty, violence, secrets, and lies—elements that are fitting for a story involving Zeus. It doesn’t shy away from the darker aspects of Greek mythology.\n   - As someone who enjoys Greek mythology retellings, I found the drama, backstabbing, and vengeance in Hera’s story to be thoroughly satisfying. It aligns well with the genre’s expectations.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**\n   - The audiobook narrator was generally engaging and well-paced, which enhanced the storytelling experience.\n   - However, there were some odd pronunciations of gods’ names (e.g., Ares and Athena) that felt jarring and out of place. This occasionally pulled me out of the story and caused minor confusion, especially at the beginning when identifying which god was being referenced.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Genre Appeal:**\n   - Having enjoyed Jennifer Saint’s *Atalanta* and Rosie Hunt’s *Medea*, I was eager to read *Hera*. It did not disappoint and felt like a natural next read for me.\n   - As a casual enthusiast of Greek mythology, I don’t delve deeply into the accuracy of modern retellings compared to classical myths.

This is ironic, given the novel's exploration of the antithesis between humanity and godliness.  \n- **Characterization:** Jennifer Saint excels at crafting characters. They are a joy to materialize and watch interact, making the reading experience enjoyable.  \n- **Representation:** Bonus points for the subtle lesbian representation of Artemis (if you squint).  \n- **Overall Impression:** Despite some reservations, the book is an inspiring and fantastically intelligent read. I would recommend it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel didn’t resonate with me as deeply as some of Jennifer Saint’s other works, the strong ending, excellent characterization, and intelligent storytelling made it a worthwhile and enjoyable read.

            "Hera is a deeply unlikable character. While I wanted to empathize with her, she often appears selfish and self-absorbed, much like Zeus. The author skillfully portrays Hera's pain and struggles, making it clear that her circumstances might have been different had she received her due or been male. Although Hera is a flawed character—like all the Greek gods and goddesses—she doesn't endure the same level of suffering as figures like Medusa and Circe."

The ending was particularly surprising and satisfying.  \n\n- **Character Perspective (Hera’s POV):**  \n  Hera’s point of view was quite toxic through the middle of the book. While I understand why it was necessary for the narrative, some sections were difficult to read.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes themes of rape and sexual assault, which are common in mythology. If these are triggering for you, I’d recommend skipping this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a thought-provoking and engaging read, though Hera’s toxic perspective and the heavy themes made certain parts challenging. The mythology and unexpected ending were highlights for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThis would have been a five-star read for me if not for the issues with Hera’s POV."

I was clueless when I started reading this, but I think I must have done a little reading in college because I started recalling Hera's story.  \n- **Character Likability:**  \n  I wish Hera was a more likeable character, but she is interesting.  \n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  Despite its length, I did manage to finish *Hera* in fewer than a month of weekends!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Greek mythology is not my usual genre, *Hera* proved to be an engaging read. Though the protagonist wasn't particularly likeable, her story was compelling enough to keep me invested, and I was able to finish the book relatively quickly despite its length.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel *Hera* reimagines the titular character, the wife of Zeus, as a powerful figure driven by her own ambitions and wisdom, rather than merely a jealous queen. It delves into her journey from a key player in the overthrow of Cronus to being sidelined in traditional myths as a mere wife and queen. This reinterpretation highlights Hera's strategic efforts to thwart Zeus from fathering a powerful heir, framing her actions as calculated rather than simply motivated by jealousy towards his lovers and illegitimate children.",
            "A renowned author in the English-speaking world is acclaimed for reinterpreting classic Greek and Roman myths through the lens of female characters who are often only briefly mentioned in the original tales. Their previous works, featuring fresh perspectives on figures like Ariadne, Atalanta, and Electra, showcase this unique approach.",
            "The novel explores themes of ambition, power, and the challenge of pursuing one's goals in a restrictive environment. It prompted me to consider the necessity of having the freedom to fully express one's abilities, even in the face of societal or environmental constraints."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Perspective:**  \n   - The author brilliantly captures Hera's character, conveying her emotions and experiences over hundreds or thousands of years.  \n   - The female PoV retelling is well-executed, and Hera's perspective on her marriage to Zeus, her feelings of being robbed of her right to rule, and her humiliation are effectively portrayed.  \n   - The nuances of Hera's character are conveyed in a way that makes her feel real and relatable.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Performance:**  \n   - The narrator is excellent, but the pronunciation of certain Greek names (e.g., Ares as \"Arr-ez,\" Hebe as \"Hair-bair,\" Persephone as \"Persephon-air\") felt odd and occasionally grating.  \n   - The pronunciation of Hera as \"Herra\" was inconsistent, with one instance where it was pronounced \"He-ra.\"  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n   - The book includes vivid descriptions of sensitive topics, such as SA (sexual assault), which may require a trigger warning for readers unfamiliar with Greek mythology.  \n   - There are several mentions of miscarriage, which could be upsetting for some readers.  \n\n- **Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n   - Hera's relationship with her sister, Hestia, is particularly enjoyable and adds depth to the story.  \n   - The complexities of her relationship with her son, Hephaestus, are well-explored and engaging.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n   - Fans of Madeleine Miller’s *Circe* will likely enjoy this book, as it shares a similar style of retelling Greek myths from a female perspective.  \n   - The book is highly recommended for fans of Greek mythology retellings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this audiobook to be highly entertaining and emotionally engaging. The author’s portrayal of Hera as a complex and relatable character, combined with the exploration of her relationships and struggles, made for a compelling listen. While the pronunciation of certain names was a minor drawback, the narration was otherwise excellent. I would recommend this book to fans of Greek mythology retellings, though a trigger warning for sensitive content would be helpful.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Unlike the author's previous works, which concentrated on specific time periods, *Hera* encompasses an eternity, reflecting the goddess's immortality. The narrative begins with her conception as the child of Titans Cronus and Rhea and traces her journey through a forced marriage to Zeus, her role as the goddess of marriage, and her involvement in pivotal mythological events such as the creation of humans, Jason's quest, the Trojan War, and the decline of the Olympians. I found the ending satisfying, as it effectively concludes Hera's character arc.",
            "Hera is a captivating character, neither a clear villain nor a heroine. While her mistreatment by Zeus evokes sympathy, her self-centered actions and tendency to punish women for his infidelities reveal her darker side. Despite her flaws, her relentless pursuit of revenge and single-mindedness are somewhat admirable, even if they lead to collateral damage among her own children and innocent women. The narrative suggests that her early life circumstances hindered her ability to become a kind or loving goddess, though she does gradually evolve and soften throughout the story."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This retelling of Hera’s story is a compelling exploration of a complex and morally ambiguous character. While it doesn’t surpass the author’s earlier works like *Elektra*, it is on par with *Ariadne* and offers a fresh perspective on a goddess often vilified in mythology. The narrative’s scope, nuanced portrayal of Hera, and satisfying conclusion make it a worthwhile read.",

While it doesn’t surpass the author’s earlier works like *Elektra*, it is on par with *Ariadne* and offers a fresh perspective on a goddess often vilified in mythology.

            "The author presents a unique and refreshing perspective on Hera, a character frequently vilified in Greek mythology.

It explores the generational cycles of entitlement, greed for power, and selfishness, as seen in the progression from Uranus to Cronus to Zeus.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Hera’s character is particularly compelling. She is defined by her role as Zeus’s wife, but the narrative reminds us that she was once so much more. The dialogue, such as when Zeus says, “It’s what you are,” and Hera reflects on the many answers she once had to that question, highlights her loss of identity and agency.  \n\n- **Mythological Interpretation:**  \n  The author, Saint, portrays the lesser Olympians as the most influential in the workings of the human world, despite their snide undercutting, power-grabbing, and vindictive nature. This interpretation underscores the absence of true heroes in Greek mythology, presenting it as more of a tragedy.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Stories:**  \n  The reviewer expresses a desire for a book focused on Athena, noting her complexity as a character who is disliked by many yet delivers cutting lines with clear wisdom despite her antagonism.  \n\n- **Personal Ranking:**  \n  The reviewer ranks the characters as follows: 1. Atalanta, 2. Hera, 3. Elektra.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a fresh and tragic perspective on Greek mythology, focusing on the struggles of its female characters and the absence of true heroes.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Focus on Hera:**  \n  I liked that this book focused on Hera throughout, giving me the opportunity to get to know her specifically. It provided a good overview of Hera from her perspective.  \n\n- **Introduction to Mythology:**  \n  As a beginner mythology reader, I appreciated being introduced to dozens of other characters. However, it was overwhelming at times, though this is more due to the nature of the subject matter rather than a flaw in the book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book was a bit too long for me. I found it hard to stay interested around the 70% mark. It covers a wide timeline, with a lot happening, and some parts felt glossed over or rushed due to time jumps.  \n\n- **Narration (Audio Version):**  \n  The narrator did a good job. She had a soothing yet strong voice, which added to the experience.  \n\n- **Cover Art:**  \n  The cover art was amazing! I absolutely loved it.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for providing this audio ARC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a good introduction to Hera and mythology from her perspective. While the length and pacing made it challenging to stay fully engaged, the focus on Hera, the strong narration, and the stunning cover art made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3⭐️"

            "The book suffers from pacing issues, with some sections engaging while others feel laborious. Spanning the entire mythological period from the Titanomachy to Ancient Greece, the narrative often skims over significant events. The focus on specific stories, such as Zeus's lovers, Jason and the Argonauts, and the Trojan War, creates jarring transitions that make it challenging to grasp the overall timeline. However, the ending shines, presenting a bittersweet and intriguing perspective on how the Gods adapt to modern life. This fresh approach distinguishes it from other retellings that remain anchored in the traditional Greek Mythology era, making it both poignant and captivating.",

Although this is a feminist retelling, her actions—punishing women targeted by Zeus and venting her anger on his children—make it difficult to empathize with her.

The time span of the story, covering the entire mythological period from the Titanomachy to Ancient Greece, felt vast and often skimmed over. The focus on specific events like Zeus's lovers, Jason and the Argonauts, and the Trojan War made the transitions between events feel jarring, and it was difficult to fully grasp the sense of time.  \n\n- **Ending and Modern Adaptation of Gods:**  \n  The ending was a highlight, offering a bittersweet and intriguing take on how the Gods adapt to modern life. This approach stood out compared to other retellings that remain rooted in the Greek Mythology era, and I found it both sad and fascinating.  \n\n- **Depiction of Gods and Mythological World:**  \n  The portrayal of the Gods was compelling, particularly Hera, Dionysus, Hephaestus, and Hestia as side characters. Zeus and Poseidon evoked the expected rage, and the mythological world, especially Olympus, felt vivid and well-realized.  \n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n  Hera was an interesting but unlikable protagonist. While this is a feminist retelling, her actions—punishing women targeted by Zeus and taking her anger out on his children—made it hard to root for her. Despite her lack of connection to her own children and family (other than her monstrous brood), she was layered and complex, making her perspective engaging to read.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author's Other Works:**  \n  This book felt like the weakest of Jennifer Saint's works so far, but it still maintained my overall enjoyment of her storytelling. It hasn't diminished her position as one of my top Greek Myth retellers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had pacing issues and some uneven storytelling, it offered a fresh take on Greek mythology with its modern adaptation of the Gods and vivid depictions of the mythological world. Hera's complex characterization and the bittersweet ending were standout elements.

While her feelings are understandable, her relentless focus on thwarting Zeus becomes repetitive and tiresome.

This book delves into the less glamorous side of the gods and goddesses, which I find intriguing and refreshing.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The relationship between Zeus and Hera is central to the story. While Zeus desired Hera, her feelings were not mutual, and her reasons for marrying him were unexpected and something I hadn’t encountered before in mythology. This added a layer of complexity to their dynamic.  \n\n- **Conflict and Plot Development:**  \n  The \"battle of the sexes\" between Hera and Zeus was particularly engaging. Hera’s attempt to seek revenge against Zeus, the most powerful of the gods, was compelling, and I found myself rooting for her despite the odds. The tension and power struggle kept me invested in the story.  \n\n- **Mythological Accuracy and Interpretation:**  \n  The book stays true to the symbols and roles of the gods, such as Zeus being the King of Kings with symbols like the oak tree, bald eagle, and thunderbolt, and Hera as the goddess of marriage. However, it also introduces unique interpretations of their relationship and motivations, which I found fascinating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a fresh and engaging take on Greek mythology, particularly through its exploration of the complex relationship between Zeus and Hera.

Other retellings, such as *Circe*, are so effective because they are focused and imaginative.  \n\n- **Scope and Focus:**  \n  *Hera* is just too big—it retold way too much, becoming list-like with events. It felt like there wasn’t a main plot, and I wasn’t sure where the story was going. Even with so much happening, it lacked a cohesive narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Jennifer Saint is a beautiful writer, but the book wasn’t very captivating. It felt almost too reflective, which might be a symptom of trying to fit too much into one book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the writing is beautiful, *Hera* suffers from an overly ambitious scope, making it feel unfocused and less engaging compared to other retellings like *Circe* or even Saint’s own *Ariadne*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐️"

While myths portray Hera as fierce, here she often remains in the background, fixated on revenge but lacking the intensity to confront Zeus or the women he pursues.",

However, the dialogue often feels stilted and unnatural, particularly during Hera's manipulation attempts.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - Jennifer Saint's writing is consistently great, and this novel is no exception.  \n   - The author effectively captures the frustrating and complicated nature of Hera's character.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Hera is portrayed as a complex character, and Saint does a fantastic job of staying true to her punishing nature in response to Zeus' actions.  \n   - The toxic and competitive relationship between Hera and Zeus is well-depicted, showcasing their mutual attempts to hurt each other.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The pacing felt off, as the story read more like a list of events and reactions rather than a cohesive narrative.  \n   - Hera's constant failures and lack of success were disillusioning, making it harder to root for her despite her unlikable nature.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - I wanted to feel more rage and anger from Hera, which would have made her more compelling.  \n   - The ending, where Hera finds peace and understanding, was satisfying but would have been more impactful if I had felt more connected to her throughout the story.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - The audiobook's pronunciation of names and terms was occasionally jarring and confusing, requiring re-listening to understand who was being referred to.  \n   - This might be a personal issue, as I am not an expert on Greek mythology, but it did detract from the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Jennifer Saint's writing and characterization of Hera are strong, the pacing and emotional engagement fell short for me. The audiobook's pronunciation issues added to the challenges of fully immersing myself in the story. Despite these drawbacks, the ending provided a satisfying resolution, though it could have been more impactful with a stronger connection to Hera earlier in the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "In this story, Hera is portrayed as a rape survivor who marries Zeus with the intention of undermining him from within. While the premise aims to empower her, the execution falls short, as Hera often appears disempowered and faces repeated failures, despite her status as queen of the gods. Additionally, her lack of engagement with her domains—women and marriage—misses an opportunity to explore her potential for protectiveness and solidarity with those she represents.",
            "*Hera* offers a mythical retelling of the goddess Hera, presenting her as a misunderstood figure rather than a mere antagonist. In the vein of *Wicked*, the author adds context that softens Hera’s harsher actions, providing a solid foundation for this reinterpretation. Throughout the novel, Hera's indifference to mortals is consistently portrayed, highlighting how her thirst for revenge distorts her character and prevents her from finding joy or moving on. However, the narrative, centered on a woman marrying her rapist, feels cruel and ultimately futile. Unlike *Elektra*, I found it lacking in catharsis.",
            "As a devoted fan of the author, I eagerly anticipate her new releases, with *Elektra* being one of my all-time favorites. However, this latest novel fell short for me; it was merely fine and lacked the impact that *Elektra* had."

The novel lacked the emotional catharsis and depth I expected, though it has many strengths that will likely appeal to other readers.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Reputation and Expectations:**  \n   - I am a big fan of Jennifer Saint's work, and her novel *Elektra* is one of my favorite books. I always read her new releases as soon as I can.  \n   - This novel, however, was only fine for me. It didn’t wow me like *Elektra* did.  \n\n- **Concept and Retelling Approach:**  \n   - *Hera* is a mythical retelling of the life of the goddess Hera, reframing her as a misunderstood figure rather than purely antagonistic.  \n   - The retelling is in the tradition of *Wicked*, adding context to soften Hera’s crueler actions.  \n   - Saint provides a solid basis for this reframing and remains consistent with her choices, such as portraying Hera as indifferent to mortals throughout the book.  \n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n   - Hera is portrayed as a victim of rape by Zeus, whom she marries to \"destroy\" him from within.  \n   - While the intention was to empower a survivor, the execution felt inconsistent. Hera is disempowered and fails repeatedly, despite being queen of the gods.  \n   - Hera shows little interest in her domains (women and marriage), which felt like a missed opportunity to explore her potential protectiveness or solidarity with her charges.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The novel explores how Hera’s thirst for revenge twists her, preventing her from moving on or finding joy.  \n   - In a story about a woman marrying her rapist, this felt cruel and like an exercise in futility and sadness.  \n   - I did not experience the same sense of catharsis as I did with *Elektra*.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Gods and Goddesses:**  \n   - Saint avoids the trend of making goddesses overly relatable or \"ordinary.\" The gods and goddesses feel distinct and separate from humanity, which I appreciated.  \n   - The gods’ morality is depicted as fundamentally different from humans’, which Saint handles brilliantly.  \n\n- **Overall Strengths and Weaknesses:**  \n   - The novel is solidly written with a lot to like, but this interpretation of Hera didn’t resonate with me personally.  \n   - I think many readers will enjoy this book, even if it wasn’t what I was hoping for.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Hera* is a well-written and consistent retelling that avoids common pitfalls in portraying gods and goddesses, its interpretation of Hera as a disempowered and vengeful figure didn’t fully work for me. The novel lacked the emotional catharsis and depth I expected, though it has many strengths that will likely appeal to other readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book shines when it presents a reimagined plot, as seen in *Elektra*. In contrast, *Hera* reads more like a straightforward retelling, akin to *Atalanta*. The narrative's focus is uneven, dedicating too much time to Hera's internal struggles in the early chapters while rushing through more thrilling events, such as the quest for the Golden Fleece and the Trojan War. Notably, a decade of conflict is summarized in just a few pages.",
            "Hera comes across as a bitter and jealous character, making her unlikable at times. Although her backstory with Zeus adds depth, her selfishness, long-held grudges, and tendency to sabotage Zeus' conquests—often targeting those who had no choice—are frustrating. I would have preferred to see her take charge of her own life instead of relying on men to rescue her. The moments when she interacts with monsters are the most engaging, but unfortunately, these instances are limited in the book.",
            "The writing is beautiful but overly descriptive, often relying on repetitive phrases and overused words like \"nectar,\" \"ambrosia,\" and \"immortality.\" Additionally, there is excessive filler, such as detailed descriptions of smoothing skirts and arranging dresses, which detracts from the pacing. At nearly 400 pages, the book feels lengthy, with a slow pace that struggles to maintain consistent interest.",

        "conclusion": "While *Hera* is beautifully written and offers some interesting insights into the gods, it suffers from an overly descriptive and repetitive style, uneven pacing, and a lack of reimagining in its storytelling. Hera’s characterization as bitter and unlikable, combined with the disproportionate focus on her internal angst, detracts from the more exciting mythological events. The book could have been significantly shorter and more engaging. However, the audiobook narration and the reference chart were highlights.",

For example, 10 years of war are covered in just a few pages.  \n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n   - Hera is portrayed as a bitter, jealous woman, which made her unlikable.

Her dislike or disinterest in everything and everyone, including other women, felt unpleasant and left me disconnected from her character.  \n   - I wasn’t sure if the author intentionally wanted readers to dislike Hera during this portion of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Growth:**  \n   - The last 25% of the book beautifully explored Hera’s complexities, relationships, and ultimate growth, which I absolutely loved.  \n\n- **Feminist Angle and Themes:**  \n   - It was odd to read a Greek mythological retelling with a feminist angle through the eyes of a female protagonist who seemingly detested other women. This contradiction made the feminist theme feel inconsistent.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n   - I loved the side characters, especially Hephaestus and Athena. The unique angles taken on their stories were really interesting and added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Mythological Integration and World-Building:**  \n   - The book did an excellent job of weaving together many popular Greek mythologies and capturing the vanity and fickleness of the gods, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  \n   - The vast timescale over which the story was set added richness to the world-building.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Specific):**  \n   - The narrator’s voice was easy to listen to and kept me engaged throughout the story.  \n   - However, the pronunciation of many mythological names was peculiar, almost as if the narrator was trying to put her own spin on them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a good book that I would recommend to specific readers, particularly those interested in Greek mythology and feminist retellings. While I struggled with Hera’s character for much of the story, her growth in the final portion and the strong side characters made the experience worthwhile.

Having previously read *Atalanta* by Jennifer Saint, I knew I appreciated her writing style.  \n\n- **Scope and Pacing:**  \n  The novel attempts to cover the vast scope of Hera’s existence as an immortal goddess, which feels overwhelming at times.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Understanding Greek Mythology:**  \n   - I’ve always struggled to understand the chronology and nuance of Greek mythology, but this work helped me connect the dots.  \n   - The novel affirmed the value that mythology, among other classics, still carries today.  \n\n- **Themes and Reflections:**  \n   - The author offers intriguing reflections on womanhood, trauma, faith, marriage as an asymmetric institution, and the formative influences we take for granted.  \n   - Quotes like *“Desperation to flee another attack might have compelled her to shed her warm, vital shape and assume one that is unyielding and impenetrable instead” (p. 125)* and *“She wonders where they see her — in rebellious wives, she hopes, in the iron souls of powerful queens, in resilient girls who find the strength to keep going” (p. 385)* highlight the exploration of resilience and identity.  \n   - The novel also critiques societal structures, as seen in *“What are men, but creations of Zeus that never should have existed?” (p. 291)* and *“Their lives only matter for the glory they bring a hero; their ignominious deaths collected as proof of his power” (p. 302).*  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n   - The build-up felt slow at times, but the conclusion positively caught me off-guard.  \n\n- **Relevance to Modern Times:**  \n   - The novel demonstrates how old stories can be brought to life to make the audience reflect on the present day, as noted in *“Old stories can be brought to life to make the audience reflect on the present day” (p. 382).*  \n   - It also questions the necessity of gods, as seen in *“She isn’t sure now that they need the actual gods at all — only the versions of them they construct for themselves” (p. 383).*  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel provided me with a deeper understanding of Greek mythology while offering thought-provoking reflections on themes like womanhood, trauma, and societal structures. Despite some pacing issues, the impactful conclusion and its relevance to modern times made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n7/10"

However, the audiobook format did not enhance my experience, and I believe it might have been better had I read the book with my eyes.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  Unfortunately, *Hera* is not a story I enjoyed. At all. It was not an easy listen, and the overall tone and content did not appeal to me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the narrator's performance was commendable, the story's themes and tone did not align with my preferences, making it a disappointing experience overall.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The exploration of her emotional state is limited, leaving her feelings largely unexamined. Written in the third person, the story feels distant, hindering a personal connection with Hera.

It remains a good read, though not the author's finest work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

            "Zeus is portrayed as a serial rapist, manipulator, and adulterer who revels in exerting power over women. He deceives and forces himself on various figures, including his sisters Demeter and Hera, as well as Metis, who raised and advised him. His marriage to Hera serves as a means of domination, despite her longing for freedom and equality. Zeus's abhorrent behavior ultimately leads to his isolation, as he fails to adapt to a new era where gods rely on human worship.\n\nHera emerges as a complex character, filled with contradictions and not entirely sympathetic. She endures significant violence and humiliation at Zeus's hands, which fuels her anger, resentment, and desire for revenge. While her suffering is understandable, she often misdirects her fury towards Zeus's lovers and illegitimate children. Hera's maternal instincts are flawed; she manipulates her own children, like Hephaestus, and neglects them when they do not serve her interests. Despite her pain, Hera clings to her power, driven by a desire for the authority she believes is her birthright as Cronus's daughter.",

However, the latter half, which centers on Heracles, becomes predictable and less engaging, particularly for those well-versed in Greek mythology. The conclusion, where Hera cuts ties with Zeus and seeks peace, feels abrupt and unsatisfying, lacking the catharsis one would expect from her long-held desire for vengeance.",
            "Hera is a multifaceted character who begins as a warrior aiding the Olympians in their conquest of the Titans but later devolves into a vengeful figure shaped by Zeus's betrayal. The book delves into her transformation from a powerful goddess to a victim of abuse, illuminating her internal struggles and the origins of her notorious reputation. Hera's tendency to blame others and lash out at Zeus's other victims stems from her inability to confront her abuser directly, adding complexity to her character while also rendering her actions repugnant.",

While the message that vengeance is futile and self-destructive is clear, its execution feels incomplete, leaving me wanting more. The concept of gods uniting against humans as a common enemy is introduced but not fully developed, resulting in a resolution that feels somewhat disjointed."

However, the latter part of the book, focusing on well-known myths, feels less engaging and predictable. The ending, while attempting to convey a message about the futility of vengeance, falls short of providing the catharsis and satisfaction I hoped for. Despite these shortcomings, the author's writing remains beautiful and thought-provoking, making the book a worthwhile read for fans of mythological retellings.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**\n   - Hera is portrayed as a complex character, starting as a warrior who helped the Olympians conquer the Titans, but later descending into a vengeful and cruel figure due to Zeus's actions.\n   - The book explores Hera's transformation from a powerful goddess to a victim of Zeus's abuse, highlighting her internal conflict and the reasons behind her infamous reputation.\n   - Hera's victim-blaming and lashing out at Zeus's other victims are depicted as a result of her inability to directly confront her abuser, which adds depth to her character but also makes her actions repulsive.\n\n- **Plot Development:**\n   - The first part of the book is engaging, offering a fresh perspective on Hera's backstory and her initial strength and power.\n   - The latter half of the book, focusing on Heracles’ story, feels predictable and less compelling, especially for readers familiar with Greek mythology.\n   - The ending, where Hera severs her connection to Zeus and finds some form of peace, feels unsatisfying and abrupt, lacking the catharsis expected from her long-standing desire for vengeance.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**\n   - The book delves into themes of abuse, victimhood, and the cyclical nature of vengeance, showing how Hera's actions against Zeus's victims ultimately lead to her own downfall.\n   - The message that vengeance is futile and self-destructive is clear, but the execution of this theme in the story feels incomplete and leaves the reader wanting more.\n   - The idea of gods uniting against humans as a common enemy is introduced but not fully explored, leaving the resolution feeling somewhat disjointed.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - Jennifer Saint's writing is praised for its beauty and ability to convey complex emotions and thoughts, particularly in the portrayal of women's perspectives.\n   - The book contains many memorable quotes and showcases Saint's talent for imbuing mythological retellings with depth and nuance.\n\n- **Reader Expectations:**\n   - The reader expected a more innovative retelling of Hera's story, with a different ending or a deeper exploration of her motives.\n   - The disappointment stems from the book's adherence to traditional mythological outcomes, which felt predictable and less satisfying compared to Saint's previous works.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the book offers a compelling and fresh take on Hera's character, particularly in the first half, where her backstory and transformation are explored in depth. However, the latter part of the book, focusing on well-known myths, feels less engaging and predictable. The ending, while attempting to convey a message about the futility of vengeance, falls short of providing the catharsis and satisfaction the reader hoped for. Despite these shortcomings, Jennifer Saint's writing remains beautiful and thought-provoking, making the book a worthwhile read for fans of mythological retellings.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Characterization: 8/10\n- Plot Development: 6/10\n- Themes and Messages: 7/10\n- Writing Style: 9/10\n- Overall Satisfaction: 7/10"

            "The decision to make an Olympian the protagonist is a bold one, but it ultimately falls flat. The absence of mortal threats, such as death, diminishes tension, while the predictability of divine intervention undermines the plot. Typhon's death feels more like a plot device than a significant event. Additionally, the abrupt ending—marked by the dissolution of Olympus and Zeus’s transformation—lacks the emotional depth found in similar narratives, such as \"Circe.\"",
            "The portrayal of Hera as a powerful yet submissive figure is intriguing, but the execution is lacking. Her divinity is not convincingly established; instead, she is burdened with mortal concerns like headaches, drunkenness, and birth pains without sufficient explanation, which undermines her godly essence. Hera's lack of agency, foresight, and insight renders her weak and two-dimensional compared to other immortals. Her surprise at her own powers and her prayers to Gaia and Rhea further diminish her divine stature. Additionally, attributing divine parthenogenesis to Gaia rather than Hera feels inconsistent with her supposed power.",
            "The novel struggles with its integration of myths, often relying on clumsy exposition. The early chapters resemble a high-school summary of the Theogony. Revisiting characters from the author's previous works, such as Dionysus and Atalanta, fails to provide fresh depth or insight, coming across as uninspired. Additionally, the prologue feels repetitive and tacked on, marred by overuse of phrases like \"gold-stained.\"",
            "The novel struggles to convey the otherworldly, four-dimensional essence of Greek gods, a quality masterfully depicted in works like Madeline Miller’s. Only Gaia and Echidna evoke a sense of true divinity, while the rest of the pantheon feels flat and underdeveloped. Additionally, the predictability of Hera’s narrative, given her omnipresence in Greek mythology, diminishes the opportunity for empathy.",
            "The exploration of Hera's abuse and subjugation is compelling, yet her lack of agency and divine portrayal diminishes its impact. While the novel aims to resonate with themes of rebellion and resilience, it ultimately fails to evoke a genuine emotional connection. The depiction of Zeus as a manipulative and abusive spouse is well-executed, but a trigger warning would be advisable for sensitive readers."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the novel’s premise of exploring Hera’s story as a powerful yet subjugated figure is intriguing, its execution falls short in multiple areas. The portrayal of Hera’s divinity is inconsistent, the world-building lacks depth, and the narrative choices often feel predictable or underdeveloped. The writing style, while occasionally engaging, suffers from exposition-heavy passages and repetitive phrasing.

They present the Olympians from various perspectives, intertwining their narratives with their identities. The writing is straightforward yet eloquent, demystifying characters while preserving their allure. Symbolism is seamlessly woven into Hera’s story, rendering her choices both authentic and inevitable. Hera is portrayed as vengeful and sullen, yet complex and layered. She embodies the struggles of women in marriage, depicting it as a cage. Despite being the most powerful goddess, she is reduced to Zeus’ plaything, underscoring the systemic oppression of women. Her narrative is poignant, delving into themes of helplessness, rage, and family.",

Although the ending is beautifully written, it feels unsatisfying, as if the author shifted direction mid-narrative, resulting in a disjointed plot. The absence of a triumphant moment for Hera, despite the buildup, made the book difficult to finish and diminished my overall enjoyment.",

I appreciated the narrative's focus on Hera's perspective, which deepens our understanding of her emotions and the injustices she endured. Hera emerges as a morally complex character; her anger and resentment are justified, yet her questionable decisions and unfair actions illustrate how betrayal can transform someone into an abuser.",

A first-person perspective might have provided deeper insight into her thoughts and emotions.\n   - There is a sense of \"telling instead of showing,\" which detracts from the emotional engagement with Hera's character.\n\n- **Scope and Ambition:**\n   - The novel covers an extensive time span, from the overthrow of the Titans to Zeus' demise, which feels overly ambitious.\n   - The inclusion of too many myths leads to redundancy and a sense of slogging through the narrative.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**\n   - While the novel falls flat compared to Saint's other feminist retellings like *Ariadne* and *Elektra*, it still offers a unique and valuable perspective on Hera.\n   - Despite its shortcomings, the book reinforces the reader's appreciation for Saint's writing and leaves them eager to read *Atalanta*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel provides a nuanced and satisfying exploration of Hera's character, offering a deeper understanding of her motivations and legacy. However, the third-person POV and the ambitious scope of the narrative hinder emotional connection and pacing. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of Saint's other works, it remains a worthwhile read for fans of feminist retellings of Greek mythology.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- **ROSE 🌹:** 4/5 (Fleshed-out Hera, satisfying ending)\n- **THORN 🗡️:** 2/5 (Third-person POV, overly ambitious time span)\n- **BUD 🌷:** 3/5 (Interest in reading *Atalanta*)"

            "The book opens promisingly with pre-Mt. Olympus exploration and Hera's belief in shared power among the gods. However, the plot quickly becomes repetitive as Hera's schemes are consistently thwarted. The absence of fresh twists renders the story predictable and less engaging. Additionally, the theme of Hera's thoughtless anger and her failure to learn from her mistakes overshadows any potential for resilience or depth.",
            "Hera's lack of growth throughout the book is disappointing. She remains largely unlikable, consumed by anger and focused on punishing young women rather than achieving meaningful victories against Zeus. Her portrayal as perpetually thwarted and vindictive, without any small wins or moments of empathy, makes her character feel frustrating and repetitive. The absence of development in her relationships—such as care for her children or sympathy for mortal women—further diminishes her complexity. Other characters, aside from Hestia and Demeter, also lack depth and appeal. Hera's children are reduced to mere tools in her revenge schemes, devoid of meaningful development or emotional connection.",

            "Hera is a captivating goddess, yet she is frequently depicted as the jealous wife punishing her husband's lovers. I appreciated the effort to present her in a more nuanced, forgiving light, revealing her motivations and emotions without feeling forced. However, this softer portrayal sometimes undermined her power, making her actions appear more like a child's tantrum than those of a formidable goddess. While I empathized with her jealousy and vindictiveness, they often felt misplaced and overly childish in this retelling. I particularly enjoyed the ending, where Hera reflects on her actions and motivations, which felt both clever and natural.

            "This novel presents a compelling feminist perspective on Hera, highlighting her anger and frustration following the Titanomachy and her ongoing struggle against Zeus, a representation of patriarchy. Hera's bitterness is both justified and adds depth to her character. The author effectively portrays her sympathy for monsters, enriching her mythology. However, Zeus comes across as a one-dimensional antagonist, lacking depth, while other gods, like Hermes, are underutilized. Notably, there is no interaction between Hera and Hermes, even during pivotal moments such as Hermes' slaying of Argus. This oversight misses the opportunity to explore potential alliances or strategic dynamics between Hera and other gods, particularly in relation to Hermes' ambitions.",

While the ending is emotionally resonant, the book’s focus on Hera’s helplessness and the lack of positive marital depictions may leave some readers wanting more.",

However, her character development—marked by pain, struggles, and a gradual recognition of her limitations—proves compelling and authentic. The contrast between her divine existence and human life effectively highlights themes of loneliness, abuse, and aimlessness.",

While it touches on various myths, it fails to explore them in depth, leaving the story feeling shallow. At times, I was tempted to stop reading due to the pacing and structure, which struggled to maintain my interest. However, the concept of gods fading from memory yet continuing to exist within humans was beautifully executed and stood out as a highlight of the book.",

Unfortunately, it portrays her as less powerful than other female deities, which is disappointing. The narrative fails to capture Hera's vengeful and formidable nature as depicted in mythology. Her attempts to spite Zeus come across as weak and unconvincing. I wanted to see Hera truly embody her mythic strength and vengefulness, but she never quite does.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narration and Audio Quality:**  \n   - The narration of the audiobook was distracting due to the mispronunciation of many gods' names throughout the book. This made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the story.  \n\n- **Characterization and Retelling:**  \n   - Hera, traditionally portrayed as a jealous wife and wicked stepmother, is reimagined as a powerful, compassionate, and strategic queen. This fresh take on her character was compelling and made me empathize with her.  \n   - The book explores Hera's internal conflict as she questions her role alongside Zeus and whether assuming power means perpetuating a cycle of violence or forging a better world.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author's Previous Work:**  \n   - I enjoyed this book more than Jennifer Saint's previous work, *Ariadne*. The focus on Hera, a character rarely explored in depth, was refreshing and engaging.  \n\n- **Appeal to Greek Mythology Enthusiasts:**  \n   - As someone deeply passionate about Greek mythology, I appreciated the unique perspective on Hera. However, the mispronunciations in the audiobook were a significant drawback.  \n   - For readers who enjoy Greek mythology but aren't overly obsessed with it, this book is likely to be an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Hera* by Jennifer Saint offers a captivating and empathetic retelling of a traditionally misunderstood goddess. While the audiobook's narration was frustrating due to frequent mispronunciations, the story itself was a standout, particularly for its fresh take on Hera's character. Fans of Greek mythology, especially those looking for a new perspective on familiar tales, will likely find this book rewarding.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The author aims for a stark depiction of Zeus's betrayals, but the inconsistent treatment of the incest theme detracts from this goal. The narrative attempts to justify or downplay the incest early on, which conflicts with the later focus on Hera's suffering.",

However, the portrayal of incest is inconsistent; while Hera grapples with its implications, characters like Zeus and Demeter dismiss it, making Hera appear self-important and whiny. The story is undeniably dark and contains several triggers that readers should be mindful of.",

Her storytelling makes complex myths engaging, and I was excited to see what new insights she would bring to this novel.  \n\n- **Mythological Content and Depth:**  \n  The exploration of monsters like Typhon, Ekhidna, and their children, as well as their battle against Zeus, was especially fascinating. I appreciated learning new aspects of the myths, even though I was already quite familiar with Greek mythology.  \n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n  Hera’s internal musings, particularly during moments where she smites mortals and Zeus’ lovers, were compelling and drew me into her character.

I did not care for her complaining and vindictiveness at all. I understand her female rage and the disgust and disappointment she felt, but she held onto every single grudge the entire book, and I really didn’t like her by the end.  \n   - Hera reminded me of Nesta from *ACOTAR*.

Through Hera's perspective, it intertwines various Greek myths, revealing her thoughts, experiences, and decisions that influence those around her. While it serves as a solid refresher on Greek mythology, it lacks new or subversive insights compared to the original tales.",
            "Hera's voice is distinct, powerfully expressing her rage and self-righteousness. While the book centers on feminine anger, it falls short of exploring feminist themes in depth.

I wished for her to embody solidarity among women, yet her quest for revenge against Zeus led her to commit terrible acts against other women without remorse, leaving me conflicted. Zeus, on the other hand, is a truly despicable character—a serial predator whose actions are consistently reprehensible. I found myself longing for his downfall throughout the story.

Her tendency to blame Zeus for her actions diminishes her character. I would have preferred a version of Hera who fully embraces her vengeful nature and takes ownership of her anger toward Zeus's lovers. While she is just as flawed and toxic as Zeus, the narrative frames her actions as merely a response to his influence, which feels reductive. Women can be just as problematic as men, and Hera's character would have been more compelling if she were allowed to be unapologetically flawed.",

While I was intrigued by the author's attempt to portray Hera as a heroine, I don't believe it succeeded. Traditionally depicted as jealous of Zeus's lovers and their offspring, the novel's portrayal of her as a vengeful, power-hungry goddess aiming to overthrow a dictatorial Zeus was refreshing. However, her constant failures made her character frustrating to follow.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development (Hera and the Gods):**  \n  I really disliked Hera as the main character, and I pretty much disliked all the gods. I was curious how the author would make Hera a heroine, but if that was the goal, I don’t think it was achieved. Hera has traditionally been portrayed as jealous of Zeus's lovers and their children, so the novel's perspective of her as a vengeful, power-hungry goddess seeking to overthrow a dictatorial Zeus was invigorating. However, her every effort was thwarted, which made her character frustrating to follow.  \n\n- **Moral and Ethical Themes:**  \n  The gods in this story have no loyalty, no sense of right or wrong, and no compassion or empathy. Everything and everyone is a pawn to be manipulated for power. This portrayal highlights the irony of Greek mythology, where the gods are far from benevolent and instead reflect the darker aspects of human nature.  \n\n- **Exploration of Greek Mythology:**  \n  I still love Greek mythology, as it reveals more about the human condition. The Olympian gods serve as examples of what happens when the powerful go unchecked. The story illustrates how a group of like-minded individuals can band together for a cause, only to self-destruct as their egos grow and jealousy takes over.  \n\n- **Engagement and Entertainment Value:**  \n  Despite my issues with the characters, the drama and power struggles among the gods were compelling. The story captures the kind of drama that makes Greek mythology so fascinating—similar to the kind of drama you’d see in a season of *Real Housewives*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the fresh take on Hera and the exploration of power dynamics among the gods, I found it hard to connect with the characters due to their lack of redeeming qualities. The novel effectively highlights the darker aspects of Greek mythology and human nature, but the unlikable characters made it difficult for me to fully enjoy the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

This atmospheric imagery and vibe persist throughout the book, showcasing Saint's skill in crafting a rich setting.  \n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n  Hera is portrayed as an elusive and complex character, consistent with her depiction in ancient texts.

The pacing, particularly in the beginning, is slow, which may not appeal to all readers.  \n\n- **Ending and Fidelity to Source Material:**  \n  The ending is satisfying, as Saint balances the complexities of the changing world and the gods' roles within it.

This lack of engagement made it difficult to invest in the story. However, in the final sections, the author successfully elevated the book by providing Hera with a unique and compelling character arc, which ultimately redeemed the narrative. Writing about immortal gods poses a challenge, as they don't age or change like mortals. The author struggled with this in the first half, resulting in unclear character development for Hera. Yet, by the end, she overcame this hurdle, giving Hera a meaningful evolution that added depth to the story.",

While the narrative is engaging and Hera's journey is unforgettable, the emotional connection with the characters could be stronger, and the portrayal of Hera as a relatable protagonist could be improved. The audiobook narration also fell short in bringing the story to life.

I feel like it didn't add much to what we already knew about Hera. It gave us a little more of a backstory and humanized her a bit, but she spends most of this novel just being the bitter and spiteful queen we've always heard about. I wanted to feel more pity for her in this story, but I just didn't. Her anger had always seemed misguided as to whom she takes it out on, and it didn't differ in this story.  \n\n- **Writing Quality and Immersion:**  \n  The writing was well done, and I was able to picture myself there with the characters. I did like that aspect of it.  \n\n- **Suitability for Mythology Enthusiasts:**  \n  For people who just want to learn a bit about mythology, this would be a good one for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel offers a well-written and immersive retelling of Greek myths, it falls short in deepening the characterization of Hera, leaving her as the familiar bitter and spiteful queen without evoking much pity or new insight. It is, however, a suitable read for those looking to explore mythology.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

However, Jennifer Saint’s portrayal of Hera from her own perspective transformed my understanding of her. Saint humanizes Hera, making her actions understandable and even relatable.  \n\n- **Hera’s Motivations and Struggles:**  \n  Hera’s story is one of betrayal and ambition. She believed that by helping Zeus conquer the Titans, she would gain the power and recognition she deserved. Instead, she is forced into a marriage with Zeus and confined to the roles of goddess of marriage, women, and childbirth. Her frustration and anger stem from Zeus’s infidelity, which mocks her role and their marriage.  \n\n- **Hera’s Relationships:**  \n  Despite her resentment toward Zeus, Hera demonstrates deep love for her children, particularly Typhon. Her actions, such as birthing children in hopes of overthrowing Zeus, reveal her complex emotions and her desire for justice and power.  \n\n- **Narrative and Writing Style:**  \n  While this wasn’t my favorite of Jennifer Saint’s books, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Saint’s ability to reframe misunderstood characters and make their stories compelling is evident here. The book provided me with a fresh perspective on Hera, which will influence how I view her in future readings of Greek mythology or related works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJennifer Saint’s *Hera* offers a nuanced and empathetic portrayal of a traditionally misunderstood goddess. By exploring Hera’s motivations, struggles, and relationships, the book provides a fresh perspective that challenges preconceived notions about her character. While not my favorite of Saint’s works, it is a thought-provoking and enjoyable read that deepens my appreciation for Hera’s story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It spans the entire history of Hera, from the rise of Olympus to Heracles to the fall of Olympus. As a result, many plot points were glossed over, with only a few pages barely scratching the surface, giving it a Sparknotes-like feel.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - Parts of the book felt very detached and emotionless. The clinical writing style made it hard to invest in Hera’s journey at times.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I really enjoyed the ending, which was my favorite part of the book. It finally provided some much-needed character development for Hera.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was an interesting read but fell short of my expectations for Greek retellings. While it was well-written, its literal interpretation of the myths, overly broad scope, and lack of emotional depth made it less engaging than I had hoped. The ending, however, stood out as a highlight.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

She accepted her circumstances but resented them, pouting without ever taking action to create change. There was no character arc or growth in her nature throughout the story.  \n\n- **Empathy and Morality:**  \n  Hera lacked empathy for others. For instance, rather than saving a female victim, she allowed Pelias to rape and kill his wife at the foot of her altar so she could take her time punishing him slowly. This made her actions feel morally questionable and unsympathetic.  \n\n- **Narrative Focus and Theme:**  \n  The book provides a broad view and timeline of the history of the Greek gods, but it feels misaligned with its title. It would be more accurate to call it *The Rise and Fall of Olympus* rather than *Hera*, as it doesn’t delve deeply into her personal journey or offer any meaningful lessons.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I typically enjoy re-tellings of Greek mythology, especially those with a feminine perspective, such as Saint’s *Ariadne* and *Atalanta*.

            "I felt a deep empathy for Hera and her sense of powerlessness. Forced into an unwanted marriage and role, she was under the control of a tyrant who acted without regard for her feelings. It’s understandable that she sought to punish the women Zeus pursued, as she felt powerless to confront him directly. Traditionally depicted as jealous and vengeful, this version of her story sheds light on the reasons behind her anger. With no control over her own life, Hera sought agency in the only ways available to her.",
            "I find it distressing that we have not progressed much since ancient Greek times. Men often act with impunity, while women bear the burden of accountability for both their own actions and those of men. How often do we hear questions like, \"What were you wearing?\" or \"Were you drinking?\" It's no surprise that sexual assault remains underreported when women fear they won't be believed. We should take lessons from Hera's story, striving to uplift and support one another rather than tearing each other down. Unity is essential, and we must hold men accountable for their actions."

She was forced into a marriage and a role that she did not want and had no say in the matter.  \n   - Hera was under the control of a tyrant who wanted to do as he pleased.  \n   - I understand why she chose to go after the women Zeus pursued and punished them; she couldn't punish him for his behavior.  \n   - Hera has always been painted as a jealous, vengeful, cruel character, but after reading this version of her story, is it any wonder that she was angry? She had literally no control over anything that happened in her life, so she went looking for it in the only places she could.  \n\n- **Moral and Ethical Dilemmas:**  \n   - Hera was justified in her anger and rage, but I don’t agree with her methods.  \n   - The person who should be held responsible in all of this is Zeus, but because he was a man and a king, he is not.  \n\n- **Social Commentary and Relevance:**  \n   - I found it distressing that we have not evolved much from the times of the ancient Greeks. Men are, for the most part, allowed to do what they please and are not held accountable for any of it.  \n   - Women are the ones who are responsible for not only their own behavior but that of men as well.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Thematic Depth and Representation of Greek Mythology:**  \n   - The book effectively portrays the deeply misogynistic nature of Greek mythology and the Olympian world, highlighting how power is divided among men/gods while women are left to grapple with its absence.  \n   - It provides a comprehensive overview of Greek mythology, including its major events, which I found informative and engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development (Hera):**  \n   - Hera's character lacks progression throughout the story, which made it difficult for me to connect with her.  \n   - Her challenges feel repetitive, and her responses, particularly her misdirected rage toward Zeus's actions, are hard to empathize with.  \n   - I wished the book delved deeper into the psychology behind Hera's choices, offering a more nuanced reinterpretation of her story.  \n\n- **Storytelling and World-Building:**  \n   - While the book is a relatively fun read, the story-building feels weak.  \n   - The language and world-building were slightly underwhelming, leaving room for improvement in creating a more immersive experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book succeeds in shedding light on the misogynistic underpinnings of Greek mythology and provides a thorough exploration of its major events. However, it falls short in character development, particularly with Hera, and lacks depth in storytelling and world-building. While enjoyable, it could have been more impactful with stronger psychological insights and a more vivid narrative style.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book was marketed as an empowering story for women, but it fell short of that promise. Instead, it primarily focuses on Zeus and the other male gods, particularly highlighting Zeus's acts of rape and infidelity. Hera's role is largely limited to pursuing the women Zeus seduces, which creates an uncomfortable dynamic of women pitted against each other. Although Hera eventually recognizes that her actions are unproductive, her realization comes across more as a personal reflection than a collective acknowledgment that Zeus is the real issue.",

However, I liked the references to myths that I knew about—I thought that part was fun.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The book was advertised as an empowering women story, but it wasn’t at all. It mostly revolves around Zeus (and the other male gods, but mostly Zeus) raping women and cheating on his wife. Hera doesn’t do much other than go after the women Zeus lures in, which felt like women being pitted against one another—something I found icky. While Hera does realize her actions aren’t productive, it’s more in a “that wasn’t helpful” way rather than a “us women are in this together, and Zeus is the problem” way.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending was disappointing. There was maybe a small glimmer of a lesson or philosophical takeaway, but it wasn’t much.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  I’m very glad to have finally finished it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some enjoyable references to mythology, it failed to deliver on its promise of being an empowering story for women.

While the formal writing style was initially challenging, it provided a welcome change of pace.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

In fact, I almost wish she had fully embraced her role as a powerful, unapologetic figure rather than trying to evoke sympathy for her struggles with Zeus.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the unique focus on a goddess in this Greek retelling, *Hera* didn’t fully meet my expectations. The attempt to humanize Hera felt unconvincing, and I would have preferred a more unapologetic portrayal of her character.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, her anger often feels unjustified, driven more by spite and wrath than by clear reasoning. Despite this, the novel gives Hera a voice she has never truly had before, presenting her as more than just the jealous Queen of the Heavens. She emerges as a complicated and relatable character, especially for many women.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I enjoy Jennifer Saint’s writing style, but at times, the plot feels overwhelming. The narrative can be dense, which detracts from the overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Appeal to Fans of Classical Retellings:**  \n  The novel is enjoyable for those who love classical retellings, as it offers a fresh perspective on Hera’s story. However, it didn’t fully meet my expectations and isn’t my favorite read in this genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel provides a unique and relatable portrayal of Hera, her anger often feels unjustified, and the plot can be overwhelming at times. It’s a decent read for fans of classical retellings but falls short of being a standout favorite.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5⭐️"

Overall, it felt like a chore to finish.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI was excited to read this novel but ultimately found it disappointing. The unlikable portrayal of Hera, lack of engagement, and underwhelming ending made it a letdown compared to other Greek myth retellings I’ve enjoyed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I wasn't sure if I would like the story of Hers as she never intrigued me as a goddess. Her character felt limited, primarily defined by her anger at her fate and her inability to change it. She spends much of the narrative passively observing Zeus's conquests, which made it hard for me to connect with her journey.\n\n- **Plot Engagement:**  \n  The story was challenging to enjoy because it revolved heavily around Hers's frustration and her lack of agency. The repetitive nature of her watching Zeus's actions without significant progression made the plot feel stagnant at times.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending provided a sense of redemption for Hers, as she achieved a small victory over Zeus. Additionally, it offered a glimpse into the fate of the gods as the world evolved, which added a layer of closure and intrigue to the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story of Hers had its shortcomings, particularly in character development and plot engagement, the ending brought a satisfying resolution and a broader perspective on the gods' legacy. It left me with a sense of closure, even if the journey to get there was uneven.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It offers a unique angle and breaks away from the repetitive retelling of familiar tales.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book doesn’t fully deliver on its promise of presenting Hera’s perspective, it still holds value for fans of Greek mythology.

I wished for a deeper exploration of Hera's thoughts and desires, as they often seemed conflicting. The ending, particularly her relationship with Zeus, felt abrupt and left much to be desired. There was a missed opportunity to showcase her growth as a protector of women; I would have loved to see her embody her power by helping others and addressing their pain. Given her traumatic experiences in marriage, it would have been impactful for her to empower women and challenge cycles of abuse. Instead, she remained distant from both mortal and divine women. I do enjoy the increasing number of stories told from women's perspectives in Greek mythology, and while Hera's viewpoint was intriguing, a first-person narrative would have made her character more relatable and engaging. The third-person perspective created a barrier, making it hard to connect with Hera's thoughts and feelings.",

The highlight for me was her interactions with Ekhidna, which were particularly engaging. I appreciated her gentle friendship with Hestia and the complexity of her relationship with Athena. However, I remain uncertain about whether Hera truly found peace and where she ultimately settled. She seemed out of place in the mortal world, having shown little interest in it until the very end, and her time in Olympus didn't appear to bring her joy either.",

The book attempts to provide insight into Hera’s character but falls short of the depth and focus I was hoping for. Nonetheless, it’s a worthwhile addition to the genre, especially for those who appreciate mythological retellings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Although there were hints of her power—other gods feared her—she never truly demonstrated it.",

Despite being the goddess of marriage, she blamed the women he cheated with rather than holding Zeus accountable.  \n   - Her “revenge” on Zeus came across as petty and weak, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Pacing and Depth of the Story:**  \n   - The book tried to cover too many big stories, which made it feel like we only glossed over each one.  \n   - This lack of depth made the story feel uneventful, with no truly impactful moments.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Book:**  \n   - The beginning was strong and interesting, showing Hera as a warrior before Zeus took control. It gave a glimpse of who she could have been.  \n   - The ending was unique and offered an interesting take that I haven’t seen in other books.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The middle of the book didn’t hold up as well as the beginning and end. While there were some good parts, they weren’t enough to make the book as strong as Jennifer Saint’s other works.  \n   - The book made me work to like Hera and tried to evoke sympathy for her, but it didn’t fully succeed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong start and an intriguing ending, the middle felt flat and lacked depth.

            "My favorite parts of the story were the early sections featuring the victorious children of Cronus after the Titanomachy. However, the pacing faltered around the birth of Heracles, devolving into a series of myths centered on Hera. Key events, such as the quest for the Golden Fleece, felt rushed and could have benefited from more depth, particularly Hera’s scheme involving Athena, Aphrodite, and Medea. The segment on Troy was especially hurried and might have been better left out entirely.",
            "I anticipated a more nuanced exploration of Hera's character, diverging from her typical depiction in modern media. The author delves into lesser-known aspects of her mythology, such as her upbringing by Oceanus and Tethys and her role as a caregiver to monsters, which was a refreshing surprise. However, I found the portrayal of Zeus assaulting Hera and coercing her into marriage problematic, as it lacks mythological basis and oversimplifies their complex relationship. Additionally, the decision to have Hera grudgingly accept Heracles rather than embrace him as a son missed an opportunity to showcase her more gracious side. I appreciated the scenes featuring other gods, particularly Athena and Demeter, despite the latter's minor role. It seemed the author selectively portrayed certain gods negatively, like Poseidon, while being more lenient with others, such as Athena, who is depicted rejecting Hephaestus despite his attempted violation in myth.",

            "The storytelling felt impersonal and rushed, presenting Hera's mythology in a rapid-fire, fact-based manner. The narrative lacked emotional depth and failed to integrate the mythological elements into a compelling story. Its repetitive structure—Hera attempted this, it failed; then she tried that, and it also failed—made it difficult to connect with the characters or the plot. While I appreciated the ending, which offered a satisfying conclusion to Hera's story, it would have been more impactful if I had been given the opportunity to connect with her character earlier in the book.",
            "The characterization of Hera in the story felt lacking. She came across as a vindictive and unlikable goddess, devoid of nuance and depth. While Hera is a strong figure who has endured trauma, her portrayal resembled a caricature rather than a fully developed character. The narrative missed the chance to delve into her complexities, including her role as a protector of women, her relationship with Zeus, and the motivations behind her jealousy and desire for revenge.",
            "I struggled to connect emotionally with Hera and the other characters, which made them seem whiny and unrelatable. Although the gods and goddesses are inherently flawed, their shallow portrayal left me feeling indifferent and even annoyed, rather than engaged."

            "My main concerns with 'Hera' lie in its plot and pacing. The story begins with the fall of the Titans and the rise of the gods, culminating in the creation of Mount Olympus. However, much of the narrative revolves around Hera's complaints about Zeus, punctuated by only brief moments of action. At 400 pages, the book feels unnecessarily long, with about 75% dedicated to Hera's lamentations about injustice rather than her taking meaningful action. This repetitive cycle of failed coup attempts renders the story stagnant and ultimately drags it down.",
            "Hera is portrayed as a frustratingly helpless character, especially for a goddess. Despite frequently asserting her power is equal to Zeus's, she fails to demonstrate it. She feels out of place on Olympus, lacking meaningful connections and never taking steps to find where she truly belongs. Her animosity towards the other gods is mutual, raising the question of why she remains there. More internal dialogue about her feelings would have enriched her characterization. Instead, she comes across as someone who spends her time complaining and failing, yet still insists she is as strong as Zeus. Zeus himself is depicted as intolerable and monstrous; in a striking display of entitlement, he assumes leadership of the gods after their victory. His assault on Hera following her rejection of his marriage proposal is particularly unsettling.",
            "The writing is technically strong. I've read a few of her other books and thoroughly enjoyed them.",
            "While there was potential for a captivating retelling of Hera's story of abuse, it ultimately falls short and lacks depth. Hera is portrayed as too helpless to take meaningful action, rendering her a mere victim of circumstances. The narrative feels like a series of repetitive and frustrating failed plots against a once-powerful figure."

Hera’s passive and helpless portrayal is frustrating, and the story lacks the depth and action needed to make it engaging.

I have read a couple of her other books and loved them.  \n\n- **Plot and Story Flow:**  \n   - The plot and flow of the story were my main issues with ‘Hera’.  \n   - The book starts at the fall of the Titans and follows the establishment of the gods as rulers and the creation of Mount Olympus.  \n   - The plot is basically Hera complaining about Zeus with small moments of action, which makes the book drag out.  \n   - This already doesn’t need to be 400 pages; 75% of it has been Hera lamenting about the injustice with very little about her actually doing something.  \n\n- **Characterization of Hera:**  \n   - Hera is written as a helpless idiot, which is frustrating for a goddess.  \n   - She repeats often that she is as powerful as Zeus but does nothing to back it up.  \n   - Hera does not fit on Olympus; she has no real attachments and never takes action to find the place she does belong.  \n   - She hates all the other gods, and they all hate her, so why stay?  \n   - Even more internal dialogue about her feelings would have helped to characterize Hera better.  \n   - I didn’t feel any attachment to her because she just spent all her time complaining and failing but still saying she was just as strong as Zeus.  \n\n- **Characterization of Zeus:**  \n   - Zeus was intolerable and monstrous.  \n   - In a wild act of white man audacity, he assumes himself the leader of the gods after the victory.  \n   - He assaults Hera after she refuses his marriage proposal, which is deeply unsettling.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n   - There could have been a magical way to spin Hera’s story of abuse, but Saint’s retelling is ultimately a nothing-burger.  \n   - Hera is too helpless to take any real action but is a victim of all actions against her.  \n   - The story feels like a series of failed plots against Zeus, which become repetitive and frustrating.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The book drags out due to the lack of meaningful action and excessive lamenting.  \n   - The repetitive nature of Hera’s failed coup attempts makes the story feel stagnant.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the writing is technically strong, the plot, characterization, and pacing of ‘Hera’ fall short.

            "I found this portrayal of Hera as a main character unappealing. While the book attempts to present her as a Strong Female Character, it feels like a modern interpretation that misses the mark. Hera is depicted as a warrior with aspirations of rulership, yet her disdain for mortals is off-putting. I wished for her to show solidarity with women who have endured similar struggles. \n\nHer transformation following Zeus's sexual assault felt abrupt, and I was uncomfortable with the framing of this as her reclaiming power. It seemed as though sexual assault was used merely as a plot device for character development, which I find troubling. Hera's victim-blaming attitude was particularly disappointing; while she recognizes Zeus's power, she lacks empathy for other women affected by him, making her appear hypocritical due to her lack of self-reflection.\n\nAdditionally, Hera's relationships with other goddesses were underwhelming. She is only close to Hestia and displays hostility towards Demeter and Persephone. Her indifference to Persephone's suffering and her manipulative behavior towards Aphrodite were frustrating. Although her friendship with Echidna and her connection to Typhon's monster children were intriguing, her vendetta against Heracles felt contradictory, especially since her actions ultimately contributed to his fame.",
            "The book would have been more compelling if it had fully embraced Hera as a villain instead of attempting to portray her sympathetically. Her ongoing power struggles with Zeus painted both characters in a negative light, and exploring that dynamic more deeply would have added intrigue to the story."

The book made her a Strong Female Character, but it felt like a modern interpretation. She's a warrior and wants to be the ruler, but I didn't like her disdain for mortals. I wanted her to show solidarity with women, especially those who suffered similar fates.\n   - Hera's transformation after Zeus's sexual assault felt like a 180-degree turn, and I disliked how the book framed it as her taking her power back. It seemed like SA was used as a plot device for character growth, which I find problematic.\n   - Hera's victim-blaming attitude was disappointing. She acknowledges Zeus's power but shows no empathy for other women who suffer because of him. Her lack of self-reflection made her come off as hypocritical.\n\n- **Exploration of Immortality and Mortality:**\n   - I really liked the last 15% of the book, where the gods leave Olympus and fade away. It was a cool way to show the decline of worship and how mortals outgrew their need for the gods. The scenes where mortals create their own stories and no longer rely on gods for guidance were particularly compelling.\n\n- **Relationships Between Characters:**\n   - Hera's relationships with other goddesses were underwhelming. She is only close with Hestia and is hostile towards Demeter and Persephone. Her indifference to Persephone's plight and her manipulative behavior towards Aphrodite were frustrating.\n   - Hera's friendship with Echidna and her attachment to Typhon's monster children were interesting, but her vendetta against Heracles felt contradictory, especially since her actions led to his fame.\n\n- **Themes and Moral Ambiguity:**\n   - The book could have been more compelling if it fully embraced Hera as a villain rather than trying to make her sympathetic. Her constant power struggles with Zeus made them both seem horrible, and it would have been more interesting to lean into that dynamic.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**\n   - The British pronunciation of names in the audiobook was a bit jarring, especially with names like \"Metis,\" which sounded like \"lettuce.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the book was just fine. While the exploration of immortality and mortality in the final part was engaging, the characterization of Hera and her relationships with other characters left me disappointed. The book had a lot of potential but fell short of my expectations. Atalanta remains my favorite by this author, with Hera and Elektra tied at the bottom of my ranking.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Overall: Just fine (3/5)\n- Characterization of Hera: 2/5\n- Exploration of Immortality and Mortality: 4/5\n- Relationships Between Characters: 2.5/5\n- Themes and Moral Ambiguity: 3/5\n- Audiobook Narration: 3/5"

However, it fell short of my expectations. This book is very different from Saint’s other Greek mythological retellings, to the point where I’m not sure “retelling” is even the right word for it. While I understand that modern retellings require some creative license, too much was changed or reinterpreted here for my liking.\n\n- **Characterization and Character Arcs:**  \n  Most of the characters, including Hera, felt like completely different people from their mythological counterparts. Hera, in particular, is such a compelling character in mythology, but Saint’s version of her felt underdeveloped. Her arc was unsatisfying; her changes in views and behaviors over time weren’t always clear, and when they were, the reasons were told to us rather than shown. The character arcs overall felt like a downgrade compared to the source material.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  Saint’s plots have never been her main strength, and this book was no exception. The quick pacing kept me engaged, but by the end, I realized the story was more of a collection of vignettes strung together rather than a cohesive narrative. While I usually prioritize characters over plot, the lack of a strong plot became a glaring issue given the character-related problems.\n\n- **Entertainment Value and Future Expectations:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I’ll likely still pick up anything Saint publishes in the future because I can always count on her for entertainment value. However, I keep hoping for a truly exceptional book from her, and I thought this one might be it. Unfortunately, it wasn’t.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Jennifer Saint’s latest book had its moments of entertainment and kept me engaged with its pacing, it ultimately fell short of my expectations.

Her relationships, particularly with Zeus and Heracles, feel underwhelming and fail to convey her fierce, vengeful nature from the myths. The book misses key opportunities to explore her quest for power, such as birthing a rival heir to Athena or leading a coup against Zeus. Hephaestus is misrepresented as a weak character, stripping away the depth found in the original myths. Zeus is reduced to a one-dimensional villain, lacking any nuance. However, Hestia stands out as a rare bright spot; her inclusion and the dialogue between her and Hera provide some of the book's few engaging moments.",

Additionally, the magical universe of Olympus is not vividly portrayed, which prevents immersion in the setting."

Hera's backstory is glossed over, leaving her motivations ambiguous and at times contradictory, which diminishes the impact of her actions. This novel misses the chance to delve into the psyche of Hera, one of mythology's most iconic figures. Rather than portraying her as a powerful goddess, queen, warrior, and formidable adversary, the author reduces her to a mere victim, which is both disappointing and undermines her legacy.",
            "Hera is depicted as a figure of anger and power, yet her roles as wife and mother lack the glamour seen in goddesses like Athena, Demeter, or Artemis. The portrayal of Hera as a passive victim is particularly problematic; she often comes across as whiny and helpless, which undermines her strength and agency. Her feminist desire to transform Olympus into a home for goddesses feels unconvincing, as she insists her actions against Zeus's infidelities stem not from jealousy but from an inability to confront him directly. The climactic moment when she realizes her purpose—protecting the gods' rule on Olympus—occurs by chance, further diminishing her character arc. A more nuanced portrayal that embraces her vengeful and petty reputation would have been far more compelling.\n\nThe supporting cast of gods and mythological figures is largely one-dimensional. Ares is perpetually angry, Aphrodite is defined solely by her affair with Ares, Athena is overly analytical, Hestia is passive, Zeus is reduced to a caricature of horniness, Poseidon comes off as entitled, and Hades is notably absent. Although the gods gain slightly more personality by the end, they remain largely uninteresting and underdeveloped throughout most of the story.",

            "Hera's rage in the story is understandable, yet its portrayal is disappointing. Throughout the novel, she victim-blames the women abused by Zeus instead of confronting him, the true predator. This hypocrisy is only addressed once in the expansive narrative, and her actions are superficially justified. For instance, when asked why she isn't angry with Zeus, Hera's frustration surfaces, but she never truly confronts him. Hephaestus also questions her actions, pointing out her attacks on Leto, Semele, Heracles, Dionysus, and Io, which underscores her troubling treatment of Zeus's victims and their children. Hera's relationship with Hephaestus is particularly difficult to read. While Greek mythology has its complexities, the tenuous understanding they reach by the end fails to redeem her character.",

Sometimes the true power is in the shadows.\" This suggests a nuanced understanding of influence, where one can observe from the sidelines as others falter. However, the exploration of these themes remains superficial. Phrases like, \"Will she be the goddess of faithful wives to faithless husbands?\" and \"Even if she destroys herself in the process, she will never let him win,\" hint at a deeper examination of Hera's character and motivations, yet this potential is not fully realized.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - There was little to no character development for any of the main characters.\n   - Hera was portrayed as a terrible person throughout the entire story, with very few redeeming qualities.\n   - She attacked and destroyed women who had experienced the same rape and torture as her, instead of directing her anger at Zeus.\n   - Hera hated her children because they couldn’t help her bring down Zeus and tried to kill or ruin all of Zeus’s children birthed by other women.\n   - I never felt connected to Hera or the other characters.\n\n- **Pacing and Detail:**\n   - The storytelling felt rushed and lackluster, especially with the concept that time passes more quickly for the gods.\n   - One moment, a character was pregnant, and the next, her child was grown and making a name for themselves.\n   - The author seemed to use this time element as a way to avoid detailed descriptions and scene-building.\n   - The detail was very lacking throughout the book, making it feel like the author was just stating facts rather than creating immersive scenes.\n\n- **Character Introductions and Relevance:**\n   - The name-dropping was excessive and often confusing, with new characters introduced without explanation or preface.\n   - Some characters were mentioned once and never again, adding to the confusion.\n   - There was often no explanation for who someone was or how they were relevant to the story.\n\n- **Expectations and Overall Experience:**\n   - I went into the book with very high expectations, especially after being astounded by the author’s previous work, *Ariadne*.\n   - This book fell far short of those expectations, leaving me sad and disappointed.\n   - I struggled to get through the story and never felt engaged or connected to the characters.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a significant letdown compared to the author’s previous work. The lack of character development, rushed pacing, excessive name-dropping, and absence of detail made it difficult to connect with the story or its characters. Hera’s portrayal as a vengeful and unsympathetic figure further diminished my enjoyment. Overall, I found the experience disappointing and struggled to finish the book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book felt repetitive, particularly for those well-versed in Greek myths and their retellings. The final act (Part Four) was disjointed and struggled to provide a satisfying conclusion to the story.",
            "Hera's character comes across as flat and emotionally shallow, even in moments of anger or when confronting abuse. While her unlikable nature aligns with her mythological persona, the storytelling ultimately fails to make her emotionally engaging.",

It tackles heavy themes prevalent in Greek mythology, including rape and incest, while recapping major myths like the Trojan War and the tale of Jason and the Argonauts. Central to the narrative is Hera's reluctance to embrace her role as queen, highlighting how it was imposed upon her.",

I went into this book with little expectation.  \n\n- **Characterization and Themes:**  \n  - I started really liking the book because it recontextualized Hera’s anger and frustrations in a very human way. I felt for her as she raged against a patriarchal society, portraying her as a powerful woman trapped in a gilded cage with little effective power. Her struggles were particularly poignant after being torn down and assaulted by a trusted man in her life.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  - As the book progressed, it started to feel monotonous and constrained by the canon of mythology. Certain beats felt obligatory, while more interesting sections—which would have required more time and detail—were glossed over.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Exposition:**  \n  - The book seemed written for readers unfamiliar with Greek mythology, as it included many explanations and detours. While this made it accessible, it detracted from the overall flow and depth of the story.  \n\n- **Originality and Depth:**  \n  - In the later sections, the story didn’t add much new to the mythology.

However, I was sorely disappointed with this one. It wasn’t outright bad, but it didn’t meet my expectations.  \n\n- **Character Portrayal (Hera):**  \n   - I was most disappointed with how Hera was portrayed. In Greek mythology, Hera is a complex and enigmatic character—both a protector of women and a vengeful queen. In this retelling, she was reduced to a whiny victim of Zeus, constantly pining over her position as his wife. This portrayal felt reductive and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The book felt like a nearly 400-page slog. The pacing was slow, and I struggled to stay engaged. The only parts I found interesting were Hera’s conception and birth of Typhon, his rise against Mount Olympus, the retelling of Heracles and his 12 acts, and the very end of the book when Hera finally experiences some character growth. Unfortunately, this growth came too late to salvage the story for me.  \n\n- **Accuracy and Enjoyment of Myth Retellings:**  \n   - Despite my disappointment, I appreciate that the various storylines were accurate to Greek mythology. I generally enjoy fictional retellings of Greek myths, which is why I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book fell short of my expectations.

By the end of the book, my frustration peaked, as Zeus's relentless victories made me despise him even more.",

It was refreshing to see her finally getting to be the main character rather than a jealous villain.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  However, it was exhausting reading page after page of her constantly losing and becoming increasingly angry and bitter. By the end of the book, I hated Zeus so much because he kept winning, which made the story frustrating.  \n\n- **Pacing and Depth:**  \n  My biggest gripe with the story is that it felt like an overview of the greatest hits of Greek mythology, but from Hera's perspective. I found myself wishing we could stay in one place and really delve into specific events before moving on to the next myth.  \n\n- **Engagement with Mythology:**  \n  If you are a fan of Greek mythology, you will probably enjoy this book. My favorite part was the beginning, before Hera became Queen or Zeus' wife.  \n\n- **Author's Style and Future Works:**  \n  Regardless, I think I'll try more of Saint's books that center around specific myths (like *Ariadne*) rather than any she writes about the gods themselves in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the unique perspective of Hera as the protagonist, the book felt too broad and exhausting due to its rapid pacing and repetitive focus on her bitterness.

However, none of the characters, including Hera, felt particularly three-dimensional. Many of them struggled to even reach two dimensions.\n\n- **Sympathy for Hera:**\n   - The novel does attempt to cast Hera in a more sympathetic light, portraying her as a figure deserving of empathy.

The pacing was glacial, making it a struggle to stay engaged. I kept reading in hopes of a satisfying conclusion, but the ending felt rushed and almost hand-waved as the age of Olympus came to an end.\n\n- **Accessibility for Readers:**\n   - I’m not sure how accessible this book would be for someone with less than a middling knowledge of Greek mythology. The narrative assumes a certain level of familiarity with the myths, which might alienate readers who aren’t well-versed in the subject.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel attempts to give Hera a more sympathetic portrayal and explores her misery in depth, it falls short in terms of character development, pacing, and delivering a satisfying conclusion.

            "The book feels overly ambitious, attempting to weave together every myth involving Hera, which results in a disjointed narrative. Hera's character shifts dramatically—from a powerful goddess to an abused young woman, then a vengeful wife, and finally a loving mother—without sufficient explanation for these transformations.",
            "In this book, Hera often takes a backseat to Zeus, whose behavior drives the narrative. Hera's role feels more like an ineffective meddler than a central character. I would have preferred a story that portrayed Hera as Zeus' equal, showcasing their struggle against their father for power, rather than depicting her as a petty figure seeking minor revenge on Zeus' romantic interests.",
            "I continue to read these books because they are visually stunning, and the concept is one I should love. However, I struggle with the writing style, which prevents me from forming any emotional connection with the characters. Hera, in particular, feels emotionally distant to me."

She begins as an independent warrior princess but is reduced to a one-dimensional character after being forced to marry Zeus. Her portrayal as the goddess of wives and mothers is shallow, defined solely by her hatred for her husband and her indifference toward her children.  \n\n- **Character Motivations and Actions:**  \n  Hera’s actions are driven entirely by resentment and hatred. She attacks the women Zeus rapes or seduces, as well as those who aid him. She despises her children for their inability to challenge Zeus, and her bitterness extends to the other gods. Her role as a protector or nurturer is absent; she does nothing to help her worshippers or those who seek her affection.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book fails to explore the emotional complexity of Hera. Instead of delving into her heart or motivations, it portrays her as cold, manipulative, and consumed by hatred. This lack of nuance left me disappointed, as I hoped to see a more profound exploration of her character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel’s portrayal of Hera is disappointingly one-dimensional, reducing her to a figure defined solely by hatred and resentment.

The last chapter or two were the most enjoyable, but overall, the experience was rough.  \n\n- **Replay Value:**  \n  This is not a novel I will keep or revisit.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the author’s attempt to reframe Greek mythology, this particular novel fell short for me. Hera’s character remained unlikable and unrelatable, and the story failed to hold my interest until the very end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was not enjoyable for me, as it felt more like a chore than a pleasurable read.\n\n- **Content and Focus:**  \n  The book heavily focused on Greek mythology, which felt like a giant history lesson. While I learned a lot about Greek mythology, this was not my intention when I picked up the book. The content did not align with my expectations or interests.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The line, “All she knows is that he leaves a trail of broken women in his wake, and she is the most broken of them all,” stood out to me. It hinted at emotional depth, but this aspect was not enough to salvage my overall experience with the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book provided a detailed exploration of Greek mythology, it failed to engage me or align with my expectations. The emotional moments were not enough to make up for the lack of enjoyment I experienced while reading.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The challenge motivated me to continue reading despite my initial disengagement.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Hera* didn’t meet my expectations in terms of plot structure and narrative focus, external motivation from a reading challenge kept me engaged enough to finish the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This book felt like a continuation of that mediocrity, and I’m not sure I’ll give the author another chance after this.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Greek mythology retelling fell short of my expectations, lacking the depth and engagement I associate with the genre. The writing style was dry and uninspiring, and my experience with the author’s previous work didn’t help. I’m unlikely to read another book by Jennifer Saint.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The narrative felt disjointed and superficial, with key moments—such as Heracles' tasks, Semele's fate, and Hephaestus' wedding—either glossed over or left unresolved, which diminished their impact.

Her attempts to overthrow Zeus were poorly conceived and executed, often relying on others to do the heavy lifting, which made her appear foolish rather than fearsome. Hera's inner monologues were repetitive and frustrating, as she lamented her lack of foresight without demonstrating any growth or learning from her mistakes. Her hypocrisy was particularly glaring in her treatment of Zeus's victims; she failed to recognize the parallels between her own experiences and theirs, rendering her unsympathetic. Although Hephaestus called her out for punishing these women, this moment of potential growth was never revisited, leaving her character stagnant.

She gave up too quickly on everything, let everyone walk all over her, and kept getting saved by men.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The story wasn’t gripping, and even after giving it 200+ pages, I still wasn’t sucked into the narrative.  \n\n- **Commitment to Finishing:**  \n  I never leave a book partially read, but I made an exception for this one. I have plenty of other books that sound far more interesting, so I decided not to force myself to finish this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel failed to engage me due to its lack of emotional depth, disappointing portrayal of its female protagonist, and slow pacing. Despite my usual commitment to finishing books, I chose to set this one aside in favor of more compelling reads.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific numerical rating was provided, but the overall sentiment is negative."

The narrative felt disjointed and hard to follow, which made it difficult for me to engage with the story.  \n- **Pacing:**  \n  The story changed too quickly, giving me a sense of whiplash. The rapid shifts made it hard to stay invested or connected to the plot or characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI ultimately decided not to finish the book because the writing style and pacing were too jarring for my taste. The experience was frustrating, and I couldn’t force myself to continue reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned, but the tone suggests a very low rating."
