His motivations, love for Annwyl, and character development added significant depth to the story. The dual timelines were easy to follow, keeping me engaged in both the past and present. The slow-burn romance, combined with a morally grey male protagonist and found family themes, was executed flawlessly. The letters throughout the book were particularly moving and brought me to tears.",

I can‚Äôt quite articulate what didn‚Äôt work for me, but it felt like a step down in quality or engagement.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book felt longer than necessary. It seemed to drag in places, which affected my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The side characters I loved so much in Book 1 were barely present in this installment. Their absence was noticeable and disappointing.  \n\n- **Series Commitment:**  \n  Despite my disappointment, I‚Äôll likely continue with the series, as I‚Äôm still invested in the overarching story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I found this book disappointing compared to the first one, particularly due to its pacing, length, and lack of focus on beloved side characters, I remain interested enough to continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book devotes a substantial portion to flashbacks of Adeline and Jack's past lives, especially those involving Anwyll and Jaevidan. While these glimpses into the characters' histories are essential for context, they overshadow the present-day plot, limiting its development. Additionally, the connection between Jaevidan/Anwyll and Jack/Adeline feels somewhat disjointed, making it challenging to perceive their love story as a cohesive arc across lifetimes.",
            "In this installment, the main side characters, Will and Arthur, take a backseat, while Thomas and Lillian enjoy more screen time. Their engaging interactions spark curiosity about their potential relationship. Violet and Adeline share some delightful scenes, including a fun girls‚Äô trip that adds a lighthearted dynamic to the story. Adeline is a likable character, though Jack's personality, summed up by the phrase \"RAWR MINE,\" is less appealing. The contrast between Jaevidan's sweetness and Jack's intensity is effectively illustrated in the party scene, highlighting their dynamic. Violet remains a standout character, with her secrets and strong personality making her particularly memorable. A spin-off exploring her love story with a charming partner would be highly anticipated. Scholar Rindaw, featured in Jack's flashbacks, is another compelling character, with their relationship with their charge blending exhaustion and deep care, adding emotional depth to the narrative.",

Overall, the worldbuilding is exceptional, with vivid descriptions that immerse the reader in every locale, from Jaevidan‚Äôs fae realm to enchanting underwater scenes and mysterious caves.",

It was the book that got me into the fantasy genre, and while I‚Äôve read many fantasy books since, none have lived up to this one.  \n\n- **Storytelling and Writing Style:**  \n   - Marilyn‚Äôs storytelling is incredibly unique, and her world-building comes to life through her words.

The emotional rollercoaster was intense, and I felt deeply connected to the characters and their journey.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n   - The story is dark and heartbreaking, but it‚Äôs also beautifully written and deeply romantic. The themes of love, loss, and perseverance are explored in a way that feels both raw and poetic.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Spoilers:**  \n   - The biggest plot twist was revealed around the 90% mark, and it completely shocked me. I dropped my Kindle and couldn‚Äôt believe what I was reading.

            "The story often felt dull and slow, largely due to Adeline's incessant whining and moral dilemmas. However, the final 10% of the book, especially the twist involving Violet, was a game-changer. It was so compelling that it redeemed the earlier monotony and significantly boosted my rating.",

While her behavior is true to her character, it doesn‚Äôt make her any more engaging and slows the story down.\n\nIn contrast, Violet emerged as the standout character. Her selfishness and embrace of being an evil protagonist were refreshing, and her dramatic twist at the end significantly enhanced my enjoyment of the story. Jack's monologue and his obsessive, creepy behavior added depth and intrigue. His charm as a dark, manipulative character was captivating, and his tragic dedication to Adeline‚Äîenslaving himself to a god to find her in every lifetime‚Äîmade his storyline fascinating."

The endings of both the first and second books left me in awe, and I‚Äôm eagerly anticipating the next installment.  \n   - The plot is full of unexpected twists and turns that I never saw coming, which keeps me thoroughly engaged.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n   - The story is set in New York during the Roaring Twenties, a time period I find exquisite and rich with potential, especially with the backdrop of World War I.  \n   - While the historical authenticity isn‚Äôt the strongest, I appreciate the urban fantasy setting, which is a refreshing change from my usual preference for high fantasy.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n   - The first book tackles mental health issues such as PTSD, eating disorders, and selective mutism, while the second book delves into themes of childhood neglect, seclusion, and poverty in middle age.  \n   - The inclusion of these themes adds depth and relatability to the story.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - Violet is my absolute favorite character, with her vulgar language, early feminism, and strong attitude. My admiration for her only grew after finishing the second book.  \n   - The books explore a variety of relationships, including fae and parallel bonds/soulmates, childhood sweethearts, twins and sibling bonds, found family, and a unique \"where's my wife?\" dynamic.  \n\n- **Tropes and Creativity:**  \n   - The series is packed with tropes, but they are executed in surprising and creative ways.  \n   - Elements like memory loss, reincarnation, and different time perspectives (retrospective through memories) add layers of intrigue and originality to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - I never expected to enjoy a historical romantasy series with pink covers as much as I have.  \n   - I‚Äôm amazed by the author‚Äôs creativity and wonder why more people aren‚Äôt reading these fantastic indie novels.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis series has been a delightful surprise, blending historical and urban fantasy with rich themes, complex characters, and unexpected plot twists. The Roaring Twenties setting, while not perfectly authentic, provides a captivating backdrop, and the exploration of mental health and relationships adds depth. Violet stands out as a standout character, and the creative use of tropes keeps the story fresh and engaging. I highly recommend this series and can‚Äôt wait for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It's crucial to read‚Äîand perhaps even reread‚Äîthe first book before diving into this one. Many elements were confusing, particularly regarding Addie's nature. While the narrative describes her as a wraith, a banshee, and a fate, these identities feel contradictory, making it hard to reconcile them, especially for those familiar with the underlying mythos. \n\nThe flashback scenes were the highlight of the story; they were exceptionally well-written and seamlessly integrated into the main narrative. However, despite their brilliance, the main plot felt lacking in comparison. The twist at the end was phenomenal. I previously noted a twist in my review of the first book, but the author truly excels in this area. It was a brilliant revelation that left me in awe."
