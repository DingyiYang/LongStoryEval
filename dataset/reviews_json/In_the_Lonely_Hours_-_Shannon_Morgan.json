            "The premise of a haunted castle in Scotland is intriguing, but the plot suffers from logical inconsistencies. There is little reason for the characters to remain on the island, given the increasing danger posed by ghosts, shadows, murderous witches, and a controlling old woman. Their decision to stay feels forced and undermines the story’s tension.",
            "The characters' decisions were both unrealistic and frustrating. Despite facing intense paranormal activity within the first 24 hours, they inexplicably chose to remain on the island. The mother, in particular, seemed like a doormat, allowing her bratty teenager to dictate their actions. Her lack of urgency in protecting her child, especially after the child became possessed, was bewildering and hard to believe. Additionally, character relationships felt underdeveloped, with the mother-daughter dynamic being especially weak; the mother was overly passive, while the teenager dominated the interactions. The suggestion that terrible people find each other was introduced but not meaningfully explored, missing an opportunity for deeper character interactions.",

However, it quickly becomes overcrowded with too many components—such as a haunted castle, a witch, a cursed jewel, and multiple spirits—resulting in a cluttered narrative. Additionally, the clues for various plot points are overly obvious, which undermines the sense of mystery and intrigue.",

            "The book alternates between the present-day narratives of Edie and Neve and the historical account of Lottie and the Maundrell family. While the foreshadowing of Samhain's significance is skillfully done, the extensive exposition and large cast initially hinder emotional investment in the story. However, the pacing improves significantly in the second half, making the mystery more engaging.

The intertwined mysteries of the Maundrell family's deaths and the diamond's curse add both intrigue and depth to the narrative.",

The story is a slow burn at first, but once the plot picks up steam, it becomes deeply immersive, delivering a gothic soap opera-esque twisted tale of the Maundrell family.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The castle itself becomes a character, its history seeping through ancient stones and into the very bones of the story. The shadow-filled corridors and ghosts around every corner create a vivid, haunting atmosphere that enhances the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  While ghost story tropes abound, Morgan infuses them with fresh energy, exploring themes of generational trauma and mental health with a nuanced touch.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship between Edwina and Neve provides a grounding counterpoint to the supernatural elements. However, Neve's often \"shitty\" attitude towards her mother can grate on the nerves, detracting slightly from their dynamic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of gothic mystery and family drama, with a richly atmospheric setting and a plot that keeps you hooked once it gains momentum.

            "The characterization of Edie, Neve, and Lady Elizabeth occasionally feels exaggerated. I found it puzzling that Lady Elizabeth, an older woman from the 1960s who lacks societal respect, wields such power over her family. There’s no clear real-world or supernatural explanation for why they endure her abuse. In the modern sections, Edie's meekness contrasts oddly with her controlling behavior towards her teenage daughter. While she begins as a grieving widow, this plot thread is quickly overshadowed by the ghostly intrigue that follows."

I was left wondering why Lady Elizabeth, an older woman from the 60s who wasn’t respected by anyone in society, had such a hold over her whole family. There wasn’t really a \"real world\" or \"supernatural\" reason as to why everyone would stay and suffer her abuse.  \n\n- **Modern-Day Character Dynamics:**  \n  In the modern-day sections, I found some of Edie's attitudes odd. She’s really meek as a character and somewhat controlling of her teenage daughter. Additionally, she starts off as a portrayal of grief for her lost husband, but that plot thread is quickly dropped as the ghost intrigue builds.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite these critiques, I did enjoy this book. I found the plot compelling, even if the characters were a little lacking. If you like ghost stories, this book is probably for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has some issues with characterization and certain plot threads, the engaging supernatural elements and compelling plot make it an enjoyable read, especially for fans of ghost stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The excessive number of characters and ghosts made it hard to follow at times, and the plot felt a bit scattered. However, the slight twist at the end added some intrigue. Overall, it was an okay read, but not particularly memorable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars (rounded down to 2 stars)."
