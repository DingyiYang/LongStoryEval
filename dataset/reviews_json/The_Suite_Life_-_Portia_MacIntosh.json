            "Set in London, the story follows Gigi as she searches for a date for her sister's wedding, resulting in a series of comically disastrous encounters. A standout element of the plot is the hotel upgrade, which injects humor and intrigue into the narrative. While the mystery surrounding Gigi's unexpected upgrade adds to the story's appeal, the eventual twist feels somewhat predictable.",
            "Gigi is an enjoyable character, though I wish she would assert herself more, particularly in her interactions with Nathan and his new girlfriend. Nathan comes off as a caricature villain, exhibiting despicable behavior, and Sunshine, his girlfriend, treats Gigi poorly as well. While Donnie is a likable character, the slow-burn romance with Gigi drags, especially with the introduction of a love triangle. The insistence on a cheating element introduces unnecessary negativity and diminishes the overall appeal of the romance. Although the closed-door, slow-burn aspect is enjoyable, it could have been more satisfying without the love triangle, as Gigi's chemistry with her first romantic interest feels genuine and makes the love triangle seem forced.",
            "The Hawaiian hotel setting serves as a stunning backdrop for the wedding, with vivid descriptions that enrich the narrative.",
            "The story is fast-paced and entertaining, featuring a variety of humorous situations. The over-the-top, cringeworthy dates are engaging and add to the fun. Despite a few minor drawbacks, this book is a quick and enjoyable read, making it perfect for the beach or vacation."

            "The story truly gained momentum once Gigi arrived in Hawaii, transforming into an engaging read. The hotel's mysterious perks and Gigi's dating mishaps were standout elements of the novel. Interestingly, I lost track of why Gigi was in Hawaii, as her sister and the wedding party were barely featured. However, this didn't detract from my enjoyment, as I found Gigi's personal journey far more compelling. While the romantic plot was enjoyable, I was more intrigued by the mystery surrounding the hotel perks. The stolen phone incident on the yacht felt somewhat out of place, and I would have preferred a different scenario to unfold.",

His role as Gigi’s wingman and their growing closeness added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The Hawaiian destination wedding setting provided a luxurious and vibrant backdrop for the story.  \n   - The exotic desserts, luxury pool services, and shared suite added to the fun and glamorous atmosphere.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The story was lighthearted and funny, with a tone that matched the rom-com genre perfectly.  \n   - The humor and coincidences were well-executed, making the book an entertaining read.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n   - The story explores themes of self-worth, moving on from past relationships, and finding love in unexpected places.  \n   - It also touches on the idea of fate and how seemingly chaotic events can lead to meaningful connections.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a fun and engaging rom-com with a mix of humor, mystery, and heartwarming moments. While some aspects of the plot and characters were initially off-putting, the story improved significantly as it progressed. The Hawaiian setting, the friends-to-lovers trope, and the clever twist with the VIP treatment made it a delightful read. If you enjoy lighthearted wedding-themed stories with a touch of fate and humor, this book is perfect for you.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5⭐"

She’s dreading the prospect of encountering her ex, Nathan, who will be attending with his new reality star girlfriend. In a bid to avoid any awkwardness, Gigi decides to find a date for the wedding, resulting in a series of humorous and awkward escapades.

However, the wingman aspect could have been explored in greater depth—particularly why Donnie is introduced as a support rather than a potential romantic interest.

            "The pacing of the story felt uneven, especially in the beginning. The male main character (MMC) is introduced only 30% into the book, making the start feel unnecessarily prolonged. It would have been more engaging if the story had begun closer to the trip to Hawaii, incorporating the initial bad dates with the MMC involved from the outset. As it stands, the early chapters felt more like listening to a friend share their dating misadventures rather than immersing the reader in a romance.",

            "The story is enjoyable and engaging, yet it falls short in certain areas. The rushed ending detracts from the overall experience. It follows Gigi as she seeks a date to impress her family at her sister's wedding, after her ex-boyfriend arrives with his famous new girlfriend. Gigi goes on several dates with various men, but none align with her lifestyle or preferences. The setting transitions to Hawaii for her sister’s lavish private wedding, where Gigi is upgraded to a luxury suite and begins to embrace life, moving on from her ex.",
            "In this story, Gigi prioritizes luxury and status in her dating pursuits, leading her to initially friendzone Donnie—a supportive, humorous, and genuine guy—because he doesn't align with her ideal wedding aesthetic. However, their relationship gradually transforms into a charming friends-to-lovers arc, which is delightful to watch unfold. While Gigi's connections with her sister and family could be more fleshed out, as she spends minimal time with them despite being a bridesmaid, the interactions between Gigi and Donnie are heartwarming and well-crafted, effectively highlighting their blossoming friendship and chemistry."

While the protagonist’s repeated failures to secure a wedding date provide an entertaining distraction, her avoidance of her family is understandable given their behavior. The predictable yet satisfying romantic twist with the nice guy who assists her adds a pleasing element to the narrative.",

It's also puzzling why a well-known influencer would feel threatened by the protagonist or be interested in her ex, who seems rather dull and unremarkable. Additionally, while the protagonist's family is supportive, they often embarrass her by divulging personal details, which seems inconsistent with their intended role.",

Additionally, I found it confusing that both Gigi's dad and a member of the wedding party were named Alfie.",

For instance, her shock that a restaurant with \"mare\" in its name serves seafood is baffling, and her constant dishonesty is off-putting. This made it difficult to empathize with her, and I found myself skipping through several awkward early date scenes due to the overwhelming secondhand embarrassment.",

However, I was still left disappointed, which is why it took me four days to finish a book that should have taken only a few hours. I kept stopping because I was so frustrated.\n\n- **Character Development (Gigi):**  \n  Gigi, the main character, is infuriating. She comes across as incredibly ignorant and shallow. For example, she’s surprised that a restaurant with \"mare\" in its name serves seafood and keeps lying about everything. Her behavior made it hard to root for her, and I had to skip through several cringe-worthy early date scenes because I couldn’t stand the secondhand embarrassment.\n\n- **World-Building (Brand Names):**  \n  The use of made-up \"knock-off\" brand names like \"Welcome to Singledom,\" \"AOB,\" and \"InTheMo\" was annoying. It felt inconsistent, especially since Instagram was referred to by its real name instead of something ridiculous like \"SnapIt.\" This detail seemed pointless and distracting.\n\n- **Plot Cohesion:**  \n  Several plotlines felt unresolved or irrelevant. For instance, the whole arc about Sunshine allegedly stealing Gigi’s phone to delete a screenshot was never brought up again. Additionally, I’m not sure if I’m mistaken, but it seemed like Gigi’s dad and one of the guys in the wedding party were both named Alfie, which was confusing.\n\n- **Redemption (Gigi’s Behavior):**  \n  The only redeeming aspect was Gigi’s surprisingly mature behavior toward Sunshine in the latter part of the book. If it weren’t for this and the low price, I would have given this book one star.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book fell short of my expectations. While it had a few redeeming moments, the frustrating main character, inconsistent world-building, and unresolved plotlines made it a disappointing read. I’m glad I only paid 99 cents for it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nIf not for the price and Gigi’s mature behavior toward the end, this book would have earned one star. As it stands, it’s a bargain read with significant flaws."

However, the questionable ethical choices and the underdeveloped romance left me wanting more, which is why I gave it 3 stars.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

            "This story masterfully intertwines themes of mistaken identity, fake dating, and friends-to-lovers romance, all set against the backdrop of a tropical wedding. Gigi and Donnie set out on a humorous quest to find Gigi a date for her sister’s wedding, ultimately leading her to discover that Donnie is her ideal match. A standout feature of the narrative is the absence of a third-act breakup, adding to its charm.",
            "In \"London Gigi,\" the protagonist struggles with unhappiness, dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem, often acquiescing to others' demands. In contrast, \"Hawaiian Gigi\" emerges as the main character, enjoying royal treatment due to a case of mistaken identity. Donnie, a charming and supportive figure, assists Gigi in overcoming her challenges, despite the humorous critiques of his name. Meanwhile, Gigi's ex, Nathan, is portrayed as problematic and unlikable, prompting questions about her sister's judgment in selecting him as her fiancé's best friend.",
            "The story features well-placed humor, with amusing lines woven throughout. However, the main character's lack of self-trust and her obliviousness detract from her appeal, making her less relatable.",

While it has its funny moments and avoids the typical third-act breakup trope, the main character’s lack of self-awareness and the heavier focus on comedy over romance made it less enjoyable for me.

There was even a little Taylor Swift reference, which felt very on-brand for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was an easy and enjoyable read with plenty of humor and relatable themes, the lack of character development in the FMC and her self-deprecating nature were disappointing. Overall, it’s a lighthearted story with fun moments but falls short in certain areas.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars"
