            "In *Tanner*, Sawyer, the youngest son of the Stewart clan, defies my initial expectations. His character comes to life through his deep love for family and a strong moral compass, echoing the traits of his siblings. Smart, well-read, and self-disciplined, Sawyer grapples with the realization that small-town life may not suit everyone, especially as he struggles to pursue love‚Äîcomplicated by his feelings for a woman engaged to another.\n\nIvy Caswell, a native Alaskan with striking red hair and green eyes, has spent every summer in Skagway since she was eight, finding solace with her aunt and uncle amidst feelings of abandonment from her parents. Initially, I found Ivy difficult to warm up to; her haughty demeanor grated on me.

First, Katy has me wanting to take a trip to Alaska, and now she has me looking for the classics, like *Wuthering Heights*.  \n\n- **Character Development (Sawyer):**  \n  Sawyer is the youngest son of the Stewart clan. He is very different from what I expected, and his behavior in the book *Tanner* makes much more sense now. He, like his siblings, has a deep love for his family and an innate sense of right and wrong. He‚Äôs very smart, well-read, and holds himself to a higher standard, yet recognizes that his small town may not be for everyone. Finding love like his older siblings may not be attainable, given the woman who claimed his heart is engaged to another man.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ivy):**  \n  Ivy Caswell has spent every summer in Skagway with her aunt and uncle from the time she was 8 years old. She‚Äôs a native Alaskan, with flaming red hair and green eyes, and feels lost and alone most of the time. Abandoned by her mother and ignored by her dad, her summers with her aunt and uncle become her lifeline. I had a really hard time warming up to Ivy initially‚Äîher attitude and haughty behavior annoyed me. However, seeing her relationships with Sawyer, her dad, and her fianc√© develop through the flashbacks made a world of difference.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Interconnectedness:**  \n  I love how the stories are run concurrently. An incident or mention in one book becomes a key point in another.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  Enemies-to-lovers and second-chance love are two of my favorite tropes, and this story having both is a home run for me.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Books:**  \n  Only two siblings are left, Parker and Reeve, and I‚Äôm excited to see their stories unfold.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a compelling addition to the series, with well-developed characters, interconnected plots, and engaging tropes. While Ivy took some time to grow on me, her character arc and the dynamics between her and Sawyer were ultimately satisfying.
