            "The emphasis on world-building overshadowed the romance, resulting in a plot that felt lacking and unsatisfying.",
            "The relationship between the two main characters in the story felt underdeveloped. They spent much of the book apart, and when together, the male main character often attempted to harm the female main character, which became repetitive. While there were several references to their past romance, the present lacked meaningful romantic moments. The author did not effectively convey the reasons for their love; instead, it was merely stated. A well-placed flashback could have helped strengthen their connection.",

The repetitive dynamics between the MMC and MFC, coupled with the lack of present-day romance, made the story feel unbalanced. The secondary relationship between the MFC and her brother stood out as more compelling, highlighting the missed potential in the central romance.",

Her life takes a dramatic turn after a Halloween party in Vegas, where she finds herself in an unfamiliar world with no recollection of how she got there. In this strange place, she encounters a man who attempts to kill her, yet instead of fear, her body responds with unexpected attraction, suggesting a profound connection between them.",

            "Stella's trials are extraordinary, marked by a curse that has befallen the Kingdom of Serpents, cast by entities from another realm. The story is distinctive, showcasing unique challenges and the goddess's inability to aid Stella. It introduces a diverse cast of characters and creatures, including dinosaurs, and weaves together thrilling adventures with a poignant love story. I would have appreciated a segment from Cahji’s perspective, particularly regarding his interactions with the Vampire king and queen. For those interested in how Cahji saved Rhodelia and Varan, Chapter 27 of *Of Blood & Nightmares* offers those details.",
            "The emotional struggle between Stella and Brandt to stay apart, despite their deep yearning for one another, was compelling. However, I found it challenging to grasp the full depth of their love beyond their mate bonds, largely due to the lack of exploration into Stella's life before her reincarnation.",
            "The lengthy world-building explanations detracted from the story, and I would have preferred a deeper exploration of Stella's backstory. I was disappointed that Stella didn't fully realize her badass potential by the end, especially in her encounters with the otherworldly beings."

            "In this story, I found myself questioning several plot points. For instance, why did the Sepeazians divide Babadon’s heart into thirds and incorporate them into an axe, spear, and goblet instead of destroying it in the volcano with reagents at his death? Additionally, why didn’t they eliminate Gola Resh when they believed they had her captured? While the explanation for Babadon and Gola Resh's takeover of the planet was logical, it felt inconsistent that it took the powers that be fifty years to find a way to break the curse, only to discover a solution within days of Stella’s return. I was also puzzled by the two Vawtrians' presence; why didn’t they return to their home planet, and what role did they serve, especially since the well maintaining the magic in the rings was self-sustaining? Overall, I enjoyed the novel, but I felt it was a bit lengthy and could have benefited from more conciseness.",

They are all somewhat interconnected while managing to have their own unique characters, countries, and challenges.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  There were lots of different types of love explored in this story: familial love, romantic love, platonic love, and patriotic love. While love can make people stronger, it can also blind and consume them, and I strongly believe that Butler illustrated this well.  \n\n- **Character Experience and Relatability:**  \n  I can't imagine falling into a world where I only got brief snapshots of my previous memories, sometimes only flashes and impressions. I'm sure I wouldn't handle it well at all.  \n\n- **Humor and Unexpected Elements:**  \n  I also really want a triceratops to ride. Never thought I would think that.  \n\n- **Content Warning:**  \n  Do be aware that a couple of scenes in this story can get a bit spicy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling addition to the series, with strong world-building, emotional depth, and unexpected humor. The exploration of love in its various forms is particularly well-executed, though readers should be prepared for some mature content.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"
