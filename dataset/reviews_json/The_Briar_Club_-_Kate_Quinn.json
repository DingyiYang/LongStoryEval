            "The story opens intriguingly in 1954 at Briarwood House, a women’s boarding house in Washington D.C., where a brutal murder occurs on Thanksgiving Day. While one of the boarders may be the culprit, the victim's identity remains a mystery, though we learn the murder took place in the room of a resident named Grace March. The narrative then shifts back four years to follow thirteen-year-old Pete, who takes on significant responsibilities to support his mother as a handyman at the boarding house. He also cares for his sister, who struggles with a lazy eye and a learning disorder.\n\nThrough Pete's eyes, we meet the diverse boarders, including Grace, who occupies a small attic room. These women, each grappling with their own demons and regrets, gather around Grace’s special sun tea, forging a tight bond of friendship as they share their love, hate, and sorrows. However, Grace’s secrets threaten to unravel their connection, leading to unexpected violence that could shatter their lives. Ultimately, each woman must discern who among them is a true friend and who is a hidden enemy.\n\nDespite the lengthy journey, the pacing is expertly balanced, with heart-pounding action that never feels rushed or repetitive. The unfolding events are executed flawlessly, culminating in a satisfying conclusion that leaves readers wanting more.",
            "This book features remarkable characterization, allowing readers to connect deeply with each woman, embracing their flaws and mistakes without judgment. Grace, a mysterious widow with a secretive past, quickly befriends the other boarders: Fliss, a beautiful young mother whose doctor husband is stationed in San Diego as the Korean War looms; Nora, the youngest at just twenty, who works at the National Archives and is entangled in a love affair with a gangster despite being the daughter of a police officer; Beatrice, an ex-baseball player whose career was cut short by WWII and her injuries; Reka, an elderly Hungarian immigrant; and Arlene, a secretary for the House Un-American Activities Committee who fervently supports McCarthy’s Red Scare.",

At three chapters in, I thought, \"Wow, this rivals Kristin Hannah.\" I usually find Hannah’s historical fiction incomparable, but this book came close.  \n\n- **Time Period and Setting:**  \n  - The story is set in the late 1940s to early 1950s during McCarthyism, when the trials of suspected Communist sympathizers dominated the news. The narrative opens with police investigating a dead body found in Briarwood House, a dilapidated boarding house for women in Washington, DC.  \n\n- **Story Structure and Character Development:**  \n  - Rather than rotating and repeating through the POV of each resident, each character gets their own section of the book. I loved this structure because it allowed me to really get to know each character and their backstory, making it much easier to distinguish who was who in the ensemble cast.  \n\n- **Unique Narrative Perspective:**  \n  - Briarwood House has its own POV laced throughout the book, offering a “fly on the wall” perspective. This approach beautifully demonstrates how “found family” can turn a dingy house into a cherished home.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Research:**  \n  - The Historical Notes at the end are a must-read. Quinn shares the real-life inspiration for each character and subplot, adding depth and authenticity to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout in Kate Quinn’s body of work, rivaling even Kristin Hannah’s historical fiction.

            "The story unfolds across nine chapters, each narrated by a different woman residing in the Briar House boardinghouse. These multiple perspectives serve as pieces of a puzzle, enriching both the murder mystery and the historical backdrop. However, the frequent shifts in viewpoint sometimes felt like nine mini-stories within a single book, with some characters' arcs ending abruptly and leaving me wanting more. Set against the backdrop of a murder on Thanksgiving in 1954, the narrative delves into the events and secrets leading up to the crime. While the pacing is generally good, the lengthy chapters and sudden POV transitions occasionally disrupt the flow.",
            "The characters were well-developed, each woman harboring her own secrets and struggles. Reka and Nora emerged as personal favorites, with their stories particularly resonating. However, some perspectives were more engaging than others, leaving me wishing to revisit certain characters while wanting to move on from others.",
            "This novel, set during the 1950s Red Scare, offers a refreshing departure from the typical war-centered historical fiction. It weaves together a murder mystery while delving into the lives of women of the era, illuminating their secrets, struggles, and unexpected friendships."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Briar Club* was an enjoyable read, especially for fans of historical fiction and murder mysteries. The unique setting, multiple POVs, and strong character development made it engaging, though the narrative structure and pacing had some drawbacks. While it didn’t quite top *The Rose Code*, it was a refreshing take on historical fiction, and I highly recommend the audiobook for its excellent narration.",

            "The alternating perspectives and timelines are effective, though the supernatural narration from the house felt unnecessary. A traditional third-person omniscient perspective would have sufficed to advance the story. The ending is satisfying, delivering justice and tying the narrative together seamlessly, with the identities of the deceased revealed in a well-executed conclusion.",
            "The story follows eight women residing in a dilapidated boarding house, united by weekly dinners that cultivate friendship despite the challenges posed by their unpleasant landlady. The narrative alternates between the perspectives of the residents and the house itself; however, the house's viewpoint felt superfluous and did not resonate with me. While not every woman's story is equally compelling, most are engaging, and the author skillfully intertwines their narratives over the span of four years.",
            "Set against the backdrop of 1950s Washington, DC, the story subtly incorporates the McCarthy era and the Red Scare, using them as contextual elements rather than central themes. The historical setting enriches the narrative without overshadowing it.",
            "This book marks a shift from the author's typical historical fiction, leaning more towards a narrative set in the past rather than adhering strictly to historical events. While it is marketed as a mystery, the mystery aspect takes a backseat to character-driven storytelling. Readers seeking action, a robust mystery, or conventional historical fiction may find themselves disappointed."

        "conclusion": "*The Briar Club* is a character-driven novel that blends elements of women’s literature, historical backdrop, and a touch of mystery. While it may not meet the expectations of readers seeking traditional historical fiction or a strong mystery, it excels in portraying the lives and relationships of its diverse cast of characters. Adjusting expectations and embracing the book for what it is—a story about friendship and resilience—led me to thoroughly enjoy it.

            "The story unfolds primarily through flashbacks, with each lengthy chapter dedicated to a character in the home. At 430 pages, the book comprises only nine chapters, resulting in substantial chapter lengths. Interspersed between these are shorter interstitial chapters, which I found to be the highlight of the book, as they centered on the murdered woman and felt more directly tied to the central mystery. While the book starts strong, many character-focused chapters seem tangential to the main plot of the Thanksgiving murder in 1954. The excessive background information on the characters ultimately detracted from the story I was most invested in.",

Nora's chapter was particularly well-written and captivating; had it been a standalone book, I would have rated it 5+ stars.

The setting has heartwarming nuances, with charming details like the traveling vine painted on the walls and the potluck dinners hosted by Grace March.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The characters are well-developed and sympathetic, particularly the house owner, a cranky divorcee with a young son, Pete, and daughter, Lina.

The other boarders include women working at the local library, government jobs, and a British girl waiting for her doctor husband to return from the war. Grace March stands out as a charismatic figure who brings the group together with her potluck dinners and creative wall paintings.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book starts with a mention of a double murder in the house, but this mystery is deeply submerged and only resurfaces at the end to wrap up the story. While the novel has many charming and sympathetic elements, it tends to drag as it delves into the pasts and lives of the individual house occupants.  \n\n- **Unique Features:**  \n  A distinctive feature of the book is the inclusion of recipes at the end of each chapter, paired with a song recommendation for when the dish should be enjoyed. This adds a quirky and memorable touch to the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I found the book enjoyable enough to finish, appreciating its charm and sympathetic portrayal of the characters.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Characters:**  \n  The novel features a diverse cast of women living in a Washington, DC boardinghouse in the early 1950s. These include a young Irish woman in love with a gangster, a rigid woman working for the Committee on Un-American Activities, a Hungarian refugee and artist, a woman who falls in love with a Senator’s wife, a former professional baseball player sidelined by injury, and Grace, whose background remains a mystery until the end. Supporting characters include the strict boardinghouse owner, her two unfortunate children, the gangster, an FBI agent, and the house itself. Grace serves as the unifying force, bringing these women together to form their own family.  \n\n- **Setting and Cultural Context:**  \n  The novel vividly captures the cultural and historical backdrop of the 1950s, including jazz clubs, McCarthyism, the strict rules of the boardinghouse (such as prohibiting men from certain areas during specific hours), the influence of the mob, and the world of women’s professional baseball. These elements enrich the story and provide a strong sense of time and place.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The story includes a “whodunit” mystery that kept me engaged from the beginning. I was surprised by the resolution, as I did not guess the outcome correctly.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Enjoyment:**  \n  The novel is a fun, light read, but it didn’t quite reach the level of Kate Quinn’s previous works, *Diamond Eye* and *The Huntress*, which I found to be exceptional.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers an entertaining and engaging story with a rich cast of characters and a well-crafted historical setting. While it didn’t match the brilliance of Quinn’s earlier works, it was still an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I truly enjoyed getting to know each housemate in such detail, including their pasts and what brought them to Briarwood House.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery Elements:**  \n  The murder mystery aspect of the book was actually my least favorite part. I didn’t feel particularly invested in who was killed or who was responsible. However, I understand that it was necessary to heighten the stakes and demonstrate how close the housemates had become.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Tone:**  \n  I would have preferred a story with a little less action and mystery and a bit more emotional depth. I know Kate Quinn has the ability to make me cry, and I felt this book could have leaned more into that emotional resonance.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author Loyalty:**  \n  Despite my minor critiques, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will continue to pick up Kate Quinn’s novels as long as she keeps writing them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the murder mystery element didn’t fully resonate with me, the strong character development and immersive storytelling made this book a worthwhile read.

The story alternates between a present timeline where the police investigate a murder and the past, where each character’s history is revealed.

I also found myself more engaged with certain backstories than others, which made some parts of the book less compelling.  \n\n- **Themes and Historical Context:**  \n  The book highlights a variety of themes and historical topics, including gangsters, post-WW2 trauma, single motherhood, the Cold War, LGBTQ experiences, domestic violence, and societal restrictions on women. I appreciated the depth and diversity of these predicaments, as they provided a rich slice of history from that era.  \n\n- **Narration (Audio Version):**  \n  The audio narration was terrific, and the narrator is a favorite of mine.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality**  \n   - I adore Kate Quinn's writing and consider her one of my favorite historical fiction authors. I was excited to read *The Briar Club* even before reading the blurb, and my expectations were high. However, the book turned out to be nothing like her previous works, and not in a good way. It was a disappointment for me.\n\n- **Prologue and Initial Engagement**  \n   - The prologue, written from the perspective of the house and the murder, was a strong and intriguing start. It set the tone for what I thought would be a gripping story, but unfortunately, the momentum didn’t last.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Plot**  \n   - The book reads more like a collection of character studies rather than a cohesive historical fiction novel. The murder, which seemed like the central premise, felt like an afterthought. The lack of a strong plot made it hard to stay engaged.  \n   - The story is entirely character-driven, with little focus on a central plot. This approach didn’t work for me, as I found it difficult to connect with the characters or stay invested in their individual stories.\n\n- **Character Development and Engagement**  \n   - There are too many characters, and most of them felt dull and hard to distinguish. Starting the story with Pete’s perspective was a poor choice, as his chapters were tedious and boring. Nora’s POV was slightly better but still failed to hold my attention.  \n   - The characters’ stories felt disconnected, making the book seem more like a series of short stories rather than a unified novel.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone**  \n   - I was surprised by how much I struggled with the writing style and tone, as I usually love Kate Quinn’s work. This book felt unlike her previous novels, and I found it hard to believe it was written by the same author.  \n   - While many readers seem to enjoy the book, the writing style and tone didn’t resonate with me personally.\n\n- **Overall Engagement and Reading Experience**  \n   - I started skim-reading before the halfway mark and considered DNFing (Did Not Finish) the book. This was a shock, especially since I’ve given two of her previous books 5 stars.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Briar Club* was a significant departure from Kate Quinn’s usual style, and it didn’t meet my expectations. While the prologue was strong, the lack of a cohesive plot, dull characters, and unengaging narrative structure made it a struggle to finish. Despite my love for Quinn’s previous works, this book simply wasn’t for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a low rating, likely 2 stars or below."

The frequent shifts between characters disrupted the flow and made it hard to stay invested.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The book blends historical fiction with a murder mystery. While the historical elements were intriguing, the mystery aspect didn’t hold my interest. By the end, I was more focused on finishing the book than solving the \"whodunnit.\"  \n\n- **Unique Elements:**  \n  The inclusion of recipes was a nice touch, adding a layer of charm to the story. The short chapters told from the house’s perspective were a bit cheesy but still endearing.  \n\n- **Author Comparison:**  \n  As a fan of Kate Quinn’s previous works, such as *The Alice Network* and *The Huntress*, I had high expectations. While this book didn’t fully meet them, I remain a loyal reader and will definitely give her next novel a chance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Briar Club* has an intriguing premise and some charming elements, its pacing and structure made it a less engaging read for me. Despite my frustrations, I remain a fan of Kate Quinn and look forward to her future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The inclusion of recipes within chapters and the narration by the house feel unnecessary and disjointed. The timeline is confusing and hard to follow, and the twist meant to unify the narrative comes off as both perplexing and clichéd.

These flashbacks tackle relevant issues, such as Nora's relationship with a mobster, Claire's struggle with her sexuality, and Rika's quest to recover stolen WWII artifacts. However, the narrow focus on each character leads to a data dump rather than a cohesive narrative.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Complexity and Cohesion:**  \n  The book attempts to weave together an overwhelming number of elements, including spies, murder, gangsters, WWII-era women’s baseball, lesbians, wife abusers, women struggling with single parenthood, deserting fathers, a sentient house as a part-time narrator, and even recipes. This combination feels disjointed and lacks cohesion, making the plot difficult to follow and appreciate.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing comes across as amateurish, reminiscent of a high school creative writing student’s work. The execution of such a complex and ambitious story falls short, resulting in a narrative that feels messy and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  While the book touches on a variety of themes and attempts to represent diverse experiences (e.g., LGBTQ+ relationships, single parenthood, domestic abuse), these elements are not handled with the depth or sensitivity they deserve. Instead, they feel tacked on and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The inclusion of a sentient house as a part-time narrator is an unusual choice that adds to the overall confusion. This narrative device does not seem to serve a clear purpose and further detracts from the story’s coherence.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book’s ambitious attempt to combine numerous themes, genres, and narrative styles ultimately results in a disjointed and unsatisfying read. The writing lacks polish, and the plot feels overstuffed and poorly executed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a low rating."
