The secluded alternative school for paranormals was just what I needed. It‚Äôs got dark hallways filled with secrets and ghosts, creating a perfect atmosphere for the story.  \n\n- **Paranormal Beings and Lore**  \n   - It was so fun to be introduced to new paranormals in *Sweet Nightmare*. Clementine is a Manticore, which I didn‚Äôt think much about until watching *Onward*. I love that Tracy uses lesser-known paranormals in these books because it introduces me to newer lore.  \n\n- **Nicknames and Romances**  \n   - The nicknames between Clementine and Jude are THE absolute best! From fruit alternatives like cumquat and tangerine to classic rock songs like *Dear Prudence*, every new nickname made me smile. There were also lots of Aerosmith references! The banter between Clementine and Jude reminded me of Grace and Hudson.  \n\n- **Friendships**  \n   - *Sweet Nightmare* introduces us to a whole new band of friends. It‚Äôs the same found-family dynamic that we grew to love in *Crave*, so if you loved that series, this one is definitely for you! I didn‚Äôt realize until later that it‚Äôs set in the same universe as *Crave*, and I‚Äôm hoping for some crossovers as the series develops.

Her strained relationship with her mother, the school‚Äôs director, highlights her mother‚Äôs prioritization of work over parenting. Jude, the love interest, is complex and haunted by his past, which creates tension in his bond with Clementine. The supporting cast, featuring Clementine‚Äôs loyal best friend Luis and the fierce vampire Izzy, enriches the narrative with depth and variety. The unique and memorable teachers and characters further enhance the story's richness.",

The immersive Dark Academia setting is particularly captivating for genre enthusiasts.",
            "The book possesses considerable emotional potential, but its rapid pacing often hinders readers from fully connecting with the characters and their struggles. Additionally, the rushed ending diminishes the impact of pivotal revelations and emotional moments."

Tracy Wolff‚Äôs books always pull me out of a rut, and this one was no exception. I loved it so much that I‚Äôm already eagerly anticipating *Sweet Chaos* next year, though the wait feels too long.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were incredible. My favorites were definitely Izzy and Remy‚ÄîI‚Äôm loving those two. Jude, oh Jude, just became my new favorite man. Not only is he Korean, but he‚Äôs also dreamy and has a princely vibe, which I absolutely adore. Each character was likable in their own way, though I was saddened by some deaths. However, I‚Äôm excited because I know more characters will join in the next book.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot had me on edge. While it felt like it dragged a bit at times, the buildup was worth it. The ending poured out so many revelations that set the stage for book two. The story thickened with lies and secrets, and I had a hunch early on that the protagonist wasn‚Äôt the daughter of who she was supposed to be. Her mom always seemed shady, which is why I never liked her.  \n\n- **Favorite Moments:**  \n  Chapter 80 was my absolute favorite. It was not only good but also the funniest chapter in the entire book. I laughed so much while reading it.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  Overall, this was a fantastic read. I even consider it better than the *Crave* series, and I‚Äôm a huge fan of that series. For me to say that means a lot.  \n\n- **Re-read Potential:**  \n  Will I reread this? Hell yeah, I will! But for now, I‚Äôll let it simmer, though I wish Tracy would release *Sweet Chaos* sooner because I can‚Äôt wait much longer!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute delight, pulling me out of a reading slump and leaving me eagerly anticipating the next installment. With its engaging plot, lovable characters, and moments of humor, it‚Äôs a standout read that I consider even better than the *Crave* series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, this book exceeded my expectations and left me desperate for more, just like the original series did!  \n\n- **World-Building and Atmosphere:**  \n  Mrs. Wolff has a way of sucking you into another world and completely entrancing you with her world-building.

It was magical to continue being involved in the world of *Crave*, my favorite series. I read it in a day and plan to reread it as soon as possible.  \n\n- **Main Characters:**  \n  Jude was an incredible character, and I loved him even more after the revelation that he was the Prince of Nightmares. Clementine was a strong and badass female main character (FMC) who never became annoying, which I appreciated. Their relationship, especially the citrus nicknames, was adorable and made me a little jealous.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  The side characters were phenomenal. Luis was the best possible best friend, always helping Clementine after her encounters with the Chrickler. Eva and Luis together were amazing friends. Seeing Remy and Izzy again was a highlight‚ÄîI genuinely screamed when Remy‚Äôs name appeared. Their dynamic is unmatched.  \n\n- **World-Building and Connections to *Crave*:**  \n  The inclusion of familiar elements from *Crave* was heartwarming. Clementine mentioning Caroline (Calder) and the Gargoyle Queen, Grace Foster, brought tears to my eyes. The introduction of new paranormals was intriguing, and I‚Äôm excited to see how they develop in future books.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was action-packed and kept me glued to the pages. Despite the many events, the loose ends were tied up in a way that left me both satisfied with the ending of *Sweet Nightmare* and eagerly anticipating the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute delight, blending beloved characters from *Crave* with new, exciting elements. The strong characters, emotional connections, and fast-paced plot made it impossible to put down. I‚Äôm already craving the next installment!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned, but the tone suggests a 5/5 or equivalent high rating."

            "The romance between Clementine and Jude came across as overly cheesy, which didn't resonate with me as it might in other stories. It felt forced and ultimately grated on my nerves, likely due to my lack of connection with Jude as a character. Although Remy had some interactions with Izzy, he remained in the background for most of the book, and I only noticed him in the second half. I initially expected Jude to be part of a love triangle involving Remy, but instead, his relationship with Clementine took center stage. I found Jude to be excessively broody and dramatic, even more so than Jaxson.",
            "I cannot recommend this book to new readers. Understanding Clementine‚Äôs character and the world requires familiarity with key events, and while some explanations are provided, they fall short.

Key events from the *Crave* series are crucial to understanding Clementine‚Äôs character and the world, and while there‚Äôs some explanation here, it‚Äôs not enough.  \n   - Remy‚Äôs backstory is also tied to earlier books, so reading the *Crave* series is essential to get the full picture.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its flaws‚Äîmessy plot, overly cheesy romance, and a lack of focus on Remy‚ÄîI still enjoyed it overall.

            "In this story, reminiscent of the author's *Crave* series, we follow a 17-year-old girl named Clementine, whose perspective offers a more mature take on YA themes. Unlike Grace, who begins *Crave* with a naive outlook, Clementine is well-acquainted with the supernatural world and has toughened through years of challenges. If you found Grace's gullible inner dialogue frustrating in *Crave*, I encourage you to give this book a chance.",
            "The book exudes a haunting gothic atmosphere, with moments that are truly terrifying, reminiscent of nightmares. The graphic, gory deaths further enhance its dark tone.",
            "Set on an island off the Texas coast, the story follows students at a school for troubled supernatural beings. These young individuals either lost control of their powers, resulting in accidental harm, or engaged in non-jailworthy acts. While a power-dampening spell is intended to keep them in check, chaos ensues as a category 5 hurricane approaches, leading to unexpected consequences."

        "conclusion": "*Sweet Nightmare* is a dark, spooky, and engaging spinoff from the *Crave* Series, with a strong protagonist and a gripping premise. While it can be read as a standalone, *Crave* fans will appreciate the connections. The audiobook narration is excellent, and the story‚Äôs gothic tone and horrific elements make it a standout read.",

The narrator did an amazing job.  \n\n- **Connection to the Crave Series:**  \n   - *Sweet Nightmare* is a spinoff from the *Crave* Series, set in the same world after the events of *Cherish* (the finale of *Crave*).  \n   - While Tracy and the publisher claim it can be read as a standalone, there are major spoilers for a character introduced in *Covet* (Book 3 of *Crave*).  \n   - If you plan to read *Crave*, I recommend finishing that series first.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n   - The book has a very spooky/gothic vibe, with some parts being genuinely horrific (literal nightmares).  \n   - There are some horrific/gory deaths, which add to the dark tone.  \n\n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n   - The story is set in a school for troubled supernaturals located on an island off the coast of Texas.  \n   - The students either lost control of their powers and caused accidental harm or committed intentional but non-jail-worthy acts.  \n   - A power-dampening spell is in place at the school, but things go very wrong when a category 5 hurricane approaches.  \n\n- **Main Character and Narrative Style:**  \n   - Like in Tracy Wolff‚Äôs *Crave* world, the story is told from the perspective of a 17-year-old girl, making it very YA.  \n   - We spend a lot of time inside her thoughts, but Clementine (the protagonist) is far less naive than Grace was at the beginning of *Crave*.  \n   - Clementine is already part of the supernatural world and has toughened up from dealing with challenges for years.  \n   - If you struggled with *Crave* due to Grace‚Äôs gullible inner dialogue, I recommend giving this book a try.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Series Potential:**  \n   - I really liked this book and believe it is the start of a trilogy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Sweet Nightmare* is a dark, spooky, and engaging spinoff from the *Crave* Series, with a strong protagonist and a gripping premise. While it can be read as a standalone, *Crave* fans will appreciate the connections.

I thought it was very obsessive pining and kinda got annoying when I‚Äôd be reading an intense scene, and all of a sudden, the MC would be thinking about her unrequited love. This was made worse by her being a teenager (in my opinion).  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, I found it to be an entertaining read. Definitely an entertaining read though!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was my first Tracy Wolff book, and while I enjoyed the premise, setting, and the quirky cast of characters, the immature behavior of the teenage characters and the obsessive romance subplot were less appealing.

            "The first 100 pages act as an introduction, leading to a thrilling surge of action from page 350 onward. While the intense events are undeniably exciting, the storyline's logical progression occasionally feels disjointed, with connections between events remaining unclear until the very end. The lack of quieter moments diminishes the impact of the conclusion, as there is no buildup to a memorable climax. Initially, the romance captivates with palpable tension and intrigue, fueled by the characters' shared history. However, as the narrative unfolds, this intensity wanes, leaving the romance feeling somewhat flat. While it's not a bad romance, it ultimately struggles to maintain the same level of engagement established at the start.",

Despite its lengthy 700 pages, it reads quickly, thanks to the relentless action and short chapters that encourage marathon reading sessions‚ÄîI often found myself devouring 150 pages at a time. While the non-stop pace kept me engaged, it occasionally felt overwhelming, leaving little time to fully process the unfolding events."

The setting and paranormal elements add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Themes:**  \n  The story includes classic romantic tropes like ‚ÄúI love you but I am not good for you,‚Äù which adds emotional tension.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  The book includes horror-adjacent themes, but it is not overly scary. I do not typically enjoy horror, but I was not scared while reading. However, readers should check the trigger warnings if horror is not their preference.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSweet Nightmare is an engaging and entertaining novel that blends paranormal elements, romance, and adventure.

Instead, these characters exhibited depth, independent thoughts, and a refreshing authenticity that steered clear of cringe-worthy moments."

The romance was enjoyable and fitting for the YA genre, but the character dynamics could have been more distinct.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The characters, setting, humor, and clever writing kept me hooked from start to finish. While it was a bit challenging to read in English, the experience was thoroughly enjoyable. I‚Äôm completely obsessed with the story and eagerly await the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review, but the overall tone is highly positive, indicating a strong recommendation."

As a spinoff from the Crave Series, I did not feel like I was missing out on anything, and it was solid as a standalone.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  A supernatural academy for the worst of supernatural beings, the island feels more like a juvenile detention center where showing weakness isn‚Äôt suggested. Clementine has been stuck on the island her entire life, and her mother and family run the academy.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  A storm threatens the island, forcing Clementine to interact with Jude Abernathy-Lee, another student who has been on the island since he was young. The push and pull between Jude and Clementine kept me turning the pages.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  There were a lot of characters and different storylines in this book. I am sure some of the characters have their own stories in Crave (which I totally want to read now). Themes of friendship, found family, and learning to trust in yourself are woven throughout the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  While the book ends on a cliffhanger, it keeps you in suspense about what other twists and turns Tracy Wolff has in store for us with this series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSweet Nightmare by Tracy Wolff is a compelling standalone novel set in a supernatural academy with a unique atmosphere. The dynamic between Clementine and Jude drives the story, supported by themes of friendship, found family, and self-trust. Despite its cliffhanger ending, the book leaves readers eager for more from this series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book becomes increasingly captivating after its initial 11 short chapters. While the plot veers into absurdity, it possesses a unique charm that keeps me engaged and eager to read on.",
            "In *Sweet Nightmare*, the protagonist Clementine is a vast improvement over Grace Foster from *Crave*. She brings humor, warmth, and genuine care for others, in stark contrast to Grace, who was often insufferable with her toxic savior complex and performative grief. While Clementine's narration can occasionally be repetitive, it is far less tedious than Grace's inner monologues. However, the story does suffer from inconsistencies in character descriptions‚Äîsuch as the Bloodletter's abrupt change in appearance, which feels unaddressed. Additionally, the author struggles with consistent representation, at times changing characters‚Äô skin tones or backgrounds without clear justification.",
            "The author's writing is not particularly strong, but her ideas are interesting and creative. However, the storytelling often lacks coherence, featuring confusing and inconsistent elements. In *Sweet Nightmare*, the writing is slightly improved compared to *Crave*, showcasing a more refined style. While it's not exceptional, it does mark an advancement. Unfortunately, the final third of the book suffers from the same absurdity as *Crave*, with stakes escalating dramatically beyond what was previously established.",
            "The lore in *Crave* suffers from inconsistency, with major contradictions such as vampires being mortal in one book and immortal in the next. In *Sweet Nightmare*, the narrative achieves greater coherence amidst these inconsistencies. However, the author still violates established rules, like the prohibition against interspecies mating, as seen with Clementine and Jude in this installment.\n\nThe introduction of oracles in *Sweet Nightmare* is notably less melodramatic than the introduction of gods in *Crave*, although it still escalates the stakes suddenly."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite my low expectations, *Sweet Nightmare* was a pleasant surprise. The author‚Äôs writing and character work have improved, and Clementine is a much more likable protagonist than Grace Foster. While the book still has some of the ridiculous and inconsistent qualities of *Crave*, it‚Äôs more enjoyable and engaging overall. I‚Äôm excited to continue exploring this unique and charming world.",

Her storytelling often leaves a lot to be desired, with confusing and inconsistent elements.\n   - The writing in *Sweet Nightmare* is slightly better than in *Crave*, with a more dialed-down Tracy Wolff style. It‚Äôs not phenomenal, but it‚Äôs an improvement.\n   - The last third of the book has the same ridiculous quality as *Crave*, where the stakes suddenly escalate to something much bigger than previously established.\n\n- **Character Development and Likability:**\n   - Clementine, the protagonist of *Sweet Nightmare*, is a significant improvement over Grace Foster from *Crave*. She‚Äôs funnier, less annoying, and more genuinely caring about others.\n   - Grace Foster was insufferable, with a toxic savior complex and performative grief. Clementine, on the other hand, feels like a good person who truly cares about others.\n   - Clementine‚Äôs narration can be repetitive at times, but it‚Äôs not as constant or annoying as Grace‚Äôs inner monologues.\n\n- **World-Building and Lore Consistency:**\n   - The lore in *Crave* was inconsistent, with major changes like vampires being mortal in one book and immortal in the next. *Sweet Nightmare* is more consistent within the existing inconsistencies.\n   - Tracy Wolff continues to break her own lore, such as the rule that different species don‚Äôt mate with each other. This happens again in *Sweet Nightmare* with Clementine and Jude.\n   - The introduction of oracles in *Sweet Nightmare* feels less over-the-top than the introduction of gods in *Crave*, though it still has that sudden escalation of stakes.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The book gets more interesting after the first 11 chapters, which are short and quick to read.\n   - The plot has a certain charm, with things getting ridiculous quickly, but it‚Äôs also unique and engaging enough to keep me excited to continue the series.\n\n- **Comparisons to Previous Works:**\n   - My expectations for *Sweet Nightmare* were very low due to my experience with *Crave*, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much better this book is in many ways.\n   - *Sweet Nightmare* is worth reading if you‚Äôve already read *Crave*, though it might not make complete sense if you haven‚Äôt. However, it might be a better experience for new readers since *Crave* is so long and all over the place.\n\n- **Diversity and Representation:**\n   - There are inconsistencies in character descriptions, such as the Bloodletter‚Äôs sudden change in appearance in *Crave*, which felt random and unacknowledged.\n   - Tracy Wolff seems to struggle with consistent representation, sometimes changing characters‚Äô skin tones or backgrounds without clear reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite my low expectations, *Sweet Nightmare* was a pleasant surprise. Tracy Wolff‚Äôs writing and character work have improved, and Clementine is a much more likable protagonist than Grace Foster. While the book still has some of the ridiculous and inconsistent qualities of *Crave*, it‚Äôs more enjoyable and engaging overall.

Forced to collaborate during a hurricane, the plot unfolds at a gripping pace, filled with unexpected twists and culminating in a cliffhanger that raises more questions than it answers. The escalating suspense, fueled by the impending storm and its aftermath, keeps readers on edge. Blending adventure, romance, and mystery, the narrative also features moments that are unexpectedly bloody and intense.",

Her rekindling relationship with Jude, who is protective of her, stands out as a highlight of the story. The supporting cast features a diverse array of paranormal characters, including wolves, Fae, phoenixes, sirens, witches, dragons, and vampires; however, the large number of characters leaves some feeling underdeveloped. The romance between Jude and Clementine is well-crafted and satisfying, with Jude's frequent protective instincts adding a classic romantic touch.",
            "The book is primarily narrated in the first person from Clementine's perspective, with two chapters offering insights from Jude's viewpoint. The writing style is engaging and facilitates an easy reading experience.",
            "The Calder Academy setting is both intriguing and distinct from Katmere Academy, providing a fresh perspective on paranormal schools. The introduction of diverse paranormal creatures enriches the world, although certain aspects can be overly violent or graphic."

Her desire for freedom is understandable, and her supernatural abilities (being a manticore and seeing ghosts) add depth to her character.  \n   - Jude, the male protagonist, starts off as a mysterious and somewhat distant character, but his backstory and motivations are gradually revealed, making him more compelling.  \n   - The supporting characters, including various supernatural beings like phoenixes and Oneirois, add richness to the story, though their trustworthiness often remains ambiguous, keeping the tension high.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The story is dark, surprising, and filled with suspense, with a well-balanced romance that doesn‚Äôt overshadow the main plot.  \n   - The looming hurricane serves as a catalyst for Jude and Clementine to work together, raising the stakes for both the academy and the world.  \n   - The cliffhanger ending sets up anticipation for the next installment.  \n\n- **Comparison to the Katmere Series:**  \n   - While the Calder Academy shares similarities with the Katmere Academy, it stands on its own with a distinct setting, characters, and plot.  \n   - Readers unfamiliar with the Katmere series can still enjoy this spin-off, as it introduces enough new elements to feel fresh and independent.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis spin-off from Tracy Wolff‚Äôs Katmere series delivers a dark, suspenseful, and engaging story set in a unique paranormal world. The well-crafted characters, particularly Clementine and Jude, drive the narrative forward, while the intriguing mix of supernatural beings and high-stakes plot keeps readers hooked. The cliffhanger ending leaves readers eagerly anticipating the next book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, she soon encounters new threats that upend her life. Initially, the narrative felt uneven, with sporadic moments of excitement but a lack of tension in the overarching plot.

Unexpected twists and intriguing new paranormal beings kept me engaged throughout the story.",
            "The protagonists, Clementine and Jude, are intriguing and well-developed characters that I found both likable and engaging.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Cover Design:**  \n   - I quite like the cover. The snake coiled around the dagger is pretty, and I also like the ornaments in the background. However, it‚Äôs not one of my favorite covers because it doesn‚Äôt stand out enough from the Romantasy crowd.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n   - I absolutely loved the Katmere Academy series by the author, and when I heard about a spin-off series featuring Remy, I knew I had to read it because I really liked the character. I didn‚Äôt read the blurb, as it was an instant buy for me‚Äîwhich, in hindsight, might not have been the smartest move.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing style is, as expected, very easy to read and very GenZ-coded, which is typical of the author. However, I found it less humorous and darker compared to the Katmere Academy series, as the tone of this series is much more somber.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The academy itself has a different vibe because it‚Äôs a school for juvenile offenders who couldn‚Äôt control their magic. The protagonist, Clementine, is trapped in this school due to her family situation‚Äîher mother is the headmistress‚Äîeven though she hasn‚Äôt committed any crimes. Additionally, her ability to see ghosts adds to her struggles.  \n\n- **Characterization (Clementine):**  \n   - Clementine feels much more serious and frustrated than other teenagers her age, which makes her less quirky compared to the protagonists from Tracy Wolff‚Äôs other books.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot was really good, and the suspense was well-maintained, in my opinion.  \n\n- **Misaligned Expectations (Remy‚Äôs Role):**  \n   - I was confused when the book was written from Clementine‚Äôs perspective because I expected it to focus on Remy. It turns out Remy is only a side character, which I didn‚Äôt realize beforehand (my fault for not reading the blurb).  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n   - There‚Äôs a romance in the book (second-chance and friends-to-strangers-to-lovers, for those interested), which I enjoyed. I‚Äôm curious to see what Tracy does with the couple next, as she loves to keep readers guessing.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n   - I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the Katmere Academy series and wants to dive into a darker story with new supernatural creatures. Even if you found Katmere Academy ‚Äútoo cringe,‚Äù give this series a try‚ÄîI think it‚Äôs much less so in this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I expected something different but still had a great time reading the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars."

The Calder Academy, with its secrets and rules, provides an intriguing backdrop.  \n   - The addition of new paranormal creatures, such as the manticore represented by Cl√©mentine, brings a refreshing twist to the genre.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - I struggled to fully immerse myself in the story initially.

Her evolution feels uneven, and some narrative choices regarding her reactions lack depth or clarity.  \n   - On the other hand, I greatly appreciated Jude‚Äôs character. Though he starts as a distant and enigmatic figure, his behavior is gradually explained through his fears and personal dilemmas. He avoids being a stereotypical \"bad boy,\" and his vulnerability makes him feel human.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n   - The dynamic between Cl√©mentine and Jude is complex, oscillating between resentment, unspoken feelings, and attraction.  \n\n- **Conflict and Catalyst:**  \n   - The hurricane acts as a catalyst, forcing the characters to confront their deepest secrets and fears.

            "The book felt like a whirlwind, with an overwhelming number of events packed into just 3-4 days. It conjured the intense, unrealistic adventures I imagine before falling asleep. The sheer number of misfortunes that befell Clementine was staggering‚ÄîI even compiled a lengthy list. However, some plot elements seemed inconsistent. For instance, how did Simon navigate the dorm area to store the carpet during a hurricane without encountering people from different timelines?",
            "I found the tension between Clementine and Jude to be frustrating. I wished for either a romantic relationship or a solid friendship, but once they did get together, I appreciated their chemistry. Initially, however, I had a strong dislike for Jude. His tendency to vanish and keep secrets was exasperating, especially as I dislike characters who withhold information without a compelling reason. Even after his secrets were revealed, I felt he should have been more transparent with Clementine from the beginning. \n\nAdditionally, Jude's frequent rescues felt unrealistic; it seemed improbable that he could always be there, especially given their poor communication. While Clementine was an acceptable character, she lacked distinctiveness beyond her powers. I was also bothered by her vulnerability towards Jude, particularly when he repeatedly disappeared. Furthermore, I found Clementine‚Äôs mother‚Äôs transformation perplexing. Initially, she appeared unconcerned, sending Clem to confront monsters and lying about college applications, but near the portal, she transformed into a caring figure who finally took Clementine seriously."

            "The story is action-packed, presenting a relentless stream of monsters with minimal explanation or description, which surprisingly didn't detract from my enjoyment.

I felt that less action and more breathing room would have improved the experience.  \n   - Despite my mixed feelings, it was a true page-turner that I couldn‚Äôt put down.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Sweet Nightmare\" was a fast-paced, action-packed novel that kept me hooked but ultimately left me feeling overwhelmed by its relentless intensity.

Each book in the series felt like \"coming home\" because I had grown so attached to the characters. It was wonderful to see some of these characters appear in Tracy Wolff's new series, even if they weren't the main protagonists but rather supporting characters.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  From the first few pages, it was clear that Calder Academy is completely different from Katmere, if not its opposite. The idea of writing about a school that suppresses supernatural powers in a world filled with them is intriguing. Initially, I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure where Tracy Wolff was taking the plot, but as the \"nightmare\" she created began to unfold and make sense, it became truly brilliant. The overall atmosphere is mystical and slightly eerie, which I found very captivating.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Getting to know the new characters was exciting. Clementine and Jude are very interesting and multi-dimensional. Unlike in *Crave*, the love story here is built around the \"Second Chance\" trope, which naturally involves some back-and-forth between the characters. While this isn‚Äôt my favorite trope, I still found myself rooting for them as the story progressed!  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  Overall, I have to admit that *Sweet Nightmare* didn‚Äôt wow me as much as *Crave* did (which I absolutely LOVED). However, it‚Äôs still a fantastic start to the series. I‚Äôm very curious about the upcoming books, especially to learn more about how the former Katmere characters ended up at Calder Academy. I hope we get more details on that soon!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Sweet Nightmare* didn‚Äôt quite match the impact of *Crave* for me, it‚Äôs a strong and engaging start to a new series. The mystical and eerie atmosphere, along with the intriguing new characters, kept me hooked. I‚Äôm excited to see where the story goes next and how the connections to the Katmere Academy series will unfold.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Having read the entire series, I was excited to discover that the author was writing a spin-off set in the same universe. The connections between the characters are evident: Clementine Calder is the cousin of Carolina Calder, and Izzy is the sister of Hudson and Jaxon Vega. Fans of the series will recognize Remy and Izzy from the fourth book. When a devastating hurricane strikes their school, Clementine and Jude must set aside their past to work together and ensure the safety of their fellow students. The high stakes of the situation compel them to confront their unresolved feelings.",
            "While I found the chemistry between Clementine and Jude somewhat lacking, their interactions didn't quite deliver the engaging banter and humor I hoped for. In contrast, Izzy shone as a standout character, showcasing classic Vega snark and sarcasm; I only wish she had more screen time or that there was a male character with similar wit. Remy also added a delightful touch with his Southern wisdom and charm. I‚Äôm eager to see more of him and Izzy together in future installments.",
            "The story centers on 17-year-old Clementine Calder, a half-breed Manticore/Oracle navigating her powers at Calder Academy, a paranormal detention boarding school that seeks to suppress students like her. Her love interest, Jude Abernathy-Lee, also 17 and a half-breed Oneiroi (spirit of dreams), adds complexity to her life, as their shared history is marred by a three-year silence from Jude, creating an underlying tension throughout the narrative."

The romance between Clementine and Jude fell a bit flat compared to the dynamic relationships in other stories.

The connection between the series is clear: Clementine Calder is the cousin of Carolina Calder (the Manticore from the prison with Remy), and Izzy is Hudson and Jaxon Vega‚Äôs sister. If you‚Äôve read the Crave series, you‚Äôll recognize Remy and Izzy from *Court* (Book 4).\n\n- **Premise and Setting:**\n   - The story follows Clementine Calder, a 17-year-old half-breed Manticore/Oracle, as she learns to use her natural powers while attending Calder Academy, a paranormal detention boarding school designed to prevent students like her from using their powers. Jude Abernathy-Lee, a 17-year-old half-breed Oneiroi (dark-winged spirit of dreams), is her love interest. They have a shared past, but after a three-year unexplained silence on Jude‚Äôs part, there‚Äôs lingering tension between them.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**\n   - When a tragic hurricane hits the school, Clementine and Jude must put their past aside and work together to save themselves and their fellow students. The stakes are high, and the situation forces them to confront their unresolved feelings.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Chemistry:**\n   - I felt the chemistry between Clementine and Jude could have been stronger. Their interactions lacked the banter and humor that made Grace and Hudson‚Äôs relationship so engaging in the Crave series. Izzy, however, was a standout character with her classic Vega snark and sarcasm. I wish she had more screen time or that there was a male character in this series with similar wit. Remy was also a great addition, bringing Southern wisdom and charm to the story. I‚Äôm excited to see more of him and Izzy together in future books.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**\n   - If I had to rank Tracy Wolff‚Äôs series, I love *Crave* the most. *Starbringer* and *Sweet Nightmare* are tied for second place.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this spin-off series has potential, especially with its ties to the Crave universe and the introduction of intriguing characters like Izzy and Remy. However, the romance between Clementine and Jude fell a bit flat compared to the dynamic relationships in the original series.

However, I didn‚Äôt feel like I was missing anything by coming in blind.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - *Sweet Nightmare* is written from the perspective of Clementine, a manticore whose family runs Calder Academy.  \n   - The Academy houses various paranormal creatures, such as Sirens, Phoenixes, and Fae, who have been sent away for abusing their powers in the outside world.  \n   - Clementine has never left the island, so she‚Äôs never had access to her powers, as the island blocks all the students‚Äô abilities.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n   - When an insanely ferocious hurricane hits the island, the students regain their powers, and nightmarish monsters are unleashed on campus.  \n   - The story becomes a nightmare as everyone tries to find their way to safety.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Story:**  \n   - The story was incredibly intriguing, and I found myself thoroughly engaged despite not traditionally reading such detailed fantasy.  \n   - I‚Äôll certainly be looking forward to more of Clementine‚Äôs story.  \n\n- **Weaknesses of the Story:**  \n   - One flaw that occasionally disrupted the flow was the inconsistency in the storm‚Äôs intensity. It often seemed difficult to believe that the storm was raging as intensely as described, yet many scenes played out as though the storm was taking breaks for the sake of the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Sweet Nightmare* is an intense and intriguing fantasy novel with a unique premise and engaging characters. While there were minor inconsistencies with the storm‚Äôs portrayal, the story kept me hooked, and I‚Äôm excited to see where Clementine‚Äôs journey goes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This academy, situated on an island off the Texas coast, caters to supernaturals grappling with their powers and personal challenges, all while magic stifles the students' abilities. Born on the island, Clementine has never experienced her own powers. The book is a captivating read from start to finish, packed with action, danger, and a delightful blend of sweet heat and slow-burn romance.",

Following Shadow-Daddy Jude and Basically-Born-In-a-Prison Clementine was intriguing.  \n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  Just because you mention Wednesday, doesn't mean that I can't make the comparison that this world/boarding school is remarkably similar to Wednesday.  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  I loved how full of world-building this story was.  \n- **Dialogue and Authenticity:**  \n  I loved how many times they said \"fuck\" for no reason, other than that's how teenagers talk.  \n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  It's definitely not as trashy-fun as the original series, but I thought the same thing about the first Crave book, so I'm holding out hope for more Remy and Izzy story.  \n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  Also, yes, there's an egregious amount of death and dismemberment in this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial disappointment with the POV choice, I found the story to be engaging and well-crafted, with strong world-building and authentic dialogue. While it didn't match the tone of the original series, I remain hopeful for future developments involving Remy and Izzy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

I‚Äôm really excited to see where the rest of this series goes and if there will be any more crossover with the Crave books in the future.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  I definitely enjoyed this book, but I felt it had the same issue as Crave. The first half of the book dragged at times, and I only got fully invested in the action around 250 pages in.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Rating:**  \n  Despite the pacing issues, I feel confident in giving this book a solid 4 stars.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some pacing issues in the first half, it eventually picked up and became engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am excited about the potential for future crossovers with the Crave series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

However, Clementine stands out because she knows what she wants and fights to be with the person she loves.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book is packed with action right from the start, and many \"friendly\" characters are lost along the way. This suggests that the new series will follow a similar style to *Crave*: lots of battles, a diverse group of friends facing off against \"the bad guys,\" political maneuvering by those in power, and intricate family dynamics.  \n\n- **World-Building and Creatures:**  \n  The novel features a wide variety of creatures and monsters, which adds depth to the world. However, the sheer number of characters and names can make it confusing to keep track of who is who.  \n\n- **Ending and Anticipation for Sequels:**  \n  True to Wolff's style, the book ends on a cliffhanger, leaving readers eager for the next installment. Unfortunately, the next book is set to release in English in May 2025, so fans will have to wait a while.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Readability:**  \n  Despite its length, the book is entertaining and a quick read.

Her manticore shifting ability was unique.\n   - Jude was a typical \"dangerous boy\" trope, but his mythical element was interesting.\n   - Remy stole the show with his dialogue, especially the line \"Who's your daddy?\"\n   - Izzy‚Äôs background story intrigued me, but it wasn‚Äôt explored enough.\n\n- **Nicknames:**\n   - The nicknames for Clem and Jude felt clunky and didn‚Äôt add much to their relationship.\n   - However, I enjoyed the nickname \"Jean-Jerks\" for its fun alliteration.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**\n   - The worldbuilding was inconsistent and lacked logic, which should have annoyed me more than it did.\n   - The power structure and magic-block system were underdeveloped, and many elements felt added on the fly.\n   - The lack of consistency might appeal more to a young-adult audience.\n\n- **Editing:**\n   - The editing was generally good, with no noticeable spelling or grammatical errors.\n   - However, there were odd moments, like an unexplained reference to boats and inconsistent dialogue, which seemed like editing oversights.\n\n- **Setting:**\n   - The setting was a school on a small island in the Gulf of Mexico. It didn‚Äôt require much scene-dressing, and what was provided was sufficient.\n\n- **Pacing and Action:**\n    - The book was non-stop action, reminiscent of the *Maximum Ride* series.\n    - Even quieter moments were overshadowed by action or mystery, leaving little room for the characters to breathe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a wild, chaotic ride that defied expectations. While the plot was overstuffed and the worldbuilding inconsistent, the sheer absurdity and humor of the ending made it an enjoyable read for me. I wouldn‚Äôt read it again, but I‚Äôm glad I experienced it once. It‚Äôs a love-it-or-hate-it kind of book, and I can see why it has polarized reviews.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3 stars (considered rounding up to 3.5)."

            "The book presents a diverse array of characters and abilities typical of a paranormal school setting. However, the author fails to explore these characters in depth, rendering their magical qualities superficial. Although many characters die, their deaths lack emotional resonance due to a lack of connection with them.",

It evoked a Harry Potter-esque vibe, which I enjoyed to some extent. While the use of strong language felt out of place and did not contribute meaningfully to the story, the writing style suggested a YA audience.

            "The first half of the book lacks significant interest, with the plot only gaining momentum around chapter 49, which is frustrating after such a lengthy buildup. The epilogue attempts to create a cliffhanger but fails to generate enough intrigue to motivate me to read the next installment. At 93 chapters and an epilogue, the book feels overly long, particularly since the story doesn't truly engage until chapter 49, making the initial sections feel unnecessarily drawn out. Many chapters are bogged down by repetitive inner monologues from the female main character, which could have been condensed. The book could have easily been trimmed to 300-350 pages without losing any crucial content.",

Their lack of seriousness felt frustrating and unrealistic.  \n\n- **World-Building and Connection to Other Works:**  \n  One aspect I really enjoyed was that the story is set in the same universe as the *Crave* series. It was cool to see characters I already knew from that series make appearances in this novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the connection to the *Crave* series and the familiar characters, the overly fast pacing and the unrealistic behavior of the adult characters left me feeling disappointed. The story had potential but fell short in execution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è"

Taking place over just 48 hours, the story feels unrealistic and overwhelming, as the characters rarely get a moment's rest. While the ending features an intriguing cliffhanger, it hasn't convinced me to continue the series. Ultimately, the book had potential but was hampered by its chaotic structure and missed opportunities for deeper storytelling.",
            "The characters, particularly the protagonist Clementine, are poorly developed. Her erratic thoughts and inability to process her trauma make her difficult to follow. Jude, the male lead, comes off as indecisive, and their relationship feels forced and undercooked. The large cast lacks depth, making it challenging to connect with anyone. The romance between Clementine and Jude is particularly disappointing; it feels rushed within the 48-hour timeline and fails to address their unresolved past. The resolution is unearned, leaving me indifferent to their fate.",
            "The academic setting added a unique dimension to the story, while the hurricane party and storm created an intense, chaotic atmosphere that initially captivated me. The idea of the female main character being a Manticore and the inclusion of various monsters were intriguing, but the lack of explanations made the narrative hard to follow. The world-building felt cluttered, with too many elements‚Äîmonsters, storms, relationship issues, new powers, family drama, and ghosts‚Äîcrammed in without adequate development.",

I sincerely hope this new saga avoids a similar fate, as the first book already demonstrates considerable potential.",

Their limited attention in the previous saga left me wanting more, so it was a delight to finally have them back!",

Additionally, Cl√©mentine's dialogue occasionally mirrors Grace's lines in *Assoiff√©s*, such as ‚ÄúThe craziest thing in my life‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe weirdest thing in my existence,‚Äù which is somewhat disappointing.",

Having read the entire *Assoiff√©s* saga by Tracy Wolff, I wanted to try this new series, which seemed similar. To my great surprise, I was hooked from the very beginning.  \n   - Compared to the calm atmosphere of Katmere Academy in *Assoiff√©s*, Calder Academy leans more toward horror, with some scenes being gory and repulsive. I felt that *Assoiff√©s* was more \"lighthearted\" in comparison, and I really enjoyed this darker tone.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - The characters are interesting and endearing, and I loved how a group gradually formed. I laughed out loud many times while reading.  \n   - I was thrilled to see the return of Remy (the man of the hour) and Izzy (the most badass vampire in the paranormal world). These two characters weren‚Äôt given enough attention in the previous saga, and FINALLY, they‚Äôre back!  \n\n- **Plot and Intrigue:**  \n   - Multiple storylines intertwine, and I truly hope we‚Äôll get answers to all of them. In *Assoiff√©s*, the first four books were exquisite, but later on, many plotlines were abandoned, leaving unanswered questions and making the story feel messy.  \n   - I sincerely hope this new saga will avoid that pitfall, as the first book shows a lot of potential.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Repetition:**  \n   - The story takes a while to get going, which is one reason for my 3.5/5 rating.  \n   - Some of Cl√©mentine‚Äôs lines feel too similar to Grace‚Äôs in *Assoiff√©s* (e.g., ‚ÄúThe craziest thing in my life,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe weirdest thing in my existence‚Äù), which is a bit disappointing.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Anticipation:**  \n   - I highly recommend reading *Assoiff√©s* first, especially since a certain gargoyle queen is mentioned (for those who get the reference).  \n   - I‚Äôm excited to read the next installment and reunite with the group!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this novel and found it engaging, especially with its darker tone and the return of beloved characters.

A storm heading toward the island escalates to a category 5 hurricane, and the wards blocking the students from accessing their magic begin to fail. The idea of these troubled paranormals suddenly having uncontrolled access to their powers adds to the suspense.  \n  - Conditions on the island deteriorate, and chaos reigns as nightmares begin to come to life. The concept of the nightmares was both fascinating and horrifying.  \n\n- **Climax and Ending:**  \n  - There was quite a bit happening at the end, and I‚Äôm excited to see where the next book will lead!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Sweet Nightmare* is an engaging and action-packed start to the Calder Academy series. While my attention waned slightly in the latter half, the intriguing world-building, dynamic characters, and suspenseful plot kept me invested. I‚Äôm looking forward to the next installment!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance between Clementine and Jude had its ups and downs, marked by significant strife, but ultimately felt disconnected. Certain elements of their relationship seemed mismatched, creating a disjointed impression. While the book featured plenty of monster chaos that was entertaining, it often felt overwhelming and disorganized, reminiscent of the chaotic climax in *Cabin in the Woods*. The major conflicts lacked cohesion, and I believe the story would have benefited from either fewer key events or a tighter alignment among them.",

The progression of the storm and the mystery behind the released nightmares were compelling elements.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance between Clementine and Jude had its moments, with plenty of strife and struggle, but the end result felt a bit off. Some aspects of their relationship didn‚Äôt seem to fit together well, leaving it feeling disjointed.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The characters, setting, and events felt surface-level, even with the secrets revealed.

However, the addition of the characters being mates felt repetitive, as this was a common theme in the first series.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential:**  \n  While I didn‚Äôt hate the book, I thought it could have been a lot better. Despite its flaws, I‚Äôm willing to continue the series and reread this book closer to the release of the second installment to see if my experience improves.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had its moments, but it suffered from a confusing start, underdeveloped character arcs, and repetitive romantic tropes. However, it showed potential, and I‚Äôm hopeful that a second read or the next book in the series might improve my overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While it has some pacing issues and lacks emotional depth in certain areas, it‚Äôs a fun read that sets up potential for the series. I‚Äôll continue with the next book, but it‚Äôs not a must-read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It follows Clementine, the daughter of the principal of Calder Academy, who has spent her entire life on the island where magical abilities are restricted. When monsters begin to overrun the island and students lose control of their powers, Clementine teams up with her childhood best friend/rival, Jude Abernathy-lee, to stop the chaos.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book is described as \"absolutely ridiculous in a truly CW kind of way,\" with a mix of supernatural elements like shifters, sirens, mermaids, and vampires. It also includes petty romantic drama and reasonably predictable twists and turns, making it a wild and entertaining ride.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  Despite its over-the-top nature, the book was fun to read. The reviewer acknowledges the absurdity but still found it enjoyable.  \n\n- **Author Controversy:**  \n  The reviewer mentions being unaware of any drama surrounding the author when they read the book and chooses not to address it in their review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Sweet Nightmare* is a chaotic, supernatural-filled story with a predictable yet entertaining plot.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Connection to Previous Series:**  \n  If you were a fan of Tracy Wolff‚Äôs *Crave* series, you‚Äôre in for a treat, as this is the new spin-off series. It‚Äôs set in the same universe and features Izzy and Remy! (Though this book isn‚Äôt ‚Äútheir‚Äù story‚Äîthat will be the third in the *Calder Academy* series, per Tracy Wolff‚Äôs website.)  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The book has a lot of ‚Äúwill they / won‚Äôt they‚Äù tension, an ex-best-friend-to-lovers trope, plenty of paranormal goodness, and monsters. There are also fun references to Beatles songs sprinkled throughout, making it a very enjoyable read.  \n\n- **Pacing and Chapter Structure:**  \n  A bonus for me was the very short chapters! It made it easy to stay up too late reading, as I kept telling myself, ‚Äújust one more chapter‚Äù over and over again.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  One thing I wish the book had done differently was incorporate dual timelines. It would have been nice to see the start of Clementine and Jude‚Äôs relationship from the beginning, with the story going back and forth between past and present. Instead, we‚Äôre thrown into the story with Clementine already in love with Jude, and we never really get to see their relationship blossom. I think I would have enjoyed the love story more if it had been developed that way. That said, I still shipped them, so it all worked out in the end!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and engaging read, especially for fans of Tracy Wolff‚Äôs *Crave* series. While I would have preferred a dual timeline to better explore Clementine and Jude‚Äôs relationship, the book‚Äôs short chapters, paranormal elements, and enjoyable tropes made it a satisfying experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded down)"

The storyline lacked proper development, and there were noticeable holes in the backstories and character arcs.  \n\n- **Enjoyment of Specific Sections:**  \n  Despite my overall disappointment, I did find the last 50-75 pages of *Sweet Nightmare* enjoyable.  \n\n- **Potential and Future Interest:**  \n  I believe the story still has potential, and I plan to continue reading the series as new books are released. However, *Sweet Nightmare* didn‚Äôt captivate me as much as *Crave* did.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I remain invested in the Crave series and see potential in its overarching story, *Sweet Nightmare* fell short of my expectations due to its rushed pacing, underdeveloped plot, and inconsistent character backstories. I hope future installments recapture the magic of the earlier books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The action-packed plot and unique setting were engaging, but the lack of deeper character connections held me back from fully immersing myself in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It successfully reconnected me with a familiar world and characters, particularly Remy, whom I hope to see more of in the future. While it stands on its own, fans of Tracey‚Äôs other series will appreciate the connections and crossovers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The author provides rich detail, particularly in the fight scenes, but this often leads to a dragging pace throughout much of the book. While there are enjoyable moments, the inconsistent pacing can make the narrative feel unnecessarily prolonged. Events unfold over just a couple of days, which strains credulity as it seems implausible for characters to function without sleep or food. Although some twists, like Jude's accidental killing of his father, Clementine's mother not being her birth mother, and the revelation surrounding Carolina's murder, are intriguing, they feel overwhelming and are introduced too late in the plot‚Äîespecially in the final chapters. Additionally, the ending comes across as abrupt and unresolved, with several new elements, such as Jude‚Äôs mother, Clementine‚Äôs father, and the oracle friends, being introduced all at once.",

Furthermore, the romantic relationship between Clementine and Jude feels rushed and unrealistic, particularly in light of their estranged history. The concept of ‚Äúmating‚Äù between different types of paranormals is introduced abruptly, lacking proper explanation or buildup.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story is set on the remote Calder Academy, where paranormal teens with criminal backgrounds are sent. The protagonist, Clementine Calder, is a Manticore and the daughter of the school‚Äôs headmistress. She has spent her entire life on the island, unable to use her magical abilities due to a protective spell.  \n   - The plot gains momentum when an unexpected hurricane threatens the island, and Clementine, along with her former crush Jude, uncovers secrets that endanger the entire school.  \n   - The tension is consistently high, making the book a page-turner. However, the pacing can feel chaotic at times, with too many events happening in quick succession, making it hard to keep track.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The dark and eerie setting of the island, with its old buildings and creepy monsters, is fascinating and adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and World-Building:**  \n   - A significant drawback is the introduction of too many creatures and characters without proper development or explanation, which can be overwhelming for the reader.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n   - The book is much darker and more brutal than expected, which may appeal to fans of gritty, dark Romantasy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSweet Nightmare is a strong start to Tracy Wolff‚Äôs new Romantasy series, set in the same world as her Crave series. While it has its flaws, such as chaotic pacing and underdeveloped characters, the high tension, intriguing setting, and dark tone make it an enjoyable read. I would recommend it to fans of the Crave series and anyone who enjoys dark Romantasy. I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to continuing the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Appreciation and Expectations:**  \n   - I am OBSESSED with the Crave series. Covet and Charm are two of my all-time favorite books (followed by ACMAF for reference). I have read the Crave series books 2-4 times at this point.  \n   - I was very excited for the journey to continue and to get more of Remy, but I am sooooo disappointed.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The second half of Cherish (the last book of the series) felt rushed, with a lot of random stuff and no rhyme or reason. This book felt very similar.  \n   - There was no storyline or flow; it was all chaos. Everything happens in two days, and the FMC literally doesn‚Äôt get a break at all.  \n   - I love a good fast-paced book, but this was just total chaos with no flow.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters are not developed at all.  \n   - The relationship between the two main characters is rushed (obviously), and you don‚Äôt get enough background info, even though there are a few flashbacks.  \n   - Grace and Clementine have very similar qualities, which I did appreciate.  \n\n- **Violence and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The book was so violent for no reason, and it didn‚Äôt add anything to the story. It happens so fast, and the FMC doesn‚Äôt ever get a chance to heal from her continuous, almost deadly injuries.  \n\n- **Plot Coherence and Logic:**  \n   - There were some things that were just so confusing and didn‚Äôt make sense for the story.  \n   - The story did come together a bit at the end, but it felt like there were so many loopholes.  \n   - I understand leaving some things unanswered for the next book, but it was not done in a good way at all.  \n\n- **Author Comparison and Disappointment:**  \n   - It‚Äôs hard to believe that it‚Äôs the same author who wrote my very favorite books and series of all time. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs the same author at all.  \n   - I really hope she‚Äôs able to get it together by the next book and especially by Remy and Izzy‚Äôs book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I adore the Crave series and hold Covet and Charm in high regard, this book fell short of my expectations. It felt rushed, chaotic, and lacked the depth and coherence I associate with the author‚Äôs previous works. Despite some redeeming qualities, such as the similarities between Grace and Clementine, the overall execution left me disappointed. I remain hopeful for improvement in future installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot had promise but ultimately fell short. It suffered from numerous unresolved threads and a lack of effective world-building. The fight scenes were uninspired, and the unnecessary twists only served to confuse, detracting from the story's overall purpose. Remy‚Äôs abrupt ability to create a portal, without any explanation or struggle, felt frustrating and poorly executed. The ending was disappointing, leaving me speechless‚Äîthough not in a good way.",

Jude was equally unlikable, often acting like a jerk, and his line about being Clementine's worst nightmare was cringe-worthy. Their love story felt poorly executed and failed to resonate with me.

The romance between Clementine and Jude feels forced and lacks believable progression; the sudden declaration of love and the concept of ‚Äúmates‚Äù seem to come out of nowhere, making their relationship feel contrived.",

Additionally, the absence of a clear plot twist was disappointing. What I expected to be a red herring revealed itself as part of the antagonists, making the outcome predictable rather than surprising.",

Information is thrown in as if it‚Äôs obvious, but it‚Äôs not. It would likely be more enjoyable after reading the main *Assoiff√©s* series.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot is improbable and overly packed with events. Everything happens within 48 hours, with characters constantly on the brink of death, injured, or running around non-stop. The pacing is so fast that there‚Äôs no emotional weight to anything.  \n   - The setting during a Category 5 hurricane adds to the absurdity. Even with supernatural abilities (which are suppressed by the school), it‚Äôs impossible to believe they can function in such extreme conditions.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - Despite frequent deaths, including those of characters close to the protagonist, there‚Äôs no emotional impact. Deaths are mentioned casually, and the protagonist, Cl√©mentine, doesn‚Äôt have time to grieve because she‚Äôs constantly in danger.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - The romance with Jude feels forced and unconvincing. He repeatedly asks Cl√©mentine to trust him but provides no reason to do so, as he‚Äôs overly secretive. Even in the midst of chaos and death, Cl√©mentine‚Äôs obsession with him feels unrealistic.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending is rushed and poorly executed. New characters appear out of nowhere to reveal the main secret, and everything is resolved too quickly.  \n\n- **World-Building and Creatures:**  \n   - The variety of supernatural creatures (e.g., manticore, triton) is a positive aspect, but their powers and backgrounds are underdeveloped, which is a missed opportunity.  \n\n- **Language and Translation:**  \n   - The nickname ‚ÄúJean-Foir√©s‚Äù (or ‚ÄúJean-Jerks‚Äù in English) is poorly chosen and doesn‚Äôt add value to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel feels disjointed, overly chaotic, and emotionally shallow.

The story failed to engage me from the outset, leading to multiple restarts as I struggled to grasp the narrative, only to realize it was the writing style at fault. Once I was immersed, I found the story entertaining, but the timeline felt implausible; most events unfolded in just 2‚Äì3 days, which didn‚Äôt justify the book's length. Additionally, there were several plot holes, including the unclear motives of the Jean Jerks, the origins of Eva's powers, and Jude's guilt regarding Carolina's fate. The mating subplot also seemed random and unnecessary, better suited for a future installment.",

The lack of clear worldbuilding, underdeveloped characters, chaotic pacing, and emotionally distant romance left me unsatisfied. Despite my initial enthusiasm, I won‚Äôt be reading further in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

A slower, more varied timeline would have enhanced character development and made for a more satisfying read.",

I would have preferred more emphasis on developing the two main protagonists, which could have set the stage for a more believable and epic romance.

            "The book begins with an intriguing mystery surrounding the Male Main Character (MMC), but that mystery stretches over nearly 50% of the narrative, ultimately becoming repetitive and frustrating rather than compelling. The ending leaves much to be desired, with Jude‚Äôs mother‚Äôs involvement and the actions of the Jean Jerks feeling underdeveloped and unresolved. Additionally, the hurricane subplot appears superfluous, failing to have any meaningful impact on the overall story. At 14 hours long, the book feels unnecessarily lengthy, with significant portions not contributing to the plot. The pacing is inconsistent, and elements like the painting/tapestry, despite their potential importance, are underutilized.",
            "In this story, Jude, the male main character, often comes across as excessively brooding, and his persistent reluctance to embrace love becomes tiresome. Meanwhile, Clementine, the female main character, appears overly emotional, a trait that can be partially excused given their high school environment.",
            "The introduction of the mating bond seemed arbitrary and lacked proper explanation. There was insufficient context regarding how mating bonds function in this world, leaving readers puzzled about Clementine's awareness of them. Additionally, the revelation that the painting belonged to Clementine‚Äôs father felt rushed and awkwardly fitted into the narrative, resembling an info dump rather than a seamlessly integrated plot element."

The pacing felt off, and the repetitive nature of the plot made it drag. The same cycle kept happening: boy kisses girl, boy runs away due to a secret, someone gets harmed or dies, and the cycle repeats until the secret is revealed. This made the story feel unnecessarily long, and I believe half the pages could have been cut without losing anything significant.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing itself isn‚Äôt bad. I didn‚Äôt have any major issues with the prose or the author‚Äôs style. However, the character names (Clementine and her boyfriend calling her Kumquat) felt a bit cringe-worthy and took me out of the story at times.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The short chapters were a positive aspect, as they made the book feel more digestible. Each chapter ended with a cliffhanger, which is a good technique to keep readers hooked. However, despite this, I had no problem putting the book down for a month and focusing on other books that held my attention better.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I didn‚Äôt feel particularly connected to the characters, especially the main character, Clementine. The lack of depth in their development made it hard for me to care about their journey or the secrets they were hiding.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the book wasn‚Äôt terrible, it didn‚Äôt captivate me. I read the first 100 pages thoroughly, skimmed to the halfway point, and then skipped to the epilogue. Surprisingly, I didn‚Äôt feel like I missed much, which speaks to how unnecessary some parts of the story felt. I have no intention of continuing with the rest of the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a mixed experience for me. While the writing wasn‚Äôt bad and the short chapters were a nice touch, the repetitive plot, lack of engagement, and unremarkable characters made it a struggle to finish.

The warning at the beginning highlights this, but I believe it‚Äôs too explicit even for some adults. As a Christian, I‚Äôm particularly uncomfortable with the frequent use of cuss words in the first ten pages.  \n\n- **Author‚Äôs Approach to the Spin-Off Series:**  \n  I feel the author, Tracy Wolff, is misleading her audience. The original Crave series was much milder, and now, by introducing such explicit material in the spin-off, she‚Äôs luring teens into content they shouldn‚Äôt be exposed to. This feels like a betrayal of the trust built with the original series.  \n\n- **Impact on Youth:**  \n  I‚Äôm deeply concerned about the corruption of today‚Äôs youth, and I believe this book contributes to that. The explicit content in the spin-off series is a travesty, and the author is guilty of promoting such material to young readers.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Disappointment:**  \n  I‚Äôm not impressed with this book so far.

            "This story is shrouded in layers of mystery and secrets, prompting readers to theorize and search for explanations. However, the conflicting scenarios can sometimes feel confusing, leaving me unsure of what I was reading. At 700 pages, the book feels overly long, especially for a plot that unfolds over just three days; substantial filler content could have been trimmed. The conclusion is packed with revelations and a cliffhanger, effectively setting the stage for a sequel. \n\nThe narrative follows Clementine, who has spent her life at Calder School, a haven for troubled supernatural youth. Three years prior, her cousin and best friend was mysteriously imprisoned, and her other best friend, Jude, abruptly cut off communication. The tension escalates when Clementine and Jude are compelled to work together, forcing them to confront old wounds and uncover the reasons behind Jude‚Äôs abandonment. A powerful and rare storm intensifies the danger, adding to the intrigue and keeping the story engaging.",

The lack of resolution is frustrating and makes the narrative feel incomplete.  \n\n- **Character Reactions and Logic:**  \n  The characters seem to ignore the chaos around them, using the excuse that it‚Äôs been a long 24-48 hours. This feels like a weak justification for their lack of curiosity or effort to make sense of the situation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel struggles with a lack of plot development, unresolved questions, and illogical character behavior. The overall experience is confusing and unsatisfying, as the story fails to provide clarity or meaningful resolution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot Coherence and Structure**  \n   - The plot is overly convoluted with too many elements crammed in without proper explanation or context.  \n   - There‚Äôs no clear direction, and the story feels like a series of disjointed side quests rather than a cohesive narrative.  \n   - The pacing is inconsistent, with long stretches of inaction followed by sudden, unexplained events.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System**  \n   - The world-building is poorly executed, with numerous paranormal species introduced without any explanation of their origins, traits, or inter-species dynamics.  \n   - The magic system lacks rules or logic, making it impossible to understand how or why characters can do what they do.  \n   - The setting, particularly the academy, is confusing‚Äîit‚Äôs unclear whether it‚Äôs a school or a prison, and the rules governing it are inconsistent.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships**  \n   - The protagonist, Clementine, is frustratingly inconsistent, with unexplained emotional outbursts and unresolved backstory.  \n   - The romance between Clementine and Jude feels forced and lacks depth, with repetitive and childish interactions.  \n   - Supporting characters are introduced abruptly, with no context or development, making it hard to care about their roles or motivations.  \n\n- **Realism and Logic (Within the Story‚Äôs Framework)**  \n   - The portrayal of a Category 5 hurricane is wildly unrealistic, with characters wandering outside and surviving impossible conditions.  \n   - The lack of logical consistency in the story‚Äôs events (e.g., shifting without losing clothes, magical wards failing randomly) undermines the narrative.  \n   - The story fails to consider the real-world implications of its magical events, such as how a magical hurricane would affect the surrounding regions.  \n\n- **Tone and Target Audience**  \n   - The tone feels inconsistent, with elements that seem more middle-grade (e.g., punny chapter titles, juvenile humor) clashing with mature themes like death and violence.  \n   - The frequent use of F-bombs feels out of place and doesn‚Äôt align with the otherwise young tone of the book.  \n   - The musical references (e.g., Beatles, Aerosmith) are niche and may not resonate with the intended YA audience.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement and Stakes**  \n   - The stakes feel hollow because the constant death and destruction are met with little emotional reaction from the characters.  \n   - The reader is given no reason to care about the characters or their struggles, as their motivations and backstories are poorly developed.  \n   - The lack of context for key events (e.g., Clementine‚Äôs past conflicts, the mating bond) makes it hard to invest in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a chaotic mess with no clear direction, poorly developed characters, and a world that defies logic at every turn. The excessive number of paranormal elements, combined with a lack of explanation or coherence, makes it nearly impossible to follow or enjoy. The romance is unconvincing, the stakes feel meaningless, and the tone is inconsistent. While there are occasional moments of humor or creativity, they are overshadowed by the overwhelming flaws in the storytelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific numerical rating is provided in the review, but the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative."

            "The plot is chaotic and lacks direction. Despite a flurry of events‚Äîdeaths, ghosts, monsters‚Äîthe story feels aimless and ultimately uninspiring. The pacing is uneven, with a jarring acceleration in the final chapters that leaves numerous questions unresolved and readers waiting for the next installment. Additionally, the central MacGuffin, a magical tapestry, is underused, and its resolution comes off as rushed and unsatisfying.",
            "The book was initially marketed as Remy‚Äôs story, but unfortunately, he was sidelined, which was disappointing. As a character I appreciated in the original, Remy was reduced to a minor role, merely making portals and delivering sassy lines. His backstory‚Äîhis time in prison, unique abilities, and grief over his best friend's death‚Äîwas completely overlooked. Instead, the focus shifted to other characters who lacked the depth necessary to sustain the narrative. Their relationships felt underdeveloped and uninteresting.\n\nJude's character is excessively dramatic, with his trauma poorly explored until the end, resulting in inconsistencies. His abilities, such as controlling nightmares, are inadequately explained. Meanwhile, Clementine is portrayed as weak, relying on Jude for rescue, which feels frustrating and outdated in a supposedly feminist YA novel.",
            "The exposition feels lazy, relying too heavily on music references and a lackluster game of two truths and a lie to reveal the characters' backstories. The writing lacks structure, resulting in a disjointed narrative that is difficult to follow. Additionally, the absence of a clear three-act structure worsens the pacing issues.",
            "The magic system in the story is poorly defined and inconsistent, with events occurring without sufficient explanation, requiring readers to simply accept them. The introduction of numerous supernatural beings and their political structures, such as the Fae Mafia, adds to the confusion and feels underdeveloped. Overall, the worldbuilding lacks depth and coherence, particularly as the rules governing the supernatural realm remain ambiguous, leading to significant logical gaps, such as the mechanics of nightmare harvesting and the rationale behind it.",
            "The damsel-in-distress trope feels outdated, particularly in a book marketed as feminist. While it attempts to address heavy themes like trauma and loss, the exploration is superficial, resulting in shallow and unconvincing character struggles."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Sweet Nightmare* is a disappointing addition to the author's works. The sidelining of Remy, the poorly developed main characters, the chaotic plot, and the lack of coherent worldbuilding make it a frustrating read. The book struggles with pacing, exposition, and thematic depth, leaving readers with more questions than answers. While the concept had potential, the execution fell flat, making it a difficult and unsatisfying read.",

            "The pacing of the book is severely lacking. Set over just a couple of days, it alternates jarringly between frantic mortal panic and snarky teenage banter. It seems the author attempted to fit several novels' worth of plot into one, resulting in a chaotic reading experience. Moments of calm are rare and feel abrupt, leading directly into the next dramatic event without a natural buildup. The plot becomes especially disjointed in the final fifty pages, introducing major elements like a surprise mating bond with no prior foreshadowing or explanation. Key aspects of the world, such as the mating bond, are never established early on, making them feel out of place. Many story elements lack consistency and logical explanation; for instance, the magic tapestry's properties are vague and contradictory, and its significance is unclear. Additionally, the protagonist's abilities, such as seeing ghosts and glimpses of the past and future, are introduced but remain unexplored, adding to the overall confusion.",
            "The characters lack significant development, as the relentless focus on action leaves little space for readers to connect with them. Many come across as generic, serving primarily as conduits for snarky dialogue rather than as fully realized individuals. The female main character is particularly underdeveloped, her personality largely defined by inconsistently portrayed trauma.",
            "The tone of the story is inconsistent, fluctuating between dark, high-stakes drama and lighthearted, snarky banter, leading to a jarring reading experience. While themes of trauma and survival are introduced, they remain underexplored, resulting in a superficial treatment of these important subjects.",
            "The world-building in the story is insufficient and lacks clarity. The setting‚Äîa school/prison for dark creatures‚Äîis poorly defined, leaving the narrative unmoored. Details such as the reasons students are sent to the Academy and what distinguishes it from other prisons are vague and confusing."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a disjointed and chaotic mess, with poor pacing, underdeveloped characters, and inconsistent world-building. The plot introduces too many elements too quickly, leaving little room for meaningful development or explanation. While there are some intriguing ideas, they are overshadowed by the lack of cohesion and logical consistency. Overall, the book feels like a rushed draft rather than a polished final product.",

Much of the content was filled with repetitive and insipid complaints from the 17-year-old protagonist, making it a chore to get through.\n\n- **Use of Tropes:**  \n  The story relied heavily on overused YA tropes, such as \"fated mates,\" which felt forced and frustrating. It seemed like the author intentionally included as many popular tropes as possible, which detracted from the originality of the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character, Clementine, was irritating and lacked depth, embodying clich√©s like stupid nicknames, self-deprecation, mom-hating, and grieving over a lost friend. She felt like a carbon copy of the protagonist from \"Fourth Wing,\" which was not a positive comparison. The supporting characters were one-dimensional, adhering to stereotypes (e.g., the tough one, the funny one, the mysterious one) without any meaningful development. The excessive number of characters further diluted any potential connection, as none were given enough time to grow or stand out.\n\n- **Concept and Execution:**  \n  The premise was intriguing, resembling a reimagined \"Wednesday,\" but the execution fell flat. The idea was dulled down to its most boring form, failing to capitalize on its potential.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  Despite being part of a series, the book did not leave me interested in continuing. The lack of engaging characters and overreliance on tropes made it unlikely that I would invest more time in this series.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an interesting concept, its execution was disappointing. The excessive length, reliance on overused tropes, and lack of character development made it a tedious read. The story failed to stand out in the YA genre, and I have no intention of continuing with the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (originally considered 2 stars but decided against it due to the book's tedious nature)."

Additionally, the introduction of a mating bond feels unearned and forced.",

It seemed like a fun, light read to enjoy in my free time.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters felt empty, flat, and lacking in charm or personality. They failed to engage me or make me care about their journey.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was dull, repetitive, and incredibly boring. Even halfway through the book, nothing significant had happened to justify continuing the story or the series.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style reminded me of something a 14-year-old might write for a school assignment. It lacked depth and sophistication, which made it difficult to stay invested.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author's Other Work:**  \n  This is my second attempt with this author, and unfortunately, it seems she‚Äôs going on my \"hard no\" list. While I managed to finish *Anhelo*, this book didn‚Äôt hold my interest in the same way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite an intriguing premise, *Dulce Pesadilla* fell flat for me due to its uninteresting characters, repetitive plot, and immature writing style.

Additionally, the story fails to address the basic needs or traits of vampires, such as their dependence on blood.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel struggles with weak character development, a lack of coherent plot, and inconsistent character behavior, particularly with Izzy. While the playful nicknames provide some entertainment, the overall narrative feels chaotic and underdeveloped, leading me to stop reading at the 60% mark.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF (Did Not Finish) at 60%."
