The first four chapters were overloaded with unnecessary details, including Rosie’s job, her co-workers, and an extended phone conversation with a male Karen. In fact, the subplot involving the stray cat proved to be more engaging than the main storyline.",

The third-person perspective made the reading experience intolerable, which is surprising since I usually enjoy this viewpoint.

I appreciated that Rosie and Aled developed a friendship before pursuing a relationship, which made their romance all the more satisfying. However, I wished there had been more focus on their relationship, as it felt somewhat underexplored. Rosie was incredibly relatable, and I admired how her struggles were addressed without overshadowing her character. Her family, job, and living situation added depth to her persona. Aled, with his soft, shy demeanor and heart of gold, was a refreshing departure from the typical cocky protagonist. I truly enjoyed his personality.",

            "I found Rosie to be a likable and relatable character, and I absolutely adored Aled—where can I find a man like him? Their blossoming friendship was beautifully written, and I was drawn into Rosie's storyline from the very beginning. While I struggled to connect with her family and James, I believe that was intentional. I felt a deep sympathy for Rosie throughout the story. Although her 'plus-size' was mentioned frequently, I felt it wasn't necessary for the plot.",

I felt really sorry for Rosie throughout the story.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  Rosie's 'plus-size' was mentioned quite a lot, but I don't think it really needed to be, as the storyline didn't require it.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Apart from a few minor issues, I really enjoyed the book. It was a fabulous read, and I was really sorry to finish it! This was my first book by this author, but it definitely won't be my last.

She then rage-quits her soul-crushing job, which sets the stage for her journey of self-discovery. Her hot Welsh neighbor, Aled, is a quiet, emotionally intelligent, and undeniably attractive character who becomes her roommate. Their dynamic is heartwarming, and Rosie’s transformation into a more confident and self-assured woman is satisfying to witness. ",

The British setting, complete with accents and a cuppa to solve problems, adds a charm that I find irresistible.

They eventually get together, but the intimate scenes are not explicitly depicted, which I found slightly disappointing but forgivable.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Cultural Appeal:**  \n  I am often forgiving of a twee, low-smut romance if it takes place in London. The British setting, complete with accents and a \"cuppa\" to solve problems, adds a charm that I find irresistible. Perhaps it’s because I was raised by Bridget Jones that I now idolize an accented, curvy, clumsy British heroine.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Rosie, the protagonist, is a millennial Bridget Jones who gets dumped by her very below-average boyfriend after dating/mothering him for a decade. She then rage-quits her soul-crushing job, which sets the stage for her journey of self-discovery. Her hot Welsh neighbor, Aled, is a quiet, emotionally intelligent, and undeniably attractive character who becomes her roommate. Their dynamic is heartwarming, and Rosie’s transformation into a more confident and self-assured woman is satisfying to witness.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance between Rosie and Aled is sweet and understated. They eventually get together, but the intimate scenes are not explicitly depicted, which I found slightly disappointing but forgivable. The focus is more on emotional connection and personal growth rather than physical passion.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is a quiet and sweet one about a woman who turns her life around and finds her happy ending. While it starts a little slow, the pacing picks up, and the narrative becomes engaging. The absence of dramatic tropes like assault, kidnapping, or threats makes it a refreshing read.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book is full of heart, self-discovery, a makeover scene, friendship, and romance. It’s a low-smut, feel-good story that delivers a satisfying emotional journey.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis British rom-com is a charming and heartwarming read, perfect for fans of low-smut, character-driven stories. While it may start slowly, the journey of self-discovery, friendship, and romance makes it a worthwhile and enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Smut: 1.4 stars  \n- Romance: 4.7 stars  \n- Story: 4.3 stars  \n- London-based twee romances: 6.3 stars"

Unfortunately, the plot is predictable, lacking surprises and depth. The pacing is uneven, with certain elements, such as \"the spare room,\" introduced early but only becoming relevant much later. Additionally, the narrative is confined to Rosie’s perspective, which restricts the story's depth and excitement; incorporating dual perspectives could have added more dimension.",

The supporting characters, such as Rhaina, Niamh, and Aled, are more intriguing but suffer from insufficient development. Aled, with his mysterious and bookish demeanor, has interactions with Rosie that feel unrealistic and underexplored. Rosie’s family is insufferable, and Aled’s family, introduced late in the story, could have added significant depth if addressed earlier. The romance between Rosie and Aled is minimal, lacking chemistry beyond fleeting glances and occasional touches. Their relationship feels shallow, and Aled’s background remains largely unexplored until the end. Overall, the story lacks substance and meaningful character development.

The author’s selection of karaoke songs—Cher’s \"Believe,\" Bonnie Tyler’s \"Total Eclipse of the Heart,\" and Paul Simon’s \"You Can Call Me Al\"—added a charming element.

James, the soon-to-be ex-boyfriend, is a character readers will love to hate; he takes advantage of Rosie, shows her no respect, and lies to her. Compounding her struggles, Rosie's family is unsupportive, fat-shaming her and believing she’ll never do better than James. Her parents discourage her from attending university, with her mother fixating on Rosie losing weight and getting married. In contrast, Aled, the new tenant, is a breath of fresh air—he cleans without being asked, cooks, and has a passion for reading.

            "The book features a slow burn romance, with the characters not sharing a kiss until about 80% in, which adds a charming touch to the friends-to-lovers dynamic and the silent pining. However, the final 20% of the story feels rushed and less satisfying. The abrupt conclusion to the slow burn leads to chaotic events and an overload of misunderstandings that detract from the narrative. The return of an ex, Aled’s misinterpretation, the protagonist’s mother suffering a heart attack, and a flat-selling revelation all feel forced and unnecessary. These conflicts seem like an attempt to inject drama after the slow build-up, ultimately making the resolution feel hurried and less impactful.",
            "In this story, Rosie, the sweet but initially timid protagonist, embarks on a satisfying journey of self-growth following her breakup. Her efforts to assert herself with her family and ex are particularly compelling. Aled, the introverted landlord and neighbor, is a well-developed character who evolves beyond just being a flatmate. His dynamic with Rosie adds depth and engagement to the narrative.",
            "The writing style was engaging and drew me into the characters and their development, especially in the first 80% of the book. However, the final chapters lost some of that engagement, leading me to skim through to reach the inevitable resolution of the misunderstandings.",

Even the often-dreaded third act conflict is handled with a grounded approach, balancing creativity and humor. Not long ago, I found myself losing interest in the romance genre, as many stories felt unrealistic and overly dramatic, with stakes that seemed absurdly high—often for the sake of a man. But this book revitalized my appreciation for the genre.",

As they navigate cohabitation, they gradually open up to each other about life, self-discovery, and the importance of choosing oneself. The author skillfully crafts strong female characters with their own motivations and ambitions, independent of the men in their lives. This refreshing portrayal was something I hadn’t realized was missing from my recent reads, and I was thrilled to finally encounter characters who embody such depth and agency.",

            "The premise of shared living and forced proximity, which has the potential to be engaging, only materializes halfway through the book. The slow pacing makes it a challenge to stay invested. Ultimately, the story centers more on Rosie’s journey of self-discovery than on romance, which may not meet readers’ expectations.",
            "Rosie embodies the charming yet clumsy Frazzled British Woman archetype often found in romcoms. While her character is endearing, she is frequently overshadowed by others, including her ex-boyfriend, family, and overbearing mother, making her both sympathetic and frustrating to follow. The male main character is a typical trope: initially aloof but with a hidden sweetness. Although he has an appealing professor vibe, his character feels underdeveloped, and the lack of chemistry between him and Rosie diminishes the romantic aspect of the story. Overall, his limited presence makes it hard to view the narrative as a true romance.",

While her character is endearing, she is constantly bulldozed by others, including her ex-boyfriend, her family, and her overbearing mother. This makes her sympathetic but also frustrating to follow.  \n\n- **Characterization (MMC - Aled):**  \n  The male main character (MMC) is described as cookie-cutter: initially aloof but with a sweetheart underneath. He has a professor vibe, which is appealing, but his presence in the story feels underdeveloped. There’s a lack of chemistry between him and Rosie, and he barely features enough to make the story feel like a true romance.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The premise of shared room and forced proximity, which could have been engaging, only kicks in halfway through the book. The pacing is slow, making it a struggle to finish. The story feels more focused on Rosie’s journey of self-discovery rather than a romance, which might not align with readers’ expectations.  \n\n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n  The book leans more toward \"chick-lit\" or \"women’s fiction\" rather than romance. The marketing might mislead readers expecting a light, fluffy romance. Instead, it delves into themes of self-actualization and personal growth, which might not resonate with everyone, especially those seeking escapism.  \n\n- **Personal Resonance:**  \n  The themes of a frazzled woman trying to find herself hit too close to home for me. I was looking for a fun, romantic read with fluff and sweetness, but this book felt too heavy and relatable in ways that didn’t provide the escape I wanted.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its sweet moments and an endearing protagonist, it struggles with pacing, underdeveloped romance, and a mismatch between its genre and marketing. It’s more about Rosie’s personal journey than a love story, which might not appeal to readers seeking a lighthearted romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "In this story, Rosie and James have been together for a decade, and Rosie anticipates a proposal. Instead, James abruptly ends their relationship through a letter and vacates their shared flat. Enter Aled, a new neighbor who temporarily moves in with Rosie while his own apartment is being renovated. As they spend time together, Rosie and Aled discover that their connection goes beyond friendship. While the narrative includes some engaging dramatic moments, such as miscommunication and a cross-country chase, it occasionally feels repetitive, particularly in Rosie’s introspective passages. Overall, the romance unfolds in a charming yet somewhat exaggerated manner.",
            "Rosie is a delightful and vibrant character, radiating positivity. In contrast, Aled is reserved and finds it challenging to connect with others, except for his students and Rosie, to whom he slowly reveals his true self. While this closed-door romance isn't my usual preference—especially since it hints at more without fully delivering—the story remains enjoyable. The romance is standard and features likable characters, though it does include some repetitive elements, particularly in Rosie’s inner monologue.",

            "I absolutely loved Rosie and immediately identified with her character. I was drawn to her eventual flatmate and the other vibrant characters in the story. The focus is on Rosie's empathy and kindness rather than her body image, which adds depth to her character. Her body insecurities are portrayed sensitively, enhancing the narrative. Although I typically prefer faster-paced romances, the slow burn between Rosie and her flatmate was so well-crafted that I found myself savoring the tension. The subtle hints that he falls for her first added an enjoyable layer to the story. Despite the lack of explicit scenes, the sexual tension is palpable, making the wait for their connection all the more rewarding.",

The conclusion is satisfying, though a bit cheesy, effectively tying up the narrative despite leaning into predictable tropes, such as the \"he falls first\" scenario. The plot centers on Rosie, who is unexpectedly dumped by her self-absorbed boyfriend of ten years. Struggling to pay rent, she strikes a deal with her enigmatic upstairs neighbor, Aled, who moves into her spare room while his flat undergoes renovations. This setup creates a forced proximity dynamic that drives much of the story.",

The story had some really lovely moments, like the roller skating scene and the blackout confession. I appreciated that there was no question of the FMC going back to her ex, which is a common trope in this genre. The third-act misunderstanding felt unnecessary. There was already enough drama with the breakup and the engagement party, and this plot point let the story down a bit. It felt uncharacteristic for the characters to suddenly stop communicating, which spoiled the flow. The story was pulled back at the end with the trip, which I appreciated.

While it’s charming in its own way, the slow-burn romance and awkward ending left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.7 ⭐️"

The book felt like a warm hug, and the slow-burn, classic rom-com vibe completely hit the spot for me.  \n\n- **Point of View (POV):**  \n  It took me a few chapters to get used to the third-person POV since most rom-coms I read are in first person. However, once I adjusted, I did enjoy the third-person perspective.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved the personal growth of Rosie throughout the book. Aled was portrayed as an ideal partner—a grown-up man who acts as an equal and supportive friend to Rosie. James, on the other hand, was annoying, but both characters felt like realistic depictions of real-life men.  \n\n- **World-Building and Community:**  \n  The sense of community created in the book was heartwarming and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Desire for Additional Perspectives:**  \n  I wish there had been a few chapters from Aled’s perspective to get more insight into his character.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  This book was a delightful read, and I’m looking forward to reading more from this author. It’s a great manual for what to do (and what not to do) in a relationship—men, take notes!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a comforting, slow-burn rom-com with a strong sense of community, relatable characters, and a writing style that felt like a warm hug.

He’s pretty much my favorite type of love interest—not at all smirky and winky. He’s a bit shy and holds back (and his feelings are slightly mysterious throughout a lot of the story), but he’s always kind.  \n\n- **Themes and Relatability:**  \n  - The main character’s relationship with her family (although luckily not my personal experience) will definitely be relatable to lots of women.  \n  - I appreciate how things ended concerning her family.

            "In this story, Rosie, the main character, experiences significant growth as she sheds toxic relationships and discovers more supportive connections. Aled, her love interest, begins as a mysterious figure but quickly becomes endearing as he reveals more of himself. Together, they are sensitive souls who complement each other beautifully, providing the support they each need. The supporting characters, aside from Rosie’s family and James, are fantastic, forming a diverse group that uplifts Rosie in various ways. I particularly enjoyed the slow-burn romance; Rosie and Aled's relationship develops gradually, creating a genuine and heartfelt connection."

However, I liked the concept so much that I started over and persevered, eventually finishing it—though with a massive migraine.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  Despite the challenges with the writing style, I thought the book was cute and enjoyed the concept.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a charming concept and cute characters, the unconventional writing style made it difficult to read and caused physical discomfort. Despite these challenges, I persisted and finished it, appreciating its charm but struggling with its execution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She was endearing and entertaining to read about, especially through her thoughts and perspective.  \n  - I actually liked all the characters, their relationships, and how they contributed to the plot.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The plot was engaging, but there were many instances where something fun or exciting was about to happen, and then it skipped right over it to the next day.  \n  - For example, scenes like fun-sounding drinks at a pub, where significant relationship-building could have occurred, or moments leading up to characters finally sleeping together, were skipped.  \n  - While I enjoyed everything I read, I felt like I missed out on big parts of the story.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  - Overall, I had a very good time reading the novel. It was a quick and easy read, which I appreciated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some missed opportunities in the plot and pacing, I found the characters, especially Rosie, to be well-developed and enjoyable. The book was entertaining and easy to read, making it a worthwhile experience overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

It has a very British, cutesy, and readable tone, making it enjoyable for fans of similar works like *Bridgerton* or *Bridget Jones*.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The story is set in an unrealistic version of London, which adds to its dreamy and utopian atmosphere.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The novel excels in character building, with well-crafted characters that make you want to keep reading, even when the plot stretches believability.  \n\n- **Plot and Believability:**  \n  While the plot is not very believable, it is balanced by the engaging characters and the sprinkling of genre clichés, which are present without becoming overly saccharine.  \n\n- **Friendships and Relationships:**  \n  The story presents a utopian example of friendships, adding to its charm and appeal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful romcom that thrives on its dreamy, unrealistic setting and strong character development. While the plot may not be entirely believable, the engaging characters and charming tone make it a very enjoyable read, especially for fans of British romantic comedies.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It evoked a strong emotional response, making it memorable and impactful.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Rosie and Aled have a heartwarming story and a real, genuine love. Their relationship feels authentic and well-developed, with each character given ample space to grow individually despite the forced proximity trope.\n\n- **Pacing and Relationship Progression:**  \n  While the romance isn’t a slow burn in the traditional sense (they liked each other pretty quickly), their journey to getting together still felt gradual and satisfying. The pacing, though not slow burn, worked well for their story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis romance is emotionally engaging and features well-developed characters with a genuine connection. While the pacing doesn’t fully align with the slow burn trope, the gradual progression of their relationship still feels rewarding and heartfelt.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While this was slightly annoying for me, given the volume and variety of books I read, there's nothing inherently wrong with it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really liked this novel. Despite my slight annoyance with the \"fade to black\" approach to romance, the story was engaging, the characters were well-developed, and the journey of self-love and hope was beautifully portrayed. It was a fun and uplifting read that left me feeling hopeful.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Originality:**\n   - The story is sweet and lighthearted, following Rosie, a young woman in a financial bind after her boyfriend unexpectedly breaks up with her and quits her job.\n   - The plot relies heavily on well-worn rom-com tropes, making it somewhat predictable.\n   - While charming, the story lacks originality and character development.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Rosie's character is central to the narrative, but her development feels limited.\n   - The supporting cast, including Rosie's friends, adds some depth to the story, but the focus remains primarily on Rosie's romantic entanglements.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - Laura Starkey's writing is engaging and easy to read, making the book ideal for those seeking a light, feel-good read.\n   - The writing style contributes to the overall charm of the story, even if the plot is predictable.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - The book offers some enjoyable moments and is a decent addition to the romantic comedy genre.\n   - Readers looking for a light, feel-good read will likely enjoy it, but those hoping for a more complex and innovative story may find it lacking.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Spare Room by Laura Starkey is a charming and lighthearted romantic comedy that, while enjoyable, relies on predictable tropes and lacks deeper character development. It’s a decent, if somewhat uninspired, addition to the genre, ideal for readers seeking a quick, feel-good read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."
