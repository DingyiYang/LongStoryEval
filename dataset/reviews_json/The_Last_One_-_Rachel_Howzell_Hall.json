            "This first book leans more towards fantasy, featuring a subtle romance subplot between the main character, Kai, and her love interest, Jadon.",
            "I absolutely loved the female main character; her banter and wit were particularly engaging in the first half of the book when she wakes up with no memories or sense of her surroundings. The characters are well-developed, and I appreciated the diversity, especially with the protagonist. As this is the author's debut in fantasy romance, I’m thrilled to see more Black authors entering this genre, which is often underrepresented. I can't wait for the next book!",
            "The writing in this book was impressive. I particularly enjoy when fantasy novels blend modern and fantastical language, although I'm uncertain about the specific setting.",
            "The world-building, including the cities, moths, and amulet elements, was intriguing. While some sections were initially confusing due to the protagonist's uncertainty, everything came together by the end.",
            "This is undoubtedly the most refreshing fantasy book I've encountered this year. It stands apart from any other fantasy I've read, and I couldn't be happier about it."

The mix of modern and fantasy language, along with the diverse representation, makes it a memorable and enjoyable experience. Despite some initial confusion, the story comes together beautifully by the end, leaving me eager for the next installment.",

It wasn't really like any fantasy book I've read this year, and I'm very happy about that.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing in this was good to me. I always love it when fantasy books mix modern and fantasy language, though I'm not sure what setting this book was in.  \n\n- **Plot and Subplots:**  \n  This first book is more fantasy with a smidge of a romance subplot with the fmc Kai and the love interest Jadon.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved the fmc so much; her banter and wit were great, especially in the first half of the book when she wakes up and has no memories or ideas of where she is. The characters are complex, and I loved the diversity, especially with the fmc.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The world, cities, moths, and amulet stuff was interesting. Some parts were confusing because the fmc was confused, but everything made sense by the end.  \n\n- **Representation and Genre Contribution:**  \n  This is the author's first fantasy romance, and I love it when Black authors write fantasy romance because they aren't popular in this genre. I'm excited for the next book!  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thanks to Red Tower for this arc!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book stands out as a unique and refreshing fantasy read with strong worldbuilding, complex characters, and a touch of romance. The mix of modern and fantasy language, along with the diverse representation, makes it a memorable and enjoyable experience. Despite some initial confusion, the story comes together beautifully by the end, leaving me eager for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25  \n\n**Read for:**  \n- Unique worldbuilding  \n- Fantasy romance  \n- Slow burn  \n- Memory loss/amnesia  \n- Cliffhanger"

            "The story occasionally dragged and became repetitive, which hindered engagement. The conflict involving Jadon's sister, Olivia, felt exaggerated, as Kai's supposed wrongdoing was minimal.",
            "Kai shines as a character with a sharp inner monologue and witty dialogue, though at times it leans toward the juvenile. Her relationship with Jadon, the love interest, suffers due to her mind-reading ability, which exposes his immediate attraction to her and diminishes the opportunity for a more nuanced, reluctant allies dynamic. Additionally, the supporting characters fall flat and feel underdeveloped.",
            "The book raises numerous unanswered questions, generating intrigue for the next installment. However, I wish it had revealed more to prevent the plot from feeling repetitive.",
            "The romance between Kai and Jadon suffers due to the mind-reading element, which detracts from the authenticity of their interactions. Some of their flirting feels more cringeworthy than charming. However, the premise is captivating: Kai, a mysterious girl, awakens in the woods with no memory of her identity. Hints about her powers, including a mysterious amulet, uniquely colored eyes and hair, and the ability to read minds, add intrigue, though the explanation of her powers is inconsistent."

        "conclusion": "While the novel had a fascinating premise and a strong, humorous protagonist in Kai, it suffered from inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped side characters, and a romance that felt forced due to the mind-reading element.

There are intriguing hints about her power, such as a mysterious amulet, uniquely colored eyes and hair, and the ability to read minds (though this power is inconsistently explained).  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Kai is a standout character with a humorous inner monologue and witty dialogue, though it occasionally borders on being juvenile. Her dynamic with Jadon, the love interest, is weakened by her mind-reading ability, which reveals his instant attraction to her, undermining the potential for a more complex, reluctant allies dynamic. The other characters, aside from Kai, felt underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story dragged at times and became repetitive, which made it harder to stay engaged. The conflict with Jadon's sister, Olivia, felt overblown, as Kai's supposed transgression was not truly a transgression.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance between Kai and Jadon was hindered by the mind-reading aspect, which made their interactions feel less organic. Some of the flirting came across as cringey rather than endearing.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mysteries:**  \n  The book left many questions unanswered, which creates intrigue for the next installment. However, I wish more had been revealed in this book to avoid the repetitive nature of the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a fascinating premise and a strong, humorous protagonist in Kai, it suffered from inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped side characters, and a romance that felt forced due to the mind-reading element.

While the memory loss trope occasionally feels drawn out, it serves the story well. The cliffhanger ending leaves me eager for the next installment to see how the characters' journeys unfold.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The narrative cleverly reveals that everyone harbors secrets, and the methods they use to conceal them are executed brilliantly. However, Jadon occasionally appears inconsistent; while we understand his character, his actions and dialogue don't always align—this isn't about morality, but rather how he is written. The representation is invaluable; hearing the nuances of my own voice reflected in a fantasy world is truly special.

One thing I love is that no two books of hers are alike.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is *chef's kiss*.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is fresh, and the slow burn is impeccably done. From the moment Kai sets out to reclaim her amulet, ish pops off, and nothing stops or slows down until the last page.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Kai and everything about her. Absolute Black girl magic.  \n  - 'Morally grey' done RIGHT. Everyone has secrets, and the way they move to hide them is executed perfectly.  \n  - Jadon reads as inconsistent at times. We have a firm idea of who he is, but sometimes his actions and words don't align—not morally, but in the way he's written.  \n\n- **Representation and Dialogue:**  \n  The representation is invaluable. Hearing how *I* would sound in a fantasy realm is truly special. I know some feel that the 'modern dialogue' (AAVE if we're being honest) can take you out of the world-building, but please don't stop.  \n\n- **Ending and Cliffhanger:**  \n  The cliffhanger hurt a little extra—borderline cruelty.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  This is a near-perfect standalone, despite being Hall's romantasy debut. I need more of it—not just a sequel, but a full series, merch, and a movie deal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRachel Howzell Hall has delivered another exceptional novel with fresh plotting, impeccable pacing, and unforgettable characters. Despite a minor inconsistency with Jadon and a painful cliffhanger, this book is a standout in her repertoire.

The story follows Kai as she wakes in the woods with no memory of her past and ends up in the impoverished Town of Maford, where she resides with the town blacksmith and the thief who robbed her. This setup was refreshing and engaging.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Banter:**  \n  I really loved the banter between Kai and the love interest, which was full of hilarious innuendo. Their interactions added a lot of charm and humor to the story. Additionally, Kai’s emotional journey as she uncovers her identity was compelling and well-executed.  \n\n- **Action Scenes and Pacing:**  \n  The action scenes felt excessive at times. While I understand that the characters are warriors, the repetitive banter-action-banter-action formula became tiresome. They fought a lot of creatures, many of which didn’t seem to contribute meaningfully to the plot. This made some parts of the book feel unnecessarily drawn out.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Tone:**  \n  The dialogue occasionally felt juvenile for an adult book, which I attribute more to the editing than the writing itself. This is a recurring issue I’ve noticed with Red Tower books.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The book excels in portraying badass warrior women who challenge traditional ideas of femininity.

It was exactly what I needed to start my year off right.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The world-building is present but unfolds slowly, which makes sense since the FMC starts with no memories and no knowledge of her identity. As the story progresses, both the FMC and the reader gradually learn more about the world, its magic system, and the creatures inhabiting it.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Dialogue:**  \n  - The banter between the characters, especially between the FMC and MMC, is excellent. Some moments had me laughing or squealing with delight.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  - The plot twists were well-executed. Some were predictable, while others completely caught me off guard.  \n\n- **Character Morality:**  \n  - I appreciated that both the FMC and MMC are morally grey, adding depth and complexity to their characters.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  - The book ends on a cliffhanger, but I’m excited to read the upcoming books in the series.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  - Thank you to Red Tower and Rachel Howzell Hall for gifting me the beautiful ARC!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful surprise, offering a unique and engaging story with strong character dynamics, intriguing world-building, and well-crafted plot twists.

The decision to end on a cliffhanger instead of wrapping up the story in a satisfying way further diminished my enjoyment. As a result, I won’t be continuing with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

These elements disrupted my immersion in the story, as they didn't align with the established setting.\n  \n- **Dialogue and Character Authenticity:**\n  - The dialogue, particularly the reference to \"chicken nuggets,\" seemed inconsistent with the medieval or fantasy tone of the world. It made the protagonist feel less authentic and more like a modern character, which was jarring.\n\n- **Engagement and Overall Enjoyment:**\n  - Despite these issues, I found the story engaging enough to read it in its entirety. While certain elements took me out of the narrative, the overall experience wasn't terrible, and I was able to stay invested in the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the inconsistent world-building and dialogue choices occasionally disrupted my immersion, the novel was still engaging enough to hold my interest until the end.
