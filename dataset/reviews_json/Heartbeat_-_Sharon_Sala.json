Amalie has faced significant challenges, and her bravery is truly inspiring—she's far stronger than I could ever be. Sean's words to her resonate deeply: “Bullshit. Don’t ever say or think that about me again. What I see in you is way beyond skin deep. You’re new to this town. We’re new to each other as adults. But we have history, lady. I’ve been holding onto you since before bubble gum. All I see… all I will ever see… is a woman of substance who makes me weak in the knees. You’re in charge. Lights on. Lights off. All I want is you in my arms.” Isn’t that just the sweetest thing? I certainly think so!",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The romance between Amalie and Sean was lovely and heartwarming.\n   - I particularly enjoyed how Amalie interacted with Sean’s family and how seamlessly they accepted her as one of their own.\n\n- **Suspense:**\n   - The suspense element of the story was engaging, even if it was relatively easy to unravel.\n\n- **Pacing:**\n   - The story felt overly long, especially in the last 30%, which could have been condensed into an epilogue.\n   - After the major plot points were resolved at the 70% mark, I found myself wondering what else could happen, which made the pacing feel uneven.\n\n- **Point of View (POV):**\n   - There were too many POVs, and the shifts between them felt random at times.\n   - In the audiobook version, the POV shifts were particularly jarring, sometimes occurring mid-paragraph, which required me to pause and re-listen to confirm whose perspective I was following.\n\n- **Series Context:**\n   - I didn’t realize this was the third book in a series when I started, but it didn’t significantly hinder my enjoyment.\n   - The references to past events were well-integrated and even piqued my interest in reading the previous books.\n   - The only minor drawback was not immediately recognizing some characters who were presumably introduced in earlier books, which caused slight confusion at the beginning.\n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**\n   - The audiobook format may have contributed to the challenges with POV shifts, as there was no clear indication of perspective changes.\n   - Despite this, the narration was enjoyable, and I appreciated the opportunity to listen to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I enjoyed this sweet second-chance romance with a touch of suspense. While the pacing felt uneven and the multiple POVs were occasionally confusing, the heartwarming romance and engaging suspense kept me invested. The story’s ties to the series were well-handled, and I’m now tempted to go back and read the previous books. Despite some minor issues, it was a satisfying read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Book 1 is less integral to the subsequent books.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n   - After an accident disrupts Amalie's life, she moves to Jubilee, where she falls in love and builds a new life.

The emotional connection between Amalie and Sean, rooted in their shared past, adds depth to the romance.  \n\n- **Weaknesses and Criticisms:**  \n   - The insta-love trope between Sean and Amalie feels unrealistic, given they only knew each other for a few months as kids.  \n   - The coincidental connections between Amalie, Sean, and Wolf (who all came to Jubilee as adults) stretch believability.  \n   - Inaccuracies in police procedures and the unrealistic speed of the judicial system detract from the story's credibility.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n   - Traci Odom narrates the audiobook. While I was less annoyed with her performance compared to Book 2, I still find her dialogue delivery lacking.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation for Future Books:**  \n   - Despite the nitpicky issues, I enjoyed the book enough to look forward to Book 4.

            "The plot contains notable logical inconsistencies. For example, the villainess's motivation for spending four years plotting against Wolf is questionable, especially considering her substantial wealth from three deceased ex-husbands. Furthermore, it is perplexing that she does not hire more competent legal representation despite her financial means.",

The villainess, a gold digger, is despicable, yet she is matched in superficiality by her wealthy, stoic husband, who married her for her youth and beauty. The lawyer is similarly underdeveloped, displaying open disdain for his client and behaving in a manner that could warrant disbarment. Overall, the characters' motivations, particularly those of the villainess, are unclear and lack depth.",

            "The story employs multiple third-person perspectives, including those of Sean, Amalie, Sean's mother, his brothers, Jubilee residents, criminals, cops, and the FBI. This narrative style cluttered the plot and hindered meaningful development. The helicopter crash, which the synopsis suggested would be a major event, ultimately served as a minor catalyst. Amalie rarely faced real danger, and the main story arc wrapped up by the 60 percent mark, leaving the remaining portion feeling disjointed and lacking direction. The book felt excessively long, and I nearly abandoned it around the 16 percent mark. The last 40 percent resembled a series of epilogues, making it drawn out and tedious. Additionally, the numerous subplots were mostly uninteresting, and the inclusion of psychics and an overemphasis on ancestry felt out of place, detracting from the overall narrative.",

Additionally, I wondered why all the leading characters are Pope men—couldn't there be a woman in the family who falls in love?",

The first few times, I thought it was a coincidence, but now it’s happened a third time, and it’s just a bit annoying. Can’t we see someone from a large family or with a super involved family? Also, why are all the leading characters Pope men? There really couldn’t be a woman in the family falling in love?  \n\n- **Plot Consistency and Payoff:**  \n  They made such a big deal about BJ coming back, but then didn’t include that in the book. Why the build-up of Shirley seeing how big he got, but we get nothing?  \n\n- **Focus on the Pope Family:**  \n  Why is it all about the Pope family? There are three families that founded the area. I didn’t like how all the last books were about the brothers. For such a large family, I would love to see other family members.  \n\n- **Repetitiveness and Engagement:**  \n  After the third book, I was reading but not as much into it as the first two. It just seems like a copy-paste of what happened before.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the book, I found certain aspects repetitive and lacking in diversity, particularly in character backgrounds and family focus. The plot had some unresolved build-ups, and the overemphasis on the Pope family made the story feel less dynamic over time.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️"

The book provides plenty of background information on the extended Pope family, though the sheer number of names can be a bit overwhelming at times.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity and Sub-Plots:**  \n  The story features a lot of different sub-plots, some of which feel quite far-fetched. The inclusion of paranormal elements was unexpected and added an unusual layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Concepts:**  \n  While I can appreciate the idea of \"it's a small world,\" the concept of lovers being re-born and re-united through eternity didn’t resonate with me as much.  \n\n- **Character Outcomes and Resolution:**  \n  I loved how the villains in the story received their comeuppance, and the happily-ever-after (HEA) ending was wonderfully satisfying.  \n\n- **Review Context:**  \n  I received an advanced copy of this book through NetGalley and am leaving this review voluntarily and honestly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Heartbeat* is an engaging read with a mix of complex sub-plots and unexpected paranormal elements. While some concepts didn’t fully resonate with me, the satisfying resolution and well-deserved outcomes for the characters made it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, after the main plot resolves, the story loses momentum, introducing several subplots that, while interesting, sometimes feel unnecessary. The book offers a mix of elements, including second-chance romance, found family, past lives, fated love, and suspense. The central plot focuses on the attempted murder of a Georgia billionaire, whose plane explodes over Jubilee, Kentucky, wrapping up about three-quarters of the way through. Alongside this, we follow Amalie’s quest to find her family and her developing romance with Sean, the tech expert she hires.",

While her immediate connection with Sean, the tech guy, felt overly sentimental and was my least favorite aspect, the narrator generally did a commendable job. However, at times, Amalie's character came off as somewhat flighty.",
