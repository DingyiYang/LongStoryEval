            "While it presents itself as a psychological thriller, the story delves much deeper. It examines the effects of childhood trauma on adulthood, echoes themes of *Tell Me Lies*, and tackles issues like the struggle against patriarchy and a woman's fierce determination to protect herself and her children. The burden of secrets also plays a significant role. This rich, layered narrative captivated me completely.",
            "I was profoundly touched to discover that this book is loosely inspired by the author’s family history, which adds significant emotional depth. However, it's important to note that it contains trigger warnings for domestic abuse and violence.",
            "I was utterly captivated by this book, listening to it whenever I had the chance. The twists at the end were fantastic, though they may seem predictable if you're actively trying to unravel the plot."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is easily one of my favorite reads this year. It’s a gripping, multi-layered psychological thriller with emotional depth, humor, and suspense. I highly recommend it, especially the audio version.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narration (Audio Version):**  \n  - I highly recommend the audio version of this book. Saskia Maarleveld, as usual, delivers an outstanding narration. She might just be my favorite narrator, and she also narrates all of Kate Quinn’s books.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - On the surface, this is a psychological thriller, but it’s so much more. It explores the impact of childhood trauma on adulthood (reminiscent of *Tell Me Lies*), the fight against the patriarchy, the lengths a woman will go to protect herself and her children, and the weight of secrets. It’s a rich, layered story that I absolutely loved.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Thrillers:**  \n  - If you’re typically turned off by mommy/kid drama in thrillers (like *The Push*), don’t let that deter you from this one. It’s much different—more suspenseful, twisty, and even semi-hilarious at times. Chapter 19 had me dying laughing!  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  - I was completely addicted to this book and tried to listen to it whenever I could. The twists at the end were fantastic, though in hindsight, they might be obvious if you’re actively trying to figure them out.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Trigger Warnings:**  \n  - I was deeply moved to learn that this book was semi-based on a true story from the author’s family life. It added an extra layer of emotional weight. Trigger warnings for domestic abuse and violence are necessary.  \n\n- **Author and Future Reading:**  \n  - This is a new-to-me author, but I’m excited to dive into her backlist now.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is easily one of my favorite reads this year. It’s a gripping, multi-layered psychological thriller with emotional depth, humor, and suspense. I highly recommend it, especially the audio version.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 rounded to 5 for Goodreads."

I highly recommend reading Madwoman instead.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I felt a whirlwind of emotions while reading this book. Clove’s childhood resonated deeply with me, making the story incredibly relatable and moving.\n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The book is beautifully written, with a strong emphasis on the bond of motherhood that is palpable throughout the narrative.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  My favorite aspect of the book is how seamlessly it transitions between past and present. The shifts happen mid-scene, like in a movie, rather than through separate chapters. This technique immerses you fully into the story and its world.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  Madwoman is undoubtedly one of my top reads for 2024. I was completely blown away by it!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMadwoman is an emotionally resonant, beautifully written novel with a masterful narrative structure that immerses readers in its world. It stands out as a superior work compared to *It Ends With Us* and is a must-read for 2024.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

The narrator reflects on how she no longer recognizes herself after becoming a mother, describing it as a life \"cleaved in two\"—before kids and after kids.  \n  - The story captures the raw, vulnerable state of being a mother, where one becomes more aware, afraid, and slowed down, yet also more determined to protect and provide for their children.  \n\n- **Trauma and Healing:**  \n  - The novel delves into the intersection of motherhood and trauma, highlighting how past experiences resurface and shape one’s parenting. The narrator acknowledges her own trauma and the cycle-breaking efforts she makes to ensure her children’s safety and well-being.  \n  - The character Clove’s self-sacrifice and relentless worry mirror the narrator’s own struggles, making the story deeply personal and reflective.  \n\n- **Self-Reflection and Growth:**  \n  - The book serves as a mirror, forcing the narrator to confront her fears, insecurities, and the harsh self-criticism she directs at herself as a mother.  \n  - It also offers a sense of beauty and healing by allowing the narrator to reconnect with her pre-motherhood self, holding that part of her identity close to her heart.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The story is emotionally resonant, evoking both pain and beauty. It hurt to see the narrator’s struggles reflected in the book, but it was also a necessary and transformative experience.  \n  - The narrator expresses deep gratitude for the book’s ability to make her reflect on her version of motherhood and the ways it has shaped her.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a powerful exploration of motherhood, trauma, and identity.

And boy did it ever!  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  In *Madwoman*, Bieker writes of a woman haunted by her childhood spent in an abusive household. Having built a new life for herself after escaping the generational cycle of domestic violence, Clove is now a wife and mother, living what looks like a charmed life—until one day, the buried past comes back from the grave.  \n\n- **Authenticity and Realism:**  \n  Working in a field where I often encounter people affected by domestic violence, I found *Madwoman* to be a dark but accurate portrayal of child abuse and its far-reaching effects.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  Bieker writes Clove’s character so authentically in the first-person POV that it’s hard for the reader to distinguish this as a psychological thriller and not a memoir.

Her journey from a traumatic childhood to building a stable life is compelling and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Bieker’s writing is impactful and evocative, effectively capturing the emotional weight of the story. The narrative is engaging, though the predictability of certain plot elements slightly diminished my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Memorable Elements:**  \n  One of my favorite quotes from the book is: “I’ll help my girls one time toward their future but the rest is up to you. And the best way to get going in this world is to stop thinking so much about your own problems and start seeing yourself as someone other people can rely on.” This line resonated deeply with me and encapsulates a key message of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Madwoman* is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that skillfully explores the lasting impact of trauma, the complexities of womanhood, and the resilience required to rebuild one’s life. While the predictable twists were a minor drawback, the book’s emotional depth and strong character development make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️💫 (3.5/5)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Apprehension and Procrastination:**  \n  I was extremely apprehensive going into *Madwoman*. Honestly, the only reason I actually read it was because it was for my book club. As a mood reader, I procrastinated and didn’t start reading until 6pm the night before our meeting. Surprisingly, that turned out to be the best decision.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I ended up binging the entire book. It’s as close as I’ll ever get to reading a thriller—it had my heart pounding with plot twists, pulled at parts of my heart, and even unearthed pieces of my own story that I hadn’t expected to confront.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  I can’t stop thinking about how brave it was for Bieker to explore the topics in this book. Although fictional, Clove’s story is rooted in real experiences that, as I’ve learned from interviews, reflect parts of Bieker’s own truth. This adds a weight that lingers, a heaviness I hope most readers would feel out of empathy for an experience that’s very real and deeply painful for so many. At the same time, reading this made me feel a bit less alone, knowing someone was brave enough to put into words experiences I often work hard to forget in my own life.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Immersion:**  \n  Bieker’s prose feels vulnerable and intimate, pulling you right into Clove’s head and allowing you to explore themes in such a raw, immersive way.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  It’s hard to sum up my thoughts on *Madwoman*, but one thing is certain: if you’re on the fence about picking it up, do it. This book surprised me in the best way, even if there are a few tear stains on the final chapters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial hesitation, *Madwoman* captivated me with its thrilling plot, emotional depth, and raw exploration of difficult themes. Bieker’s bravery in addressing such personal and painful experiences made the story both impactful and relatable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 ⭐️"

It delves deeply into the topic of domestic violence, exploring the trauma, psychological damage, and coping mechanisms associated with it.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book builds as a frustrating read for multiple reasons, but I’m glad I stuck with it until the end. The emotional weight and intensity of the subject matter made it a challenging yet rewarding experience.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  In my opinion, the second half of the book is better than the first half. The pacing and narrative structure seemed to improve as the story progressed, making the latter part more engaging and impactful.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was initially different from what I expected and had a slow start, it ultimately delivered a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of domestic violence.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Characterization:**  \n  - The narrator, Clove, is portrayed as a postpartum mess, grappling with mental health issues and the challenges of motherhood.  \n  - Clove’s husband is described as gentle and mild but prioritizes his well-paying career, leaving her feeling isolated.  \n  - Clove’s mother is a significant figure in her past, serving a life sentence for pushing her father off a building, which adds a layer of trauma to Clove’s backstory.  \n  - Jane, a mysterious woman Clove meets, becomes a central figure in her life, representing friendship, support, and solidarity, though their relationship is codependent and teeters on homoeroticism.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The novel explores themes of trauma, mental health, and the complexities of motherhood.  \n  - Clove’s past catches up with her as her mother reaches out from prison, forcing her to confront her history of abuse and loss.  \n  - The story is somewhat epistolary, with Clove addressing her mother throughout the narrative.  \n  - The plot includes a car accident that leads Clove to meet Jane, sparking a relationship that becomes a focal point of the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Comparisons:**  \n  - The writing style reminded me of ‘Motherthing’ by Ainslie Hogarth and ‘Liars’ by Sarah Manguso.  \n  - The content drew parallels to ‘It Ends With Us’ by Colleen Hoover, particularly in its exploration of trauma and relationships.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The novel delves into the “new depths of hell” that come with postpartum struggles, offering a raw and relatable portrayal of mental health challenges.  \n  - Clove’s journey of running from her past and confronting it is emotionally gripping and resonates deeply.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling exploration of trauma, motherhood, and mental health, told through the lens of a flawed yet relatable protagonist. The epistolary style, complex characters, and emotionally charged plot make it a memorable read, drawing comparisons to works by Ainslie Hogarth, Sarah Manguso, and Colleen Hoover.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While I anticipated the major reveals from the outset, I'm not certain that this detracted from the story. The events seemed inevitable, unfolding as they must. My favorite part of the book is the ending, where Clove finally has a chance to be herself—honest and free in a way she's never experienced before. The prospect of Clove, her husband, their children, and Jane grasping freedom provides a hopeful contrast to the otherwise dark narrative.",
            "Clove is a profoundly complex character, grappling with rage, fear, anxiety, and a yearning for goodness and perfection. Her emotions resonate deeply throughout the book, evoking a strong sense of empathy in the reader. Even 20 years after fleeing her childhood of abuse and trauma, the scars of her past continue to shape her life.",
            "*Madwoman* captivates with its compelling premise, delving into intricate themes of trauma, identity, and the quest for freedom in a patriarchal society.",
            "This book powerfully elicits an emotional response, particularly in its depiction of how women navigate and adapt to a male-dominated world. It poignantly raises questions about how often women feel compelled to conceal their true selves or spiral into madness just to survive."

While I’m not sure if I liked Clove as a character, her journey is compelling and leaves a lasting impact. The ending offers a glimmer of hope, suggesting that freedom and self-acceptance are possible, even after a lifetime of pain.",

            "The novel centers on a woman who transforms herself into a typical middle-class Whole Foods mom in an effort to escape her traumatic childhood marked by domestic violence. Her carefully constructed life unravels when her past resurfaces, resulting in a breakdown and an unhealthy codependency with another Whole Foods shopper, Jane. The ending, especially the final twist involving Jane, was disappointing and echoed the unsatisfying conclusion of *The Plot*. Ultimately, the story sacrifices its complexity for a forced happy ending that feels inconsistent with the narrative's tone.",
            "The protagonist's coping mechanism—adopting a humorous, “peak woo woo Pilates mom” lifestyle—was both witty and authentic. Her gradual unraveling was portrayed with realism and depth. However, the narrative's emphasis on her mother detracted from the overall story, leaning too heavily into “mommy issues” in a way that felt unengaging.",
            "This novel provides a sharp, satirical critique of middle-class wellness culture, particularly through the protagonist’s obsession with supplements and her \"grain-free life.\" It poses thought-provoking questions about accountability, as she grapples with whether her mother deserved her prison sentence for facilitating the abusive childhood environment. The narrative delves into her complicated feelings toward her deceased father, who was abusive, and her mother, who is imprisoned for killing him.",

            "There’s one lingering issue that continues to bother me.",
            "Clove was quite overwhelming, and I found it difficult to connect with her. Her obsession with natural medicine and supplements felt excessive and unrealistic—one wonders how she avoided overdosing on magnesium. Her personality, characterized by spiritualism, meditation, and a perpetual focus on concepts like stardust and manifesting, was off-putting and hard to relate to. While I recognize that some of her life choices arose from trauma, they were often infuriating. Additionally, her relationship with Jane struck me as creepy and stalkerish, creating an uncomfortable dynamic. ",
            "I really enjoyed the writing style! The narrative was distinct, featuring the main character's ongoing dialogue with her mother.",
            "This book powerfully explores the intertwined themes of domestic violence and addiction, illustrating their lasting impact on future generations. It's certainly not a light read; the weight of its subject matter is profound and resonant. I was particularly struck by the portrayal of alcohol, which initially appears as a comforting friend, offering a sense of freedom and safety. However, this illusion soon unravels, revealing alcohol's true nature as a destructive force. Aptly dubbed \"spirits,\" it invites possession rather than solace."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, I would recommend this book for its unique writing style and its powerful exploration of heavy themes like domestic violence and addiction. However, the main character, Clove, was difficult to connect with due to her extreme personality and choices, and some aspects of the story felt unresolved.",

Both Clove and Alma are survivors of domestic abuse. After her father's death, Clove escaped Hawaii, adopted a new identity, and attempted to rebuild her life. However, a letter from Alma, pleading for Clove's assistance in exposing their shared history of abuse, compels Clove to confront her past and consider its potential impact on her marriage and children.",

Her husband believes her parents died in a car accident, but the truth is far darker: her mother, Alma, was incarcerated for the murder of her abusive father. Clove and Alma were both victims of domestic abuse, and after her father's death, Clove fled Hawaii, assumed a new identity, and tried to rebuild her life. The arrival of a letter from Alma, who begs for Clove's help to prove their shared history of abuse, forces Clove to confront the truth and its potential impact on her marriage and children.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book shines in its portrayal of Clove as a damaged woman grappling with the haunting memories of her violent childhood. Her internal conflict and desperation to protect her new life while being pulled back into her past are compelling. Alma's character, as a mother seeking redemption and support, adds depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  While the novel starts as a deeply emotional exploration of trauma and survival, it shifts into thriller territory later in the story. This transition felt somewhat over the top and left me conflicted, as I was highly invested in the emotional core of the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nChelsea Bieker's *Madwoman* is a powerful exploration of trauma, identity, and the complexities of family ties. The emotional depth of Clove's story is its strongest aspect, though the shift into thriller territory detracted slightly from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars."

Your body remains palpably tense, anticipating the story turning into full-blown horror. Thankfully, the author doesn’t take it in that direction, but I didn’t realize that until the end of the book.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  Readers should be aware of sensitive content (i.e., domestic abuse and homicide). Bieker does not sensationalize violence against women. Tropes of this kind trigger me these days.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Comparisons:**  \n  *Madwoman* reminds me of Kuang’s *Yellowface* and her use of satire (even though I didn’t enjoy Kuang’s novel).  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  Contrasting the lurking sinister mood, I appreciate the cathartic, safe-haven depiction of the grocery store, the birthplace of “all good things.” We equally love Trader Joe’s for the yummy snacks and therapeutic smiles.  \n\n- **Ending and Satisfaction:**  \n  From a human perspective, the ending is satisfying. On a storytelling level, I’m not sure if it’s as satisfying. But I’m content with Bieker’s conclusion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Madwoman* is a dark, suspenseful novel that balances tension with moments of catharsis.

Yet mothers made the world. The world is not made for children. Yet children are the future.\" The beginning was gripping, and I felt myself tabbing almost every other page.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  This wasn't a fast read, but I feel like if I had an e-copy of the book, I would have devoured it at night while I should have been sleeping.\n\n- **Emotional Depth and Themes:**  \n  This book was therapy. It was harrowing. It was a hallelujah! I felt all the maddening reasons of hate and love and how they can coexist in the same realm - this was the therapy. And it's still leaving me paralyzed.\n\n- **Character Development and Title Relevance:**  \n  During the middle, I truly thought, \"Wow, madwoman is a title well earned,\" lol. But then the catharsis happened, and through it all, I got it.\n\n- **Target Audience and Relatability:**  \n  I can absolutely see how this book will not win everyone's heart. The middle was a bit. BUT, if you're a mom and/or have a complicated relationship with your parents... This will do it. It will absolutely stay on my mind for a while.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply emotional and thought-provoking read, particularly resonant for mothers or those with complex parental relationships. While its pacing may not appeal to everyone, its powerful themes and gripping opening make it a memorable and impactful experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While it did include elements of those genres, it was also an intensely autobiographical story with heavy themes of domestic violence (DV).\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book was simultaneously very enjoyable and very hard to read. The descriptions of what happened to Clove’s mom were integral to the story and helped me understand the main character (MC), but they were also deeply unsettling and made my stomach hurt. It made me incredibly sad for women who endure such experiences daily and never escape.\n\n- **Writing Style and Engagement:**  \n  The writing style hooked me from the beginning. It was darkly funny at times, and I found myself chuckling occasionally, though the humor was overshadowed by the heavier themes.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character work was excellent. The author did a fantastic job of making the characters feel real and complex, especially the MC.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  I wish there had been a content or trigger warning included in the blurb or front matter, as the intense DV content could be distressing for some readers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a hard but necessary read.

The protagonist’s journey of liberation is compelling and deeply engaging.  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel, like Bieker’s previous work *Godshot*, revolves around a woman striving to free herself from a desperate and horrible situation. In *Madwoman*, this situation involves a father who horribly abuses her mother. The story is told through flashbacks, juxtaposing her seemingly happy present with the reemergence of people from her traumatic past.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is finely wrought and intense, making the reading experience a pleasure despite some minor flaws.  \n- **Suspense and Plot Twists:**  \n  The book is filled with suspense and plot twists, though a couple of these twists felt slightly strained. However, this did not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI highly recommend *Madwoman* for its gripping characters, intense prose, and compelling narrative. While a couple of plot twists felt a bit forced, the overall experience of reading this novel is deeply satisfying and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their personality and actions felt “off,” which I think was deliberate to serve the story’s purpose.  \n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n  I was close to giving this book a 5-star rating until the end, which made me second-guess my initial impression. The conclusion left me somewhat uncertain or unsatisfied.  \n- **Comparisons and Vibes:**  \n  Something about this novel gave me similar vibes to *Little Fires Everywhere*, which I found intriguing and worth noting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really liked much about this novel, particularly its intentional character complexity and the thought-provoking vibes it evoked. However, the ending slightly diminished my enthusiasm, leaving me with mixed feelings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.2/5"

While I understand her role, I found her overwhelming at times.\n- **Themes:** The heavy emphasis on the \"Mother Earth mothering\" theme was a bit excessive for my taste. I think scaling it down would have made the story more enjoyable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel had its moments, the predictable twist, the overwhelming main character, and the overbearing theme of \"Mother Earth mothering\" detracted from my overall enjoyment. It’s a decent read but could have been more balanced.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5 stars."

While I understand why the author chose this approach, it wasn’t executed well enough to justify it. A distant third person or first person without the inner dialogue to the mother would have worked much better. The inner dialogue to the mother felt annoying at times and fell flat, despite having potential to be interesting.  \n\n- **Execution of Themes and Topics:**  \n  The story tackled the topic of abuse very well, with lines related to it being executed powerfully. The concept of what constitutes a “mad” or “crazy” woman was intriguing and handled in a way that didn’t shy away from the horrific realities of abusive households.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**  \n  The plot felt lazy and relied heavily on backstory rather than a well-developed narrative. While the potential for Clove to be truly mad or haunted was there, the execution fell short. The ending was rushed and unsatisfying, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Clove’s character development and overall arc were poorly done. The story leaned too much on the reader’s ability to empathize with an abused character without giving Clove the depth or growth she needed.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book isn’t a thriller but has some mystery elements. It could have had a more “thriller-esque” vibe with better foreshadowing of events involving Jane/Christine and a less predictable revelation.  \n\n- **Emotional Payoff:**  \n  The emotional payoff was lacking, especially in the relationship between Clove and her mother. The entire book is framed as a letter/talking to her mother, yet their interaction is barely a page long. This felt like a missed opportunity and lazy writing, which significantly impacted my enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the story’s attempt to explore complex themes like abuse and the societal perception of “madness,” the execution fell short in several areas.

            "The novel's alternating timelines effectively enhance Clove's character development, but they occasionally disrupt the pacing. The interplay between contemporary and suspense elements feels uneven; one twist is predictable while the other seems out of place. This lack of balance undermines the overall cohesion of the story.",
            "Clove is a richly developed character, and her reflections on her past and present are profoundly moving. Her struggle to maintain a sense of normalcy, particularly in relation to her fears about her mother, is depicted with subtlety. In contrast, Jane’s character feels underdeveloped, and her role in the story lacks a satisfying resolution, resulting in a disjointed narrative.",
            "The novel powerfully explores themes of women's oppression, showcasing how they are marginalized and mistreated. Clove's journey as a mother striving for stability amid the scars of her abusive childhood is particularly haunting. The vivid feminist themes amplify her struggles, making them both relatable and emotionally resonant.",

If the plot twists were never intended to be major reveals, the way the story was written didn’t align well with that intention, creating a sense of inconsistency.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMadwoman is a powerful and intense exploration of intimate partner violence, with sharp prose and a complex narrator. However, the predictable ending and tonal inconsistencies prevented it from being more than an average reading experience for me. While Bieker's writing is compelling, the narrative's flaws ultimately held it back.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story is decent overall, with a satisfying twist at the end, but the lack of clarity around a key character’s motive detracts from the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I identified the twist early on, as the premise felt entirely predictable. Given Clove's pattern of leaving and witnessing her mother’s repeated assaults, it was clear she would ultimately need to break the cycle of abuse. Furthermore, Christina's introduction made me suspect she had Munchausen syndrome by proxy. I want to clarify that I don’t typically analyze thrillers in depth, but Christina's reluctance to allow Celine outside due to an unspecified congenital issue strongly suggested medical abuse. I believe this perception reflects more on my own fears of medical malpractice than on the author's writing.",
            "I appreciate the author's attention to domestic abuse, particularly the nuanced question of \"Why didn't you leave?\" Their insights into sexual and social politics are commendable. While the book treats domestic violence with the seriousness it deserves, the overwhelming focus on wellness culture detracts from the central message. Although I understand there's an intention to critique the notion of a perfectly curated, holistic mother, I feel that I may not be the intended audience for this work.",
            "It took me several days into my reading to determine the genre of this book, which I discovered was labeled as a thriller. I was surprised, given that the first 80 pages focus primarily on ashwagandha, L-theanine, and a satirical take on Gwyneth Paltrow. In fact, only the final three chapters—out of twenty-nine—could be considered thrilling."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  I really appreciate the attention that Bieker gives to domestic abuse, especially the nuances that complicate the question \"well, why didn't you leave?\" I think that Bieker is incredibly observant of sexual and social politics. Overall, I think that this book takes domestic violence quite seriously, but the message is distracted by the overwhelming emphasis on wellness culture. I know that there is probably supposed to be emphasis on the artifice of constructing a \"holistic\" and probiotically perfected mother, but I think that I might just not be the target audience for this book.\n\n- **Genre and Pacing:**  \n  I could not figure out what genre this book was supposed to be until days after I started it and marked it as \"Currently Reading.\" I saw that it was supposed to be a thriller. What? You're telling me this book that has spent approximately 80 pages talking about ashwagandha, L-theanine, and a parodic take on Gwenyth Paltrow is a thriller? Quite literally, only the final three chapters (of twenty-nine) were anything remotely close to a thriller.\n\n- **Predictability and Plot Twists:**  \n  I caught the twist almost immediately because the premise was entirely predictable. Given Clove's proclivity for leaving and bearing witness to the repeated assault of her mother, I could tell that she was going to have to be the one to literally break the cycle of abuse. Additionally, as soon as Christina appeared, I had surmised that she had Munchausen by proxy. I would really like to emphasize that I really don't go into thrillers trying to pry them open, but Christina's hesitance to even let Celine outside because of her unnamed congenital issue that was never talked about in much detail just screamed medical abuse. I'm going to wager a guess that this is more a reflection of an early and intense fear of medical malpractice and not Bieker's writing.\n\n- **Exposition and Detail:**  \n  There were a few things that weren't super well explained and other things that were way over-explained. Like, did I need to know the bizarre witch's brew of homeopathy that Clove ingested on the daily to understand her? Probably not. But did I want to know how Jane wound up with her car in considerably more detail? Absolutely.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI can't say that I hated this book, but I didn't exactly love it. I did like plenty of parts about it, particularly its serious treatment of domestic abuse and its nuanced social commentary. However, the genre confusion, predictable twists, and uneven exposition prevented me from fully connecting with the story.

I found this method less engaging and felt it limited the depth of the storytelling.  \n\n- **Twists and Turns:**  \n  The book includes some twists and turns that add interest to the plot. However, these elements weren’t enough to compensate for my dissatisfaction with the character and writing style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile ‘Madwoman’ had an intriguing premise and some engaging plot twists, the inconsistent character development and unappealing writing style left me feeling underwhelmed. Overall, I found the book to be just okay.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n🌟🌟🌟"

We spent way too much time reading about Clove’s mental breakdown/crisis phase and grocery stores. I did get pretty invested in the last 15%.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I didn’t like the writing style. It was a little all over the place for me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I didn’t like the main character. Ok but the husband just forgives and is “so amazed” by his wife that is a total lie and a murderer?? Absolutely no way. Also, kinda lowkey was rooting for the butcher ex to win her over.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  Didn’t see the entire ending coming but definitely knew all along that she was the one who killed her father. Ok the ending was the only saving grace for this book.  \n\n- **Themes and Awareness:**  \n  I will say that this book was great DV awareness.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book struggled with pacing, writing style, and character development, the ending was a redeeming factor. The plot twist was unexpected, and the book effectively raised awareness about domestic violence. However, certain character decisions felt unrealistic, and the overall engagement was inconsistent.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The narrative is structured as a long letter from the main character to her mother, which adds a unique perspective. However, just as the story began to pick up momentum, it ended abruptly, which was disappointing.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character’s exploration of her present life and her past trauma provides depth to her character. The portrayal of her struggles with motherhood and her complex relationship with her parents adds emotional weight to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was engaging enough to keep me reading daily, it fell short of leaving a lasting impression. The abrupt ending and lack of a more impactful resolution resulted in a somewhat unsatisfying experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

Her portrayal lacked depth and nuance, which made it difficult for me to connect with or care about her journey.  \n\n- **Representation of Sensitive Themes:**  \n  The writing did a poor job of representing a domestic violence relationship. I found this aspect particularly frustrating, as it felt mishandled and lacked the necessary sensitivity and authenticity.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  There were a couple of big predictable twists. While their inclusion prevented me from being even more annoyed, they didn’t add much value to the story or make it more engaging.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I was really disliking this book for most of the story. The last 50ish pages were slightly better, but they still didn’t redeem the book for me. Overall, this just wasn’t my favorite read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a slight improvement in the final pages, the book fell short for me due to poor character development, mishandled representation of sensitive themes, and predictable plot twists. It was a frustrating and largely unsatisfying read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars."

            "This gripping story centers on a mother and daughter trapped in an abusive relationship in Hawaii, seeking to escape the torment of the father. The daughter, Calla Lily, believes she witnesses her mother push him off their 33rd-floor balcony and turns to a neighbor for help. The neighbor provides her with the identity of a sick child and a plane ticket to California. However, Calla Lily later discovers that the sick child has died, and her mother, consumed by grief, takes her own life.\n\nRenaming herself Clove, she begins to rebuild her life, finding love and starting a family, yet the shadows of her past linger. The plot takes a dramatic turn when Jane, the supposedly deceased sick child, re-emerges, revealing that it was Clove who pushed her father. Together, they embark on an online campaign to secure Clove’s mother’s release from prison, seeking redemption and closure.",

She seeks help from a neighbor, who gives her the identity of a sick child and a plane ticket to California. Later, she learns the sick child has died, and her mother, overcome with grief, drowns herself. Calla Lily, now Clove, builds a life, finds love, and starts a family but struggles with the trauma of her past. The plot takes a twist when Jane, the supposedly dead sick child, reappears and reveals that Clove was the one who pushed her father. Together, they work to free Clove’s mother from prison through an online campaign.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Clove’s character evolves from a traumatized child to a determined adult who seeks to break free from the cycle of abuse. Her internal conflict about parenting and her fear of becoming like her own parents add depth to her character. Jane’s reappearance and her dark past (killing her own mother) introduce complexity and tension to the narrative.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel explores themes of abuse, trauma, identity, and redemption. It delves into the long-term effects of childhood trauma and the struggle to overcome one’s past. The story also touches on the power of collective action, as seen in the online campaign to free Clove’s mother.\n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n  The review criticizes the writing as “pure nonsense,” suggesting that the plot twists and events feel unrealistic and poorly executed.

Even then, I couldn’t fully immerse myself in the story. The pacing felt off, and reading it often felt like a chore.  \n- **Narration and Structure:**  \n  The narration and frequent time jumps were frustrating. Clove’s transitions between the present and past were unclear, and the lack of smooth transitions made me feel like I was constantly rereading parts. The random conversations with her mom further disrupted the flow.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  I ended up annoyed with all of the characters. None of them resonated with me, and their actions or personalities didn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing felt clunky and disjointed, which made it hard to stay engaged. The use of multiple aliases added to the confusion and made the reading experience more exhausting.  \n- **Plot and Twist:**  \n  The twist towards the end was somewhat interesting and added a layer of intrigue, but it wasn’t enough to redeem the overall experience for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book wasn’t for me.

Her inability to form genuine, healthy connections further alienates the reader.  \n\n- **Themes and Moral Ambiguity:**  \n  The novel explores themes of trauma, identity, and redemption, but the protagonist’s lack of growth or accountability undermines these themes. The author may intend to evoke understanding for Clove due to her abusive past, but her continued selfishness and repellent behavior make it hard to empathize with her.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  The story’s unlikable protagonist and her ghastly behavior made it difficult to continue reading.

It may appeal to readers who enjoy deeply flawed characters and unconventional storytelling formats.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐ 2/5"

It had a compelling premise that reminded me of *Stone Cold Fox* by Rachel Koller Croft, particularly the idea of a woman redesigning herself to erase her past and achieve a perfect new life.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Clove, was initially intriguing, but her portrayal of a \"perfect life\" felt excessive and almost satirical. Her obsession with health consciousness, affluence, and self-care (minerals, vitamins, essential oils, organic clothing, kombucha, spiritual therapy jargon) became overwhelming and exhausting. Additionally, her addictive shopping habits and the resulting debt, which her husband was unaware of, added to her flawed character. Her children were also portrayed in a way that felt grating and contributed to the overall sense of annoyance.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story included a twist, but I saw it coming, which diminished its impact. The novel also delved into themes of domestic violence, which were handled in a way that made me uncomfortable and sickened.

This mismatch in expectations made the reading experience disappointing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Clove, is portrayed as a neurotic married woman with two children. Her personality and decisions were unrelatable and off-putting. I couldn’t empathize with her, and any initial sympathy I had vanished early in the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot revolves around Clove’s mother, who is in prison for killing Clove’s father. The story drags as Clove spirals emotionally after receiving a letter from her mother seeking help. The angsty, stream-of-consciousness narrative felt endless and unengaging.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The focus on healthy living and clean food felt excessive and irritating. The exploration of domestic violence and its consequences, while potentially meaningful, was overshadowed by Clove’s unrelatable reactions and decisions.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The audiobook narration was disappointing. The narrator’s voices for different characters were indistinguishable, which detracted from the experience.  \n\n- **Personal Suitability:**  \n  I recognize that I may not have been the right audience for this type of story. My frustration with the characters and pacing made it a challenging read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel failed to meet my expectations as a thriller and instead delivered a slow, angst-filled drama with unrelatable characters.

            "None of the characters were particularly likable.

While her mental struggles stem from severe trauma, they ultimately rendered the experience exhausting.",

While I typically enjoy narratives about \"madwomen\" and their descent into chaos, this story felt unbalanced, focusing more on abuse than on the mother-daughter dynamic. I recognize that victims of domestic abuse might interpret the narrative differently and find it affirming, but I cannot speak from that perspective. The frequent references to current trends—such as Baggu bags, the cottagecore aesthetic, and Erewhon market—distracted from the world-building rather than enhancing it.

Reviews also highlighted its exploration of mother-daughter relationships, which intrigued me.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book delves heavily into domestic abuse, which made for an uncomfortable read. While I’ve enjoyed stories about “madwomen” and their descent into chaos, this one felt unbalanced, with more focus on abuse than on the mother-daughter dynamic. I acknowledge that victims of domestic abuse might interpret the story differently, possibly finding it affirming, but I cannot speak to that perspective.  \n\n- **Character Development and Likability:**  \n  None of the characters were likable. I sympathized with the narrator and her mother, but the narrator’s obsessive thoughts and poor judgments were relentless and difficult to endure. While her mental state is a product of severe trauma, it made for an exhausting reading experience.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  The story is written in a confessional tone, with the narrator speaking directly to her mother and father. This style became tiresome after a few chapters. Additionally, the plot was very predictable, which diminished my engagement.  \n\n- **Use of Modern References and Themes:**  \n  The narrator frequently referenced current trends (e.g., Baggu bags, cottagecore aesthetic, Erewhon market), which felt distracting rather than meaningful to the world-building.

I also thought of *Rouge* by Mona Awad, which, while not my favorite, handled the wellness theme more effectively.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  This was an unpleasant read, and I wouldn’t recommend it.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book was boring from the very first page, and I struggled to stay engaged. The narrative style, with little to no dialogue, made it difficult to connect with the story. I only managed to reach chapter 5 after weeks of effort, as the chapters were excessively long and tedious.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is told in a narrative style that lacks dialogue, which I found monotonous and unappealing. This style contributed significantly to my inability to stay interested in the book.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  This was my most disappointing read of 2024. I had hoped to explore a new genre and expand my reading repertoire, but the book simply wasn’t for me. I couldn’t bring myself to finish it, though I plan to revisit it in the future to see if my perspective changes.\n\n- **Value of Time:**  \n  With so many great books available, I felt that continuing to read this one was a waste of time. I couldn’t justify pushing through something that didn’t capture my interest.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book failed to engage me due to its slow pacing, lack of dialogue, and monotonous narrative style. While I may attempt to read it again in the future, it was a disappointing experience overall and not a good fit for my reading preferences.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

As someone from a large family (the oldest of nine children), I believe we turned out fine without the constant worrying, cuddling, and overindulgence depicted in the book. My own grandchildren are the love of my life, but their parents don’t bend to their every whim like the narrator does.  \n- **Character Motivation:**  \n  I understand that the narrator’s behavior stems from her abusive father and her attempt to compensate for that trauma. However, I find her actions unrealistic and overdone.  \n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  As a Boomer, I couldn’t relate to the narrator’s parenting style or the overall tone of the book.
