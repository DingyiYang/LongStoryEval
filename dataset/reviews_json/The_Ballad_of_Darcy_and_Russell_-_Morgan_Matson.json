Compared to her earlier works like *Amy & Roger*, *Since You've Been Gone*, *Second Chance Summer*, and *Save the Date*, *The Ballad of Darcy and Russell* feels like it was written by a young writer attempting to turn her teen rom-com dreams into a fanfic. It lacks the depth and charm of her previous novels.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book was unnecessarily long and bogged down by a tired, repetitive story that I’ve seen done better by far less talented writers. The plot felt thin, with little substance beyond the central romance. The short road trip at the end felt like a cheap imitation of Matson’s *Amy & Roger*, which already perfected the road trip narrative.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n  I hated the insta-love between Darcy and Russell. Their connection felt rushed and unrealistic. I couldn’t sympathize with Darcy’s anger upon discovering Russell’s secret because, honestly, they had only known each other for a few hours. It’s unrealistic to expect to know everything about someone so quickly, and it highlighted the lack of emotional depth in their relationship.  \n\n- **Relatability and Target Audience:**  \n  I wondered if my disappointment stemmed from being an adult who can no longer relate to teen stories. However, I revisited Matson’s earlier novels and still found them excellent and relatable, so that’s not the issue here.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Ballad of Darcy and Russell* was a significant letdown. It lacked the emotional depth, originality, and charm of Matson’s previous works. The insta-love, thin plot, and repetitive story made it a frustrating read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nFewer than three stars (exact score not specified)."

This twist heightens the stakes in Darcy and Russell’s relationship, making it feel more authentic and engaging. The narrative cleverly subverts the “love at first sight” trope, transforming it into a deeper and more meaningful connection.",

As the main character, she is relatable, even when making questionable choices—an authentic reflection of a young, chaotic mind. Her two best friends, though not physically present, serve as a clever devil and angel on her shoulder, adding a unique touch I haven't encountered before.

            "This story follows two California teenagers who fall in love over the course of 24 hours during an unplanned desert road trip. While it incorporates familiar YA romance tropes, the narrative introduces subtle twists that make it more relatable and grounded. The pacing leans toward the slower side, largely due to the emphasis on dialogue. Notably, the book dedicates considerable time to developing Darcy and Russell as individuals rather than merely portraying them as a couple.",

Their authentic banter highlights shared anxieties about life transitions. By the story's conclusion, both characters undergo significant personal growth and develop a clearer perspective on their futures.",

Readers seeking a traditional romance may be disappointed, as the narrative emphasizes the individual journeys of the characters over their relationship as a couple."

And he’s super hot? It just doesn’t add up in my mind.  \n\n- **Tone and Enjoyment:**  \n   - This was fun, goofy, and cute.  \n   - I need to reread all her old books ASAP.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n   - Ignore the fact I just gave *Promchanted* 3 stars — it’s not even listed under the “other books by Morgan Matson” that was at the beginning of this book, so I’m quietly ignoring it from her canon.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a delightful and entertaining read, typical of Morgan Matson’s style.

However, Darcy’s inner dialogues with her two friends can feel exaggerated, slightly diminishing her relatability. The romance unfolds naturally, characterized by witty banter that often brings humor. As they spend more time together, their feelings grow authentically, making their relationship believable. While some readers may find the reasoning behind the third-act breakup predictable, it doesn’t detract from the overall enjoyment of the story. Russell’s vibrant, chaotic family, complete with dogs, injects charm and humor, especially during their amusing interference with Darcy and Russell.

I loved this one.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Few authors give you secondary characters as incredible as Morgan does. I loved Darcy and Russell as individuals and together. I can't believe how much I liked and cared about characters we didn’t even really get to see—her dad, her friends, even Gillian.  \n\n- **Use of Pop Culture References:**  \n  I normally hate pop culture references, but these were well done and didn’t pull me out of the story at all. I don’t know if any other author I read could have pulled off the number of references in this book.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  I had so much fun reading this and absolutely adored the ending.  \n\n- **Overall Appreciation for the Author:**  \n  I love Morgan Matson.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations, delivering well-developed characters, seamless pop culture references, and an engaging story. It reaffirmed my love for Morgan Matson’s writing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, if you feel that way at the beginning like I did, I encourage you to keep with it—it gets better.\n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  I really liked the family feels that were introduced. The family was quite charming, and of course, I loved the dogs!\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  I appreciate how Matson’s books always handle deeper subjects. This one had a lot to do with divorce and finding your way after high school, which I found meaningful.\n\n- **Cultural and Setting References:**  \n  I enjoyed all the references to In-N-Out as well as the nods to Stanwich, Connecticut (a fictional town, but I have to take the small state representation where I can get it!).\n\n- **Music Integration:**  \n  There’s a big emphasis on music throughout the book, featuring both real songs and songs created for the story. However, at one point, the female character mentions the song “The Little Old Lady From Pasadena” and credits it to The Beach Boys—no! It was Jan and Dean! This small inaccuracy stood out to me.\n\n- **Plot Elements:**  \n  I did like most of the story, but there’s a lot of secret-keeping that I didn’t enjoy. It felt unnecessary at times.\n\n- **Overall Tone and Genre:**  \n  Overall, this was a cute and fun contemporary novel, as almost all of Matson’s books are!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started off with an instalove trope that I didn’t enjoy, it improved significantly as the story progressed.

            "In this story, Darcy, the female protagonist, embodies the typical YA romance character, with quirks that can be both charming and cringe-worthy—her obsession with Theseus's Sailboat being a prime example.

He defies the jock stereotype, presenting as an ordinary guy with a lovable personality and a genuine desire for recognition. His unpredictability adds an enjoyable layer to the narrative, making the story both fun and engaging.",

            "The story starts off on a cringe-worthy note with an exaggerated and unrealistic direction that left me rolling my eyes, especially as Russell’s character was immediately obvious. However, author Matson skillfully grounds the narrative, transforming it into a more relatable and enjoyable piece of escapism. The ending offers a refreshing twist, diverging from typical story conventions. The premise of a life-changing day together, coupled with the uncertainty of their future, evokes comparisons to *Before Sunrise*, which the book cleverly references.",
            "The author skillfully develops secondary characters and delves into family and friend dynamics, and this book is no exception. \n\nDarcy's feelings toward her mother and Russell are somewhat justified, but the resolution feels lacking. Although Darcy's internal conversations with her friends—where she reflects on her lies to Russell—seem odd, I don't believe she was deceitful. Not disclosing deeply personal information to someone she just met is entirely reasonable. Furthermore, the resolution regarding Darcy's issues with her mother is unsatisfying. Given that her mother abandoned her as a toddler to start a new family abroad, the burden of repairing their relationship should have rested on her mother, not Darcy."

While Darcy’s inner monologue with her friends (which I found a bit odd—she has full conversations with them in her head) acknowledges that she lied to Russell too, I don’t think she did. Not revealing deeply personal information to someone she just met seems normal, not deceitful.\n   - The resolution of Darcy’s mom issues felt unsatisfying. Her mom abandoned her as a toddler and moved abroad to start a new family, yet Darcy is expected to fix the relationship. I believe the responsibility should have been on her mom to make amends.\n\n- **Plot and Ending:**\n   - The ending was a refreshing change of pace for this type of story. The idea of spending one life-changing day together (with the question of whether they’ll stay together afterward) felt reminiscent of *Before Sunrise*, which is even referenced in the book.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**\n   - Overall, this is a typical Matson book, but it didn’t quite measure up to *Since You’ve Been Gone*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book had a rocky start and some unresolved issues with character dynamics, it ultimately delivered a grounded and enjoyable story.

            "The story opens with a familiar rom-com setup that nearly deterred me from finishing the book. However, the author expertly subverts these expectations by illustrating that life is far from a romantic comedy. Once Darcy's idealized bubble bursts, the narrative becomes much more engaging. The plot follows Darcy and Russell's unexpected encounter and their journey through Jesse, Nevada, which initially seems like a perfect first date but ultimately explores deeper, more realistic themes.",

            "The 24-hour gimmick in the plot didn't resonate with me and felt unnecessary, especially since the story didn't strictly adhere to this timeframe. The drama seemed contrived, and while I understood Russell's reasons for his lack of honesty, Darcy's anger felt unjustified. She chose to sleep with a stranger and then became upset about not knowing enough about him, which undermined her plan to save herself for someone romantically perfect.",
            "The imagined conversations with the main character's best friends felt clunky and served as an unnecessary addition to the already tight 24-hour timeframe. They detracted from the story rather than enhancing it. Additionally, the insta-love trope was unconvincing; I wanted to see more depth and development in the characters' relationship.",
            "One of my favorite authors usually excels at capturing the essence of rom-coms. However, if her next book again relies on a short time-frame gimmick, I may have to reconsider my admiration.",
            "While I could relate to the story, having gone through a whirlwind romance before a major life change, I found the portrayal to be oversimplified. My personal experience may have made me less receptive to the narrative, as I felt it missed the complexities of such relationships."

My high expectations were met, as I truly loved this book.\n\n- **Relatability of the Protagonist:**  \n  Even though I’m at a different stage of my life than Darcy, I still related to her deeply. Her uncertainty about moving off to college and whether she’s making the right decision felt incredibly real and resonated with me.\n\n- **Plot and Romance Development:**  \n  The plot and romance in this novel were done exceptionally well. Matson is a master of crafting realistic romances. She doesn’t rush the relationship, allowing Darcy to prioritize her own life and growth before falling in love.\n\n- **Character Relationships (Mother-Daughter Dynamic):**  \n  I loved the growth of Darcy’s relationship with her mother. It wasn’t rushed or left until the very end. Instead, it was an ongoing issue that Darcy revisited throughout the novel, and I appreciated how it was resolved.\n\n- **Adventure and Enjoyment:**  \n  The wild adventures in the story were so much fun, and I enjoyed this book immensely!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book lived up to my expectations as a Morgan Matson fan. It delivered a relatable protagonist, a well-developed plot and romance, meaningful character growth, and exciting adventures. It was a thoroughly enjoyable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her reaction, saying \"I don't know him at all,\" felt exaggerated. Obviously, she wouldn't know him well—they had just met a few hours ago. Even if he had been truthful the whole time, she wouldn't have known enough about him to claim she knew him.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  This is my least favorite of all her books.

Despite the book’s length, it didn’t feel overly long.  \n\n- **Narrative Devices:**  \n  One element I didn’t care for was the use of Darcy’s two best friends as a “Greek chorus.” Darcy often has imaginary conversations with them in her head, and I felt this narrative device didn’t add much to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Aside from the minor issue with the narrative device, this book was an absolute smash! I was thrilled to have a brand-new Morgan Matson novel to kick off the summer, and I highly recommend it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Ballad of Darcy and Russell* is a heartfelt and engaging novel that combines a charming love story with themes of self-discovery and growth.

However, it eventually took unexpected directions, which improved my engagement with the story.\n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The novel explores themes of romance, family, growing up, and embracing change. These elements made the story sweet and entertaining, aligning with what I typically enjoy in Matson's books.\n\n- **Author's Consistency and Appeal:**  \n  While Matson's recent books haven't resonated with me as strongly as they did when I was younger, I still find her stories fun and enjoyable. I plan to continue reading her work because of the consistent charm and relatability of her narratives.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a slow start, the book ultimately delivered a heartwarming and entertaining experience. Matson's ability to weave relatable themes into her stories keeps me coming back for more, even if her recent works don't quite match the impact of her earlier ones.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
