            "This complex art-world thriller revolves around the fictional Surrealist painter Juliette Willoughby. The ambitious narrative unfolds from three perspectives across multiple timelines (from 1937 to the present) and is non-linear. It interlaces the viewpoints of 1990s art history students Caroline Cooper and Patrick Lambert with Juliette's diary entries. The plot is driven by the mysterious deaths tied to Juliette’s lost painting, *Self Portrait as Sphinx*. While the pacing can be slow as it meticulously brings together various storylines and characters, the novel compensates with several surprising twists that maintain engagement.",

            "While I appreciated the author's intention behind the three timelines, they ultimately didn't resonate with me. The Big Reveal fell short of the surprise I anticipated, likely due to Alice's minimal presence—she appears only in two brief cameos. The author did make a commendable effort to resolve every plot point, from the Missing Maid to the Osiris Club ritual, which came together almost organically. However, I felt that relying on events in Dubai to unravel multiple mysteries was a bit too convenient. Additionally, I was left wanting a different resolution for Next Door Terry, as the ending provided didn't fully satisfy my expectations.",

            "Juliette’s story captivated me the most. Her lack of family support and a relationship that failed to uplift her made her a compelling character. Despite her struggles, her remarkable determination and willpower positioned her as one of the strongest characters I’ve encountered in recent readings. Patrick and Caroline’s experiences in the 1990s were also fascinating. Their university friends tended to be unlikable—wealthy, privileged, and often entitled. Initially, I found it hard to distinguish Patrick from them, but as the plot unfolded, I recognized his self-awareness and acceptance of his inability to meet his father's expectations. In contrast, Caroline, a more introverted character, took her time to connect with others.",

In the past, I've had mixed feelings about collaborations involving two authors, often getting caught up in trying to identify who wrote which parts. However, in this novel, their partnership was flawlessly executed. I was completely absorbed in the story and never once considered the dual authorship.",

The sudden disappearance of one of Patrick’s unsavory friends after a party profoundly impacts Patrick, particularly concerning the murder charge he faces in the present timeline.

I’ve had mixed feelings in the past about authors who are actually two people, often spending too much time trying to figure out who wrote which part. However, with this novel, the collaboration worked perfectly. I didn’t even think about it—it was seamless.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Timeline:**  \n   - The story is told through three narrators and initially spans three time periods: Juliette in the 1930s in Paris, and Caroline and Patrick in the 1990s and modern day. The way the timelines intertwined was engaging, and I appreciated how the narrative showed the profound impact of art on their lives—though not always in a positive way.  \n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**  \n   - Juliette’s story was my favorite. Her lack of family support and a relationship that didn’t improve her situation made her a compelling character. Despite her struggles, she had incredible determination and willpower, which made her one of the strongest characters I’ve encountered in recent reads.  \n   - Patrick and Caroline’s lives in the 1990s were also intriguing. Their university friends were largely unlikable—rich, privileged, and often entitled. Initially, I struggled to see Patrick as different from them, but as the story progressed, I realized he was more self-aware and knew he could never compete with his father’s expectations. Caroline, on the other hand, was more of a loner who took her time to open up to people.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The novel explores how wealth impacts family dynamics, loyalty, and relationships. The disappearance of one of Patrick’s despicable friends after a party had significant repercussions, particularly on the murder charge Patrick faced in the modern-day timeline. This part of the story highlighted the darker side of privilege and how it shapes people’s lives.  \n   - Art plays a central role in the characters’ lives, though its influence isn’t always positive. For Caroline and Patrick, art seemed to matter deeply, but for others, it was more about status and wealth.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The characters were well-developed, and the intertwining timelines kept me engaged. Juliette’s story, in particular, stood out to me. I’ve already added Ellery Lloyd’s previous novel to my reading list.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by Ellery Lloyd is a compelling exploration of art, wealth, and the complexities of human relationships.

            "The initial slow burn was effective, although the frequent perspective shifts were frustrating despite being understandable. Unfortunately, the pacing and structure faltered in the second half, becoming convoluted and difficult to follow. The plot took several absurd turns, with reveals that felt laughably unrealistic. Events from the past, particularly one that was outright impossible, strained believability. Ultimately, the story barely maintained a 2-star rating, with only the strong first half redeeming it.",
            "The character exploration of Juliette and three to four supporting characters was impressive, particularly in the first half of the story. I appreciated the depth of their development.",
            "The writing and era-specific details in the first half were skillfully executed, highlighting the author's talent. However, the second half struggled with balance, resulting in a plot that felt unsteady and underwhelming.",
            "I found the first half of the book deeply engaging, rating it 4 stars until around page 160. However, my enjoyment dipped to 3 stars for the next 30 pages, and the conclusion barely warranted 1-2 stars. Despite the disappointing second half, I couldn't bring myself to rate the book 2 stars overall, as I genuinely appreciated the first half more than most works in this genre. I don't recommend this book unless you're passionate about art analysis and can overlook its significant plot holes and unrealistic elements. It feels overrated on Goodreads, with all three storylines lacking the depth and coherence they deserved. Given the notable flaws, I won't be pursuing further works by this author.",

            "The book weaves together three timelines set in Paris, Cambridge, and Dubai, creating an experience that sometimes feels like reading multiple stories at once. While I typically enjoy multiple storylines, this approach proved a bit confusing. About 20% in, I opted to read the diary entries separately before returning to the other narratives, ultimately skipping the diary sections. Although the complexity was intended to foster mystery, I found it excessive and would have preferred a more straightforward narrative that spanned from 1938 to the present day.",

It weaves a rich tapestry of dark family drama, passionate art enthusiasts, manipulation, and Egyptian history, all underscored by a relentless quest for truth. The book is filled with captivating plot twists that kept me thoroughly engaged. The narrative unfolds from multiple perspectives, yet the author provides clear markers at the start of each section, indicating the narrator, year, and location, making it easy to navigate despite its complexity.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Structure and Complexity:**  \n  The novel features three intersecting timelines, multiple points of view, an interesting historical fiction element, and several mysteries set in the art world. However, the predictability of the major twists, which I guessed as early as page 37, diminished the overall experience.  \n\n- **Character Development and Payoff:**  \n  One character is given a tragic backstory, but it feels unnecessary and lacks any meaningful payoff. It seems like the authors added trauma to the plot without exploring it deeply, making parts of the novel feel unnecessarily heavy.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n  The inclusion of an almost supernatural theme tied to a character’s obsession with Egyptology didn’t work for me. While I understood the intent behind these elements, their execution felt disjointed and ineffective.  \n\n- **Pacing and Relevance:**  \n  Several storylines felt unnecessary and didn’t contribute meaningfully to the overall narrative. This made the book feel longer than it needed to be, especially since I spent much of it waiting to confirm what I already suspected.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential with its ambitious structure and intriguing setting, the predictability of the twists, underdeveloped character arcs, and disjointed themes ultimately left me disappointed. The unnecessary elements and lack of payoff made the reading experience less satisfying than I had hoped.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n*No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.*"

The narrative shifts between Caroline’s and Patrick’s perspectives in 1991 and 2023, spanning locations from Cambridge to the Willoughby’s Longhurst estate and Dubai. Side plots involving murder, romance, and Egyptology further deepen the story. Overall, the book is complex without being overwhelming, maintaining a strong sense of mystery until the very end.",

The abrupt pacing shifts and lack of a cohesive structure left me dissatisfied. The central mystery of the maid's murder, which was heavily emphasized, felt underwhelming in its resolution.

Moreover, the mention of lead poisoning at the end felt like an afterthought, as the characters' actions were already adequately explained by existing circumstances. The final twist was presented as a shocking revelation, despite being established nearly 100 pages earlier. This lack of narrative payoff made the ending anticlimactic and poorly executed."

The central question of whether both the painting and the heiress perished adds a captivating layer. However, the story has significant plot holes and coincidences that challenge its believability. For example, Quentin, Patrick's egomaniacal father, manages to keep a major secret for over 30 years, which feels unrealistic. Additionally, it’s hard to believe that Caroline and Patrick, who are immersed in the art world, wouldn't recognize their classmate \"David White\" as a billionaire art collector. The novel is quite lengthy and navigates three timelines and perspectives. While this structure adds depth, it can also be confusing and disrupts the story's flow."

The characters’ journeys and the mysteries surrounding the painting kept me hooked until the very end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a brilliant, multi-layered story that combines mystery, art, and history into a captivating narrative. The elegant prose, well-structured timelines, and educational depth make it a standout read. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a blend of intrigue, glamour, and intellectual stimulation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly positive evaluation, likely 5/5 or equivalent.)"
