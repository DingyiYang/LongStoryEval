            "The plot is captivating, featuring thrilling action sequences that kept me fully engaged from start to finish.",
            "**Orka:** A formidable and renowned warrior, Orka's character shines as she searches for her abducted son. One of my favorite moments is when she reveals why she left the Bloodsworn mercenary group; the leader's reaction moved me to tears. \n\n**Elvar:** Initially, I found Elvar annoying due to her hubris and desire for battle fame, but her character arc ultimately captivates. She is behind one of my favorite moments in Chapter 54. \n\n**Varg:** I appreciated Varg's perspective and empathized with his quest for vengeance after his sister's murder. Witnessing his transformation into a skilled and spirited member of the Bloodsworn was emotionally rewarding, though I wish he had left a stronger impression. \n\n**Antagonists:** \n**Biórr:** He comes across as naive; his justification for his actions seems sound at first until you realize he’s on the wrong side.  \n**Guðvarr:** Surprisingly, I found myself liking Guðvarr; his inner monologue is hilarious, and he continually impresses me by escaping precarious situations and dispatching enemies.",
            "Both stories feature exceptional world-building, making the choice largely a matter of personal preference. For me, the Roman/Anglo-Saxon Iron Age setting resonated slightly more than the Norse-inspired one."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This is a masterpiece, with superb world building, a scintillating plot, and unforgettable characters. While I slightly prefer *The Faithful and the Fallen* for its epic scope and setting, *The Bloodsworn Saga* is equally brilliant. The emotional depth, especially in the Acknowledgments, adds a profound layer to the experience. I eagerly await the next book.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Series Conclusion:**  \n  I am stunned. What an amazing conclusion to an amazing series.  \n- **World Building:**  \n  The world building is superb in both series, so it comes down to preference; I think the Roman/Anglo-Saxon (?) Iron Age setting in *The Faithful and the Fallen* just hit my sweet spot a tiny bit more than the Norse one in *The Bloodsworn Saga*.  \n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot is scintillating, with formidable action sequences that kept me engaged throughout.  \n- **Characters:**  \n  I’m in this for the characters. I love them all, to differing degrees, but love them I do. This even includes the antagonists, which is a very rare experience for me.  \n  - **Orka:** Orka is just such a great character – a formidable, renowned warrior seeking her abducted son. One of my favorite moments is when she explains why she abandoned the mercenary group of the Bloodsworn; the leader’s reaction brought tears to my eyes.  \n  - **Elvar:** Initially my least favorite protagonist due to her hubris and lust for battle-fame, her character arc is perfect. She is responsible for one of my absolute favorite moments (Chapter 54).  \n  - **Varg:** I enjoyed his PoV and sympathized with his quest for vengeance for his murdered sister. Seeing him become one of the Bloodsworn, both in skill and spirit, was emotionally rewarding, though he left the faintest impression on me.  \n  - **Antagonists:**  \n    - **Biórr:** He is rather naive, and his reasoning justifying his actions is sound – at least until you take a closer look and realize he is on the wrong side of things.  \n    - **Guðvarr:** I even like him; his inner monologue cracks me up, and he keeps surprising me by killing people and weaseling out of tight spots.  \n- **Comparison to Other Series:**  \n  I often pondered which series I like better, *The Faithful and the Fallen* or *The Bloodsworn Saga*. *The Faithful and the Fallen* felt a little more epic, with a larger scope. Based on the characters I loved (and loathed), I think I have to go with *The Faithful and the Fallen*.  \n- **Acknowledgments and Personal Reflection:**  \n  I did not know of the death of John Gwynne’s daughter Harriet. Reading about it in the Acknowledgments devastated me. The way he describes grief as an ocean with no shore in sight is beautifully and aptly phrased. It resonated deeply with me, and I hope it speaks to others who have lost someone.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis series is a masterpiece, with superb world building, a scintillating plot, and unforgettable characters. While I slightly prefer *The Faithful and the Fallen* for its epic scope and setting, *The Bloodsworn Saga* is equally brilliant. The emotional depth, especially in the Acknowledgments, adds a profound layer to the experience. I eagerly await the next book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

I was initially nervous about how the story would conclude, but it ended perfectly. These books are precious to me, and I love them deeply.  \n\n- **Writing Quality and Execution:**  \n  John Gwynne’s writing is masterful, especially in crafting battles and fight scenes. His experience as a reenactor adds an extra layer of authenticity and emotion to every moment, from shields locking together to the fatigue setting in. The ship battle was particularly amazing.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  It took me a little while to get back into the story, partly because I wished I had reread the first two books and partly because I read an eARC on my phone, which isn’t my preferred format. However, the book includes a marvelous recap at the beginning, which helped.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  The book is filled with chaos, and I wasn’t sure how it would end satisfyingly, especially with so few pages left. Yet, it stuck the landing perfectly, delivering a conclusion that felt both epic and heartfelt.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The story is deeply emotional, and I felt a strong connection to the characters and their journey. The ending left me feeling satisfied and grateful for the experience.  \n\n- **Author’s Effort and Future Work:**  \n  I appreciate the time and care John Gwynne took to craft this Viking fantasy. I’m excited to read whatever he writes next.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to Netgalley and Orbit for providing the eARC. My review is entirely my own and reflects my genuine thoughts.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis trilogy is a masterpiece, combining epic battles, emotional depth, and a satisfying conclusion. John Gwynne’s writing is exceptional, and I’m deeply grateful for this heartfelt Viking fantasy. It’s a series I’ll cherish forever.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars. All the stars."

            "The plot unfolds as a thrilling journey where characters unite to confront a dragon god. With intense sea battles and a fast-paced narrative, the story masterfully blends character development with grimdark fantasy elements. The battles are vividly violent and steeped in magic, creating an immersive experience. While the ending is satisfying, I still have questions about certain events in the final chapters. There’s clear potential for a continuation or spin-off, which I would eagerly welcome. However, I was disappointed that Snaka, prominently featured on the cover, didn’t have a more significant role.",
            "**Orka:** A sharp and fierce embodiment of both a mother and a \"girlboss,\" Orka's unwavering determination to protect her son stands out. Despite her tough exterior, she embraces help from others and demonstrates genuine care for her friends, showcasing significant character growth. \n\n**Elvar:** A strong leader grappling with suspicion, Elvar's treatment of the tainted raises questions. Although she eventually softens, her decision to keep them collared out of fear is difficult to support. \n\n**Varg:** His storyline revolves around the found family trope and a quest for vengeance. While driven by revenge, he discovers new values, such as friendship and camaraderie. \n\n**Ulfrir:** A key character in the narrative, Ulfrir's admirable personality and interactions with Elvar made him particularly endearing to me. \n\n**Byorr:** A steadfast yet biased villain, Byorr's journey intrigued me, even if I wasn't rooting for him. \n\n**Gudvarr:** A narcissistic coward, Gudvarr is largely unremarkable and whiny. While I didn't care for him, his eventual downfall provided a touch of amusement.",
            "The world-building in the Bloodsworn trilogy is truly remarkable. The vivid descriptions create an immersive experience, akin to watching an epic adventure unfold in my mind. The grimdark fantasy elements are masterfully depicted, with a mix of familiar and new enemies that heighten the tension and suspense throughout the story."

        "conclusion": "This is one of the best grimdark fantasy series I’ve read in a long time. With unforgettable world-building, a gripping plot, and complex characters, it was an epic ride. While the ending left some questions unanswered and Snaka’s role was underwhelming, I’m hopeful for more stories in this world.",

The detailed descriptions made it feel like I was watching an epic adventure movie inside my head. The grimdark fantasy aspect was vividly portrayed, with new and old enemies adding tension, suspense, and thrill to the story.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot is a nerve-wracking journey where characters join forces to slay a dragon god. It features intense sea battles, a rapidly moving storyline, and urgent storytelling that emphasizes both character development and the grimdark fantasy elements. The battles are deliciously violent and infused with magic, making the story gripping and immersive.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - **Orka:** Sharp, vicious, and the epitome of a “mother” and “girlboss.” Her bond with her son and her unstoppable determination to ensure his safety were highlights. Despite her rough edges, she accepted help from others and showed genuine care for her friends, marking a fine shift in her character.  \n  - **Elvar:** A strong leader but with mixed feelings due to her suspicious nature and treatment of the tainted. While she eventually came around, her decisions to keep them collared because she felt threatened were hard to agree with.  \n  - **Varg:** His chapters centered on the found family trope and vengeance arc. While driven by revenge, he found new things to care about, like friendship and camaraderie.  \n  - **Ulfrir:** Played a significant role in this book, with admirable personality and interactions with Elvar. I warmed up to him a lot.  \n  - **Byorr:** A steadfast, biased, and single-minded villain. I wasn’t rooting for him but was intrigued by his journey.  \n  - **Gudvarr:** A narcissistic coward and fool, unremarkable and whiny. I didn’t care for him but found his eventual downfall amusing.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was well-rounded, but I have lingering questions about some events in the final chapters. There’s potential for a continuation or spin-off series, which I’d eagerly welcome. However, I was disappointed that Snaka didn’t play a bigger role despite being featured on the cover.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Bloodsworn trilogy is one of the best grimdark fantasy series I’ve read in a long time.

Additionally, the pattern of the first two titles (*The Shadow of the Gods* and *The Hunger of the Gods*) suggests that the third title will also feature a six-letter word, and *\"Battle\"* fits perfectly.\n\n- **Plot Speculation:**  \n  Book 2 hints at a major conflict involving the resurrected gods, which I predict will be the central focus of Book 3. This battle is likely to be monumental, impacting both the world of Vigrith and the characters within it.\n\n- **Cover Art Prediction:**  \n  Given that the covers of the previous books feature animal gods, I speculate that the cover of Book 3 will depict one of the following: Rotta, Orna, or Snaka. These three animal gods are frequently mentioned in Book 2, making them strong candidates for the cover art.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI am excited about my predictions for the title, plot, and cover art of Book 3 in the Bloodsworn Saga Trilogy. I can’t wait to see if my guesses are correct and would love to hear others’ thoughts on this!\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The POV characters I disliked were still interesting enough that I never felt frustrated reading their perspectives.  \n\n- **Plot and Storylines:**  \n  The overall plot was solid and entertaining, with side plots that were interesting and fulfilling. I particularly enjoyed how most of them wrapped up. The way the author intertwined the different characters and their storylines was one of my favorite aspects—seeing favorite characters through different POVs or the consequences of one character's decisions appearing in another POV was incredibly satisfying.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The pacing and tone were spot on. The story included consequences to actions, difficult decisions, and plenty of bittersweet moments. There were times when I was so tense that I had to put the book down and take a break to brace myself.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I really loved this ending to the trilogy. It felt like a fitting conclusion to an amazing series, and I will definitely reread these books in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is an excellent ending to an incredible trilogy. The series excels in worldbuilding, character development, and intricate storytelling. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it and look forward to reading more from the author in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating, likely 5/5 or equivalent."

Despite the time gap since the previous book, *Hunger of the Gods*, and having read over 200 books in between, it was surprisingly easy to dive back into this world.  \n  - John Gwynne provides a helpful recap of events, a cast of characters, a pronunciation guide, and a glossary of terms at the beginning, which I found incredibly useful and wish more authors would do.  \n\n- **Pacing and Action:**  \n  - This might be the most action-heavy book I’ve read of this size. Once the action starts, it doesn’t let up until the very end.  \n  - While I often enjoy slow-burn fantasy epics with extensive world-building and philosophical exploration, I also appreciate series like this that get straight to the point and let the action speak for itself.  \n\n- **Combat Authenticity:**  \n  - Gwynne’s reenactment experience shines through in the detailed descriptions of battle dress, weapons, and techniques, making the close-quarters combat scenes feel immersive and intense.  \n\n- **Character Development and Themes:**  \n  - Amidst the action, there are great character moments and a strong focus on the importance of family bonds.  \n  - The Norse-inspired storytelling blends traditional sagas with epic fantasy, creating a Viking-like world enriched with giant resurrected gods and magic.  \n\n- **Stakes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - Knowing that Gwynne isn’t afraid to kill off main or beloved side characters kept the stakes high and maintained tension throughout every page.  \n  - The ending was satisfying and bittersweet, leaving some room for potential future stories in this world, which I hope the author revisits.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Excitement:**  \n  - Many thanks to NetGalley and Little, Brown Book Group UK for providing an eARC in exchange for an honest review.  \n  - I’m thrilled to have had early access to this concluding story and eagerly await my pre-ordered and signed hardback, expected to arrive on the release date of 24th October 2024.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Fury of the Gods* delivers an action-packed, immersive, and emotionally resonant conclusion to the trilogy.

This is my third experience with their work, and I’m continually amazed by their ability to tie together all narrative threads with a masterful blend of emotion, storytelling, and respect for their characters. The climax of this book begins around the 60% mark, dedicating nearly 300 pages to the final battle, much like the gripping finale of *Avengers: Endgame*. I found myself deeply invested in each character's fate.",

This is the third series of his I've completed, and every time I'm astounded by how he wraps up all the threads with the perfect blend of emotion, story writing, and integrity to the characters he's created. The ending of this book really starts from about 60 percent, which means there are 300 or so pages dedicated to the final battle. This was reminiscent of the end of *Avengers: Endgame*, where you are comprehensively invested in every single character's outcome.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  The story is of epic proportions, and I was deeply invested in the characters. However, I do think there were perhaps too many characters at times, and one of the point-of-view (PoV) characters just didn’t work for me across books 2 and 3.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Authors:**  \n  John Gwynne is, in my opinion, the best writer of epic fantasy since Tolkien.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a masterful piece of storytelling with an emotionally satisfying and action-packed finale.

It solidified my status as a lifelong fan of John Gwynne, and I’m already eager to reread it. The Bloodsworn Saga has become one of my new favorite fantasy series of all time.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The Fury of the Gods is the final installment in the series, and it masterfully weaves together all the various plotlines into an epic, bloody conclusion. The pacing was fast and addicting, making the book utterly unputdownable. The ending was as perfect as one could ask for, with every POV concluding in a satisfying way.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are all wonderful, even the ones you love to hate. I felt a special connection with Svik, a vain, cheese-loving oaf who remained my favorite throughout the series. Every character was written so well, with their own motivations and beliefs, making each POV enjoyable (for the most part). Orka, in particular, is a standout badass.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The conclusion left me feeling incredibly satisfied, though also hollow now that the series is over. The emotional highs and lows, especially after the shocking ending of the previous book, were intense and memorable.\n\n- **Series as a Whole:**  \n  The Bloodsworn Saga is a masterfully written, Viking-inspired fantasy that is brutal, bloody, and utterly captivating. It’s a series I picked up on a whim but quickly became obsessed with. I have so many theories and questions, but I’ll leave it at this: this series is golden.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Fury of the Gods is a perfect conclusion to the Bloodsworn Saga, delivering an epic, satisfying, and emotionally impactful ending. With its fast-paced plot, well-written characters, and brutal Viking-inspired world, this series is a must-read for fantasy fans.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5⭐️ (as a book and for the Bloodsworn Saga altogether)"

            "The fight scenes were epic and expertly executed. While some plot points felt predictable—likely due to effective foreshadowing—there were also several unexpected twists. Many questions were answered, though a few remain unresolved, inviting discussion and speculation. The ending was perfect, offering a fitting conclusion to the trilogy. I was left in disbelief that it was over and felt inspired to explore the author's other works.",
            "Orka is my favorite main character of all time, not just as a female protagonist. She embodies a perfect balance of strength and compassion, and her moments with Breca are truly touching. Additionally, the fact that nearly every character faced their comeuppance added a satisfying layer to the story.",
            "The story employs a soft magic system that unfolds gradually throughout the narrative. Magic is rune-based, with ordinary humans wielding staffs made from Froa, while those Tainted by Snaka’s blood possess innate magical abilities. The absence of detailed rules or explanations regarding the magic is not a flaw but rather a stylistic choice. Additionally, since none of the POV characters are magic users, this accounts for the limited exploration of the magic system.",
            "The book left me feeling forlorn and plunged into a deep book depression now that it’s over. It surprised me, made me laugh, and brought me to the brink of tears. The character development was both beautiful and heartbreaking, leaving a lasting impact even though I didn’t cry."

In contrast, Gudvarr remains unpleasant and unsympathetic, effectively fulfilling his role in the story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The book picks up right where the second book left off, with a helpful summary of the previous events.  \n  - It delivers an epic and satisfying conclusion, especially for fans of the series.  \n  - The story is action-heavy, with combat scenes in almost every chapter, but the variety keeps it fresh (e.g., ship-to-ship combat, shield walls, epic battles, intimate duels).  \n  - The action is well-written, with clear descriptions that make it easy to follow even in chaotic scenes.  \n\n- **Character Development and Arcs:**  \n  - The five POV characters from the previous book continue to be central, with Elvar standing out as a particularly compelling character this time.  \n  - Each main character has a satisfying conclusion to their arc, though not all endings are happy.  \n  - The author isn’t afraid to kill off beloved characters in impactful and sometimes cruel ways.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  - The book explores themes of family (both blood and found), friendship, and brotherhood in a heartfelt but not overly sentimental way.  \n  - There are touching moments of reunion, grief, bonding, and care between characters, which make the stakes of the action feel meaningful.  \n\n- **Villains and Antagonists:**  \n  - Lik-Rafa is a strong main villain, but Rotta stands out as particularly sinister and compelling, stealing every scene he’s in.  \n\n- **World-Building and Detail:**  \n  - The author excels at describing weapons, armor, and tactics, adding depth to the combat scenes.  \n  - The world feels rich and immersive, with a mix of humans, gods, and creatures participating in the action.  \n\n- **Criticisms and Loose Ends:**  \n  - The book is very combat-heavy, which might not appeal to everyone, though fans of the series will likely expect this.  \n  - There are a couple of minor loose ends regarding a character and an item whose fates are not fully resolved, leaving room for potential sequels.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis final installment of the Bloodsworn saga is a thrilling and emotionally resonant conclusion that delivers on all fronts. John Gwynne masterfully balances epic action with heartfelt character moments, making it a must-read for fans of the series. While it’s combat-heavy and leaves a few minor questions unanswered, it’s a satisfying and impactful end to the saga.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 10/10 (The reviewer states, \"he's officially ten books out of ten for me now.\")"

Both were even better the second time, heightening my excitement for the final book, especially after the cliffhanger ending of Hunger of the Gods.\n\n- **Satisfaction with the Ending:**  \n  The Fury of the Gods delivered everything I wanted in a finale.

This depth of character development continues right up to the last page.\n\n- **Battle Scenes and Deaths:**  \n  The book is packed with marvellous battles and numerous deaths, but nothing feels gratuitous. Every death is purposeful and adds layers to the story. John Gwynne’s battle scenes are unmatched—raw, immersive, and so vivid that you feel like you’re in the thick of the action. This book felt like one continuous battle, yet it never dragged or hindered the story’s progression.\n\n- **Pacing and Reading Experience:**  \n  The fast-paced nature of the book made it an exhilarating read. Despite the constant action, the story’s development remained strong, creating a perfect balance between intensity and narrative depth.\n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  This series has solidified John Gwynne as my favourite author, and the Bloodsworn Saga has earned a place in my top 10 all-time favourite series.

Gwynne knocked it out of the park by wrapping up each storyline nicely. No one died 'unnecessarily' or 'gratuitously.' Everything made sense in the context of the story. The Bloodsworn Saga finishes in a very nice, well-rounded way.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  My absolute favorite warrior, Orka, continued to hold her own throughout the whole book. She is so, so, so cool. How awesome is it that the most badass warrior of the bunch is a woman? And not even a young woman—Orka's a middle-aged mother! Such a neat character. I would have read the series if it was only through her POV, honestly.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  My one 'complaint,' I guess you'd call it, is that Snaka's appearance was extremely short-lived and almost (almost!) unnecessary. It did bring some gravitas to the situation the characters found themselves in, but ultimately it didn't really do anything to the story that wasn't already happening.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  The Bloodsworn Saga is absolutely worth the read. I can't recommend this one enough—especially if you're fond of Viking-esque stories. Please go read this series. It's so good.  \n\n- **Author's Work:**  \n  I think I will definitely be picking up some of Gwynne's older work as this series was the first by him that I've ever read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Bloodsworn Saga is a masterfully concluded series with well-rounded storylines, compelling characters (especially Orka), and a satisfying ending. While Snaka's appearance felt slightly unnecessary, it didn't detract from the overall excellence of the book.

Orka’s journey from losing everything to finding her family again was deeply satisfying. Varg’s development, from finding his place among the Bloodsworn to getting his revenge, was incredibly rewarding. Biorr’s inner conflict and slight redemption added depth to his character. Even villains like Rotta and Guthvarr were compelling and hateable in the best way.\n\n- **Twists and Emotional Moments:**  \n  The book was full of jaw-dropping twists, such as Grend being tainted and Elvar freeing the tainted. Orka’s survival and Spert’s heartbreaking death were emotional highlights. The reunion between Vesli and Breca, as well as Orka and Breca’s moments, were beautiful. The deaths of Einar and Glornir were heartbreaking but beautifully handled.\n\n- **Villains and Antagonists:**  \n  The villains, particularly Rotta and Lik Rifa, were incredibly hateable yet fascinating. Their interactions felt human and vulnerable, making them more compelling. The grotesque scene of them killing Snaka and Vesli stealing his heart was a standout moment.\n\n- **Ending and Potential for Sequel:**  \n  The ending was bittersweet, with many characters finding peace while others were lost. The Bloodsworn making a home at Orka and Thorkel’s old steading felt perfect. Gwynne left plenty of threads open for a potential sequel, which excites me, but he wrapped up the character arcs beautifully.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFury is a masterful conclusion to an incredible trilogy. It delivered everything I wanted: jaw-dropping twists, emotional depth, satisfying character arcs, and compelling villains. The ending was bittersweet but perfect, leaving room for potential sequels while wrapping up the story beautifully. This trilogy is an all-time favorite for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a perfect or near-perfect score (e.g., 5/5 or 10/10)."

I will miss each of these characters as if they were friends, which speaks volumes about how well they were written.  \n\n- **Action and Pacing:**  \n  The battle scenes are unforgettable, and I don’t think any other author can compare to John Gwynne in this regard.

Almost every character had someone they needed to kill for revenge, and these events happened back-to-back, which felt forced. It might have been more effective if these moments were spread out over the book or the entire series.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.

It was a perfect conclusion to the trilogy.\n\n- **Writing Style and Emotional Impact:**  \n  John Gwynne's ability to write the most vicious battle scenes I've ever read, alongside some of the most heartwarming and heartbreaking moments, left me in awe. The emotions this book evoked were intense—I was furious, giddy, and sobbing real ugly tears, especially during the last 10% of the book.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The themes of grit, vengeance, loyalty, and love were beautifully portrayed. The characters will forever hold a special place in my heart. I particularly felt protective of Spert and Vesli—they must be protected at all costs!\n\n- **World-Building and Accessibility:**  \n  The cast of characters is very large, but the detailed character listings, glossary, and recap of previous events provided an excellent refresher and made the story more accessible. This thoughtful addition enhanced my reading experience.\n\n- **Personal Connection and Gratitude:**  \n  I feel incredibly lucky to have had the chance to read this book early. The story and characters resonated deeply with me, and I’m eternally impressed by Gwynne’s storytelling. I also have a few playful thoughts for the author: Orka should be mentioned in the summary, and we *need* more of this world!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFury has solidified the Bloodsworn as my favorite trilogy, possibly ever. It’s a masterful blend of action, emotion, and unforgettable characters. I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone looking for a gripping and emotionally charged fantasy series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific numerical rating was mentioned in the review, but the tone and language suggest a highly positive evaluation, likely a 5/5 or equivalent.)"

The scenes just jump off the page, creating such cinematic melees and battles.  \n\n- **Author's Personal Context:**  \n  - For Gwynne to have written this after suffering (and continuing to suffer) such heartbreak and grief is nothing short of remarkable.  \n  - To have the strength to go back to writing a series in a world so changed for him must have been incredibly difficult, and I know as a huge fan among many that we are all so grateful that he did.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an exceptional conclusion to the trilogy, leaving a lasting emotional impact and showcasing John Gwynne's mastery of character development, world-building, and gripping battle scenes. The realistic and heartfelt ending, combined with the author's personal resilience, makes this a standout read.

His newfound confidence is reflected in his budding romance with Rokia, which finally begins to blossom.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Orka remains the standout character of the trilogy, one of the most complex and fascinating characters I’ve encountered. Her relentless determination to find Breca, even resisting the powerful influence of Ulfrir, showcases her strength and resolve. Elvar’s development across the series is also noteworthy. In this book, she finally takes charge and makes choices that reflect her own sense of fairness, marking significant growth as a leader and person.  \n\n- **Lore and World-Building:**  \n  The lore surrounding Orka is mindblowing—her history as the former leader of the Bloodsworn, with a husband who was one of them, adds depth to her character. It would be amazing if Gwynne explored a prequel featuring Breca as the protagonist, imagining the warrior he could become.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book delivers a gripping and heartfelt conclusion to an unforgettable trilogy. It’s raw, visceral, and deeply moving, making it a must-read for anyone seeking a powerful fantasy series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Fury of the Gods* brilliantly completes John Gwynne’s Bloodsworn Saga, offering a sensational and immersive conclusion. With its engaging plot, incredible character dynamics, and rich lore, it’s a deeply emotional and action-packed finale that leaves a lasting impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The first half of the book primarily sets the stage for the climactic battles, which somewhat slows the momentum. However, this is more than compensated for in the second half, where skirmishes, intricate plots, and high-stakes confrontations create a relentless pace of action.",
            "The five main POV characters are distinct, each with unique goals, philosophies, and character development. Elvar grapples with imposter syndrome and the challenges of leadership, while Biorr rationalizes his actions in the name of the greater good. Orka is driven by a quest for vengeance and peace for her son, Varg is dedicated to protecting his chosen kin, and Gudvarr embodies an unapologetically selfish man-child. The side characters are strong and memorable, though a few lean towards being one-dimensional.",

The second half is filled with skirmishes, plots, and high-stakes fights that keep the action thick and fast.\n\n- **Action and Descriptions:**  \n  The battles are fierce, bloody, and vividly described, with detailed and realistic depictions that immerse the reader in the chaos. The grisly details are so intense that they evoke sensory experiences, making the reader feel as though they are in the midst of the action.\n\n- **Character Development and Arcs:**  \n  The five main POV characters remain distinct, each with their own goals, philosophies, and growth (or lack thereof). Their arcs are well-developed and true to their established personalities. Elvar struggles with imposter syndrome and leadership, Biorr justifies his actions for the greater good, Orka seeks vengeance and peace for her son, Varg fights to protect his chosen kin, and Gudvarr remains an unapologetically selfish man-child. Side characters are strong and memorable, though some are slightly one-dimensional.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The book effectively ties together plot threads from the previous installments and delivers on the promises made earlier in the series. The Norse-inspired culture, myth, and legend are fascinating and add depth to the world. The final clashes are memorable and satisfying.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Series Conclusion:**  \n  As a fan of the previous books and someone who enjoys strong action and Norse-inspired themes, I found this to be a solid and fitting conclusion to the trilogy. It delivers on its promises and leaves a lasting impression. The Bloodsworn Trilogy has been a fantastic ride, and I would love to see more stories set in this world, particularly one exploring the gods of the southern continent, Iskidan.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a satisfying and action-packed conclusion to the Bloodsworn Trilogy. While not without minor flaws, it delivers on its promises, ties up plot threads effectively, and leaves a lasting impression.

These entities coexist with lesser beings, who, despite their shorter lifespans, limited power, and lesser intelligence, strive to survive and thrive in a chaotic and oppressive environment.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The story explores profound themes such as helplessness, survival, love, freedom, and hope. It delves into the struggles of beings who are rendered powerless by their own natures yet continue to strive against overwhelming odds. The narrative raises questions about whether there is any way out of this existential struggle and whether love, freedom, or hope can exist in such a world.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Conflict:**  \n  The interactions between the vastly different beings—ranging from the mad, powerful entities to the lesser, striving ones—create a rich tapestry of conflict and tension. The characters' struggles are driven by their inherent limitations and the relentless pressure to survive in a world dominated by fear and hatred.\n\n- **Resolution and Meaning:**  \n  The novel suggests that any semblance of love, freedom, or hope is fleeting and must be earned through strength, wisdom, and perseverance. The characters can only hold onto these positive aspects for a limited time, emphasizing the transient nature of their existence and the constant battle to maintain what little they have.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers a deeply thought-provoking exploration of existence in a world defined by chaos, power imbalances, and existential struggle. It challenges readers to consider the nature of hope, love, and freedom in the face of overwhelming adversity, leaving a lasting impression of both despair and resilience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The intricate details and the richness of the setting pulled me in and made the world feel alive.\n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic system is intriguing and well-integrated into the story, adding depth and excitement to the narrative.\n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The plot is well-balanced, with a mix of individual character arcs and overarching storylines. The final book effectively wraps up numerous character arcs and the overall plot, culminating in a massive, expertly written war.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The series boasts an incredibly human cast of characters. While the final book focuses more on the battle and less on character growth compared to the first two, all POV characters are concluded in satisfying ways. The earlier character work makes the reader care deeply about the battle and its outcomes.\n\n- **Moral Complexity:**  \n  The series blurs the line between good and evil, presenting both sides of the conflict with valid motivations but questionable methods. This moral grayness forces the reader to question what is truly right and wrong, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Villain Perspective:**  \n  One of the unique aspects of the series is the inclusion of POVs from the \"villains\" later in the book. This humanizes the antagonists and creates contradictions, making the story more complex and engaging.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The series delivers powerful emotional moments, from shocking twists to tearful conclusions. The resolution of various storylines, including the unexpected death of Elvar, left a lasting impact.\n\n- **Favorite Characters:**  \n  Rotta, a character who is arguably worse than the main antagonist Lik-Rifa, stands out as a fascinating and charming yet selfish and cowardly villain. His complexity and charm make him one of my favorite characters in the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Bloodsworn Saga is a standout epic fantasy series that excels in world-building, character development, and moral complexity.

            "I appreciated how the author embraced the moral ambiguity of the war. Initially, there are no clear heroes, despite the presence of valiant figures. I find myself inclined to support Ulfrir’s side—Elvar’s side—but as Varg insightfully points out, we are ultimately fighting for the enslavers, symbolized by Ulfrir’s own thrall collar. The oppressed flock to Lif-Rika, yearning for the equality they deserve, seeking a life free from the shackles of their uncontrollable bloodlines. However, Lif-Rika is portrayed as a dangerous and unpredictable despot. This creates a compelling social commentary. While I would have liked more exploration of these themes towards the end, I still appreciated the author’s approach, especially in Biorr’s arc."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Finale and Continuation Potential:**  \n  *Fury of the Gods* was a perfect finale to this epic, Viking-inspired trilogy. It provided enough of an opening to potentially have future books written in Vigrith, which I’m all for.  \n\n- **Handling of Criticism:**  \n  I think Gwynne took online criticism to heart because “thought cage” isn’t even mentioned until chapter 4, and I thought it was used relatively sparingly compared to the past two installments, thank the dead gods.  \n\n- **Moral Complexity and Social Commentary:**  \n  I really liked how Gwynne leaned into how morally grey this war is. There are no clear-cut good guys, at least not at first, despite us reading about valiant heroes. The reader is inclined to root for Ulfrir’s side—Elvar’s side—but as Varg so astutely puts it, they are fighting on behalf of the enslavers, poignantly represented with Ulfrir’s own thrall collar. The tainted flock to Lif-Rika in droves, seeking equality they deserve, a life where they needn’t be slaves merely because of their uncontrollable bloodlines. Yet, Lif-Rika is clearly a despot, dangerous and unpredictable. It’s an interesting social commentary, and while I would have liked a little more time fleshing it out in the end, I still appreciated how Gwynne addressed it—particularly with Biorr’s arc.  \n\n- **Battle Scenes and Narrative Tension:**  \n  With such an intense lead-up to the showdown between gods, Gwynne does not disappoint. There are a ton of battle scenes, and every single one was incredibly intense. My anxiety was active. I was torn between not wanting anything bad to happen to our main characters and my desire to know the outcome, to know who survives in such high stakes. Gwynne is realistic in his assessment that such a war would not leave his entire cast unscathed. He was also brutal in his choices—no spoilers here, other than to say I was satisfied with his choices for narrative purposes, even if I was also heartbroken.  \n\n- **Format and Accessibility:**  \n  I treated myself to both the Kindle version and the audiobook, and I really enjoyed both—as well as the luxury of being able to switch between either version. I also appreciated that Gwynne provided the cast of characters with their primary histories at the beginning of this novel, as he did in the second.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Impact:**  \n  Gwynne provided an epic finale to this series. I loved spending time with all of the characters, and I especially loved how he set up some poignant moments throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is an absolute favorite series for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone who would enjoy some epic Viking-inspired fantasy thundering around within their own thought-cages.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I had heard of *The Faithful and the Fallen* and its sequel series but hadn’t read them yet. The hype around *The Shadow of the Gods* in May 2021 convinced me to dive in, and it was a powerful debut, followed by an even better sequel. After exploring Gwynne’s other series and spin-offs, I’ve come full circle to the conclusion of *The Bloodsworn Saga*.  \n\n- **Final Battle Sequences:**  \n  Gwynne excels at crafting hyped final battle sequences where the forces of good and evil clash in unique locations, often enhanced by terrain or magic. Whether the protagonists are on the offensive or defensive, these battles are always thrilling and well-executed.  \n\n- **Character Development and Standouts:**  \n  The characters are a highlight, especially the point-of-view characters: Orka (the best of the series), Varg, Elvar, and the villains Biorr and Gudvarr. Each has distinct perspectives and motivations, ranging from simple to complex. Biorr, in particular, was a compelling antagonist with reasonable motivations, while Gudvarr was more straightforwardly villainous. The supporting cast, including Glornir, Rotta the Rat, and various creature companions, added depth and richness to the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Potential for Spin-offs:**  \n  The ending was satisfying while leaving room for potential spin-offs. I’m especially intrigued by the foreign invaders from the south and their culture, which opens up exciting possibilities for future stories.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Gwynne’s writing style is a standout feature. He excels not only in action sequences but also in character dialogue, traveling scenes, and depictions of nature. His prose is concise and purposeful, avoiding unnecessary excess, which I greatly appreciate.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a thrilling conclusion to *The Bloodsworn Saga*, showcasing John Gwynne’s strengths in crafting epic battles, memorable characters, and immersive storytelling. It’s a fitting end to the series while leaving the door open for future explorations in this world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars.  \n\n*(Received an ARC from Orbit and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.)*"

Many fantasy books present expansive maps but confine their stories to a single region.

            "In this story, the protagonist Orka is a profoundly wounded and disillusioned character. Her grief over the loss of her husband and son is palpable, and her cynicism toward the gods and their promises adds depth to her persona. Her interactions with Biórr showcase her skepticism and refusal to be swayed by idealistic rhetoric. Meanwhile, Breca, as a young and impressionable character, highlights Orka's determination to teach him survival skills, revealing her protective and pragmatic nature.",

The serpents aboard the Sea-Wolf and the references to Rifa and Rotta suggest a mythology that deeply influences the characters' beliefs and actions. The tension between the oppressed Tainted and their oppressors adds depth to the narrative, emphasizing the struggle for freedom and justice.",

Orka's disdain for the gods, coupled with her belief in their indifference to human suffering, deepens the novel's exploration of power dynamics and the consequences of blind faith. Additionally, the theme of resilience shines through in Orka’s determination to equip Breca with survival skills, emphasizing her commitment to preparing him for a harsh and unforgiving world."

It provided a lot of closure for characters who had been seeking it for three books.  \n- **Character Development:** I saw a lot of the heroes rise and achieve vengeance, which was satisfying.  \n- **Plot Execution:** There was some plot armor, but enough losses occurred to make an impact.  \n- **Snaka’s Role:** I’m still unsure how I feel about Snaka’s return. It was a difficult task to reintroduce such a formidable force without making him overpowered or allowing him to dominate the story. I wanted more of Snaka and his creator’s presence, but I understand that his involvement had to be limited given his destructive nature.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel ended strongly, delivering closure and satisfying character arcs. While Snaka’s return was a complex element to handle, the story managed to balance his presence effectively. Despite some plot armor, the losses and triumphs created a meaningful impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The epic battles are brutal and perfectly choreographed, while the quieter, emotional exchanges leave a lasting impact. Varg’s journey, in particular, is a highlight, offering a blend of action and heartfelt emotion.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  While The Fury of the Gods is a strong and enjoyable finale, it does not quite reach the heights of A Time of Courage, the final book in Gwynne’s Of Blood and Bone series, which remains a personal favorite. Nonetheless, it delivers a fun and rewarding conclusion to the trilogy.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Fury of the Gods is a fitting end to The Bloodsworn Saga, offering a mix of epic battles, emotional depth, and satisfying character arcs.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Conclusion:**  \n  The conclusion of the Bloodsworn saga was exceptionally well-written. The collision between the dragon, the rat, and the wolf was monumental and destructive, living up to expectations. The pacing of this book was much better than the first, and each book in the series improved with its conclusions and battles. The ending was full of surprises, with unexpected twists and elements that kept me guessing, even when I was confident about what would happen.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, Varg, Elvar, and Orka, were unbelievably well-written and developed throughout the series. This book stayed true to their desires and intentions set early in the story, allowing for growth while remaining consistent with their original motivations. Almost every character got the revenge, growth, and conclusion I hoped for. However, I felt Elvar’s character had unrealized potential and depth. While I loved the direction of her story, her on-page transition and growth felt rushed, especially given her pivotal role in the narrative. I wish we had seen more of her evolution, which is why I didn’t give the book 5 stars.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I am genuinely sad that the series has ended because it was that good. The harrowing tales of loss and revenge, combined with the gripping and epic battles, made this series unforgettable. I was particularly moved by Elvar’s journey and her ultimate evolution to free the thralls, even though her death was bittersweet.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The book did a tremendous job of concluding almost every plot point and revenge line. There were no loose ends, and the story felt satisfyingly complete. The author’s ability to surprise and subvert expectations was a highlight, making the reading experience engaging and unpredictable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Bloodsworn saga is a fantastic series with well-developed characters, epic battles, and a satisfying conclusion. While the pacing and character growth improved with each book, Elvar’s rushed development slightly detracted from an otherwise perfect ending. Despite this, the series remains a standout in the genre, and I am sad to see it end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars"

            "The book is action-packed, culminating in a large-scale battle that occupies about a quarter of the story. While the well-executed combat will appeal to fans of Viking and Norse-inspired tales, it occasionally overshadows the character-driven elements. A small redemption arc for one character and a pivotal decision affecting the Tainted feel secondary to the fighting. The ending is satisfying, tying up most loose ends, though I always crave a bit more closure in a trilogy. It offers a fitting conclusion that aligns with the grimdark tone of the narrative. \n\nThe Fury of the Gods, the final installment of the Bloodsworn Saga, unfolds in a world inhabited by Animal gods, The Tainted (humans infused with divine power), Witches, and Viking-like peoples. The story centers on the awakening of the Dragon God, who seeks to dominate the world, while the Wolf God and his allies rise to oppose her. The narrative skillfully alternates between various points of view, showcasing grudges, blood oaths, and the ultimate battle against a dragon. Overall, the story delivers on its promises, requiring a mix of cunning and force to confront the Dragon God, with no character truly safe from peril.",
            "The multiple perspectives enrich the narrative, offering valuable insights into each character's motivations. Varg, a former slave and member of the Bloodsworn, is particularly compelling as he seeks vengeance for his sister's murder. Similarly, Orka, driven by the loss of her husband and the abduction of her son by the Dragon, delivers a deeply satisfying quest for revenge. However, some character development seems to have been sacrificed for action, resulting in fewer intimate, character-focused moments compared to earlier installments."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The Fury of the Gods is an epic and action-packed conclusion to the Bloodsworn Saga, delivering a satisfying, if not entirely happy, ending. Fans of grimdark fantasy, Viking-inspired settings, and intense battles will find much to enjoy, though some may miss the deeper character moments from earlier books. The story wraps up most threads well, leaving readers with a sense of closure and fulfillment.",

The story is action-packed, culminating in an epic conclusion of gods fighting gods. The Dragon God, awakened after centuries, seeks to rule the world, while the Wolf God and his allies stand against her. The narrative alternates between various points of view (PoVs) on both sides of the conflict, with grudges to settle, blood oaths to keep, and a dragon to defeat.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The multiple PoVs help expand the story and provide insight into each character's actions. Varg, a former slave now part of the Bloodsworn, is a standout character seeking vengeance for his sister's murder. Orka, whose husband was killed and son stolen by the Dragon, also stands out, and her quest for vengeance is deeply satisfying. However, some character development felt sacrificed for the sake of action, with fewer smaller, character-centered moments compared to previous books.\n\n- **Action and Pacing:**  \n  The book is filled with battles, leading up to a large-scale conclusion that occupies about a fourth of the story. While the action is well-executed and will appeal to fans of Viking/Norse-inspired battles, it sometimes overshadows the character-driven elements. There is a small redemption arc for one character and a pivotal decision affecting the Tainted, but these moments feel secondary to the fighting.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending is satisfying overall, tying up most loose ends, though I always desire a bit more closure in a trilogy. It provides a good ending rather than a happy one, fitting the grimdark tone of the series. The story delivers on its promises, with a mix of cunning and force required to defeat the Dragon God, and no character is entirely safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Fury of the Gods is an epic and action-packed conclusion to the Bloodsworn Saga, delivering a satisfying, if not entirely happy, ending. Fans of grimdark fantasy, Viking-inspired settings, and intense battles will find much to enjoy, though some may miss the deeper character moments from earlier books.

            "I always feel a mix of excitement and anxiety when a series concludes, but this one provided remarkably satisfying closure. The books are lengthy, and while I enjoy long reads, I felt they could have been slightly shorter. I appreciate short chapters that encourage me to read \"just one more\" multiple times in a night. However, some pivotal scenes unfolded so quickly that I had to reread them to fully grasp what happened; they deserved more attention given their significance.\n\nI generally enjoy multiple points of view, but my focus tends to wane when there are more than four. Since I often read several books simultaneously, it became challenging to keep track of the characters, especially with minimal interaction between their perspectives. At times, it felt like I was reading six different stories. I could have done without the Varg and Biorr POVs. \n\nWhat I would have loved to see is an epic saga-song at the end to highlight \"who made the cut.\"",
            "Orka is my favorite badass female main character—a fierce mother wolf on a quest for revenge and to find her son. Her perspective was truly captivating! I appreciate how the story showcases women in powerful roles, demonstrating that they are just as skilled, if not more so, in battle than their male counterparts. With so many characters to keep track of, I found myself frequently referring to the character index at the beginning of the book.",
            "The author excels at crafting gripping battle scenes, immersing readers in the intense action with vivid detail. While the covers feature impressive beasts, they only appear briefly in the final pages of books 1 and 3. I crave more of their presence!"

        "conclusion": "Overall, this finale was a satisfying and action-packed conclusion, though the length and multiple POVs made it a bit challenging to navigate at times.

Her POV was my absolute favorite!  \n  - I love that women hold powerful positions and are just as (and more) skilled in battle as the men.  \n  - SO many characters, I referred to the character index at the beginning of the book constantly.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - I always get SO nervous when a series comes to an end, but I think this was phenomenally satisfying closure.  \n  - These are looong, I felt like I finished a marathon. I don’t shy away from long books, but I felt these could have been a smidge shorter.  \n  - Short chapters – I love when I feel like I can read “just one more” 37 times a night.  \n  - Certain unalived scenes were so quick I didn't even realize what happened and I had to go back and reread. I felt these deserved much more time given the significance.  \n\n- **World-Building and Detail:**  \n  - John Gwynne without a doubt writes the most outstanding battle scenes, every little detail pulls you right into the bloody action.  \n  - We have these bada$$ beasts on the covers, but yet in books 1 & 3 they are in perhaps 10 pages of the end of the book, I want MORE!  \n\n- **Multiple POVs and Narrative Structure:**  \n  - Bear with me here - multiple POV. I do love multiple POV, but my brain sort of taps out at 4+. This is a personal struggle because since I am typically reading more than one book at a time, it became rather challenging to keep track since there is little interaction between the characters with their different POV, it almost feels like I’m reading 6 different stories in one at times. I could have done without the Varg & Biorr POVs 👀  \n\n- **Reader-Friendly Features:**  \n  - Bless this man for putting a character debrief roster and summary of the previous books, I have the memory of a goldfish so this was clutch.  \n\n- **Ending and Closure:**  \n  - What I would have loved: an epic saga-song at the very end to see “who made the cut” 🤭  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this series finale was a satisfying and action-packed conclusion, though the length and multiple POVs made it a bit challenging to navigate at times. John Gwynne’s talent for crafting intense battle scenes and strong female characters like Orka truly shines, but I wished for more focus on the beasts and a tighter narrative structure.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

After spending three books with these characters, I was left a bit unsatisfied with some storylines.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  - I wanted more lore and background on the gods.  \n  - There was too much focus on less interesting elements, like “nithing arselings humping and smelling piss in every hall they come across.”  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - Despite its flaws, I think this is a solid series that I would recommend to people looking for epic fantasy.  \n  - I look forward to reading the author’s other series to see how they compare.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Bloodsworn Saga is a powerful and emotionally impactful series with strong character development, though it suffers from some repetitiveness, unsatisfying conclusions to certain arcs, and a lack of deeper lore. Despite these issues, it remains a solid recommendation for fans of epic fantasy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Instead, *Shadow of the Gods* was my introduction to his worlds, and I didn’t know what to expect. Now, having completed the trilogy, I’m completely blown away and eager to explore his other series.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really enjoyed the character development throughout the series. Some characters were absolutely lovable, especially as they developed great senses of humor. On the other hand, I absolutely hated some characters, though I understood why they were widely disliked. I could even see myself playing devil’s advocate for them, as they genuinely believed they were doing the right thing with the knowledge they had.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was light, but I think it was the perfect amount, especially given the timing of when it unfolded.\n\n- **Theme and Moral:**  \n  The moral of the story centered on friendship and coming together for a common cause. All roads led to one ending, and while great and not-so-great characters met their demise (sometimes literally), it was executed flawlessly.\n\n- **Helpful Features:**  \n  I found the summaries of each character and their deeds from the previous book incredibly helpful—something I hadn’t seen before. The pronunciation guide for names was also a great addition, and I appreciated that the names weren’t overly complicated or hard to read.\n\n- **Loose Ends and Future Potential:**  \n  One big loose end wasn’t tied up: What will happen with the Iskidan? Will there be a new series? I’m very excited to find out!\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to John Gwynne for immersing me in this fantasy epic, and to Orbit Books and NetGalley for sending the ARC.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis trilogy was an incredible journey, with strong character development, a well-balanced romance, and a powerful theme of unity. While one major loose end remains, it only adds to my excitement for what’s next.

            "The book occasionally felt rushed, especially regarding Elvar’s arc and the limited focus on the Battle-Grim towards the end. While I enjoyed Varg and Orka, I believe other characters, such as Elvar and Biorr, deserved more development.",
            "Initially, the characters in the first two books didn't capture my interest, but Book 3 shifted my perspective. The growth of characters like Elvar and Biorr was particularly compelling. Elvar’s transformation from a typical Vigrðian who accepted slavery to someone who liberated the Tainted was a standout moment. Although her death felt anticlimactic at first, it ultimately served a crucial role in enhancing the narrative's impact. Biorr’s tragic journey, where he renounces vengeance only to succumb to it, was profoundly moving and underscored the story’s anti-revenge theme.",
            "The worldbuilding is exceptional, not due to its size or diversity, but because of the author's deep passion for Norse culture and mythology. The gods, magic, and creatures are intricately woven into the narrative, creating a rich and immersive experience.",
            "This story conveys a compelling anti-revenge message, particularly through Biorr’s journey. Unlike other narratives that merely suggest revenge is unfulfilling, this tale explores the devastating consequences of a revenge-driven culture through a relatable character. The irony of Biorr’s death—where he renounces vengeance only to be killed by someone seeking it—adds a poignant layer to the narrative."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Action Scenes:**  \n  John Gwynne is renowned for his action scenes, and this series lives up to that reputation. Each book in the trilogy features at least one epic moment, such as the awakening of Lik-Rifa in Book 1, Oran’s death and Guðvarr’s betrayal in Book 2, and the resurrection of Shaka and the final battle in Book 3. These scenes are some of the most memorable I’ve encountered in any series.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is incredible, not because it’s the largest or most diverse, but because of John Gwynne’s evident passion for Norse culture and mythology. The gods, magic, and creatures are all intricately woven into the story, making the world feel rich and immersive.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While the characters didn’t initially drive my interest in the first two books, Book 3 changed my perspective. The growth and development of characters like Elvar and Biorr were particularly compelling. Elvar’s transformation from a typical Vigrðian who believed in slavery to someone who freed the Tainted was a highlight. Her death, though initially seeming anticlimactic, was necessary for the narrative’s impact. Biorr’s tragic arc, where he rejects vengeance only to fall victim to it, was deeply moving and reinforced the series’ anti-revenge message.\n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**  \n  The book felt a bit rushed in places, particularly with Elvar’s arc and the lack of screen time for the Battle-Grim after the end. While I loved Varg and Orka, I felt that other groups, like Elvar and Biorr’s, deserved more attention.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The series delivers a powerful anti-revenge message, particularly through Biorr’s story. Unlike other stories that simplify revenge as “not feeling good,” this series shows the devastating consequences of a revenge-obsessed culture through a character we sympathize with. The irony of Biorr’s death, where he rejects vengeance but is killed by someone seeking revenge, is particularly poignant.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was very good and satisfying, with epic action scenes, rich worldbuilding, and compelling character development. While I had a few nitpicks about pacing and focus, the series left a lasting impression, especially with its powerful themes and memorable moments.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Overview & Context:**  \n  The Bloodsworn Saga has become a cornerstone of modern Viking fantasy, with *The Fury of the Gods* serving as the explosive conclusion to the trilogy. It brings together multiple storylines in an epic battle that determines the fate of Vigrið, blending myth, magic, and visceral combat while exploring themes of loyalty, family, and belonging.  \n\n- **Character Development & Relationships:**  \n  John Gwynne excels at crafting complex, flawed characters whose growth feels earned. Varg’s evolution from a lone wolf to a trusted Bloodsworn member is particularly compelling, while Orka’s fierce maternal love drives her arc meaningfully. The author handles multiple POV characters with distinct voices and motivations.  \n\n- **World-Building & Mythology:**  \n  The world of Vigrið is richly detailed, with its culture, religion, and daily life vividly brought to life. Gwynne’s interpretation of Norse mythology feels fresh yet authentic, especially in the complex relationships between gods and mortals. New elements like Ulfrir’s wolf den and the political machinations in Snakavik add depth to the world.  \n\n- **Combat & Action:**  \n  Gwynne’s battle scenes are visceral and tactical, ranging from intimate duels to large-scale conflicts. Each fight serves the story while maintaining genuine danger and consequence. The varied combat styles of characters like Orka’s berserker fury and Elvar’s calculated leadership showcase the author’s understanding of warfare.  \n\n- **Thematic Depth:**  \n  The novel explores themes of family and belonging, examining the concept of chosen family alongside blood ties. Characters like Breca and Bjarn represent the next generation’s struggle to understand their heritage. Elvar’s journey as a leader offers a nuanced look at the responsibilities and sacrifices of leadership.  \n\n- **Writing Style & Craft:**  \n  Gwynne’s prose balances accessibility with poetic flourish. His descriptions of settings like the Jarnvidr (Iron Wood) and Ulfrir’s den create atmosphere without sacrificing clarity. The integration of Norse terms and concepts feels natural rather than forced.  \n\n- **Areas for Improvement:**  \n  - **Pacing Issues:** Certain sections, particularly the gathering of forces at the Wolfdales, feel stretched, and the build-up to the final confrontation may take longer than necessary for some readers.  \n  - **Character Density:** The large cast, while rich and varied, can occasionally overwhelm, especially for new readers trying to keep track of relationships and allegiances.  \n  - **Rushed Plot Threads:** Some plot threads feel hurried in their resolution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Fury of the Gods* delivers a worthy conclusion to the Bloodsworn Saga, solidifying John Gwynne’s place as a leading voice in contemporary fantasy. Despite minor pacing issues and a dense cast, the novel’s strengths—its compelling characters, rich world-building, and thematic depth—far outweigh its weaknesses.

            "In *The Hunger of the Gods*, the characters, especially Orka Skullsplitter, Varg No-Sense, and Elvar, are compelling and well-developed, with clear motivations that enhance the narrative. The story skillfully sidesteps typical “hero” archetypes, maintaining its grimdark tone. Additionally, side characters like Varg and Rokia, along with the dynamic between Rotta and Biorr, stand out in *The Fury of the Gods*.",

The inclusion of mythological figures like the dragon Lik-Rifa and the wolf Ulfrir enhances the depth and intrigue of the narrative.",
            "The story delves into themes of family, inclusion, and bigotry, particularly through characters of divine lineage who face persecution. While it effectively explores these issues, the action-driven finale and the symmetrical resolutions of the characters may leave readers yearning for a deeper meaning."

The story excels in creating an immersive atmosphere and exploring themes of family and inclusion, but the finale’s symmetry and anti-climactic resolutions highlight the tension between visceral enjoyment and deeper meaning.",

            "The emotional impact of Spert’s death was a standout moment, but the pacing slowed significantly afterward. Some side plots, particularly Varg’s storyline, felt unnecessarily prolonged and lost my interest. However, the final battle and the resolution of all plot threads were executed effectively, resulting in a satisfying and impactful conclusion. The author skillfully embraced heartbreak, with the deaths of key characters like Elvar and Biorr being both surprising and fitting. The epic fight scenes, coupled with the absence of plot armor for certain characters, heightened the stakes and made the story feel genuinely impactful.",

His relationship with Orka and his role within their family dynamic were beautifully depicted. Gudvarr and Biorr also left a lasting impression; Gudvarr's cowardice and self-absorption made him oddly endearing, while Biorr's awakening and subsequent death stirred strong emotions. Elvar's character growth was significant as well. Although she was my least favorite POV in earlier books, her relationship with Grend and her tragic demise added considerable depth to her arc.",
            "The expansion of the world and the introduction of numerous side characters were ambitious but ultimately overwhelming. Many characters lacked distinct traits, making it difficult to differentiate them, especially with their Nordic names.

The plot is refreshingly unpredictable, with twists that left me stunned and prompted me to reread passages for clarity.

The intense showdowns allow characters to finally confront their pasts, making for a satisfying and engaging read.",

Her story arc is expertly crafted, and she transcends the typical \"strong female character\" stereotypes. With her fierce determination and formidable skills, she truly embodies the essence of a compelling heroine.",
            "This book is a thrilling, action-packed read filled with gruesome and over-the-top moments. One standout scene features a character having his hands chopped off with an axe, complete with his chilling screams at the bloody stumps—both horrifying and captivating. If you appreciate a blend of “blood and guts” horror with epic fantasy adventure, this book is sure to delight you.",

I was not expecting some of the losses in this book, but Gwynne does a skillful job of laying the groundwork for these emotional sucker-punches. By the end, I wanted vengeance as much as any of the characters did.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The final book in this epic, Viking-inspired trilogy is exactly the conclusion I was looking for. It’s got a bit of everything—propulsive plot, brutal battles, settled scores, and bittersweet endings for some beloved characters. The showdowns are intense throughout as characters finally settle old scores.\n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  The story features a truly inspired reimagining of Viking and Scandinavian lore, which adds depth and richness to the narrative.\n\n- **Action and Tone:**  \n  This is a dynamic, action-packed read with plenty of gruesome, schlocky moments. For example, a scene where a guy gets his hands chopped off with an axe and screams at the bloody stumps is both gruesome and awesome. If you enjoy “blood and guts” horror mixed with epic fantasy adventure, you’ll love this book.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Orka Skullsplitter is one of my favorite characters from a contemporary fantasy series.

At times, the pacing felt too rapid, though I'm uncertain if that was due to my reading speed or the narrative itself.

Initially, I was apprehensive about their journeys, fearing that positive outcomes were unrealistic in such a harsh world. However, their conclusions were beautifully executed.

It will be 5 stars for many people.\n  \n- **Pace (Unputdownable):** 3/5  \n  - The pacing was decent, but I would flip chapters 26 and 27 to create a better surprise. Otherwise, you already know what will happen through chapter 27.\n\n- **Writing Style:** 3/5  \n  - The writing style is direct, which I appreciated in the recap at the beginning. However, some parts of the book were harder to follow.\n\n- **World Building/Creativity:** 5/5  \n  - The world-building is fantastic! The magic and powers are very creative, and I loved this aspect of the book.\n\n- **Characters:** 3/5  \n  - I love the main characters and even the villains, especially Gudvar, who is a great villain with fun and descriptive thoughts. However, I found the cast of characters confusing at times, and I wish there were fewer characters to keep track of.\n\n- **Romance Level:** 1/5  \n  - The romance aspect was minimal in this book.\n\n- **Bloodshed Level:** 5/5  \n  - There is a high level of bloodshed, which adds intensity to the story.\n\n- **Funny/Laughter Level:** 1/5  \n  - The book is not particularly humorous.\n\n- **Spice Level:** 1/5  \n  - There is very little spice or romantic tension.\n\n- **Cry/Tears Level:** 3/5  \n  - The emotional moments were impactful but not overwhelming.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a strong conclusion to the series, with exceptional world-building and creativity. While the pacing and character confusion held it back from being a 5-star read for me, it is still a highly enjoyable and memorable story. The recap at the beginning was helpful, and the villain, Gudvar, was a standout character.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Overall Rating: 8.4/10  \n- Unputdownable (Pace): 3/5  \n- Writing Style: 3/5  \n- World Building/Creativity: 5/5  \n- Characters: 3/5  \n- Romance Level: 1/5  \n- Bloodshed Level: 5/5  \n- Funny/Laughter Level: 1/5  \n- Spice Level: 1/5  \n- Cry/Tears Level: 3/5"

            "In the third book, the first half is largely devoted to setting the stage, featuring extensive travel. The second half culminates in a well-executed but lengthy battle. While the story's general trajectory was established early on, it took too long to gain momentum. The late introduction of new characters and macguffins felt unnecessary and contributed to the book's length. Although some surprises kept the narrative from being entirely predictable, the overall plot remained familiar. Despite this, the execution was engaging."

It was an epic page-turner that kept me hooked from start to finish. A fantastic end to a gripping series that will stay with me long after the final page.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I’ve been emotionally invested in these characters since Book 1, and watching their relationships evolve—particularly the found family dynamic—added a depth of emotion that made the story even more compelling. It had me in tears at certain points.\n\n- **Action and Battle Scenes:**  \n  The battle scenes are some of the best I’ve read in fantasy: intense, well-crafted, and full of high stakes that kept me on edge throughout. While the battle sequences are thrilling and brilliantly written, they occasionally drag on, slightly diminishing the focus on the characters’ growth and journeys.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was a little inconsistent, with some events feeling rushed or compressed in the final sections of the book.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n  This book delivers on every front with powerful moments, epic action, and plenty of heart.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Fury of the Gods is a powerful and emotional conclusion to The Bloodsworn Saga, delivering epic action, deep character connections, and moments that resonate long after reading. Despite some pacing issues and occasional overlong battle scenes, it remains a gripping and satisfying end to the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the pacing had some uneven moments and certain plotlines felt underdeveloped, the overall experience was highly enjoyable, leaving me eager to return to this world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The characters in this book possess greater nuance; unlike in previous works where they often appeared purely *good* or *evil*, here they are more layered and complex.

The characters in this book had more nuance, whereas in the earlier series, they seemed to be either purely *good* or *evil*. While the characters here still weren’t fully nuanced, they were more layered and complex, which I appreciated.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The series had fewer POV characters, which made the story feel more focused and easier to follow. Additionally, I really appreciated that books 2 and 3 started with recaps of the previous books. This was a thoughtful addition that helped me stay engaged with the story.\n\n- **Action and Violence:**  \n  There were fewer battle scenes compared to Gwynne’s previous series, though the story still had plenty of violence. This balance worked well for me, as it allowed more room for character development and plot progression without overwhelming the narrative with constant action.\n\n- **World-Building and Terminology:**  \n  While I enjoyed the world-building overall, some of the terms used in the series, like *thought cage* and *saga tale*, felt very silly to me. This was a minor issue, but it did detract slightly from my immersion in the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed this series and felt that Gwynne made significant improvements over his previous work. The characters were more nuanced, the pacing was better, and the inclusion of recaps was a thoughtful touch. While some of the terminology felt silly, it didn’t overshadow my overall enjoyment of the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars for the series."

When certain events happened to specific characters, I didn’t feel as emotionally affected as I expected.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my minor gripes, it was a great read and a fitting end to the trilogy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book delivers an epic and action-packed conclusion to the Bloodsworn saga, with strong world-building and vivid descriptions. While the fight scenes were overwhelming at times and character development could have been deeper, it remains a satisfying and enjoyable finale to the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As a gamer originally drawn to this series because of my love for *Skyrim*, it was incredibly satisfying to see the final act play out with nonstop action, much like a game finale. Gwynne added twists that kept me guessing about the final outcome, and I believe he delivered a satisfying ending for the characters. The revenge pacts set up in the previous books paid off in gruesome fashion, which was highly rewarding.\n\n- **Character Development and Motives:**  \n  However, I was disappointed that character development and motives took a backseat in this installment. Specifically, Breca’s character felt underutilized, as he was reduced to hitting a \"Mama\" button just to acknowledge his existence. This was a letdown compared to the depth seen in previous books.\n\n- **Pacing and Action Sequences:**  \n  While the action was generally thrilling, one of the earlier fight sequences dragged on longer than necessary. It was the only point in the series where I considered flipping forward a few pages, as it disrupted the otherwise tight pacing.\n\n- **Series Appeal and Accessibility:**  \n  Overall, I am very happy with this series and see it as a great entry point for those new to fantasy. I’m glad I own these books in paperback, as I plan to recommend and pass them on to friends. The awesome covers are an added bonus.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some minor flaws in character development and pacing, *Fury of the Gods* delivered a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.

While the action is intense and well-executed, I personally found myself growing tired of the constant focus on lamellar plate and dripping axes.  \n\n- **Character Development and Plot:**  \n  For a book or series to become a favorite of mine, I need more emphasis on character building and plot. While *The Bloodsworn Saga* excels in its action sequences, I felt it lacked the depth in these areas that I typically look for.  \n\n- **Series Finale and Resolution:**  \n  The series finale wraps up everything in a nice, shiny bow, which I believe most readers will find quite satisfying. The conclusion is well-crafted and provides a sense of closure.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  Despite my personal preferences, the book is overall engrossing and reads quite fast. The pacing keeps the reader engaged throughout, making it an enjoyable experience.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I do recommend the series, even though it isn’t an all-time favorite for me. It is well done and will likely appeal to fans of action-packed fantasy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Fury of the Gods* and *The Bloodsworn Saga* as a whole didn’t fully align with my personal preferences due to its heavy focus on action and battles, I can appreciate its strengths. The series finale is satisfying, the pacing is engaging, and it is a well-crafted story that I would recommend to others, even if it isn’t a personal favorite.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I loved her character direction.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The story provided (mostly) storybook endings.  \n  - I would have appreciated a little more diversity in character and plot.  \n  - The plot felt a bit repetitive with themes of revenge, slavery, and violence (\"slash slash wolf let loose in blood\").  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The world created in this series is amazing, and I would love to see another series set in it.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - This was a good book and a good series that I am happy to have read!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book serves as a fitting end to a strong series, with a focus on Elvars' compelling character arc. While the story delivers satisfying conclusions, it could benefit from more diverse characters and plotlines. Despite some repetitive themes, the world-building is exceptional, leaving me eager for more stories in this universe.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While the story is rich in social and philosophical themes, they often take a backseat to the relentless action. The inevitable clash between the armies of the Wolf and Dragon gods unfolds through a series of brutal battle scenes. Although the author demonstrates a strong talent for writing action, the sheer volume of combat—spanning hundreds of pages—eventually became tiresome for me.",
            "I appreciated the themes of community and brotherhood among the Bloodsworn and Battle-Grim, as well as the intricate dynamics of slavery and power. However, these elements were often overshadowed by the relentless emphasis on violent action scenes.",
            "One of the most compelling aspects of this story is its exploration of power dynamics and the issue of slavery. Following the gods' war 300 years ago, civilization on the continent of Vigrio nearly collapsed, leading to petty Jarls consolidating power. Many inhabitants of small steadings wish to remain uninvolved in these political upheavals but have little voice in the matter. The Tainted, individuals with gods' blood, face persecution; they are hunted down and either killed or enslaved with Thrall collars, a particularly insidious form of bondage. The Bloodsworn, a group of mercenaries composed entirely of Tainted, conceal their identities to avoid enslavement, while the Battle-Grim, another mercenary faction, captures and sells Tainted to the highest bidder, effectively acting as slavers. The Dragon god promises to end slavery for the Tainted but leaves the door open for enslaving the normals, potentially reversing the status quo. Meanwhile, the Wolf god, initially captivated by the Battle-Grim leader, seeks to kill his sister, the Dragon god, even as his army employs thralldom. I found this exploration of power and morality particularly engaging, and the author skillfully develops these themes in this installment."

I liked it, but it could have been so much better. The trilogy can be read on different levels, some of which excelled while others fell flat at the end, so your experience may vary depending on how you connect with the overarching themes.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  One of the standout issues in this series for me was the exploration of who rules and the issue of slavery (thralls). After the gods' war 300 years ago, civilization nearly collapsed, and now petty Jarls are consolidating power on the continent of Vigrio. Many people in small steadings want no part of these political shifts but have little say. The \"Tainted,\" those with gods' blood, were hunted down and either killed or enslaved with \"Thrall collars,\" a particularly insidious form of slavery. The Bloodsworn, a group of mercenaries who are all Tainted, hide their nature to avoid enslavement. The Battle-Grim, another mercenary group, track down and sell Tainted to the highest bidder, essentially acting as slavers. The Dragon god promises to end slavery for the Tainted but leaves open the possibility of enslaving the normals, flipping the status quo. The Wolf god, initially enthralled by the Battle-Grim leader, seeks to kill his sister, the Dragon god, but his army still utilizes thralldom. I loved this aspect of the story, and Gwynne brings it home in this installment.\n\n- **Action and Pacing:**  \n  The major social and philosophical themes take a back seat to the non-stop action. The inevitable clash between the armies of the Wolf and Dragon gods is depicted in endless, brutal battle scenes. Gwynne excels at writing action, but after hundreds of pages of one battle after another, it became a bit tiresome for me.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  I appreciated the ideas of community and brotherhood among the Bloodsworn and Battle-Grim, as well as the complex dynamics of slavery and power. However, these elements were overshadowed by the relentless focus on bloody action scenes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the trilogy and appreciated its exploration of deep themes like power, slavery, and community, the final installment felt unbalanced due to its overemphasis on action. The social and philosophical commentary that initially drew me in was overshadowed by endless battle scenes, making the conclusion feel less impactful than it could have been.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 bloody stars!!"

Guðvarr's perspective was unnecessary; he remained a flat, uninteresting character whose attempts at growth ultimately went nowhere.

I was emotionally invested in the previous books, *The Shadow of the Gods* and *The Hunger of the Gods*, but this one didn’t resonate with me the same way.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  I predicted every single event in the story. The plot felt repetitive, especially from the 50% mark, where the cycle of vengeance and antagonists escaping played out repeatedly until the climax around 80%.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The battle scenes dragged on for too long, and the pacing felt uneven. The first half of the book had a slow buildup, while the second half rushed through events, making the narrative feel disjointed.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The cast felt stagnant. We didn’t get any new insights into the characters, and their arcs didn’t evolve meaningfully. Some significant characters didn’t even appear until around 60% of the book.  \n\n- **Orka’s Role:**  \n  Orka, a standout character from the previous books, didn’t shine as much here. Despite having around 30% of the chapters, her moments of badassery felt underwhelming compared to her earlier feats. Her storyline, particularly with Brecca, didn’t hit the emotional notes I expected.  \n\n- **Spoiler-Related Nitpicks:**  \n  - Brecca’s return at the beginning undermined the emotional impact of Orka’s sacrifice in *The Hunger of the Gods*.  \n  - Lik-Rifa’s resurrection of Snaka only to have him killed shortly after felt unnecessary and jarring.  \n  - The deaths were predictable, and the plot twists didn’t land as effectively as they could have.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  I didn’t feel as emotionally connected to the story as I did with the previous books.

More time to flesh out the characters would have strengthened their emotional journeys and deepened the reader’s connection to them.\n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**  \n  Gwynne’s prose is functional and efficient, clearly describing what needs to be conveyed without lingering on any scene. While this approach works well in action scenes, lending them a rhythmic and fluid quality, it detracts from the emotional depth the story aims to achieve.

His fans are described as overly enthusiastic and almost toxic, claiming his writing can solve life’s biggest problems. This made it difficult to approach the book with an open mind.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style was underwhelming. The chapters were short, resembling a thriller or suspense novel, which didn’t suit the epic fantasy genre. There was repetitive use of certain words like \"ululating,\" similar to the overuse of \"thought cage\" in the previous book. This detracted from the overall experience.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was dominated by excessive combat and action scenes, which made up nearly 70% of the book. I found myself skimming through these sections to get to the actual story. The battle between the gods was a highlight, but it wasn’t enough to elevate the book beyond being just \"okay.\"\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was unsatisfying and felt incomplete, as if it was setting up for a sequel series. This left many questions unanswered and didn’t provide a sense of closure for the trilogy.\n\n- **Length and Content:**  \n  The book was notably short, and much of its content was repetitive, focusing on angry, vengeful violence. This made the reading experience feel monotonous and less engaging.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments, such as the battle between the gods, it fell short of the high expectations set by the hype. The excessive combat, repetitive writing, and unresolved ending made it a mediocre read.

The story would have benefited from a fourth installment or at least an additional 200 pages to develop the ending more effectively. Key plot points, such as Snakka coming to life and the second battle, felt underwhelming and lacked depth. The conclusion left several loose ends, making it feel incomplete. The dragon's death was hard to believe, and while Rotta's survival was fitting for a rat, it felt poorly executed. Additionally, the sudden appearance of wood spirits in the battle was jarring; I would have preferred a storm of wolves, as hinted earlier.",

The ending, though not neatly tied up, feels true to the story and offers a thin beam of light in darkness, which is sometimes all you need to keep going.\n\n- **World-Building and Tone:**  \n  The world of the Bloodsworn Trilogy has always been a cruel place, and it’s at its cruelest in this book. Good people die, suffer, and are forced to grow up before their time. Moments of levity or kindness are few and far between, yet everything fits; nothing felt forced or out of place to me.\n\n- **Pacing and Action:**  \n  My previous complaints about the frenetic pace of the action still hold. While the fast-paced nature of the story keeps things moving, it can feel overwhelming at times.\n\n- **Characterization and Plot Development:**  \n  The relatively weak characterization remains an issue. Certain plot points that come to fruition lack punch—for example, the revelation that the murderer of Varg’s sister is one of the series’ main bad guys feels unsurprising and underwhelming.\n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  I wouldn’t necessarily recommend this series to anyone who isn’t already a major Viking nerd, and I probably won’t ever go back for a reread. However, I can confidently say that this is a solid collection of books with a surprisingly wholesome ending that resonates with the story’s themes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its flaws, including frenetic pacing and weak characterization, it succeeds in portraying a harsh world where loss and resilience are central themes.

For example, a decision to go to a city would be followed almost immediately by news of its destruction. This pacing made it seem like the story was hurriedly moving toward the final battle.\n\n- **Revenge Plots:**  \n  The revenge arcs didn’t feel as satisfying or glorifying as I had hoped. I didn’t find myself cheering when characters achieved their vengeance, which was disappointing.\n\n- **Battle Scenes:**  \n  John Gwynne excels at writing battle scenes. His descriptions are visceral, gritty, and immersive, making it feel like you’re right there in the action.\n\n- **Engagement:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, the book was highly engaging. I often found myself glued to the pages for 50-75 pages at a time, as Gwynne has a talent for pulling readers into the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its flaws, particularly in dialogue authenticity, plot pacing, and the execution of revenge plots, it shines in its battle scenes and overall ability to captivate the reader. Despite my grievances, I was consistently drawn into the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The gods were portrayed as simplistic, \"King Kong-like\" beings without the mystery or depth I expected. Additionally, the \"tainted\" characters felt like a primitive or underdeveloped version of the X-Men, which was disappointing.  \n- **Potential:** Despite its flaws, the novel had the potential to be great, and I still found it to be a very nice read overall.  \n- **Author's Work:** I remain a fan of John Gwynne's writing and plan to continue reading his books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel is the weakest of the three I’ve read by John Gwynne, it was still an enjoyable read. However, issues with pacing, character development, and the handling of themes prevented it from reaching its full potential. Despite these shortcomings, I remain committed to exploring more of Gwynne’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The representation of diversity is poorly executed; secondary characters' identities and motivations come across as tokenistic. Although the attempt at diversity is commendable, it falls short. The sexual orientations of secondary female characters serve more as plot devices than meaningful aspects of their identities.

While this concept is not unique in speculative fiction, the story fails to offer something special or fresh. The exploration of themes like the legitimacy of resistance and the dichotomy between violent and non-violent methods of achieving freedom is notably absent, making the narrative feel derivative and shallow.\n\n- **Moral Complexity and Themes:**  \n  The series attempts to present a \"grey morality\" but falls short. The moral dilemmas are oversimplified, with clear-cut answers that lack depth. For instance, the dragon god Lik-Rifa and her followers are portrayed as unequivocally evil, with no nuanced understanding of their motivations. The resolution of the societal issue of slavery is handled in a rushed and superficial manner, undermining the complexity of the conflict. The reluctance to confront the issues set up in the story results in a black-and-white moral compass, which is disappointing for a grimdark fantasy.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, especially non-POV ones, are underdeveloped and lack depth. Most are driven by revenge, leading to repetitive and predictable arcs. While Biorr and Guthwar have some interesting journeys, their development feels formulaic. The diversity representation is poorly executed, with secondary characters' identities and motivations feeling tokenistic and underdeveloped.\n\n- **World-Building and God Content:**  \n  Despite the series being about the return of the gods, there is surprisingly little focus on the gods themselves. Characters like Rotta and the wolf god are underutilized and fail to live up to their potential. The world-building, while attempting to create a Viking-inspired setting, lacks depth and fails to fully immerse the reader.\n\n- **Pacing and Action Scenes:**  \n  The narrative is dominated by repetitive action scenes—skirmishes, battles, and duels—that take up most of the chapters. While these scenes may appeal to some readers, they lack stakes and become monotonous. The constant focus on physical violence detracts from the plot progression and character development.\n\n- **Diversity and Representation:**  \n  The attempt at diversity is commendable but poorly executed.

            "One of the main issues with this book is its handling of character arcs. While the author wisely avoids overwhelming the narrative with too many perspectives, some, like Guovarr’s, feel superfluous. In the second book, Guovarr’s viewpoint added depth by connecting with more compelling characters and plots. However, in this installment, he fails to contribute meaningfully to the climactic battle or the overall story. Elvar stands out as the only character with a clear arc, and while it is well-executed, it could have been more focused to enhance the impact of key moments. Ultimately, the characters seem to be forced into a predetermined plot rather than actively driving the action themselves.",

It’s commendable that he persevered and completed the book despite such challenges. However, this context doesn’t overshadow my critique of the novel itself.\n\n- **Series Comparison:**  \n  While *The Faithful and the Fallen* series was decent enough for me to finish, it wasn’t something I’d revisit. In contrast, the *Bloodsworn* series felt like Gwynne had leveled up as an author. Unfortunately, *Fury of the Gods* doesn’t maintain the exceptional quality of the first two books in this series and feels like a step down in comparison.\n\n- **Character Arcs and POVs:**  \n  One of the biggest issues with this book is the handling of character arcs. While Gwynne avoids overloading the story with too many POVs, some perspectives, like Guovarr’s, feel unnecessary. In the second book, Guovarr’s perspective added value by intertwining with more interesting characters and schemes. Here, he contributes nothing significant to the climactic battle or the overall plot. Elvar is the only character with a clear arc, and while it’s well-done, it could have been more focused to make the big moments land even better. Overall, the characters feel like they’re being forced into a pre-determined plot rather than driving the action themselves.\n\n- **Action and Repetition:**  \n  There are still some strong moments, particularly in the action sequences, which are unique and fun. However, the sheer volume of action becomes repetitive at times. Gwynne also overuses repetition in the narrative, often stating something and then having a character think the exact same thing. This made me feel like many words added nothing to the story.\n\n- **Overall Disappointment:**  \n  While I’m sympathetic to the challenges Gwynne faced, I’m still disappointed with this installment. It doesn’t live up to the high standards set by the first two books in the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the personal tragedy John Gwynne endured while writing *The Fury of the Gods*, the book falls short of the exceptional quality of its predecessors. Issues with character arcs, unnecessary POVs, repetitive action, and narrative redundancy detract from the overall experience. While there are still strong moments, the novel feels like a step down in the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nGrade: 6/10"

The excessive focus on blood and gory action overshadows other elements of the story, making it feel insufferable at times.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt underdeveloped, especially considering this is the culmination of their stories. I wanted more growth and depth to better connect with them and their journeys.  \n\n- **Moral Complexity:**  \n  The story is too black and white, with a clear good vs. bad dynamic. I expected more nuanced morality and ethical exploration, which is often a hallmark of epic fantasy.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Repetition:**  \n  The author has a habit of repeating certain phrases and overusing similes, which became frustrating and annoying. For example, the repeated use of \"thought cage\" was particularly grating.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing felt unbalanced, with sections of high tempo followed by long stretches of nothing, then sudden spikes in action again. This inconsistency made the story drag, especially in the middle section.  \n\n- **Pointless Chapters and Meandering:**  \n  Several chapters felt unnecessary and should have been cut during editing. They added little to the overall narrative and disrupted the flow.  \n\n- **POV Choices:**  \n  The inclusion of Gudvarr’s POV was a poor decision. His character is poorly written, and his constant inner monologues were tedious and hard to get through.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the series as a whole has some strong elements, such as its Nordic-inspired world-building and thrilling action, this final book fell short in many areas. The lack of character development, moral complexity, and balanced pacing, along with repetitive writing and unnecessary chapters, detracted from the overall experience.

Despite hoping the final book in the series would be the most enjoyable, it failed to meet my expectations. I had to push myself to finish it, and the payoff at the end was not worth the effort.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Many of the characters were un-relatable and generally unlikable. Their actions and personalities did not resonate with me, which made it difficult to connect with the story.\n\n- **Magic/Power System:**  \n  The magic and power system in the series felt inconsistent and \"all out of whack.\" It lacked coherence and failed to create a believable or engaging framework for the story.\n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  The ancient gods were built up as ominous and all-powerful, but they were easily defeated and killed, which undermined their significance. Additionally, the gods were described as smart and cunning, but their actions did not reflect these traits, making them feel inconsistent and poorly developed.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would not recommend this series to anyone. If you enjoyed the first two books, you might like this one, but overall, the series was not for me. For a more detailed, spoiler-filled explanation of my issues with the book, I’d be happy to discuss it in person.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis final book in the series did not live up to my expectations. It lacked engaging characters, a coherent magic system, and consistent world-building, making it a disappointing read. The effort to finish the book was not rewarded with a satisfying conclusion.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
