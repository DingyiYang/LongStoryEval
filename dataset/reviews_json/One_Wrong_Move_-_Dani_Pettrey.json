However, readers who enjoy a significant romantic subplot in their suspense novels will likely find it satisfying.  \n\n- **Character Complexity:**  \n  - The story felt a bit hectic due to the large number of characters to keep track of, including 3 siblings, their 3 sidekicks, and the villains.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  - Overall, the book is a good start to a new series, showing promise for future installments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDani Petry’s *One Wrong Move* delivers a strong suspense plot with a compelling heist element and a well-integrated faith theme. While the romance subplot was heavier than I preferred, it may appeal to readers who enjoy a mix of romance and suspense. The large cast of characters made the story feel somewhat hectic, but the novel sets a solid foundation for a new series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars  \n\n*Thanks go to NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read an advance copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

I particularly liked Christian, Andi, Deckard, Harper, Riley, and Greyson. Greyson stands out as a clever addition to this genre.  \n\n- **Faith Emphasis:**  \n   - The strong faith emphasis is a highlight. I appreciate the inclusion of prayers, both spoken aloud and internalized. This aspect is pivotal to Christian fiction and reflects how Christians live their faith.  \n   - The Christian characters authentically lived out their faith in many ways.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - The romance is strong and enjoyable to read, though it might be a bit excessive at times. The chemistry between Christian and Andi is tremendous, and Pettrey effectively conveys their connection.  \n\n- **Suspense:**  \n   - The suspense keeps readers engaged, with the dynamic couples constantly on edge and rarely feeling safe throughout the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Authenticity:**  \n   - The dual plot lines of investigation were challenging for me. Some elements felt unrealistic, which detracted from the story's authenticity.  \n     - The antagonists were too infrequently present, making their appearances distracting and hard to follow. It was unclear who was truly in charge, with Cyrus, Casey, and Theresa each having separate agendas.  \n     - It was confusing why a private investigator (Christian) was leading a national search for dangerous criminals like killers, arsonists, and art thieves. This role seemed more suited to the FBI or police, with a PI assisting rather than leading. The final scene, where the PI team enters a highly dangerous situation, felt implausible.  \n     - Ethan's role in seeking vengeance against Christian was unclear for most of the story. His use of a pseudonym was revealed late, and Cyrus appeared to be driving the antagonists' agenda, which didn’t fully connect for me.  \n     - The tension in many high-stakes situations was undermined by Christian and Andi’s constant distraction due to their attraction to each other. This felt unrealistic and detracted from the suspense.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Series Potential:**  \n   - Despite the issues, I enjoyed the story and found it fun to read. I particularly liked the three siblings: Christian, Deck, and Riley.  \n   - I’m interested in reading more from Pettrey, especially if the next books in the series feature Riley and Greyson as leads. They are a fascinating and less predictable duo compared to the other couples.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has its strengths, such as strong character development, faith emphasis, and engaging romance and suspense, some plot elements felt unrealistic and detracted from the story’s authenticity. Nonetheless, I found it enjoyable and look forward to reading more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I enjoy reading about characters who overcome a painful past.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The book delivers a romance between Christian and Andy, and two additional romances spark in this first book, hinting at more to come in the series. While there was more focus on the hero and heroine's physical bodies than I'm used to, it was overall tasteful.  \n\n- **Suspense and Thrill:**  \n  The book begins with two relatively creepy scenes from the bad guys' perspectives, setting the tone for what Christian and Andy face throughout the story. The suspense scenes are action-packed and engaging. However, the story leans more toward romance than suspense, making it a romantic suspense rather than a psycho-thriller.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The ranch serves as a beautiful setting for the story, and I hope to revisit this locale in future books.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Complexity:**  \n  The book features multiple point-of-view characters and subplots, with many names sounding similar. At times, I found it challenging to keep everyone straight.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *One Wrong Move* is a compelling romantic suspense novel with strong character dynamics, engaging romances, and thrilling action scenes. Despite some complexity in keeping track of characters, I highly recommend it to fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Storyline and Premise:**\n   - The premise of the storyline is interesting, involving a break-in and theft at an art gallery, which escalates into a more complicated case with additional break-ins.\n   - The story had a lot going on, with multiple subplots and a high level of complexity.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - Many characters were likeable, including Christian, Andi, Deckard, and Riley.\n   - The main characters had significant personal baggage, which added depth but also complexity to the story.\n   - Andi, in particular, had a troubled past, leaving her FBI job under a cloud of suspicion, and only her friend Harper believed in her innocence.\n   - Christian, Deckard, and Riley also had a rough past, with their memories and struggles resurfacing throughout the story.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Complexity:**\n   - The book had too many characters and subplots, which made it challenging to keep track of everything.\n   - The volume of issues and details took away from the main storyline, making it feel overwhelming at times.\n\n- **Tone and Content:**\n   - The book included two brutal murders told from the perspective of the bad guys, which felt over the top and unnecessarily violent, especially for a book from a Christian writer and publisher.\n   - The level of violence and the graphic nature of the murders were surprising and almost made me put the book down.\n\n- **Faith Elements:**\n   - The Christian faith was somewhat included but was not deeply developed, which felt like a missed opportunity given the author’s background.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**\n   - The physical attraction between some characters could have been toned down, as it felt somewhat out of place in the context of the story.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Some decisions and risks taken by characters felt illogical and hard to believe.\n   - The ending, in particular, did not seem plausible, especially with law enforcement’s involvement in resolving the case.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *One Wrong Move* by Dani Pettrey had an interesting premise and likeable characters, it was overwhelmed by the sheer number of characters, subplots, and personal baggage. The graphic violence and illogical decisions detracted from the story, and the Christian faith elements were underdeveloped. Despite these issues, there were elements I enjoyed, such as the engaging storyline and the depth of the characters. However, the complexity and volume of details made it difficult to fully appreciate the book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The plot and pacing were brisk, effectively propelling the story forward. The short chapters helped maintain momentum, particularly since I wasn’t fully engaged. While the art heists were intriguing, they failed to deepen my investment in the narrative. Cyrus's threats to kill Casey felt hollow, as they never came to fruition, and it was Enrique who ultimately committed the murders, which felt inconsistent. Additionally, Casey's role as Christian's rival lacked significance, leaving his character underdeveloped and lacking impact.",
            "The characters were adequate, but none left a lasting impression. I found it difficult to keep track of some, especially Cyrus and Casey, due to their similar names. Additionally, the random name change for Casey (from Ethan) seemed unnecessary and only added to the confusion.",
            "The book's blurb piqued my interest, but unfortunately, the execution didn't live up to my expectations, despite the author's evident talent. I found myself speed-reading to avoid a DNF, but ultimately, the story didn't resonate with me as I had hoped. I wanted to enjoy it more, but I suspect I'll forget most of it in a couple of weeks."

As the book focuses on art heists— a subject I'm not particularly drawn to—this may have contributed to my disengagement.",

            "The novel follows Christian O'Brady, a security specialist and private investigator, and Andi Forester, a former FBI forensic analyst turned insurance investigator, as they join forces to tackle a series of art heists. The narrative features relentless villains, including a figure from Christian's past seeking revenge. Additionally, a secondary investigation led by Christian's brother and Andi's best friend delves into the circumstances surrounding Andi's wrongful framing for mishandling murder evidence, which derailed her FBI career. While the plot is intricate and engaging, it can occasionally feel overwhelming due to its multiple threads. Although suspenseful moments are present, some slower sections disrupt the overall flow, suggesting that a better balance between action and quieter moments could enhance reader engagement.",
            "I appreciated the characters in general, but Christian's overly protective nature towards Andi sometimes undermined their dynamic. Their faith was depicted thoughtfully, adding depth to their personalities and actions. However, the romance between Christian and Andi felt rushed, lacking the emotional connection I usually seek in a relationship. This romantic element felt secondary to the main plot, which may have contributed to its lack of depth."
