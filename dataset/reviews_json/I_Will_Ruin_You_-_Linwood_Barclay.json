For example, the protagonist, a mild-mannered high school teacher, faces a series of extreme challenges, including defusing a school suicide-bomb threat, dealing with blackmail, being hunted by drug dealers, solving a potential teacher-student abuse case, being suspected of murder, and acting as a go-between in a drugs-for-cash exchange. Despite the improbability, Barclay makes it work within the context of his storytelling.  \n\n- **Themes and Subplots:**  \n   - The novel includes a subplot about book banning, which arises from the protagonist Richard Boyle‚Äôs use of Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs *The Road* (2006) in his English class. This subplot adds depth to the story and reflects real-world issues.  \n   - Barclay‚Äôs personal experiences with book banning, including his childhood and his connection to Margaret Laurence‚Äôs *The Diviners* (1974), inform this aspect of the novel.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The protagonist, Richard Boyle, is an ordinary person thrust into extraordinary circumstances, a hallmark of Barclay‚Äôs writing style. This approach makes the character relatable and the stakes feel higher.  \n\n- **Author Background and Style:**  \n   - Linwood Barclay, though born in the U.S., is considered a Canadian author, having lived in Canada since 1959.  \n   - He began his career as a humor columnist for the *Toronto Star* before transitioning to full-time novel writing after the success of *No Time for Goodbye* (2007).  \n   - His writing style is often compared to Harlan Coben‚Äôs, featuring ordinary protagonists navigating dangerous and mysterious situations.  \n\n- **Additional Context and Resources:**  \n   - Barclay wrote a short column about his experiences with book banning, which can be found in *The Book Reporter* (May 10, 2024).  \n   - Barbara Peters of the Poisoned Pen Bookstore interviewed Barclay about *I Will Ruin You*, and the interview is available on the bookstore‚Äôs YouTube channel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*I Will Ruin You* is another gripping suspense novel by Linwood Barclay, featuring an elaborate and sometimes improbable plot, a relatable protagonist, and a thought-provoking subplot about book banning.

The plot intertwines the blackmailer with a death and involves a group of ruthless drug dealers being investigated by Richard's sister-in-law, an undercover detective. While the pacing starts slow, it ultimately accelerates toward a gripping resolution.",

I plan to try his older novels in the future, hoping that this particular book was an outlier and not representative of his overall work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this novel, it ultimately fell short in terms of engagement, pacing, and a satisfying conclusion. However, I remain open to exploring the author‚Äôs earlier works, as I believe there may still be potential for a better reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Just like Richard, you'll find yourself swept up in the unfolding momentum, and I doubt you'll unravel the mystery before he reveals his hand. While the story offers some thoughtful moments, it primarily focuses on plot and action. As a devoted fan of this author, I appreciate how he consistently delivers on strong characters, fast-paced action, and intricate plots, all while ensuring each novel remains original and captivating. The term \"headlong\" comes to mind when reflecting on his work; once the action begins, it never relents. Characters rarely have the luxury of pausing to consider their next steps, and it‚Äôs easy to see why‚Äîthey‚Äôre constantly propelled forward by unfolding events.",
            "The characters in this story are well-developed, particularly Richard, whose empathy shines through. Despite the heavy use of first-person narrative, the author skillfully presents a balanced view of Richard's strengths and flaws, making him relatable and easy to root for. While some supporting characters are less fully realized, they still contribute to the sense of a vibrant, authentic cast. Ultimately, this story feels populated by real people, even if it doesn't delve deeply into every character's psyche.",
            "The author excels at crafting a compelling thriller, and this one is no exception. It's fast-paced and gripping, ensuring that readers will power through it in no time.",
            "While the author has penned several novels, this work stands independently. It features a familiar setting‚Äîa mid-sized town‚Äîand includes minor characters that appear across his other works. One such character takes a more prominent role here, but prior knowledge of the author's other novels is not necessary to enjoy this story. The recurring characters enhance the sense of a vibrant, realistic backdrop. Even for first-time readers, the background is well-developed and effectively supports the narrative."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The author delivers another compelling thriller with strong characters, a twisty plot, and relentless pacing. The novel is both thoughtful and action-packed, with a well-drawn setting and a protagonist who is deeply human and relatable. Whether you‚Äôre a longtime fan or new to this author‚Äôs work, this book is a highly enjoyable read.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author's Style and Consistency:**\n   - I‚Äôm a huge fan of Linwood Barclay. One of the things I love is the way he gives you exactly what you expect (strong characters, fast action, a twisty plot) and yet every single novel is original and interesting.\n   - ‚ÄúHeadlong‚Äù is a word I often associate with Barclay‚Äôs novels. Once the action starts, it never lets up. Characters often find it hard to stop and think it through, and you completely understand why. There‚Äôs always something happening, pushing them to react quickly.\n   - Barclay knows how to write a good solid thriller, and this is not an exception. It‚Äôs fast-paced and absorbing, and you‚Äôll read it surprisingly quickly as a result.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot is suitably twisty, with misleading events and behaviors aplenty. It‚Äôs all very convincing; it doesn‚Äôt feel at all contrived. Just as Richard gets caught up in the momentum of events, so will you. And I bet you won‚Äôt sort it all out before Barclay is ready to show his hand.\n   - This is a novel that is somewhat thoughtful, but largely focused on the plot and action.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Characters are strong. We spend most time with Richard, and he‚Äôs a very empathetic character. Despite the substantial amount of first-person narrative, Barclay gives us a rounded picture of Richard‚Äôs strengths and character flaws. I found him very human and was definitely on his side, hoping for a good resolution.\n   - Other characters are also strong, although not all are as fully rounded. That‚Äôs okay; this isn‚Äôt a character study, and you still feel as though it‚Äôs a cast of real people.\n\n- **Setting and Background:**\n   - Although Barclay has written some novels which effectively form series, this is an independent novel. It shares a vague background with some of his other novels: a mid-size town, and minor characters who make appearances in multiple novels. Here a minor character from other novels is brought closer to the foreground; it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to have read any of those to enjoy this one.\n   - I find the use of recurring characters contributes to the sense of a vivid background, realistic and solid. However, even if this is the first Barclay novel you‚Äôve read, the background is strongly enough drawn for the needs of this novel.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it with no reservations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLinwood Barclay delivers another compelling thriller with strong characters, a twisty plot, and relentless pacing. The novel is both thoughtful and action-packed, with a well-drawn setting and a protagonist who is deeply human and relatable. Whether you‚Äôre a longtime fan or new to Barclay‚Äôs work, this book is a highly enjoyable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The book begins with a gripping scene featuring an English teacher conducting a lesson on *The Road* by Cormac McCarthy when he spots a suspicious young man on the school grounds. The teacher's quick thinking and protective instincts during the ensuing attack are both compelling and illuminating, offering a glimpse into how such crises are managed in the U.S. The plot unfolds at a brisk pace, yet it never feels rushed, thanks to short, tense chapters that effectively sustain a thrilling atmosphere.",
            "The characters are believable and relatable, reacting to the crisis in genuinely authentic ways. They face tough decisions without resorting to the exaggerated responses often found in thrillers. Their moments of panic and vulnerability enhance the depth of their portrayals.",
            "While I'm not particularly fond of car chases and gun scenes, I acknowledge their relevance to the American setting of the story. For instance, the phrase \"taking a couple of shots\" cleverly refers to photographs rather than gunfire, highlighting an important cultural nuance. The chilling premise of a vulnerable ex-student planning to blow up his old school is both unsettling and thought-provoking. As a former teacher, I've contemplated such scenarios, even though they are rare in England. The story's U.S. backdrop, complete with established protocols for these situations, adds a layer of realism and tension."

While some action elements may not appeal to everyone, they are integral to the story‚Äôs setting and tone. Overall, it‚Äôs a highly recommended read that balances tension with emotional depth.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The high school is described as a living, breathing organism, filled with unpredictability, tragedy, heartbreak, success, and inspiration. It feels like a small city teeming with stories.  \n\n- **Character and Plot Development (Main Storyline):**  \n   - The protagonist, English teacher Richard Boyle, is thrust into a high-stakes situation when he confronts a former student, Mark LeDrew, who has a bomb strapped to his chest. Richard‚Äôs quick thinking averts a crisis, and he becomes a hero. However, the media attention he receives is not entirely positive, adding complexity to his character and the plot.  \n\n- **Secondary Storyline and Pacing:**  \n   - The second storyline detracts from the overall experience. The use of miscommunication as a trope feels disjointed and disconnected from the original premise, causing a loss of interest. The book would have been stronger if it had stayed focused on the initial plot.  \n\n- **Author‚Äôs Style and Personal Preference:**  \n   - The reviewer loves the author and enjoys thrillers set in high schools or featuring teachers as main characters. While this book didn‚Äôt fully meet expectations, the author remains a favorite, and the reviewer plans to continue reading their work.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Publication Details:**  \n   - The reviewer thanks NetGalley and William Morrow Publishing for providing an early copy of the book, which is set to publish on May 7, 2024.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a compelling main storyline with a strong protagonist and an engaging high-stakes scenario, the secondary storyline fell flat due to its reliance on miscommunication and lack of cohesion with the original plot. Despite this, the reviewer remains a fan of the author and looks forward to future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- The reviewer implies a rating of less than five stars, suggesting it could have been a five-star read if the secondary storyline had been more focused and aligned with the main plot."

The story involves a mix of troubled current and former students, misguided parents, unlikable teachers, ruthless drug dealers, and a detective (Richard's sister-in-law) who is investigating the chaos.  \n\n- **Character Development and Decisions:**  \n  The main character, Richard Boyle, is a high school teacher being blackmailed by a former student for something he didn‚Äôt do. However, I found it hard to get behind some of the decisions he made throughout the story, which affected my overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  While the book was solid, I don‚Äôt consider it one of Barclay‚Äôs best. It had its moments, but it didn‚Äôt fully meet my expectations based on his previous works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by Linwood Barclay had an engaging premise and a strong start, but some of the main character‚Äôs decisions and the overall execution didn‚Äôt quite live up to the author‚Äôs usual standard. It‚Äôs a decent read but not his strongest work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3+ stars."

The ending, however, fell short of the usual Barclay standard.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

When I first saw this, I thought, \"Ugh,\" and almost dismissed it entirely.  \n\n- **Engagement and Plot Development:**  \n  However, the story evolved in a way that changed my perspective. It became fun, twisty, and kept me guessing throughout. Every time I thought I had figured it out, the plot would shift, which kept me engaged and intrigued.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the story wasn't groundbreaking or earth-shattering, it was enjoyable for what it was‚Äîa light, entertaining read with enough twists to hold my interest.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial reservations about the communication trope, the novel surprised me with its engaging and unpredictable plot. It turned out to be a fun and entertaining read, even if it didn't redefine the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

This made the character's arc feel stagnant and less engaging.\n\n- **Author's Style and Consistency:**  \n  I generally like the author and have enjoyed his previous works, but this novel didn‚Äôt live up to my expectations. It felt less compelling compared to his earlier books.\n\n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n  The story lacked surprise for me, as I saw the final twist coming much earlier than the protagonist, Richard, did. This predictability made the plot feel less thrilling and somewhat boring.\n\n- **Genre Saturation:**  \n  It‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôve read too many books in this genre, which might have contributed to my lack of excitement and the predictability of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the author‚Äôs previous works, this novel fell short for me. The repetitive character scenarios, predictable plot, and lack of freshness in the genre made it a less enjoyable read compared to his earlier books.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I typically find this author‚Äôs twists surprising, but in this case, I anticipated nearly all of them, save for a minor one. The only twist that caught me off guard was the revelation that Billy's friend was blackmailing the main character, though it felt relatively insignificant. I saw Trent's revelation coming from a mile away. Overall, the plot lacked the suspense that usually characterizes this author's work, leaving me disappointed."
