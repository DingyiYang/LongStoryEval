            "The author presents intriguing ideas and a fun setup, but the execution falls short. While I recognize considerable promise in their work, the narrative didn't fully resonate with me. The book features one of my favorite tropes: a protagonist returning to their hometown to confront an unresolved issue or trauma, which initially captured my interest. However, this trope alone wasn’t enough to sustain the story for me, although it may appeal to others.",
            "The first 15% of the book was captivating, with a tone and direction that I loved, leading me to believe it would be a solid 4-star read. However, as the story unfolded, it lost momentum and my attention. The narrative became muddled, causing my interest to fluctuate.",
            "The synopsis, cover art, and title of *What Grows in the Dark* immediately caught my attention. Despite its low average rating of around 3.01 stars, I decided to read it, as I often find myself in the minority opinion on books. The story is a genuine Supernatural Thriller/Mystery, yet it reads more like a YA novel, even though it's categorized as Adult. While I personally enjoy YA Horror/Thriller novels, the YA-like tone may affect its overall rating for other readers. This book could serve as a great transitional piece for those moving from YA to Adult fiction, though it feels more like New Adult than strictly Adult."

It follows Brigit and Ian, a YouTube duo investigating supernatural events that bring them to Brigit's hometown, where they unravel disturbing truths connected to her sister's death.

Both characters are well-developed and nuanced, adding significant depth to the story.",

            "The story centers on Brigit Weylan, a fraudulent spiritualist, and her cameraman Ian as they explore paranormal phenomena while fabricating results for their YouTube show. Brigit's personal stake in the narrative—her sister Emma's mysterious disappearance in the woods of Ellis Creek—infuses the plot with emotional depth. Their return to Ellis Creek to investigate the eerie disappearance of two teenagers, reminiscent of Emma's case, adds a compelling layer of mystery.",
            "The novel delves into the themes of lies and secrets, both deliberate and subconscious, that influence the characters' relationships and dynamics. The author offers intimate insights into the thoughts and internal monologues of Brigit and Ian, fostering a deep connection between the readers and the characters. Although this depth enhances the narrative, it sometimes affects the pacing of the story.",
            "The Dell, the woods surrounding Ellis Creek, is a striking element of the story. Its beauty is intertwined with an unsettling atmosphere, characterized by quiet darkness and a profound sense of isolation. The author skillfully conveys the tension and eeriness of the woods, making the setting feel like a living, breathing character. The Dell's role in the narrative seamlessly blends folk horror and environmental horror, adding a distinctive layer to the overall story.",
            "I relish the excitement of discovering novels by debut authors, especially when I approach them with little prior knowledge. The synopsis of *What Grows in the Dark* immediately hooked me, and the glowing endorsements from Sequoia Nagamatsu and Keith Rosson made it a must-read. The author delivers inventive and eerie scares that rank among my favorites in recent horror literature. The story's atmospheric and chilling qualities set it apart, with moments that truly send shivers down your spine. Interludes featuring newspaper articles, interviews, and transcripts provide glimpses into the Dell's history and mysteries. However, I found myself wishing for more depth in the exploration of the Dell's past, as it at times felt somewhat vague."

        "conclusion": "*What Grows in the Dark* is a strong debut novel by the author, blending folk horror, environmental horror, and a deeply personal mystery. While I wished for more detailed world-building and history, the atmospheric setting, compelling characters, and inventive scares make it a memorable read. I’ll definitely be checking out more of this author’s work in the future!",

The pace picked up slightly during the 'seance' scene and towards the end, but by then, I was mostly reading to finish the book rather than out of genuine interest.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The only characters I paid attention to were Brigit and Ian, and even then, my interest in them was minimal.

The repetitive descriptions, such as the constant emphasis on the \"peaty\" smell and \"tasting dirt,\" became tiresome. The lack of straightforwardness made the story harder to engage with.\n\n- **Use of Sexuality:**\n   - The inclusion of sexuality felt inconsistent and underdeveloped. While the relationship between the sister and the police officer felt natural, the non-binary main character’s sexuality was mentioned at odd times without serving a clear purpose in the story. It often felt out of place and unresolved.\n\n- **Overall Execution:**\n   - The disparity between the intriguing synopsis and the actual book was disappointing. The book failed to deliver on its potential, and the lack of connection with the characters, pacing issues, and writing style made it a challenging read.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book had an interesting premise, its execution fell short in several areas, including pacing, character development, and writing style.

            "The story centers on a pact known to Brigit from the start. Much of the narrative serves as filler, with only one truly startling moment that feels unwarranted due to the characters’ lack of depth. The plot, sparked by the disappearance of two children, pulls Brigit back to her hometown and explores the interconnected lives of those linked to the kids. While the premise had promise, the execution leaves much to be desired. The book wraps up with the unveiling of some poignant secrets, but if the author had focused on these elements and structured the narrative around them, the story could have been genuinely chilling and far more engaging. The ending hints at the book’s potential, yet ultimately it feels like a missed opportunity.",

Some reviews liken it to Lovecraftian (Eldritch) horror, but I believe this comparison is inaccurate. Although the story features preternatural elements and a primordial forest setting, it lacks the depth and impact characteristic of Lovecraft's work.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Skill and Education:**  \n  I believe the author should consider the negative reviews seriously and perhaps pursue a formal education in creative writing, such as an MFA. This could help refine their craft and address some of the issues highlighted in the reviews.\n\n- **Genre and Misclassification:**  \n  The book is labeled as contemporary horror, but I find this classification misleading. It doesn’t align with what I consider true horror. Additionally, some reviews compare it to Lovecraftian (Eldritch) horror, which is inaccurate. While the story has preternatural elements and a primordial forest setting, it lacks the depth and influence of Lovecraft’s work. Moreover, given Lovecraft’s problematic views, I doubt the author intended to draw inspiration from him.\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The book features diverse characters, including a non-binary protagonist, a lesbian character (Emma), and several other LGBTQ+ individuals. This representation is a positive aspect, especially in contrast to Lovecraft’s bigotry. However, I feel younger readers might not fully grasp the historical context of these themes, as their understanding often comes from platforms like TikTok rather than deeper research.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story revolves around a pact that Brigit has known about from the beginning. Much of the narrative feels like filler, with only one moment truly standing out as startling—though even that felt unwarranted given the character’s lack of depth. The plot is driven by the disappearance of two children, which brings Brigit back to her hometown and branches into the lives of those connected to the kids. While the concept had potential, the execution fell flat.\n\n- **Ending and Missed Opportunities:**  \n  The book concludes with the revelation of some sad secrets. Had the author focused more on these elements and built the story around them, it could have been genuinely scary and far more compelling. The ending hints at what the book could have been, but it ultimately feels like a missed opportunity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has some interesting elements, such as its diverse representation and a potentially intriguing premise, it suffers from poor execution, misclassification, and a lack of depth. The story feels padded with filler, and the ending, though promising, doesn’t deliver on its potential. With more focus and refinement, the concept could have been much stronger.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

All characters were supposedly adults but came across as very young adult (YA), which made it difficult to identify with them.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The main character’s gender identity felt like an afterthought and was never fully explored or integrated into her identity.
