However, the series as a whole is wonderful and absolutely worth reading in its entirety.\n\n- **Storytelling and Uniqueness:**  \n  Gabrielle Meyer’s storytelling abilities are fantastic, and each book in the series feels completely unique and exciting. This story, in particular, stands out because it deals with time-crossers who must ultimately choose one time, yet it offers a fresh and captivating narrative.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The protagonist, Caroline, lives in 1727 and 1927, and her story is unique because she doesn’t have someone to guide her through being a time-crosser. At the start, she believes she is the only one of her kind, but a letter from her mother in 1727 leads her to pose as a cabin boy on a pirate ship to seek answers. The combination of pirates and prohibition in her dual lives is incredibly engaging.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance in this story is well-crafted and enjoyable, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  My favorite aspect of the book is its message of God’s grace and redemption, which is beautifully carried out across both timelines. Caroline’s parents in 1927 serve as a wonderful example of practicing what they preach, making the themes even more impactful.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  While I have enjoyed every book in the series, this one has become a new favorite for me. It’s a story that absolutely cannot be missed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Across the Ages* is a captivating addition to the Timeless series, offering a unique and exciting story with a powerful message of grace and redemption.

            "I genuinely enjoyed both storylines, but I found myself rooting for one particular romance from the start. It was truly swoonworthy, especially with the characters bonding over books and discussing literature and faith. It was also a delight to reconnect with familiar characters from previous installments.",
            "I would rate this book PG due to its mature themes. The story includes elements such as rumors of adultery and witchcraft, characters smoking cigarettes and cigars, and drinking alcohol. It explores complex situations, including a man having an affair and fathering an illegitimate child, a girl facing an unplanned pregnancy, and implications of sexual violence. Other themes include bootlegging, a woman's feelings of inadequacy in her marriage, and a man visiting a brothel. The narrative also touches on cohabitation before marriage, miscarriage, and a woman being a mistress, along with references to speakeasies and a man's troubled past with drinking and gambling. Notably, there is a poignant moment of faith that brought tears to my eyes. **Trigger Warning: miscarriage.**",

The characters and their relationships are beautifully developed, and the story is both engaging and emotionally resonant. I highly recommend it, especially for fans of the genre.",

It is the bee’s knees and a swashbuckling adventure!  \n  - There’s some amazing faith content, and one part even brought tears to my eyes.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - I honestly love both storylines, although there is one romance that I was rooting for from the beginning, and it was so swoonworthy (the characters even read books together and discuss literature and faith)!  \n  - It was great to meet characters from previous books.  \n\n- **Standalone vs. Series Reading:**  \n  - It can be read as a standalone, although I highly recommend reading them in order, as future books will be spoiled.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  - I give this book a PG rating. Examples of the content: rumors of adultery and witchcraft; a character smokes cigarettes; characters smoke cigars and drink; a man has an affair and an illegitimate child; a girl is pregnant out of wedlock; implication that a woman would be r*pe; someone bootlegs illegal alcohol; a woman feels if she was a better wife and slept with her husband more, he wouldn’t cheat; a man is at a brothel; a couple lives together before marriage; miscarriage; a woman is someone’s mistress; characters go to a speakeasy; a man drank and gambled in his past; reference to the wedding night, closed door.  \n  - TW: miscarriage.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Anticipation:**  \n  - Of course, every book in this series is amazing!  \n  - I can’t wait until the next book!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“Across the Ages” is a captivating addition to the series, combining swashbuckling adventure, heartfelt romance, and meaningful faith content.

The author’s commitment to historical accuracy and detail is a remarkable aspect of her writing.",
            "The faith element is skillfully integrated into both timelines, with themes of forgiveness, second chances, and redemption resonating throughout. The narrative delves into family expectations, personal identity, and moral dilemmas, adding significant emotional depth."

The author delivers another captivating story with well-developed characters, intricate plot twists, and rich historical detail. This book is a must-read for fans and newcomers alike, though I highly recommend reading the previous books to fully appreciate the depth of the story.",
