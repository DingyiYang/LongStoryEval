            "The story follows Justine Poole, a bodyguard who eliminates three would-be thieves during a robbery. In retaliation, the gang leader hires an assassin named Sealy to kill her. What ensues is a gripping cat-and-mouse chase. I appreciated the author's fast pacing and the absence of a romantic subplot, allowing Justine to navigate her challenges independently—a refreshing choice. However, the plot does feel repetitive, essentially unfolding as one extended chase scene.",

The tone of the book was set in her favor. The story followed a straightforward \"bad guys versus good guys\" narrative, which made it predictable.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Justine Poole played her many roles well, especially after her boss was killed, and she had to struggle on her own. There was a hint of romance between Justine and her boss, but it didn’t add much depth to the story. The evil guy hiring bad guys to go after her felt like a typical antagonist setup.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The book had a tone that reminded me of cozy tea mysteries. It was a quick read, but the writing didn’t leave a strong impression. Thomas Perry has written many books and won awards, but this one felt like he might be tired or uninspired.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I read the entire book but wasn’t very impressed. While it was an okay read, it didn’t stand out. If you have nothing else to read, it’s passable, but it didn’t leave a lasting impact.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book by Thomas Perry was a so-so experience for me.

            "This novel is quintessential Thomas Perry, making it a solid choice for fans of his work. The author excels at crafting thrilling narratives, and this book is no exception. Previously, I’ve noted his tendency to create invincible, almost god-like villains and heroes, with crime rings that possess MI6-level intelligence—which can skew towards the unrealistic. However, in this installment, Perry has made strides in grounding the characters and their actions, significantly enhancing the story’s overall realism.",

            "The title \"Hero\" is generic and uninspired, lacking the depth to engage readers. While the majority of the novel is a well-crafted, fast-paced thriller featuring a gripping cat-and-mouse game between two skilled adversaries, the ending feels rushed and abrupt, as if the author was racing against a deadline. The climax and resolution don’t fully develop, leaving readers emotionally unfulfilled. The pacing and suspense are expertly maintained for nearly all of the 277 pages, but the final moments fall short, detracting from an otherwise compelling narrative.",
            "Justine Poole, the protagonist, is a compelling character who stands out as a resourceful bodyguard, having risen from a clerical position rather than a background in law enforcement or the military. In contrast, Leo Sealey, the antagonist, is a cold-blooded and relentless professional assassin. His chapters evoke the meticulous style of Frederick Forsyth’s *Day of the Jackal*. The alternating perspectives of Justine and Leo offer valuable insight into their thought processes, enhancing the story's engagement.",
            "The author's prose is lean and efficient, providing just enough backstory to engage readers in Justine's survival. The book has a cinematic quality, featuring well-crafted action sequences and clear, straightforward storytelling. The plot remains largely uncomplicated, steering clear of unnecessary twists or double-crosses, which allows the central conflict to take center stage.",
            "Despite its rushed ending, the novel is highly entertaining, maintaining a gripping pace filled with relentless action and suspense. The story reads like a screenplay, perfect for a movie adaptation, with actresses like Jennifer Lawrence or Emily Blunt ideal for the role of Justine. While some action sequences may seem implausible in hindsight, they are incredibly engaging in the moment."

It was in the downtown area near Clifton's Cafeteria and some former banks and other buildings that used to be fancy and glamorous, but during his time in LA were always being ferociously remodeled, replaced, or converted, five or six at a time.\"  \n\n- **Character Background and Plot Intrigue:**  \n   - There's a section that makes me wonder if this is a reference to another book or just a bit of character background:  \n     - Leo Sealy's phone rang. He'd left it charging on the kitchen counter, so he had to trot across the apartment to get it. He was hoping it was going to be a friend, maybe Bobby Danziger. Before this job had been offered to him, he and Bobby told each other they should meet for a drink soon. They were both in the same line of work and had known each other for a few years, since the time when they had both been hired by an old guy in Palm Springs to kill the same list of eleven people.  \n     - Neither of them had known before they'd driven out there to meet him exactly what the job was or that anybody else was on it. The first they knew about it was when he arrived and the old guy let him into this sprawling one-story house. Sealy and the man crossed a vast living room with a view of Mount San Jacinto but kept walking and talking. \"There's somebody else I need you to meet.\"  \n     - When he had given them both copies of the list of names and addresses, they both realized that this was a very big job. The targets were all over the country, were of both sexes and a range of ages. Leo and Bobby had let their resentment of the old man go after they realized that he wasn't expecting to get a bargain. He was willing to pay very well for each killing.  \n     - Leo and Bobby worked out a system, dividing the country, so each took five names in a geographic area, and began scouting the targets. On the seventh of the next month at midnight, each would start the slaughter, trying to get through the five names as quickly as possible so the later ones would be less likely to hear of the earlier ones. Whoever got his five first could take, and be paid for, the eleventh. Leo got that one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel effectively captures the essence of a gripping thriller, with well-crafted references to local landmarks and intriguing character backstories that add depth to the narrative. The comparison to Donald Westlake's style highlights the book's appeal to fans of similar works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Expertise and Evolution:**  \n   - I have been a great fan of Thomas Perry since the Jane Whitefield series (\"Vanishing Act\" - 1994).  \n   - Perry is proficient at the fun subgenre of mysteries wherein the protagonist must run and hide from danger.  \n   - As technology advanced, Perry had to adapt his storytelling to reflect modern challenges like phone/computer technology and street cameras, moving beyond Jane Whitefield's old-school methods like creating fake passports.  \n   - Perry has become an expert in the area of \"disappearing,\" as seen in works like \"The Old Man,\" which was adapted into a Hulu series.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - In \"Hero,\" Perry again features a woman trying to hide, this time from bad guys seeking revenge for her killing a couple of their men.  \n   - Justine Poole, a highly skilled bodyguard, becomes a hero in LA papers after killing intruders during a home invasion.  \n   - She must go into hiding without leaving LA, as the police require her to stay for their investigation, which is challenging given modern surveillance technology.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I liked the expertise and resourcefulness of Justine, particularly how she outfoxed the assassin sent after her.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - \"Hero\" is another exciting story by Perry, showcasing his mastery of the \"disappearing\" theme.  \n   - The novel is a winner, maintaining Perry's reputation for thrilling and well-crafted narratives.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Hero\" is a gripping and expertly crafted novel by Thomas Perry, showcasing his ability to adapt to modern storytelling challenges while maintaining the excitement and resourcefulness of his characters. Justine Poole's journey is both thrilling and satisfying, making this another standout addition to Perry's body of work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this gripping narrative, criminal mastermind Mr. Conger hires hitman Leo Sealy to eliminate Justine Poole, a skilled private security agent trained by Ben Spengler at the Spengler-Nash agency. What unfolds is a high-stakes cat-and-mouse game, with tension mounting as Sealy closes in on Justine. I found myself on edge, rooting for Justine, unsure of how events would unfold. The story effectively builds suspense; however, the denouement feels rushed and leaves much to be desired. The resolution arrives abruptly, resulting in a disappointing conclusion. The conflict is set in motion after Justine heroically kills two intruders during a home invasion, earning media acclaim, yet Ben's fearful anticipation of retaliation from the criminal underworld lays the groundwork for the ensuing turmoil.",

I am a big fan of his work, though this particular book is not one of my favorites.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows Justine Poole, a private security agent trained by Ben Spengler, who works for the Spengler-Nash agency. During a home invasion/robbery, Justine kills two criminals and is hailed as a hero by the media. However, Ben anticipates retaliation from the criminal underworld, which sets the stage for the main conflict.  \n\n- **Conflict and Tension:**  \n  The criminal mastermind, Mr. Conger, hires a hitman, Leo Sealy, to kill Justine. The narrative then becomes a high-stakes cat-and-mouse game between Justine and Sealy, with the tension escalating as Sealy gets closer to his target. The reader is kept on edge, rooting for Justine while being unable to predict the outcome.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  The story builds tension effectively, but the denouement feels rushed and somewhat unsatisfying. The resolution happens abruptly, which was a bit of a letdown for me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the rushed ending, the book is engaging and maintains the suspenseful style typical of Thomas Perry's work. If you're a fan of Perry, this is still a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Hero* delivers the suspense and tension expected from a Thomas Perry novel, the abrupt resolution detracts from the overall experience.

He excels at crafting plots centered around a chaser/tracker and a runner/evader, turning these stories into classics. His narratives are smart and detailed, showcasing a chaser who knows all the tricks of avoiding capture and a runner skilled in evading trackers.  \n\n- **Series and Standalone Novels:**  \n  While the best examples of this dynamic are found in his Jane Whitefield series, which I highly recommend, his other novels also feature the investigator/pursuer vs. fugitive/target theme.  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n  In this book, the target is a private security professional, and the pursuer is a professional assassin hired to track her down and eliminate her. The plot is filled with \"tricks of the trade,\" false leads, and near misses, leading to a climactic showdown.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The chase was detailed and engaging, making for a fun ride. However, I was slightly disappointed by the abrupt ending, which felt rushed compared to the buildup.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThomas Perry delivers another gripping crime novel with a well-crafted chase dynamic, intricate details, and a thrilling narrative.

As she kills a couple of the robbers in the line of duty, she unwittingly attracts the attention of the mastermind behind the crime, who seeks revenge by hiring a hitman to eliminate her.

However, the publicity makes her a target for revenge. While there is plenty of action, the story fell flat for me because the characters were not well-drawn.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works by the Author:**  \n  I’ve enjoyed many of Perry’s novels, but this one is not the best of the lot. If you’re looking for characters that are well-drawn, I recommend Perry’s \"Jane Whitefield\" novels instead.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an engaging premise and plenty of action, the lack of compelling character development made it difficult for me to fully enjoy.

It reads as if it were written hastily, perhaps to fulfill a contractual obligation, rather than crafted with care and attention to detail.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story comes across as underdeveloped, as if it were written between breakfast and lunch.

The characters feel flat and uninspired, lacking the complexity and depth that make his other works so memorable.\n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  The novel feels like a significant departure from Perry's usual excellence. It’s as if the writing was outsourced to less talented individuals, a trend I’ve noticed with some other famous thriller writers. This approach has resulted in a book that is mediocre at best and a far cry from the quality I associate with Perry.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I have always admired Perry's intelligent and character-driven thrillers, *Hero* is a disappointing departure from his usual standards.
