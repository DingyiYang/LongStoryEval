            "This book offers a contemporary retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*, complete with a brooding hero, D/s dynamics, gothic elements, and an elite sex club. The narrative centers on the age-gap romance between Asher Voss and Annabelle, capturing the classic \"good girl meets tortured bad boy\" trope. Following her father's sudden death, Annabelle is compelled to strike a deal with Asher to prevent her family from losing their home. The agreement requires her to work for him for a year, fulfilling his every request.",

She confronts Asher, the eldest Voss brother, who is poised to inherit the property. Themes of family responsibility, past trauma, and the mysterious circumstances of her father's death weave through the narrative; however, I felt the latter could have been more thoroughly explored. This dark contemporary romance features elements of a Beauty and the Beast retelling, an enemies-to-lovers dynamic, and a 14-year age gap. While the story is compelling, the mystery surrounding Annabelle's father's death remains underdeveloped. Although it is introduced early on, it fails to lead to a satisfying resolution, leaving several questions unanswered.",
            "Annabelle is a strong, determined character who will go to great lengths to protect her family and confront those who underestimate her. While she exudes good-girl vibes, she is unafraid to stand her ground. Asher begins as a mysterious, brooding figure with a traumatic past, but as he opens up to Annabelle, he reveals a softer side that contrasts with his initial aloofness. Their dynamic is compelling, and their relationship evolves beautifully throughout the story. The romance is intense and well-developed, featuring tantalizing spice that adds depth. Themes of jealousy, possessiveness, and a third-act breakup heighten the emotional stakes. The steamy elements, including BDSM, exhibitionism, and aftercare, make this a captivating read for fans of dark romance."

Their dom/sub sessions added layers to their relationship, and it was fascinating to see Asher struggle with his denial of love.  \n\n- **Brother Dynamics and World-Building:**  \n  The band of brothers, each with their own shades of complexity, was a strong point in P. Rayne's writing. Asher, as the eldest, carried the burden of their evil father’s cruelty, their mother’s tragic death, and running their business dynasty. The brotherly dynamics and the promise of more stories in this world were intriguing.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Resolution:**  \n  The emotional journey was intense. Asher and Anabelle almost lost each other, but their eventual surrender to love was deeply satisfying. Watching Anabelle heal Asher’s broken pieces was heartwarming and fulfilling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Moonlit Thorns* is a captivating retelling of Beauty and the Beast, blending dark gothic vibes, scorching chemistry, and emotional depth. The characters, especially Asher and Anabelle, are beautifully developed, and their journey from enemies to lovers is both intense and satisfying. The incorporation of original details and the strong brother dynamics make this story stand out. I loved every moment of it and can’t wait to explore more in this world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Anabelle's struggle to conceal her attraction to Asher leads to some amusing moments when he calls her out on it.

Central to the narrative is the dynamic between Asher, the brooding anti-hero, and Annabelle, the spirited heroine. Asher is mercurial, cruel, and deeply tormented, while Annabelle combines curiosity, vulnerability, and a strong will. Their enemies-to-lovers relationship is charged with intense sexual tension, as Annabelle navigates the complex interplay of safety and pleasure in vulnerability, while Asher grapples with his desire for control. Sexual exploration becomes a catalyst for character growth, as lust transforms into a profound emotional connection.",

            "This retelling of *Beauty and the Beast* introduces a BDSM twist that adds depth to the classic tale. Anabelle (Belle) is resolute in her quest to save her family's estate, which her father has put up as collateral for a loan from billionaire Asher Voss. Asher agrees to return the estate, but only if Anabelle works for him for a year. The plot is fast-paced and captivating, compelling me to read it in one sitting. While the double suspense at the end felt somewhat excessive, the overall experience was enjoyable.",
            "Anabelle is a good girl with a hint of rebellion, driven by her curiosity about the sex club and her strong attraction to Asher. Asher, the tortured hero, is captivatingly handsome but burdened by a haunting past that unfolds gradually. However, Preston's character feels superfluous, particularly with the presence of Galen, a Gaston-like figure, already in the narrative.",

It delves into the complexities of dark billionaire romance, exploring themes of grief, past child abuse, and redemption.",
            "Overall, I found the story enjoyable, though the sex club plot didn't resonate with me. However, Asher's backstory was compelling and added significant emotional depth to the narrative."

            "This story follows Annabelle as she grapples with her father's death and the looming threat of eviction from her ancestral home by the infamous Voss family. The plot is captivating and creatively parallels *Beauty and the Beast*. However, the narrative wavers between magical and non-magical elements, which could benefit from clearer definitions to enhance clarity.",

In contrast, Asher Voss is a well-developed character, effectively showcasing his indifference and internal struggles. His older, more experienced demeanor highlights Annabelle’s youth. The bond among the four Voss brothers is strong and compelling, leaving me eager to see how their stories unfold. The enemies-to-lovers dynamic between Asher and Annabelle is engaging, filled with ups and downs. However, Annabelle's character could benefit from greater maturity to better balance Asher’s complexity.",

            "In this story, the female main character, Anabelle, comes across as whiny and immature, often reflecting her youth through her actions and thoughts. The male main character, Asher, is preoccupied with their age difference, frequently lamenting Anabelle's youth. This obsession with the age gap is a recurring theme throughout the book. For about 70% of the story, Anabelle lacks agency, acting as a doormat for Asher and struggling to assert herself. While the last 30% shows some improvement in their character dynamics, the fixation on the age gap remains a persistent issue.",
            "This book features a first-person dual POV, offering a balanced perspective from both main characters. It incorporates several engaging tropes, including an age gap, a billionaire hero, and elements of BDSM, such as a sex club and a dom/sub dynamic. The story also touches on the \"touch-her-and-die\" trope and includes a hint of grumpy/sunshine chemistry. Notably, there is no drama involving other women or men, allowing the hero and heroine to remain the sole focus of the narrative."

Additionally, the mysterious Saturday night events, which were initially intriguing, ultimately felt underwhelming once revealed and were quickly glossed over.",

Asher's character arc is well-crafted, and I connected with him deeply. In contrast, Annabelle's character feels underdeveloped. With the narrative primarily from her perspective, I struggled to fully understand her.",

            "This book skillfully blends fairytale retellings with billionaire romance, specifically offering a fresh take on Beauty and the Beast.

The inventive incorporation of key elements from the original story, particularly the beast and the roses, truly stood out to me."

            "As a fan of \"Beauty and the Beast\" retellings, I found this rendition to be truly remarkable. It closely follows the original fairytale while introducing unique twists that set it apart. The addition of the Voss family's backstory adds depth and intrigue, making the story feel refreshingly original.",
            "Asher Voss embodies the quintessential Beast archetype: older, dark, brooding, and deliciously volatile. His hot-and-cold demeanor makes him both protective and distant, but as his attraction to Annabelle grows, he gradually lets her in. Annabelle is clever, resourceful, and determined to save her family’s home after her father's death. She is kind, slightly innocent, and curious about Asher, reflecting Belle’s personality. The chemistry between them is palpable, with Annabelle being more vocal about her feelings. The book's spice is perfectly balanced, emphasizing consent, particularly given the 14-year age gap and power dynamics. The D/s (Dominance/submission) dynamic is portrayed consensually and respectfully, adding depth to their relationship. Once the characters open up to each other, the romance becomes intense and captivating.",
            "This book masterfully blends elements of Beauty and the Beast with age-gap romance, D/s dynamics, secret societies, and mafia undertones, resulting in a captivating and original narrative.",
            "I eagerly anticipate Kol's story next! Thank you for the ARC (Advanced Reader Copy). All my thoughts and opinions are my own and freely shared about this incredible book!"

The emphasis on consent and the intriguing backstory of the Voss family make it a refreshing and captivating read. Fans of age-gap romance, D/s dynamics, and mafia-inspired stories will thoroughly enjoy this book.",

            "The plot was engaging, and the love story between Anabelle and Asher was well-developed, both deserving a solid 4/5 rating.",
            "One of the standout aspects of this story is how the authors skillfully handle the retelling, particularly in the development of Anabelle and Asher's relationship. Anabelle, a kind and resilient young woman, returns to her hometown after her father's death. I found her character compelling, especially in how she navigates Asher's gruff demeanor upon arriving at Midnight Manor. She confronts challenges with courage and empathy, making her a relatable protagonist.\n\nAsher, on the other hand, is a complex character—a wealthy, brooding man haunted by childhood traumas inflicted by his father. As the protector of his brothers, he struggles with commitment and initially comes across as difficult to love due to his erratic behavior. However, the authors effectively portray his vulnerability and gradual willingness to trust Anabelle, which adds depth to his character.\n\nTheir relationship begins with tension as Anabelle is compelled to work and live with Asher at Midnight Manor. Her curiosity about the house's secrets and her enigmatic boss drives the narrative forward. I particularly enjoyed the moments when they grew closer, especially when Asher opened up about his painful past. The intertwining of the manor's mysteries and the Voss brothers' dynamics enhances their emotional connection.\n\nAnabelle's bond with her brother Luke is also touching, and I would have appreciated more exploration of this relationship. While Anabelle's character could have been further developed—especially regarding her father's truth—her journey remains engaging. Asher's character arc is well-executed, though his initial blame of Anabelle for Kol's behavior was somewhat perplexing. Nevertheless, his evolution into vulnerability and love for Anabelle is gratifying.\n\nThe secondary characters, particularly the Voss brothers, are a strong point of the story, contributing to its overall appeal. I would rate this story a solid 5/5."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a highly enjoyable read, especially for a first-time experience with the author’s work. The retelling, character development, and relationship dynamics were standout elements, though there was room for deeper exploration of Anabelle’s personal story. The secondary characters and world-building added richness to the narrative, making it a memorable experience.",

I loved getting to know the world of Midnight Manor and the story of Anabelle and Asher.  \n\n- **Retelling and Character Development:**  \n   - One of the things I liked most was how the authors handled the retelling in this story, particularly how Anabelle and Asher's feelings developed.  \n   - Anabelle is a good and sweet girl who returns to her hometown after her father's death. She is a very interesting character, and I liked how she dealt with Asher's attitude from the moment she arrived at Midnight Manor. She faces situations with courage and has a kind heart that allows her to empathize with others.  \n   - Asher is a complicated character: a rich, grumpy, and reserved man who suffers from childhood traumas caused by his father. He is the protector of his brothers and believes himself incapable of commitment. While he was hard to love at first due to his confusing actions, the authors took him on a good path, showing his vulnerability and his ability to trust and open his heart to Anabelle.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n   - The relationship between Asher and Anabelle begins tensely when she is forced to work and live with him at Midnight Manor. Anabelle is curious about the secrets of the house, the strange events within its walls, and her enigmatic boss.  \n   - I particularly enjoyed the moments when they began to grow closer, especially when Asher confided in Anabelle about his painful past. Their use of the secrets of Midnight Manor and the Voss brothers to act on their feelings for each other was a highlight.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Potential for Development:**  \n   - Anabelle’s relationship with her brother Luke was touching, and I would have loved to read more about it. Her character would have been perfect if the authors had developed her personal story further, especially regarding the truth about her father.  \n   - Asher’s character arc was well-done, but his initial actions, such as blaming Anabelle for Kol’s behavior, were confusing. However, his growth into vulnerability and love for Anabelle was satisfying.  \n\n- **Secondary Characters and World-Building:**  \n   - The secondary characters, particularly the Voss brothers, were a strong point of the story, earning a 5/5 rating.  \n\n- **Plot and Romance:**  \n   - The plot was engaging, and the love story between Anabelle and Asher was well-developed, both earning a 4/5 rating.  \n\n- **Aesthetic and Spice Level:**  \n   - The cover was visually appealing, earning a 4/5 rating. The spice level was moderate, rated 3/5.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a highly enjoyable read, especially for a first-time experience with P. Rayne’s work. The retelling, character development, and relationship dynamics were standout elements, though there was room for deeper exploration of Anabelle’s personal story. The secondary characters and world-building added richness to the narrative, making it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Asher: 3.5/5  \n- Anabelle: 4/5  \n- Plot: 4/5  \n- Love Story: 4/5  \n- Secondary Characters: 5/5  \n- Cover: 4/5  \n- Spice Level: 3/5"

            "Asher’s contract with Anabelle is nothing short of outrageous—he takes her phone for a year, pays her minimum wage, and severely restricts her freedom, effectively making her an indentured servant. This dynamic heightens the tension throughout the story. Anabelle faces repeated dangers, and the line \"Maybe she consented?\" regarding her being drugged and unconscious is frustratingly infuriating. The action ramps up towards the end, echoing the style of *Fifty Shades Freed*. I love a dark romance, especially a Beauty and the Beast retelling, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The premise of a billionaire romance with plenty of spice really appeals to me. After her father’s death, Anabelle’s family estate is in jeopardy, leading her to seek employment and housing at the manor of the Voss billionaire brothers, which sets the stage for a captivating and dramatic narrative.",
            "Asher Voss, a 36-year-old billionaire with a cold demeanor, finds himself entangled with Anabelle, whose curiosity leads her into perilous territory. Anabelle's ex-boyfriend's delusional proposal had me laughing out loud, and I was relieved she didn’t entertain it for long, even if she ultimately traded him for Asher, who torments her out of boredom. Asher's brothers exude unsettling vibes, particularly during the breakfast scene, while Preston and the sheriff, Anabelle's former flame, are no better. This makes Asher appear as the lesser evil, despite his hidden motives.",
            "The story unfolds at a fantastic pace, captivating me with its characters. I found myself pacing around my room with every chapter. The writing style is engaging, though I wished Anabelle would assert herself more often and that Asher would dial down his initial rudeness.",
            "Dual POV in romance novels is my gold standard, and I was delighted to find it here. It was entertaining to witness the male lead's obsession with the female lead, especially when she believes he hates her. A standout moment was when Asher listened to Anabelle’s audiobook through her AirPods—it was both hilarious and relatable. However, I found it frustrating that Anabelle frequently walked into danger, ignoring clear red flags. I wanted to shake her and make her recognize the risks she was taking."

        "conclusion": "*Moonlit Thorns* is a dark, spicy, and engaging Beauty and the Beast retelling with a captivating plot and complex character dynamics. While some character decisions were frustrating, the dual POV, fast pacing, and dramatic tension made it an enjoyable read. I look forward to continuing the series.",

            "The shift from intense, angsty tension to a romantic dynamic occurs too abruptly, largely fueled by their sexual relationship, which comes across as unrealistic. Additionally, a chaotic scene where Anabelle gets drunk and creates unnecessary drama feels forced and poorly executed. The resolution of conflicts, including this chaotic moment, is rushed, leaving the story feeling uneven and lacking depth.",

Asher initially comes off as overly aggressive and accusatory, creating an unrealistic and irritating dynamic. His abrupt transition from anger and control to protectiveness and affection after their sexual encounter feels jarring. Despite being depicted as the older, more mature character, Asher's behavior often resembles childish tantrums, undermining his credibility.",

Additionally, the depiction of emotional vulnerability and intimacy feels rushed and lacks depth, especially following intense scenes.",

Though she fears him, she is inexplicably drawn to his intensity. Their romance is both steamy and compelling, evolving into a captivating love story.

            "This novel offers a dark reimagining of *Beauty and the Beast*, where Annabelle's family estate is lost to the Voss family due to her father's debts. She travels to Midnight Manor to negotiate and ends up working for the grumpy yet handsome billionaire, Asher Voss. The plot takes a dramatic turn when Annabelle uncovers a significant secret about the Voss family, leading to intense and steamy moments with Asher. The story is addictive, blending mystery, romance, and dark themes. However, I would have liked to see a deeper exploration of the *big secret* after Annabelle's involvement, as it seems poised for further development in future installments. The author skillfully reimagines *Beauty and the Beast*, incorporating familiar elements from the Disney film (such as the Potters and the dress) while adding a darker, more mature twist.",

But when I’m with you... you give me hope that I can be more than just those things. At least with you.”  \n  - “I would never hurt you. Never raise a hand to you.

The story revolves around Asher Voss, a wealthy man with brothers, and Annabelle, a woman trying to save her family estate. While there are some gothic and dark elements, the connection to the original fairy tale is weak.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  - The story is set at Midnight Manor, a gothic-style estate owned by Asher Voss, where he lives with his brothers. The manor has a sex club in the basement, which becomes a significant part of the plot. Annabelle, facing the loss of her family estate, strikes a deal with Asher to work for him in exchange for the deed to her property.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Asher Voss is portrayed as a troubled man with a difficult past, including an abusive father and an absent mother. He is dismissive and mean at first, but his character evolves as the story progresses. Annabelle is determined and resourceful, willing to make bold decisions to save her estate. Their relationship develops gradually, with Asher initially pushing her away before they eventually fall for each other.  \n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Elements:**  \n  - The romance between Asher and Annabelle is central to the story, but the intimate scenes are limited. The only significant moment of intimacy occurs in the sex club, which Annabelle joins after discovering its existence. The story lacks consistent \"spice,\" with most of the focus on their emotional connection rather than physical encounters.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  - The story includes a kidnapping subplot near the end, where Annabelle is abducted by another character. This adds tension but feels somewhat disconnected from the main narrative. The resolution ties up the central conflict, with Asher and Annabelle overcoming their personal struggles to be together.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite not feeling like a true \"Beauty & the Beast\" retelling, I enjoyed reading the book. The gothic atmosphere, character dynamics, and emotional journey made it an engaging read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book doesn’t fully deliver on its promise as a \"Beauty & the Beast\" retelling, it offers a compelling story with a gothic setting, complex characters, and a slow-burn romance.

Anabelle is a standout character; she is strong, resilient, and sweet despite her hardships. I admired her determination to protect her family and her willingness to fight for Asher, even amidst his antics.

            "Anabelle and Asher are a perfect match. At first, Ash is guarded and closed off, but Anabelle's presence gradually opens him up. He falls for her the moment she steps into his office seeking help, and despite his efforts to push her away, he can't resist her charm. I love when the male lead falls so deeply. The forced proximity and Ash's urgent desire to keep Anabelle safe add significant depth to their relationship. Lines like, “If Anabelle knew how often I think of her, how I feel this pressing need to keep her hidden away from the world, safe, she’d probably run screaming from here,” and “You are a goddess. My goddess,” are both romantic and intense. The BDSM club in the mansion introduces a dark, spicy element to the story, enhancing the edgy, forbidden layer of this fairytale-inspired romance.",
            "The rosebush stood out to me as a powerful symbol in the story. I appreciated how Ash struggled to revive it, only for Anabelle to find a way to save it. This beautifully mirrored their love story, making it a poignant metaphor."

Lines like, “If Anabelle knew how often I think of her, how I feel this pressing need to keep her hidden away from the world, safe, she’d probably run screaming from here,” and “You are a goddess.

It added an edgy, forbidden layer to the fairytale-inspired romance.  \n\n- **Symbolism and Details:**  \n  The rosebush was a standout element for me. I loved how it was dying and Ash couldn’t revive it, but Anabelle comes along and finds ways to save it. It was such a perfect metaphor for their love story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Beauty and the Beast-inspired billionaire romance was an absolute delight!

            "This novel bears more resemblance to *50 Shades of Grey* than to *Beauty and the Beast*, with only a few shared elements, such as a rose bush and the female main character's confinement to a mansion. It features familiar tropes, including forced proximity, billionaire romance, a secret society, \"touch her and die,\" an age gap, and dom/sub dynamics. The first 40% of the book is engaging, showcasing fluid interactions and satisfying tension between the female and male leads. However, the narrative takes a jarring turn when the brothers' involvement in a sex club is revealed, leading to a rapid progression in their relationship. The final act feels rushed and predictable, lacking the depth and unpredictability that characterized the earlier sections. While the tension in the first half is well-crafted, the pacing falters after the sex club revelation, causing the main drama to occasionally lose its impact.",
            "Annabelle (Belle) is a strong female lead, though her swift acceptance of the dark underworld she encounters feels somewhat unrealistic.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel shares more similarities with *50 Shades of Grey* than *Beauty and the Beast*, with only a few elements like a rose bush and the FMC being sequestered to a mansion drawing parallels. The story includes tropes such as forced proximity, billionaire romance, secret society, \"touch her and die,\" age gap, and dom/sub dynamics. The first 40% of the book was enjoyable, with fluid interactions and satisfying tension between the FMC and MMC. However, the focus shifts jarringly once the brothers' involvement in a sex club is revealed, and the relationship progresses too quickly. The final act felt rushed and predictable.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Annabelle (Belle) is a strong FMC, though her quick acceptance of the dark underworld she encounters feels unrealistic. Asher, the MMC, is a morally grey \"Beast\" with a compelling backstory rooted in childhood trauma. His hot-and-cold behavior is well-executed and doesn't feel forced. The moments where Belle breaks down Asher's emotional walls are particularly touching and well-written.\n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  The tension-building in the first half of the book is satisfying, but the pacing becomes uneven after the sex club revelation. The main drama occasionally wavers, and the final act lacks the depth and unpredictability of the earlier sections.\n\n- **Tropes and Preferences:**  \n  The dom/sub trope isn't for me, but readers who enjoy this dynamic will likely appreciate it. The forced proximity, billionaire, and \"touch her and die\" tropes are well-integrated, though the age gap and secret society elements could have been explored more deeply.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel has some strong moments, particularly in the tension and character development between Asher and Belle. However, the pacing issues, rushed ending, and uneven focus on certain tropes detract from the overall experience. Fans of dom/sub dynamics and morally grey characters will likely enjoy it more than I did.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nStars: ⭐️⭐️⭐️  \nSpice: 🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶❤️‍🔥"

As a Dom, he was a dream.  \n\n- **Pacing and Build-Up:**  \n  I enjoyed the book overall, but I felt the pacing was a little fast. There wasn’t enough heat between the characters at the start, though it built up later, making the book amazing.  \n\n- **Depth and Plot Execution:**  \n  The characters, especially Annabelle, felt like they were missing some layers. I also noticed a plot hole, which was a bit disappointing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some minor issues with pacing, character depth, and a plot hole, I found this spicy retelling of Beauty and the Beast to be highly enjoyable. The characters, particularly Annabelle and Asher, were compelling, and the story was engaging. I would definitely recommend this book!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She is nurturing and full of love for others, even when they don't deserve her kindness.  \n  - I felt her grief and struggle but admired her for making impossible choices.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Chemistry:**  \n  - The steam between the characters was fabulous but didn’t overtake the plot.  \n  - These Voss men love their adult parties, which added a really fun and spicy element to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - I needed this spicy and emotional escape! The story was both emotionally engaging and a delightful escape.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Fairytale retelling is a perfect blend of emotional depth, romantic tension, and nods to the original story.

The story made me curious about the Vosses and their background, which added a layer of mystery.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing felt a bit slow leading up to when the main characters finally got together.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  The spice between the characters was hot once they got involved. However, when they had their clothes on, their chemistry felt lacking. The relationship transitioned abruptly from “I own you” to “I’m obsessed with you,” with no pining or buildup in between.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I enjoyed the strong-willed female main character (FMC). Despite the age gap, she stood her ground and went toe-to-toe with the male main character (MMC).  \n\n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  While I was entertained, the story didn’t fully pull me in.

This affected my overall experience with the book.  \n\n- **Trope Execution:**  \n  I wouldn’t classify this as an enemies-to-lovers story. It felt more like a hate-to-love or obsession-to-love dynamic. I kept wondering, “Where are the enemies?” This aspect didn’t quite meet my expectations.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The story moved very quickly, and I wished things had unfolded at a slower pace.

I re-read *Cruel King* by Rina Kent because my best friend was reading it, and I wanted to share details. Jumping from Levi-fucking-King to a simpler, lighter retelling of *The Beauty and the Beast* was a stark contrast.  \n\n- **Retellings and Genre Preferences:**  \n  I don’t usually enjoy retellings—I hate them, in fact—but I gave this one a shot because I appreciate how the authors manage to deliver a simple, fun book in between more intense reads.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Asher is a good “beast,” and Anabelle is a good Belle. The characters were well-written, and they actually made me forget that this was supposed to be a version of the fairy tale.  \n\n- **Series Potential and Role as a Palate Cleanser:**  \n  I will definitely keep reading the series as palate cleansers. Even though the themes and trigger warnings don’t seem light, the way the story is told makes it feel like a refreshing break for me.  \n\n- **Personal Reflection:**  \n  I apologize to the book for reading it right after a Rina Kent novel. It wasn’t the book’s fault that I didn’t enjoy it as much as I could have.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Monlit Thorns* didn’t captivate me as much as other books I’ve read, it served its purpose as a light, enjoyable read.

            "This dark retelling of *Beauty and the Beast* significantly diverges from the Disney version. The story centers on billionaire Asher Voss (the Beast) and the strong-willed, book-loving Anabelle (the Belle figure). After her father's untimely death, Anabelle agrees to live and work at Midnight Manor to pay off his debt, creating a forced proximity with Asher. However, a small plot hole or unfinished storyline left me uncertain whether it was intentionally left open for future books or simply overlooked.",

Anabelle, resilient and determined, balances her strength with a deep love for books. The 14-year age gap and the Dom/Sub dynamic further enrich their relationship. The \"Touch Her and Die\" trope highlights Asher's protective and possessive instincts. Despite their differences and Asher's attempts to uphold boundaries, their undeniable mutual attraction ultimately leads to a breakdown of the rules they initially established.",

            "This story offers a dark twist on the classic *Beauty and the Beast*, infused with elements of spice, kink, and a touch of suspense. The plot centers on Anabelle, who strikes a deal with billionaire Asher Voss to save her family estate and business, committing to a year of living and working for him.",
            "The relationship between Anabelle and Asher is central to the story, highlighting their forced proximity and the billionaire/age gap trope. While the inclusion of a secret society, sex club, and BDSM dynamics adds complexity, it felt excessive. I found the third-act breakup particularly frustrating, especially when the male main character sends the female main character away after she gets hurt due to his actions, only for them to reconcile later. This conflict felt avoidable and detracted from the overall narrative.",
            "The narrative is primarily driven by themes of attraction and secrets.",

What is shown, however, is good.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The story includes a small third-act breakup, which adds tension but doesn’t overshadow the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite some flaws, the book is enjoyable, and I’m excited to read the next book in the series, which focuses on Kol.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis \"Beauty and the Beast\" retelling has its strengths, particularly in the chemistry between the leads and the emotional depth of the male protagonist. However, the overly obvious parallels to the original tale and the underdeveloped mystery surrounding the club detract from the overall experience. Still, it’s a solid read, and I’m looking forward to the next installment in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 3.9 ⭐️  \n- 2 🌶 (spice level)"

            "This book presents a captivating twist on the classic beauty and the beast narrative, as the heroine is compelled to leave her home to live with the beast and his household staff due to her father's debt. Initially framed as a bully romance, the male lead's early emotional investment adds an intriguing layer to their relationship. The gothic atmosphere of the house and grounds heightens the suspense, leaving me anxious about the potential dangers facing the heroine. However, the third-act conflict felt predictable and could have benefited from a more mysterious buildup. The central mystery surrounding the manor's monthly events was somewhat glossed over, lacking the sinister depth I had anticipated, which ultimately diminished its impact.",

His tough exterior softens only for the heroine, which I found particularly appealing.

The heroine herself is compelling, and her interactions with the male characters are both engaging and dynamic."

A notable drawback is Annabelle's lack of friends, a recurring issue I often see with female protagonists. The story features an enemies-to-lovers trope, enhanced by forced proximity and a workplace romance.

            "The ending of the book fails to justify the journey, a sentiment echoed by many readers. If it weren't for the excellent narration, I would have considered abandoning it. The author leans on clichéd tropes to excuse Asher's abusive behavior. For instance, sexual acts are used to obscure Annabelle's perception of his flaws, he saves her from an attempted assault, and he unloads his trauma on her to elicit sympathy and distract from his rage. These elements come across as contrived and ultimately unsatisfying.",

Despite her frequent claims of maturity, her actions and demeanor often feel immature. Meanwhile, the male lead, Asher, is portrayed as a promiscuous jerk—mean and unlikable. It's difficult to understand why Annabelle would be attracted to him, given his behavior.",

His voice was exceptional, and I would listen to him read anything, even a dictionary.  \n\n- **Genre and Theme Accuracy:**  \n  The book was marketed as a Beauty & the Beast retelling, but this description is so loose that it feels almost like false advertising. Instead, it leans heavily into a mafia-style dark romance with BDSM elements, which was not what I expected or enjoyed.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The female main character (MF), Annabelle, is portrayed as a doormat rather than a strong submissive. She constantly whines, \"I am not a child,\" yet her actions and demeanor come across as immature. The male main character (MM), Asher, is a promiscuous jerk who is mean and unlikable. It’s unclear why Annabelle would be drawn to him, given his behavior.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n  The author relies on lazy tropes to justify Asher's abusive behavior. For example, s*x acts are used to magically blind Annabelle to his flaws, he saves her from an attempted r*pe, and he trauma dumps on her to make her forget his rage and feel sorry for him. These elements felt contrived and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  The ending did not justify the journey of the book. I agree with other reviewers who felt the same way. If it weren’t for the excellent narration, I would have stopped reading (DNF'd) this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the narration by Marcio Catalano was outstanding, the book itself was a disappointment.
