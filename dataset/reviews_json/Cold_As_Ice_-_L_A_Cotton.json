While his reluctance to communicate can be irritating, it’s understandable given his troubled past.

Their growth throughout the story was engaging and well-developed.\n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  As a fan of the Lakeshore U series, I appreciated how this book maintained the tone and quality of the previous installments.

            "Review:  \nTropes: Hockey Romance, Single Mom, Found Family, Friends with Benefits, College Romance, Angst, Past Trauma, Adorable Daughter. This book quickly became my favorite! Austin's story was absolutely worth the wait.",
            "I've eagerly anticipated Austin's story since the beginning. His mysterious nature and unique relationship with his sister, Rory, have always intrigued me. Previous books hinted at his closed-off demeanor, allowing only a select few to glimpse his true self. However, when Madison entered his life, he opened his heart, loving both her and her daughter, Imogen, as they truly deserve.\n\nFrom the start, I've been drawn to Austin's enigmatic character. There’s a reason behind his guarded behavior, and reflecting on his difficult childhood makes it clear that he didn't deserve to feel that way. On the other hand, Madison, a dedicated single mom, works two jobs to ensure her daughter has a happy life and fulfills her dreams. Her strength and unwavering commitment to her child's happiness are qualities I deeply admire.\n\nAustin's past has led him to believe that he doesn't deserve love, which makes him hesitant to embrace the idea of finding his soulmate. I had hoped he would discover a love that would accept him for who he is. In a matter of hours, Madison's daughter had captured my heart, and Madison herself felt like she belonged beside me. Being around her brought me an unexpected sense of peace, and now that I've experienced it, I never want to let her go.",
            "This has quickly become my new favorite book; it beautifully reveals the true Austin. Madi has faced significant challenges in recent years, but her determination to persevere amid adversity showcases her strength. The author has crafted another compelling story that is truly worth reading. I always feel a deep emotional connection to her characters, and I cherish their interactions—whether it's playful banter or the unwavering support of their 'family' dynamic."

The dynamic between Austin and Madison, with its conflicts and resolutions, keeps the plot engaging, although some interactions come across as overly dramatic.",
            "Austin's transformation from a grumpy, mysterious loner to a man capable of love is both satisfying and well-earned. While Madison is likable, she doesn't fully capture the reader's affection; her immediate attraction to Austin and reactions to his behavior can feel predictable and frustrating. A highlight of the story is Austin's growth, especially in reconciling with his sister Rory and confronting his past. Although his initial attitude toward Rory is exasperating, their eventual resolution is rewarding. Imogen is delightful, and I look forward to her potential love story. The chemistry between Austin and Madison is intense and steamy, but their repetitive back-and-forth about keeping things casual feels unrealistic. Madison's trust issues from her past create inconsistencies in her attraction to Austin and her willingness to trust new men.

            "Madison and Austin share a compelling chemistry, irresistibly drawn to each other despite their determination to remain apart. Their push-and-pull dynamic fuels the tension and excitement in their relationship, making it an engaging read. While Austin can be difficult to like at times, he undergoes significant growth throughout the story. His complicated relationships with his mother and sister hinder his ability to form new connections, but Madison challenges him to confront these feelings. One of my favorite aspects of the book is Imogen, Madison’s adorable 4-year-old daughter, whose heartwarming bond with Austin adds depth to the narrative. However, her baby talk occasionally feels unrealistic—for instance, she says “wike” while also articulating “special gloves” perfectly. Nonetheless, the tenderness in Austin and Imogen's relationship beautifully illustrates the magic of a man connecting with a child.",

            "In this narrative, we meet Austin, who initially comes across as guarded and enigmatic, keeping his thoughts and feelings to himself. Even after his sister arrives in Lakeshore and his friends find happiness, he still feels like an outsider. This book allows us to delve deeper into his character as he begins to shed his past burdens and open up to those around him. \n\nI was drawn to Madison from the very beginning; she is fiercely determined and will do anything to ensure her daughter feels loved. Sweet little Imogen quickly captured my heart as well! Austin is Lakeshore U’s brooding goalie, while Madison is a young single mother carrying the weight of the world. When their paths cross multiple times, Austin proposes they explore their undeniable chemistry, but they both agree it can only be a friends-with-benefits situation—because that always works out, right?\n\nThe found family aspect of this story is truly heartwarming and one of its standout features.",

Despite this, it was a satisfying read that highlighted their individual struggles and the unexpected love they found in each other.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It didn’t disappoint.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Austin has been the most standoffish and curious character so far. He was a hurt character who I needed to know more about. He is so complex and didn’t want anyone to read him. Maddison coming in had a rough ride where he was concerned.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  Neither character wanted anything serious, but it was still full of angst. I loved watching their characters grow and sort through all their baggage together and grow together.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The author really took me on a journey. Another great book in The Lakeshore U series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Cold as Ice* was another great read in The Lakeshore U series. It delivered on my high expectations, offering a compelling journey with complex characters, emotional depth, and satisfying growth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Maddie perfectly balanced Austin's stormy nature with her own sunshine. Her confrontation after realizing her mistakes was a pivotal moment that deepened my admiration for her character; witnessing her journey toward self-discovery was truly inspiring. As the strong protagonist, Maddie shines, but it was Austin who truly stole the show for me. Lianne crafted his story with raw emotion and turmoil, capturing his struggles with his past, his relationship with Rory, and his teammates in a way that resonated deeply. Meeting Maddie becomes a turning point for him, motivating him to reconnect with his sister and friends. His gradual realization of how far he has fallen was both poignant and swoon-worthy.",
            "Cold As Ice should come with a warning for the intense emotions it evokes! Austin and Maddie’s romance is packed with the emotional turmoil we expect from Lianne, but it offers so much more. I was unprepared for the profound impact this story would have on me and how deeply I would fall for the icy goalie. Austin tore me apart and then pieced me back together on his journey to a happily ever after with Maddie and Immy!"

        "conclusion": "Cold As Ice is a deeply emotional and captivating hockey romance that beautifully balances heartbreak and healing. Maddie and Austin’s journey from friends to lovers is filled with slow-burn tension, genuine growth, and heartwarming moments, especially with the addition of Imogen. While the sibling dynamic between Austin and Rory could have been explored further, the story’s raw emotion and character development make it a standout read.",
