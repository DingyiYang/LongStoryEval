        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  Kelley Armstrong once again immerses readers in 1869 Edinburgh in *Disturbing the Dead*. The historical setting is vividly portrayed, and the contrast between Mallory’s 21st-century perspective and the 19th-century world she inhabits adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Mallory, a 21st-century Canadian detective, continues to adapt to her life in 1869, now in the body of a housemaid named Catriona. Her growth and adaptation to Victorian customs and clothing are well-executed. The supporting characters, such as Dr. Duncan Gray and his sister Isla, are compelling and progressive for their time. Their relationships with Mallory add richness to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The central mystery involves the unwrapping of an Egyptian mummy, which takes a surprising turn when the body is revealed to be a contemporary figure known to the characters. A fun subplot involves uncovering the identity of the person writing sensational broadsheets about Dr. Gray and Mallory’s adventures, which humorously misrepresents Mallory as merely a “sexy, pretty sidekick.” A well-executed twist about two-thirds into the book adds excitement and depth to the story.  \n\n- **Series Continuity and Standalone Potential:**  \n  While *Disturbing the Dead* can be enjoyed as a standalone novel, reading it as part of the *A Rip Through Time* series provides valuable backstory and enhances the overall experience. The gradual expansion of characters who know Mallory’s true identity adds continuity and intrigue.  \n\n- **Audiobook and Narration:**  \n  The audiobook, narrated by Kate Handford, is well-performed and complements the story effectively. The ability to switch between the audiobook and ebook formats was convenient and allowed for seamless engagement with the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Disturbing the Dead* is a captivating addition to the *A Rip Through Time* series, blending historical fiction, mystery, and character-driven storytelling. The well-crafted plot, engaging characters, and immersive setting make it a highly enjoyable read.

            "In this gripping tale, Mallory and Duncan are reluctantly drawn into the unwrapping of a mummy, a prospect they find utterly distasteful. However, upon arrival, they discover that the host is missing, and Duncan is reluctantly thrust into the task of unwrapping the mummy, only to uncover the host's lifeless body inside. Their investigation leads them into dark, unsettling territory, including an underground market where anything can be obtained through bartering. The novel is not only compelling and well-written, but it also stands out as one of the most macabre in its genre, delving into peculiar aspects of Victorian life, such as Egyptology and chilling folk remedies.",

The continuity and character development make it worth starting from the beginning.\n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  This book contained a twist I wasn’t expecting, and at first, I wasn’t happy about it. However, it was executed so well that it won me over. The story revolves around Mallory, Dr. Gray, and Isla being invited to a mummy unwrapping party, which leads to the discovery of a murder. The unexpected twist was the revelation that the hosts were familiar with them due to a serialized account of their adventures, which gave Dr. Gray all the credit and reduced Mallory to a pretty sidekick.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I truly love these characters. Mallory, Dr. Gray, and Isla are well-developed, and their dynamics are engaging. Mallory’s determination to help solve the murder, despite being sidelined in the fictionalized accounts, adds depth to her character.\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  This book frequently had me laughing. The humor is well-balanced with the mystery, making it an enjoyable read.\n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I started this book with the audiobook and loved the narrator. She brought Mallory’s voice to life, and I wish I had been patient enough to finish it that way. Some of the later scenes would have been even more impactful with the narrator’s voice. However, I ended up finishing the last two-thirds on Kindle, which is faster for me.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I am hopeful this will be far from the last book in the series. The story and characters have so much potential for further development.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is my favorite book in the Rip Through Time series so far. The unexpected twist, well-executed plot, and engaging characters made it a standout read. The humor and narration added to the overall enjoyment, and I’m eagerly looking forward to more books in the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI gave this one 4.5 stars, rounded up for catching me off guard with a twist."

Early in the story, Mallory humorously refers to Dr. Grey as a \"consulting detective,\" a nod to Arthur Conan Doyle's creation, and she silently apologizes for the anachronism. This clever interplay sets the stage for Dr. Grey to embrace the title for himself, adding an engaging layer to their adventures.",

            "This book's mystery was thin and failed to capture the depth and engagement of its predecessors. The repetitive dialogue, coupled with the excessive length, made the story feel monotonous. The ending was rushed and disappointing, and Catriona's character arc felt particularly lacking. Although she was depicted as a flawed character, the absence of closure or exploration of her contemporary experience clashed with the series' themes of investigation, science, and empathy.",
            "In this third novel, Mallory's character loses some of her dynamism. No longer making mistakes or misjudgments that made her relatable in earlier books, she now comes across as perfect, possessing flawless intuition and expertise. Similarly, Duncan's character feels inconsistent; after their previous efforts to repair their relationship, his sudden shift to being \"very, very human\" feels jarring and out of place.",
            "I have a deep admiration for the author's work, but I was disappointed by the last two books in one of their series. The first two installments were captivating. In these earlier novels, Mallory, a detective who time-travels to Victorian England, finds refuge with Duncan and Isla Gray. Duncan serves as an unofficial coroner, aiding his detective friend McCreadie. The initial books offered engaging mysteries, rich character development, and a compelling tension as Mallory navigated the complexities of Victorian society and forged trust with the Grays."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Context and Expectations:**  \n   - I love Kelley Armstrong’s Rockton series, Haven’s Rock series, and Cainsville—except for the last two books in Cainsville. I really enjoyed the first two books in this series.  \n   - In the previous novels, Mallory, a detective who travels back in time to Victorian England, is taken in by Duncan and Isla Gray. Duncan assists his detective friend McCreadie as an unofficial coroner.  \n   - The earlier books had engaging mysteries, character development, and tension as Mallory navigated Victorian society and built trust with the Grays.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - In this third novel, Mallory’s character feels less dynamic. She no longer makes mistakes or misjudgments, which made her relatable in the earlier books. Instead, she’s portrayed as perfect, with flawless intuition and expertise.  \n   - Duncan’s character also feels inconsistent. After working to repair their relationship in the previous book, his sudden shift to being “very, very human” felt jarring and out of place.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n   - The mystery in this book was threadbare and lacked the depth and engagement of the earlier novels.  \n   - The repetitive dialogue and the book’s excessive length made the story feel monotonous.  \n\n- **Ending and Themes:**  \n   - The ending was disappointing and felt rushed. The treatment of Catriona’s character arc was particularly unsatisfying. Despite her being portrayed as an awful character, the lack of closure or exploration of her experience in the present day felt inconsistent with the series’ themes of investigation, science, and empathy.  \n\n- **Overall Engagement and Series Continuation:**  \n   - For the first time, I found myself not attached to the characters and even annoyed by Mallory.  \n   - I’m unsure if I’ll continue with this series. I think I’ll stick with Haven’s Rock instead.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I’ve enjoyed Kelley Armstrong’s previous works and the first two books in this series, this third installment fell short. The lack of character development, repetitive dialogue, and unsatisfying ending left me disappointed. The series’ earlier charm and depth were missing, making it hard to stay invested.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I loved the idea of a murder occurring during such an event and appreciated the historical aspects of the story.  \n\n- **Investigation and Setting:**  \n  The story emphasizes using wits and intelligence to solve crimes without access to modern-day crime-solving technology, which I found intriguing and refreshing.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I enjoyed both Mallory and Dr. Gray as characters and appreciated their working relationship. They collaborate with ease, which made their partnership engaging to follow.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The narrator, Kate Hanford, did an absolutely fantastic job of portraying all the different characters, including handling multiple accents. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the audiobook and felt it added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to Kelley Armstrong, Macmillan Audio, and Minotaur Books for providing the EARC and ALC. The publish date is May 7th, 2024.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Disturbing the Dead\" is a captivating blend of historical and modern crime fiction, with a unique premise and well-developed characters. The audiobook narration enhances the experience, making it a highly enjoyable read (or listen) even for those new to the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I still don't feel deeply invested in them, this book does include a few charming moments that helped me appreciate why some readers support their pairing. I'm pleased that their relationship remains a slow burn; I'm not particularly invested in their romance, but the moments shared in this installment added a nice touch.",

I can’t wait to see how she reacts upon discovering the truth about Mallory. Mallory’s relationships with the other characters are well-developed and distinct, making sense given their personalities. I’m especially intrigued by her evolving dynamic with Mrs. Wallace, who surprised me in this installment.",
            "My main concern is the brief moments in which Mallory conveys her 21st-century sensibilities, particularly regarding museums and stolen artifacts. These instances felt like the author’s personal opinions rather than a natural part of the narrative. While it makes sense for Mallory to hold modern views, these snippets were too brief—just a line or two—and seemed intended to preempt criticism rather than engage with the topics meaningfully.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - I am obsessed and in love with this series. It’s so much fun, and the mysteries are incredibly interesting.  \n   - I almost liked this book more than the first one, though nothing can beat the initial fun of seeing Mallory try to survive in Victorian Edinburgh.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I’m really starting to love the characters, especially Annis. She’s hilarious, and I’m obsessed with her. I can’t wait to see her reaction if she finds out the truth about Mallory.  \n   - Mallory’s relationships with everyone are well-developed, distinct, and make sense given the characters’ personalities. I’m particularly curious about her evolving relationship with Mrs. Wallace, who surprised me in this book.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n   - In my review of the last book, I complained about Mallory and Dr. Grey’s relationship. While I’m still not super invested in them, there were a couple of cute moments in this book that made me understand why people ship them.  \n   - I’m glad their relationship is slow-burn because I don’t care much about them being together, but the moments in this book were a nice touch.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - My only complaint is the inclusion of very brief scenes where Mallory expresses her 21st-century sensibilities (e.g., her views on museums and stolen artifacts). These felt like the author’s personal opinions inserted into the story.  \n   - While it makes sense for Mallory to have modern views, these scenes were too brief (just a line or two) and seemed like the author was trying to preempt criticism rather than explore the topics meaningfully.  \n   - These asides took me out of the story and didn’t encourage deeper thought. The book would have been better if these topics were either explored more deeply or removed entirely.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the minor issue with the brief, jarring social commentary, I absolutely loved this book. The characters, relationships, and mysteries are engaging, and I’m eagerly looking forward to the next installment in May.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This third installment builds on the strengths of its predecessors, showcasing Mallory's growth into a more settled and optimistic character. The author skillfully resolves a lingering question from the beginning, delivering a heartwarming conclusion that leaves me eager for the next installment. \n\nThe narrative centers around a mummy unwrapping event at Sir Alastair Christie’s home, where Mallory and Duncan tragically uncover that the corpse is none other than Sir Alastair himself. Detective Hugh McCreadie promptly takes charge, sending the body to Duncan's lab and questioning various suspects, including a young woman protesting outside the estate. As Mallory and Duncan delve into Sir Alastair's relationships, particularly with his Egyptian brother-in-law and Lord Muir, they navigate a web of danger and intrigue.",
            "In her ongoing journey through 1869 Edinburgh, Mallory, now inhabiting the body of Catriona Mitchell, deepens her connections with Isla, Duncan, and Hugh. She also takes the time to reassure Alice, the young parlourmaid, of her good intentions. However, tension arises from her strained relationship with Mrs. Wallace, the cook, which adds complexity to the household dynamics. Mallory's developing partnership with Duncan stands out, as they collaborate to unravel the mystery together.",
            "The author's writing captivates me, deftly balancing suspense, character development, and historical detail. The pacing is excellent, blending action, mystery, and emotional moments that keep the story thoroughly engaging.",
            "I appreciated the author's inclusion of the Victorian practice of mummy unwrapping as entertainment, a concept I first encountered elsewhere. The novel thoughtfully addresses the disturbing and disrespectful nature of this practice, enriching its historical context.",
            "This novel delves into themes of sexism and societal norms, especially through the experiences of a young woman studying medicine who encounters substantial prejudice. Additionally, the subplot featuring someone documenting Mallory and Duncan's detective escapades in a melodramatic and sexist fashion further critiques gender roles and societal expectations."

            "The plot centers on solving the murder of Sir Alastair Christie and uncovering the mystery of the missing artifacts. However, it fails to deliver the suspense and urgency typically associated with a murder mystery. The pacing is uneven, with some parts dragging due to Mallory's repetitive internal monologues. Additionally, the significance of the artifacts and their relevance to the mystery are not well defined, which undermines the overall tension and engagement.",
            "The main characters—Mallory, Duncan, Ilsa, and McCreadie—are well-developed, likable, and engaging, with their rapid friendship enriching the narrative. Mallory’s dry wit and her refusal to adhere strictly to Victorian norms generate both entertaining and relatable moments.",

            "This novel offers a vivid and meticulously researched portrayal of 1869 Edinburgh, effectively capturing the atmosphere, societal norms, and behavioral constraints of the Victorian era. The author skillfully illustrates the challenges faced by a modern woman like Mallory in this historical context, resulting in amusing and engaging scenarios.",
            "The novel presents several suspects, yet none are thoroughly developed, making it challenging to invest in their motives or actions. Sir Alastair Christie, the victim, lacks depth, diminishing the emotional weight of his murder. While the mystery is intriguing, it ultimately fails to provide the nail-biting suspense characteristic of the genre."

While the novel excels in its richly detailed setting, likable characters, and humorous moments, it falls short in delivering a gripping, suspenseful plot. The pacing and lack of clear stakes in the mystery may leave some readers wanting more. Nonetheless, fans of Victorian-era stories will find much to enjoy.",

Without giving too much away, this part fell short of my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some predictable plot points and a few disappointments, this was a very good book. The series continues to captivate me with its characters, historical context, and intriguing mysteries. I highly recommend it and look forward to the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

            "This story offers a fun and adventurous plot centered around a stolen mummy and a murdered host, seemingly the work of two different culprits. The engaging mystery and excellent pacing keep the reader hooked throughout.",
            "The characters in this book are one of its standout features, particularly the main character, Mallory. Adjusting to life in the Victorian era after hailing from the present day, she is both likable and intelligent, with a refreshing sense of humor. Her evolving relationships with her employers and roommates add depth to the story, as she becomes increasingly involved in investigations. The slow-building romance is a highlight, avoiding the pitfalls of instalove, and the \"will they or won't they\" tension is skillfully executed. I'm confident they will end up together, and I look forward to seeing how their relationship develops.",
            "The author's writing is both engaging and immersive. This book marked my first encounter with her work, and I’m grateful to NetGalley, the author, and the publisher for the opportunity to read and review this ARC.",
            "The book incorporates humorous elements, featuring publications that satirize Mallory and Duncan’s crime-solving escapades. While these pieces credit Duncan, they depict Mallory as a glamorous yet dim-witted sidekick, offering insightful commentary on Victorian gender roles."

        "conclusion": "*Disturbing the Dead* is a fantastic addition to the series. It combines a gripping mystery, well-developed characters, humor, and a slow-burn romance, all set against the intriguing backdrop of the Victorian era. I highly recommend it, especially if you start with Book 1 to fully appreciate Mallory’s journey.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Continuity and Standalone Potential:**  \n   - While *Disturbing the Dead* (Book 3) can be read as a standalone, I highly recommend starting with Book 1 (*A Rip Through Time*). The first book is crucial for understanding Mallory's current predicament, her decision-making, and the dynamics with other characters. Plus, it’s a fantastic series opener.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The characters are one of the best parts of this book and the series as a whole. Mallory, the main character, is particularly compelling. Originally from the present day, she’s adjusting to life in the Victorian era and finding her place. She’s likable, smart, and doesn’t take herself too seriously. Her relationships with her employers/roommates are evolving, and she’s becoming more involved in investigations.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n   - The plot is fun and adventurous, featuring a stolen mummy and a murdered host, seemingly committed by separate perpetrators. The mystery keeps you engaged, and the pacing is excellent.  \n\n- **Humor and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The book includes humorous elements, such as publications mocking Mallory and Duncan’s crime-solving adventures. These publications credit Duncan while portraying Mallory as a sexy but brainless sidekick, adding a layer of social commentary on gender roles in the Victorian era.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - There’s a slow-building romance that I’m enjoying. It’s not instalove, and the “will they or won’t they” tension is well-executed. I’m pretty sure they will, and I’m excited to see how it unfolds.  \n\n- **Writing and Author’s Style:**  \n   - Kelley Armstrong’s writing is engaging and immersive. This book introduced me to her work, and I’m grateful to NetGalley, the author, and the publisher for the opportunity to read and review this ARC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Disturbing the Dead* is a fantastic addition to the *A Rip Through Time* series. It combines a gripping mystery, well-developed characters, humor, and a slow-burn romance, all set against the intriguing backdrop of the Victorian era. I highly recommend it, especially if you start with Book 1 to fully appreciate Mallory’s journey.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The twist is skillfully executed and avoids spoilers, enhancing my reading experience. While *Disturbing the Dead* presents a standalone mystery, it is best enjoyed within the series to fully appreciate Mallory’s journey. The thrilling storyline is filled with red herrings that kept me guessing until the end. The scene featuring a mummy unwrapping party, where a fresh body is discovered instead of an ancient mummy, is particularly gripping. Additionally, the historical elements—like the Victorian fascination with death and mummy unwrapping—add depth and intrigue to the narrative.",

Dr. Duncan Gray, the undertaker and medical examiner, is kind, intelligent, and stoic. The supporting characters, including Isla (Gray’s sister) and Detective Hugh McCreadie, add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is intriguing, with a murder mystery involving a mummy unwrapping party that takes a dark turn when the host goes missing and the mummy is revealed to be a modern-day murder victim. The story moves at a steady pace, keeping me engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The book includes many humorous moments that added to my enjoyment. Mallory’s snarky personality and the interactions between characters provided a lighthearted balance to the darker themes.  \n\n- **Writing and Narration:**  \n  The writing is excellent, and the narration by Kate Handford is superb, enhancing the overall experience.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  The cover is visually appealing and well-designed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Disturbing the Dead\" is a captivating blend of time travel, historical fiction, and murder mystery. With its engaging plot, well-developed characters, and humorous moments, it’s a highly enjoyable read. I look forward to exploring more books in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Characters: 5/5  \n- Writing: 5/5  \n- Plot: 4/5  \n- Pacing: 4/5  \n- Unputdownability: 4/5  \n- Enjoyment: 5/5  \n- Narration: 5/5  \n- Cover: 5/5  \n- Overall: 4.6/5"

I can see a slow-burn relationship brewing between them, but it feels like it’s been dragging on for three books now.  \n\n- **World-Building and Research:**  \n  The characters, the setting, and the imagination behind this story are phenomenal. The author’s research to create such a detailed and immersive world, blending what was and wasn’t known at the time with Egyptian history, is truly impressive.  \n\n- **Plot and Tone:**  \n  I loved the story and the intrigue, especially with the comical quips from the characters as Mallory and Duncan worked to solve the Mummy Murder.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  Kate Handford did an incredible job narrating the audiobook, capturing all the characters and their accents perfectly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite starting the series on Book 3 and feeling a bit lost, I thoroughly enjoyed the story, characters, and world-building. The slow-burn relationship between Mallory and Duncan could use more development, but the overall intrigue, humor, and narration made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

I've been a fan of Kelley Armstrong since middle school, starting with her Darkest Powers series, and recently rediscovered her works as an adult with the A Stitch in Time series.\n\n- **Genre and Setting:**\n   - A Rip Through Time is a Victorian time slip mystery, distinct from A Stitch in Time, which is more of a gothic time slip romance. Disturbing the Dead continues the story of modern-day Canadian detective Mallory Atkinson, who slips through time and wakes up in Victorian Scotland in the body of grifter-turned-housemaid Catriona Mitchell, alongside her boss, consulting detective, doctor, and undertaker Duncan Gray.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**\n   - The novel revolves around solving the murder of an Egyptologist whose remains are disguised in the wrappings of a mummy and unveiled in front of a crowd of the rich and privileged. The mystery is engaging and well-crafted.\n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Social Commentary:**\n   - I appreciate Armstrong's historical accuracy regarding the differences in gender roles, race, and class during the Victorian era. The use of her characters to condemn these societal issues is commendable.\n\n- **Character Relationships and Development:**\n   - While I like the focus on the mystery and character relationships over romance, the slow burn is extremely slow. I had hoped Mallory's brief return to modern day would spur some progression in her relationships, but it did not. \n   - Mallory's return to her own body was somewhat glossed over in favor of the big mystery, which I felt was a missed opportunity for more character and relationship development.\n\n- **Anticipation for Future Installments:**\n   - I am eagerly awaiting the next book in the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDisturbing the Dead is a compelling addition to Kelley Armstrong's series, blending historical accuracy with a gripping mystery.

It’s *Outlander* meets *The Alienist* – part historical fiction, part mystery, part romance, part sci-fi. It’s genre-bending in the best way, and I’ve never read anything like it.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  Book 3 brings us back to 19th-century Edinburgh and delivers murder, mayhem, and mummies. While the first two books focus on world-building and developing Mallory’s professional life in the 19th century, this installment delves deeper into her personal life and strengthens her relationship with the Gray family.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Impact:**  \n  I didn’t think I could love this series any more than I did coming into this book, but I do. I always feel a little devastated when finishing a new book in this series, but this one was especially tough because I’m more invested than ever in the characters and their world.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The narrator, Kate Handford, is PERFECT for Mallory. Although she’s narrated many other books, I’ve only ever listened to her perform this series, so in my head, she IS Mallory. She does a wonderful job of bringing this story to life, and I highly recommend picking up an audio copy of this one.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Installments:**  \n  I CANNOT WAIT for book 4.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my already high expectations for the series. It masterfully blends genres, deepens character relationships, and immerses readers in a richly detailed 19th-century Edinburgh. The emotional investment in the characters and world is stronger than ever, and the audiobook narration elevates the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

Mallory Mitchell, a time-traveling Vancouver detective who now inhabits the body of a 20-year-old housemaid, collaborates with her physician/undertaker boss, Duncan, and his chemist sister, Isla, to solve the murder of an Egyptologist. The plot blends mystery, adventure, and humor, as Mallory and Duncan navigate underground tunnels and bustling markets filled with costumed characters. The story maintains a strong pace, skillfully intertwining elements of intrigue and excitement. However, the narrative stumbles when Mallory returns to her own timeline to visit her dying grandmother; the rationale behind these timeline shifts feels forced and disrupts the overall flow.",

Mallory Mitchell, a time-traveling Vancouver detective now inhabiting the body of a 20-year-old housemaid, teams up with her physician/undertaker boss, Duncan, and his chemist sister, Isla, to solve the murder of an Egyptologist. The plot involves a mix of mystery, adventure, and humor, with Mallory and Duncan exploring underground tunnels and markets filled with people dressed as magical creatures.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Mallory remains a compelling protagonist, balancing her modern detective skills with her life in 19th-century Edinburgh. Duncan and Isla continue to be strong supporting characters, adding depth to the story. The interactions between the characters are enjoyable and contribute to the overall charm of the book.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The setting of 19th-century Edinburgh is vividly portrayed, with its underground markets and tunnels adding a unique and immersive atmosphere. The blend of historical elements with fantastical touches, such as people dressed as magical creatures, enhances the story's appeal.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story maintains a good pace, keeping the reader engaged with its mix of mystery and adventure.

The mysteries are engaging, and the \"fish out of water\" experience of the time travelers resonates with me.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Romance:**  \n  I thought this might be the last installment, but I’m not so sure now, as the romance has not progressed at all (for obvious reasons). Despite this, I will continue reading the series, even though the books do drag a bit at times.  \n\n- **Narration and Format:**  \n  The audio version worked better for me, as it is easier to follow through if I lose interest for a moment.  \n\n- **Character Authenticity and Realism:**  \n  All the main characters are \"too good to be true,\" but I don’t mind. I wish people were better in real life. I don’t need my books to represent reality in every way. If the characters and their inner workings seem genuine to me, that is usually enough to make me believe in them.  \n\n- **Setting and Descriptions:**  \n  The descriptions of Edinburgh have improved, probably because the author was able to visit the city herself. She couldn’t do so for the first book due to the pandemic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoy the series for its engaging characters, mysteries, and the unique perspective of time travelers. While the plot can feel slow at times and the romance hasn’t progressed as expected, the authenticity of the characters and the improved setting descriptions keep me invested. The audio format also enhances my reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Mallory’s expertise in modern police practices and forensic science seamlessly complements Duncan's work, making her role as his assistant both credible and engaging. The main character, Mallory, is a contemporary police detective who is thrust into Victorian Scotland after a near-fatal encounter with a stalker. She inhabits the body of Catriona, a housemaid with a vastly different personality. This intriguing premise allows for a captivating exploration of Mallory’s adaptation to the 1890s, and I found her growth particularly compelling as she adjusts throughout the narrative.",

This book seemed like an excellent opportunity to reconnect with her writing, even though I had to break my personal rule about always starting a series with the first book. I was not disappointed.\n\n- **Main Character and Setting:**  \n  The main character, Mallory, is a modern police detective who finds herself in Victorian Scotland after a stalker almost kills her. She inhabits the body of Catriona, a housemaid with a very different personality. This unique premise was intriguing, and I found Mallory's adaptation to the 1890s fascinating, especially since she has largely adjusted by this volume.\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The supporting characters, particularly Dr. Duncan Gray, an undertaker/medical examiner, and his eccentric, forward-thinking family, added depth to the story. Mallory's modern knowledge of police practices and forensic science complements Duncan's work, making her role as his assistant both believable and engaging.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot involving a mummy and Egyptian artifacts was a bit convoluted, but it worked overall. While the complexity of the storyline was noticeable, it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.\n\n- **Series Continuity and Interest:**  \n  I can't help but wonder how well Mallory coped with adjusting to the 1890s in the first two books, but her adaptation in this volume felt natural. The story has piqued my interest enough that I definitely intend to pick up the earlier entries in the series and add them to my to-be-read stack.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful return to Kelley Armstrong's storytelling. The unique premise, engaging characters, and intriguing plot made it a worthwhile read, despite some complexity in the storyline.

            "This novel offers an interesting twist on time travel, as protagonist Mallory Atkinson finds herself 150 years in the past, inhabiting the body of a housemaid named Catriona Mitchell. The plot centers on a murder mystery that involves a mummy and a stolen artifact, as Mallory teams up with Duncan Gray to play amateur detectives. While the whodunit elements feel routine and lead to a predictable resolution akin to a \"Moonlighting\" episode, the exploration of the missing mummy and its possible medicinal properties is much more captivating.",
            "Mallory Atkinson, a contemporary police detective, serves as the witty and insightful narrator, offering sharp commentary on the cultural and scientific contrasts between 1869 and 2019. Her partner, Duncan Gray, is a charming amateur detective reminiscent of a famous literary consulting sleuth. The supporting characters, including the unconventional Queen Mab and the pioneering women admitted to medical school, enrich the narrative and add depth to the story.",

            "The plot unfolds at a steady pace, balancing story progression with character development effectively. It features numerous unexpected twists that keep the reader engaged. However, this installment lacks some of the intensity found in previous books, particularly the tension between Mallory and Duncan and the hardships of Victorian England, which diminishes the stakes and excitement. The ending is notably disappointing, especially regarding Catriona's character and the themes of women's rights and redemption. Additionally, the resolution of the letter/time subplot feels unsatisfying and inconsistent with the established themes.",
            "Mallory is a captivating character, grappling daily with the challenge of suppressing her modern knowledge to prevent altering the timeline. Her internal conflict over whom to trust with her secret adds depth to her character. The supporting cast, notably the housekeeper, is well-developed and enhances the intrigue as more secrets unfold.",

            "The novel's premise is captivating, featuring Mallory, a character who occupies a 19th-century body while retaining her modern knowledge. Her struggle to blend into a historical setting without revealing her true identity adds significant depth to the story. The combination of a murder mystery with this intriguing concept kept me engaged from the very start."

        "conclusion": "While *Disturbing the Dead* is an interesting addition and continues to develop compelling themes, it falls short in maintaining the tension and stakes that made earlier works so engaging. The ending, in particular, was a letdown, and some aspects of the plot felt underdeveloped. Despite these flaws, the book still offers enough intrigue and character development to keep me invested.",

This development adds depth to the story and keeps readers engaged. The ending introduces yet another surprise, setting the stage for intriguing possibilities in future installments. The novel begins with a shocking turn at a mummy unwrapping event, where Mallory, Duncan Gray, and Isla stumble upon a fresh corpse instead of an ancient mummy, effectively launching a gripping murder mystery. Additionally, a subplot involving serial pamphlets portrays Duncan as a master detective and Mallory as his less intelligent assistant, enriching the narrative. The mystery is intricately crafted, keeping me guessing until the very end about the murderer, the connections between the incidents, and the ultimate resolution.",
            "Mallory Atkinson shines as a standout character with her humor and snark, offering a refreshing perspective as a 21st-century woman in Victorian Scotland. The charming responses of Duncan Gray to Mallory enhance their dynamic, making it a highlight of the story. Annis, Duncan and Isla’s older sister, adds to the enjoyment with her unapologetic wit and humor; her interactions with Mallory are especially entertaining, and I look forward to seeing more of her in future installments.",
            "The Victorian Scotland setting is vividly rendered, with Mallory often pondering historical events and questioning whether they lie in the past or future. This reflection enriches the story's time-travel theme. Additionally, the Goblin Market scene serves as an engaging nod to historical and literary influences, reminding readers of T. Kingfisher’s work and Christina Rossetti’s poetry."

            "The premise of a fresh body enveloped in mummified remains is captivating, yet the story ultimately falls short. The time jump subplot—Mallory's return to her old body—suffers from numerous flaws, including gaps in world-building and unresolved questions that undermine its coherence. Key issues include the grandmother’s mysterious supernatural abilities and time travel knowledge, the inconsistency of Mallory's visibility into the veil in contemporary times versus 1869, the mechanics behind her waking up in her modern body after being strangled in the tunnels, and the absence of the real Catorina and her unexplained fate.",
            "Mallory's family’s immediate and uncritical acceptance of her story seems unrealistic and misses an opportunity for emotional depth and tension. The potential for internal conflict in Mallory’s return to modern times is also underexplored; for instance, her struggle to rekindle past relationships while navigating Catorina’s actions could have added significant depth. Additionally, Gray and Mallory’s relationship lacks development, particularly following the promising conclusion of Book 2. Their interactions feel stagnant, with more lively banter occurring between Mallory and McCreadie than with Gray. The absence of intimate conversations and romantic progression makes their relationship feel regressive and ultimately unsatisfying.",

However, the detective work and everything else surrounding the story were still good to read. This is really just a matter of preference and doesn’t determine how good the book is.  \n\n- **Romantic Development (Slow Burn):**  \n   - I’m starting to get a little frustrated with Mallory and Duncan’s “romance.” We know it’s going to happen; everyone in the story knows it’s going to happen, and yet I’m not sure these two have even hugged. I’m not expecting them to jump into bed together, but I would really like for there to be a little more honest and open conversation between them about how they’re feeling.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Research:**  \n   - Armstrong really does her research. I imagine everything from the mummy unwrapping party to the underground market is historically accurate. The Edinburgh Seven are real, and they were nicely woven into the story.  \n\n- **Plot Twist:**  \n   - I *really* didn’t expect that twist about two-thirds of the way through, and I truly loved that Armstrong went there.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the subject matter of mummies didn’t captivate me as much as previous books in the series, the detective work, historical accuracy, and unexpected plot twist kept me engaged.

While the mechanics of her journey aren’t the center of attention, this resolution offers satisfying closure, allowing the series to progress without the constant anxiety of her disappearing or Catriona reclaiming her body.",
            "Mallory's 21st-century sensibilities are the story's strength, as she guides us through a critical lens on Victorian culture, prompting us to confront its problematic aspects rather than ignore them.

I'm eager to see where the story leads next and hope it continues for a long time to come.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Accessibility:**  \n  I'm the kind of person who can't jump into the middle of a series, so when I received this audiobook through NetGalley, I immediately went back to the beginning and started with *A Rip Through Time*.  \n\n- **Premise and Initial Skepticism:**  \n  I was skeptical at first—the premise seemed like something that could go in some troubling directions. However, as I kept going, I realized that if you take the *Emperor's New Groove* approach of not worrying about the logistics, it's a great ride.  \n\n- **Character Perspective and Sensibilities:**  \n  Mallory's 21st-century sensibilities are the key to the story. By making her our guide, we're not asked to ignore or excuse problematic aspects of Victorian culture, nor are we expected to forget everything we know about science and history that has occurred since then.  \n\n- **Plot Convenience and Acknowledgment:**  \n  Is it incredibly convenient that Mallory got dropped into a household positioned to believe her story and put her professional skills to use? Yes. Does the author acknowledge that? Also yes. This acknowledgment allows us to move past questioning the logistics and focus on the mystery.  \n\n- **Mystery and Themes:**  \n  The mystery is a good one, involving questions still being resolved today, such as the white gaze on Egyptian history, \"nice guys\" and their treatment of women, and a good old-fashioned underground tunnel system.  \n\n- **Closure and Series Continuation:**  \n  This is also the book where Mallory makes it back to 2019. While the mechanics of how it works aren't the focus, it provides a nice amount of closure, allowing the series to continue without constant worry about her disappearing or Catriona repossessing her body.  \n\n- **Character Development and Future Potential:**  \n  Each book adds more characters to the colorful cast (learning that Jack will be more central to future installments is a lovely touch at the end) and builds our map of Mallory's Edinburgh. I can't wait to see where the series goes from here and hope it continues long into the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *A Rip Through Time* is a compelling and well-crafted story that balances historical intrigue with modern sensibilities. The author's acknowledgment of plot conveniences and the satisfying closure provided make it an enjoyable read, and I’m excited to see how the series evolves.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book effectively answers the central question of Mallory's existence in Victorian Scotland, exploring the fate of her past life and her role in this new era. The conclusion is satisfying. The story follows the dynamic crime-fighting team of Mallory, Lord Gray, and Ina as they investigate the murder of Sir Alastair Christie, an Egyptologist discovered dead in his home, swathed like a mummy. The added complexity of a missing ancient mummy raises intriguing questions: was the motive personal revenge or a greedy attempt to profit from the black market? The mystery is captivating, culminating in a rewarding twist.",
            "Mallory, a 21st-century Canadian detective stranded in Victorian Edinburgh, remains a standout investigator despite her contributions often being overlooked due to her perceived naivety and gender. The interplay between Mallory, Lord Gray, and Ina is both entertaining and engaging. Queen Mab, an underground herbalist and one of the most memorable characters, plays a crucial role in this installment.",
            "One particularly entertaining aspect is Mallory's realization that an anonymous writer is dramatizing her crime-fighting escapades, depicting her as a naive and overly emotional young woman. This introduces a delightful layer of humor and self-awareness to the narrative."

            "The story opens with Mallory at a Victorian mummy unwrapping party that quickly descends into chaos when a fresh body is found. This discovery sparks a thrilling chase for both mummy parts and a murderer in the depths of Edinburgh. The setting immerses readers in the city's dark underbelly, particularly the black market hidden beneath South Bridge, while also delving into the historical context surrounding the first women admitted to the University of Edinburgh.",

            "This book is the third installment in the author's *A Rip Through Time* series, featuring Mallory Atkinson, a modern police detective transported back to 1869 Edinburgh into the body of housemaid Catriona. The narrative follows Mallory and Dr. Duncan Gray as they solve murders, skillfully blending contemporary policing techniques with Victorian investigative methods. The central mystery centers on the murder of Sir Alistair, an Egyptologist, at a mummy unwrapping party. Drawing inspiration from classic detective narratives, Mallory plays the role of Duncan's sidekick, though she bristles at the comparison. The mystery is engaging, filled with red herrings that keep readers guessing the identity of the murderer. While the story drags slightly in the middle, it ultimately concludes with a strong and satisfying finish.",
            "Mallory/Catriona serves as a compelling protagonist, skillfully employing her modern detective abilities within a historical context. In contrast, Duncan Gray embodies a reluctant Sherlock Holmes, uneasy with the media attention directed toward him and Mallory. The presence of a few characters who recognize Mallory's true identity and accept her story enriches the narrative's interpersonal dynamics."

However, the narrative tends to meander, often veering off on tangents and relying on coincidences that come across as contrived.

When she unexpectedly returns to the 21st century, her family persuades her to go back, believing she loves it there. However, this resolution feels emotionally flat and unrealistic, as her family assures her they will manage without ever seeing her again.",

However, the heroes, while subtly protesting, do not share this viewpoint and attend the party. This moral perspective feels anachronistic, as it's doubtful that many Victorians would have held similar beliefs, although Mallory might.",

However, the cool factor fades when you think about it for more than two minutes, and the concept ultimately doesn’t make sense.  \n   - There wasn’t any sense of tension, and the plot felt like it was running on rails.  \n\n- **Character Development and Setting:**  \n   - Mallory is so nicely settled into Victorian Scotland that there isn’t a lot of interest in that regard.  \n   - When Mallory unexpectedly returns to the 21st century, her family convinces her to go back to Victorian Scotland because she clearly loves it there. This resolution felt emotionally flat and unrealistic, as her family claims they’ll be fine without ever seeing her again.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n   - The author goes to great lengths to emphasize her disapproval of mummies being taken from their places of origin and the need for repatriation. However, the heroes don’t agree with this stance and attend the party under mild invisible protest.  \n   - This moral stance feels anachronistic, as it’s unlikely many Victorians would have thought this way, though Mallory might.  \n\n- **Plot Execution and Resolution:**  \n   - The plot wraps up incredibly neatly, which made the book feel low on energy and high on tidiness.  \n   - The lack of emotional depth and the overly tidy resolution left me feeling unsatisfied.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the murder mystery had potential, the execution fell flat due to a lack of tension, emotional depth, and believable character motivations.

The investigation takes them into the underground market for body parts, the lives of seven women admitted to medical school, and the world of broadsheet publishing. While the plot is not fast-paced, it is rewarding and educational.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Mallory, an American detective time-traveled into the body of a Victorian housemaid, and Dr. Duncan Gray, a physician and detective, are the central characters. Their dynamic, along with Hugh McCreadie, drives the story. Duncan's sisters and the household, which have been a highlight of the series, play minor roles this time, mostly for atmosphere, though the housekeeper is key to one part of the plot. The Christie family's children, initially important, fade from the narrative once the investigation progresses.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  This is the third book in the series. Readers familiar with the earlier books will find it more rewarding, but it also works well as a standalone.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  The novel is rich in historical detail and explores themes like the underground trade of body parts and the challenges faced by women in medical school. The writing is immersive and educational, making it a satisfying read despite its slower pace.  \n\n- **Surprises and Spoilers:**  \n  The story includes a surprise element, which the reviewer avoids spoiling, adding to the enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis installment in the series is a rewarding and educational read, with a well-crafted mystery and rich historical detail. While some beloved characters take a backseat, the central investigation and the surprise twist make it highly enjoyable.

While I understand its importance to the overarching story, I wish it had been executed more effectively. I'm eager to see where the narrative goes next. I hope the slow progression of Duncan and Mallory's romance picks up in the fourth book; if you're expecting significant changes in this installment, you might be disappointed. On a positive note, I enjoyed the mystery in this book the most so far. Themes of Egyptology, black markets, and suffragettes come into play, and the return of characters from the previous book is well done."

Egyptology, black markets, and suffragettes all play their part in this one, and characters introduced in the last book make really great comebacks.  \n\n- **Execution of a Key Plot Point:**  \n  I honestly would have given this book a higher rating if it weren't for a specific plot point that happens around 70% of the way through the book. I don't want to spoil anything, since this book has yet to be released, but, wow, was it clunky. I get why it happened, because it is a major plot issue, but damn do I wish it was done a lot better.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot and Pacing:**  \n  I am excited to see where this series goes next. Hopefully, the glacial pace of Duncan and Mallory's potential romance will start picking up speed in book 4, but if you are hoping to see big changes in this one, well, you will sadly have to keep waiting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book is a solid addition to the series, with an engaging mystery and interesting historical elements. However, a poorly executed plot point and slow romantic development hold it back from being a higher-rated read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars out of 5."

However, it became clear that there would be no romance, and Mallory's predicament was resolved too neatly, which diminished my interest.  \n\n- **Genre and Plot Focus:**  \n  I don’t typically enjoy crime/murder mystery novels because I’m more invested in the main characters and their personal stories rather than a large cast of unfamiliar characters. The murder mystery in Book 3 was only okay, and I ended up skimming through most of it.  \n\n- **Time Travel Aspect:**  \n  The time traveler aspect is interesting, but the focus is always on criminal investigations, which doesn’t align with my preferences.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Resolution:**  \n  I was surprised by the change in events halfway through the book, but the resolution felt unrealistic and contrived, especially in how it tied up Mallory’s history. I couldn’t accept it.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Connection:**  \n  I’ve realized that I don’t actually like Mallory as a character. She avoids intense emotions, which makes it hard for me to connect with her emotionally. Even when we’re told she cried, it’s quickly brushed past, leaving me feeling nothing. Additionally, her overly polite and politically correct demeanor, along with Gray’s flawless portrayal, became annoying. Their frequent banter also started to feel irksome.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Series Fatigue:**  \n  While I initially found the series heartwarming and enjoyable, I’ve grown bored with it. My opinion of the series has declined, and I’m unsure if I’ll continue with the next book. I’m looking for a more interesting story and main character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMy interest in this series has significantly waned. While I appreciated the initial premise and found the earlier books enjoyable, the lack of romance, unrealistic resolutions, and unrelatable characters have left me feeling disconnected and bored. I’m unsure if I’ll continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The opening scene of a mummy unwrapping party is engaging and effectively sets the tone for the story. It introduces a compelling twist that delves into Mallory's emotions surrounding her lost life. However, the ending is somewhat disappointing. I anticipated a significant twist that never arrived, and the resolution feels overly convenient, with the guilty parties confessing while the detective eavesdrops from the shadows.",
            "Mallory's humor shines throughout the story, bringing charm to her character. The dynamic between her and Dr. Duncan Gray is compelling, effectively driving the narrative forward.",
            "The writing has improved significantly from previous installments, with the author showcasing greater confidence and providing richer details. However, while the dialogue remains humorous and true to Mallory's character, it can occasionally feel too literal, particularly in procedural scenes that may drag on due to an overemphasis on sleuthing details.",
            "The latest novel masterfully weaves together crime, historical fiction, time travel, and romance. It follows Mallory, a modern-day detective in her 30s, who finds herself transported to Victorian Scotland in the body of a young housemaid. As she aids a doctor in solving murders through autopsies and investigations, the story unfolds with intrigue. Despite some flaws, the book is an enjoyable read, and I eagerly anticipate the next installment."

        "conclusion": "The latest *Rip in Time* novel delivers a strong blend of genres, improved writing, and engaging characters, though it stumbles slightly with procedural pacing and an underwhelming ending. Fans will likely appreciate the continued development of Mallory’s story and look forward to what comes next.",

The story includes a nice twist that explores Mallory’s feelings about the life she has lost. However, the ending feels underwhelming. I expected a twist that never materialized, and the resolution feels too convenient, with the guilty parties confessing everything while the detective listens from the shadows.  \n\n- **Characterization and Humor:**  \n  Mallory’s humor remains a highlight, adding charm to her character.

The inclusion of stories about Mallory and Dr. Gray added depth, and while the resolution of events in the present was satisfying, the one-way communication felt like a missed opportunity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It’s not a genre I typically read, but I found it engaging and unique.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  This is the third book in a series, but I didn’t realize that when I started reading. Despite this, I believe it can be enjoyed as a standalone, as the book provides enough background on Mallory’s history.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows Mallory, who has been sent back in time from 2019 to 1869. She’s unsure how she got there but ends up assisting Dr. Gray in solving crimes without the aid of modern technology. The premise is intriguing and adds a fresh twist to the traditional whodunit format.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Style:**  \n  I found the book to be a really fun and enjoyable read. The blend of mystery, time travel, and historical elements kept me entertained throughout.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for providing the ARC (Advanced Reader Copy).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Victorian-era murder mystery with a time-travel twist was a delightful and engaging read, even for someone who doesn’t typically gravitate toward this genre. The standalone nature of the story and the unique premise made it an enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

While this third book is not as good as the first, it is better than the second. I would rate it a 3.5 instead of a 4.\n\n- **Plot Development and Character Arc:**  \n  I appreciated that Mallory went back to her own time and found some answers about what was happening there. However, I was intrigued by her return to Victorian Scotland. This back-and-forth in time added an interesting layer to the story.\n\n- **Future Expectations:**  \n  I’m curious to see how the idea of time travel and the shifting between timelines will be explored in the next book, if at all.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was an enjoyable read, though not as strong as the first in the series. The time travel elements and Mallory’s journey kept me engaged, and I’m looking forward to seeing where the story goes next.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

I’m excited and anxious for them to finally admit their true feelings.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n   - This series is truly the best! If you love time travel, the Victorian Era, a well-crafted police procedural, and a slow-burn romance, this is the series for you. It combines the best of all these elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Disturbing the Dead* is a fantastic addition to the *A Rip Through Time* series, blending humor, mystery, and character development seamlessly. The engaging plot, dynamic relationships, and unexpected twists make it a must-read. I highly recommend it and can’t wait for the next installment!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a 5/5 or highly positive rating."

Fans of the author will commend the consistent tone, intricate world-building, and character development present throughout. It comes highly recommended for those who enjoy complex plots, captivating characters, and a unique take on historical fiction."

Now that Catriona has moved into a new body and time, I hope we see more romantic development between Duncan and Mallory. I understand why this wasn't explored before; Mallory didn't have the agency to make choices in her previous body. However, now that she does, I’m eager for progress. As someone who isn’t fond of slow burns, I find it frustrating that after three books of mutual care and desire, their romance has yet to evolve.",
