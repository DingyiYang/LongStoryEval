            "Ember is a complex character who resorts to lies to secure a job, evade embarrassment, and even deceive herself. Her choice to uncheck the American Indian race box on job applications and embellish her qualifications highlights her struggles and determination. The story delves into her pride and \"pull yourself up by the bootstraps\" mentality, revealing both its strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, her impatience with her younger brother's mistakes adds further depth to her character."

Ember’s journey is both relatable and inspiring, while Danuwoa adds depth and charm to the romance. The story’s nuanced portrayal of Native life and its critique of cultural appropriation make it a must-read for both Native and non-Native audiences.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Representation of Native Women in Romance:**  \n  - The novel does an excellent job of representing Native women, particularly through the character of Ember, who is Chickasaw/Choctaw and enrolled Chickasaw.  \n  - As a Native woman (Cherokee) from Oklahoma, I deeply appreciated the authentic portrayal of life in Oklahoma and the inclusion of cultural elements like frybread cooking, the Miss Indian Oklahoma pageant, and the use of Native languages.  \n  - The story also addresses the issue of \"Pretendians\" (people falsely claiming Native identity), which adds a layer of authenticity and relatability for Native readers.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ember):**  \n  - Ember is a compelling character who lies to get a job, avoid embarrassment, and even to herself. Her decision to untick the American Indian race box on job applications and stretch the truth about her qualifications reflects her struggles and determination.  \n  - The story explores her pride and \"pull yourself up by the bootstraps\" mentality, showing both its strengths and flaws. Her impatience with her little brother’s mistakes adds depth to her character.  \n\n- **Romantic Interest (Danuwoa):**  \n  - Danuwoa, the IT guy and Cherokee love interest, is a refreshing and well-rounded character. He is not only attractive but also deeply caring, with a strong sense of family and a love for cats.  \n  - His portrayal as a \"sexy shirtless Native\" who isn’t a stereotype (like Jacob Black) is a welcome addition to the romance genre.  \n\n- **Cultural Authenticity and Nuance:**  \n  - The novel is rich in cultural details, from the inclusion of Native languages to the critique of cultural appropriation (e.g., the \"spiritual guide\" who falsely claims Native identity).  \n  - These elements make the story deeply meaningful for Native readers while also offering non-Native readers an opportunity to learn and appreciate Native culture.  \n\n- **Author Representation:**  \n  - I am thrilled to see a Chickasaw author published by a major publisher, as this is a significant step toward greater representation in the literary world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Truth According to Ember* is a groundbreaking novel that excels in its representation of Native women, cultural authenticity, and character development. Ember’s journey is both relatable and inspiring, while Danuwoa adds depth and charm to the romance. The story’s nuanced portrayal of Native life and its critique of cultural appropriation make it a must-read for both Native and non-Native audiences.

I’m so glad it did not disappoint.  \n\n- **Familial Relationships:**  \n  The portrayal of familial relationships was very well done, in my opinion. I enjoyed the nuance, especially with Sage, Ember’s younger brother, who caused trouble but ultimately showed the depth of sibling love. The same goes for Danuwoa and his sister—great representation and such lovely characters.  \n\n- **Workplace Environment:**  \n  The workplace environment gave me strong *The Office* vibes. It felt like a mix of annoying coworkers full of microaggressions but also a fun little space with the right people. I enjoyed it, though I think that’s where the main issue lies (looking at you, Gary & Kyle).  \n\n- **Main Character (Ember):**  \n  Ember was an interesting character! I would get nervous as she piled up her lies, but her determination, development, and kindness really made me see her as the wonderful female main character (FMC) she was.  \n\n- **Male Lead (Danuwoa):**  \n  Danuwoa was a great male lead—yup! The nickname Joanna gives him felt very real. He’s caring, silly, and attractive.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was 🥰🥰🤌🤌. As someone who usually avoids steamy scenes, I still felt the story, tension, and love were very much complete without relying on that element.

            "The protagonist's chronic lying made it challenging for me to fully connect with her as a female main character. While her motivations were understandable and seemingly harmless, the sheer volume of her deceit detracted from my enjoyment of the story. However, I truly appreciated that the narrative centered on an Indigenous couple, a rarity in literature. The author’s note at the end emphasized this lack of representation, which was an eye-opener for me as a white reader. The setting in Oklahoma, particularly in OKC and the community college I attended, added a personal touch that I found delightful. The story's exploration of the limited opportunities available to Indigenous people was both powerful and heartbreaking. Witnessing the protagonist's struggle for basic, entry-level opportunities was inspiring, yet it also underscored the systemic barriers that Native Americans continue to face today.",

            "Ember is intelligent and ambitious, but her education was interrupted by the need to support her family. Identifying as indigenous on job applications hasn't yielded any interviews, prompting her to take drastic measures. She embellishes her credentials by misrepresenting a few accounting classes as a degree and claims to be Caucasian—an identity she partially holds. Is it truly a lie? After successfully faking her way through the interview process, she lands an accounting job, where she encounters a captivating indigenous IT guy. While the romance plays a significant role in the story, the narrative primarily delves into Ember's experiences as she navigates her new workplace.",

            "I’m thrilled this book exists! We need more Native stories, especially in the romance genre. The book's exploration of racism, microaggressions, and the ongoing mistreatment of Indigenous Americans by some in society and corporate America is its greatest strength. Ember, the protagonist, lies about nearly everything in her life, and while some readers may enjoy following a character whose little white lies spiral into a complex web, I found it quite stressful. Ember's initial lies are understandable; everyone embellishes their resume, and given her struggles to find a job, can we really blame her for exploiting biases and identifying as white on applications? Despite her growing deception, Ember is a good person who simply wants to be seen differently. She is fiercely loyal, principled, funny, sassy, and smart.",
            "I enjoyed *The Truth According to Ember*, but unfortunately, I didn't love it as much as I had hoped. That said, it's not a bad read! It was often entertaining to watch Ember navigate her way out of the predicaments she created, though it was more of a \"thank goodness that's not me!\" kind of fun, which added a layer of tension.",

While I didn’t love it as much as I hoped, I appreciated its exploration of Native stories and the complexities of Ember’s character. It’s a funny, thought-provoking, and heartfelt read that balances steamy romance with meaningful themes.",

We NEED more Native stories, especially in the romance genre.  \n   - The book’s exploration of racism, microaggressions, outward aggressions, and how Indigenous Americans are still treated as less than by some people in society and corporate America is its biggest strength.  \n\n- **Humor and Writing Style:**  \n   - This book is laugh-out-loud funny. Nava clearly has a vibrant sense of humor and utilizes it to the max here. I laughed throughout this story!  \n\n- **Character Development (Ember):**  \n   - Ember lies about literally *everything* going on in her life or anything having to do with her, even tangentially.  \n   - Some people will enjoy reading about a character who can't tell the truth to save her life, watching how little white lies snowball and become her entire personality, but I felt pretty stressed the entire time I read this book.  \n   - Ember's first lies are completely justified. Everyone lies on their resume, everyone beefs up their qualifications, and since she was not getting any snags on her resume and needed a job to better her situation, can anyone blame her for exploiting racists and clicking \"white\" on her job applications?  \n   - Despite her mounting lies, Ember is a good person who just wants people to look at her differently. She is fiercely loyal, fastidious in her beliefs, funny, sassy, and smart.  \n\n- **Romance (Ember and Danuwoa):**  \n   - The romance between Ember and the equally sweet, kind, and cute Danuwoa is a slow, slow, sloooooow burning office romance I enjoyed exploring.  \n   - There is a good balance of steamy, sweet, and important moments here.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - I liked \"The Truth According to Ember\" by Danica Nava, but sadly, I didn't LOVE love it like I hoped I would. That doesn't mean it's bad, though!  \n   - It was frequently fun to see how Ember would dig herself out of the next hole she dug herself in, but fun in a \"wow, I am glad that's not me!\" kind of way, which is still nerve-wracking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"The Truth According to Ember\" is a strong debut by Danica Nava, blending humor, important social commentary, and a slow-burn romance. While I didn’t love it as much as I hoped, I appreciated its exploration of Native stories and the complexities of Ember’s character. It’s a funny, thought-provoking, and heartfelt read that balances steamy romance with meaningful themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars.  \n\n*Thank you to NetGalley, Danica Nava, and Berkley Publishing Group for the complimentary ARC of this book. All opinions are my own. I was not compensated for this review.*"

She was heavily parentified as a child, which led to her reluctance to ask for help and her need to handle things independently. Her experiences with microaggressions and outright racism as a Native American further explain her tendency to lie to secure stability and financial flexibility. While her lies come back to haunt her, I don’t blame her for resorting to such measures given her circumstances.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics (Ember and Danuwoa):**  \n  The relationship between Ember and Danuwoa felt rushed and overly intense at times, which detracted from the story’s believability.

            "This novel tackles significant issues such as racism, sexism, parental abandonment, and death. It contains explicit sexual content, which readers should be aware of. The depiction of white techbro culture is particularly frustrating, especially the character who makes racist comments while denying his racism, referencing childhood games like cowboys and Indians. As an Asian Indian, I appreciated the author's exploration of critical topics, including capitalist culture, the mispronunciation of names of people of color, the plight of missing and murdered Native women, cultural appropriation, and brownface. I found Ember's experiences of stress and expectation relatable.",

While he appears perfect, I found him flawed, particularly in how he dismisses Ember’s concerns about their public relationship. His actions inadvertently contribute to the third-act fallout. I wholeheartedly support Ember, flaws and all. Her moment of malicious compliance with Mr. Stevenson was hilarious, and her struggles with pride resonated with me. Ember’s lies, driven by her desperation for a job and the company's racist policies, felt justified and minor. Danuwoa sees through her small deceptions because she is fundamentally good-hearted, making them feel less like betrayals.",

I'm grateful the author shared a narrative that is authentic to her, especially under the pressure of being a \"first.\"",

As a reader, I felt reassured that the truth would eventually emerge, and it did.",
            "It's surprising that we’ve reached 2024 without a contemporary romance featuring a Native American protagonist, especially one written by a Native American author. I hope this paves the way for more Native American voices in literature. I appreciated that the narrator was Native American, which added authenticity to the story. However, I felt the romance developed too abruptly. While I adored Danuwoa's character and his relationship with Ember, the lack of flirtation made their connection feel sudden—one moment they were friends, and the next, they were kissing. Danuwoa was such a genuinely good guy that at times, I wondered if he was too good for Ember, yet they had a strong chemistry. The scene in the supply closet was particularly memorable! I also enjoyed the side characters, especially Ember's best friend and roommate, Johanna, who was hilarious, as well as Danuwoa's sister and their time at the bowling alley. Overall, the story had great moments, but I wished for a more gradual build-up in the romance."

I thought she was hysterical.  \n   - I also loved Danuwoa's sister, as well as the time they were at the bowling alley.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - I paired my reading with the audio, and I thought Siena East did a fabulous job!  \n   - I thought Siena made the listening easy and enjoyable.  \n   - I think other romance readers would enjoy listening as well.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - I am looking forward to reading more from Danica in the future!  \n   - Check this book out if you are looking for a mildly spicy workplace romance filled with off-the-wall moments!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis contemporary romance, written by a Native American author and featuring Native American characters, is a refreshing and much-needed addition to the genre.

My little sister has Downs, and it truly made my heart so full. I’d love to see her in another book by Nava!  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot (centered around lying) got to be too much for me. I knew lying would be part of Ember getting her job, but she kept lying, half the time for no reason. She lied about where she lived, about liking cats (while being extremely allergic), and about everything to everyone.  \n   - The pacing was weird and affected the relationship development.  \n   - The ending was exactly as much of a painful implosion as I knew it would be. Sometimes things get subverted, but this was not one of those times.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing was strong, so I’ll definitely read more from the author.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - The audiobook did not quite do it for me. The narrator really emphasized/embodied all of Ember’s immaturity, which I suppose was the point. She performed Ember well, but it made me even more exasperated.  \n   - While her intonation was a little wonky, her voice work was great. She really did bring Ember to life.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was just okay for me.

            "The story begins with a compelling premise and authentic representation, but it falters as Ember's constant lying and work struggles take center stage. This focus slows the pacing, leading to repetitive scenarios where Ember attempts to conceal her deceit.",
            "Ember is a deeply flawed character whose constant lying makes it hard to empathize with her. While her initial struggles are somewhat relatable, the accumulation of her lies becomes frustrating. Her character arc lacks a satisfying moment of redemption, leaving me feeling disconnected. In contrast, Danuwoa is sweet and understanding, almost too good to be true. However, the relationship feels underdeveloped, as we only see Ember's perspective, rendering Danuwoa's character superficial. Their bond is based on shared experiences, but Ember's dishonesty prevents a genuine connection, making the romance feel incomplete. The progression of their relationship feels rushed, with key moments skipped, overshadowed by Ember's workplace struggles. Despite these issues, the novel excels in its authentic representation of Native American culture, which is original and well-executed, adding depth and richness to the story.",

However, due to travel plans around its release, I couldn’t. I felt bad about missing the initial release because I was so sure it would be good. I had to wait a while to borrow the audiobook, and when I finally got to it, my expectations weren’t fully met.\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  What I liked was the representation in the story, how easy it was to follow, and the discussions about race and Danuwoa. These aspects were well-done and added depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  I strongly advise against getting the audiobook. The narrator was annoying to listen to and made the main character, Ember, even more unlikeable. The only redeeming feature of the audiobook is the glossary, which helps clarify the pronunciation of certain terms.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The plot was largely centered around Ember lying and trying to dig herself out of those lies, which became repetitive. Combined with an office setting (which I don’t typically enjoy in books), it made for a story I wouldn’t normally have picked up.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was okay, but it was hard to fully enjoy because Ember kept lying to Danuwoa. The story would have been much better if she had stopped lying, especially about her resume.\n\n- **Author Potential:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I’m open to reading more by this author in the future. This is her debut book, and it definitely reads like one. I’m hopeful that her next work will show improvement.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some strong points, such as its representation and themes, it fell short in other areas like the plot, narration, and character development. However, I remain optimistic about the author’s potential and look forward to her future works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Danuwoa is sweet, charming, and perhaps a bit fiery, and their chemistry shines through in their enjoyable meet-cute and witty banter. However, Ember's naivety and tendency to tell small lies, such as claiming severe allergies to cats, can be frustrating and feel irresponsible. The interactions between Ember and her family are heartwarming and authentic, providing a meaningful exploration of their history and the financial and emotional challenges they face.",

While the forbidden romance theme began with promise, it quickly became tiresome.

However, the plot becomes messy and stressful as the main character’s lies multiply in both volume and egregiousness over the course of the book. The constant tension of the \"sword of Damocles\" looming over Ember made it difficult to fully enjoy the unfolding plot.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Ember, the FMC, is a realistic portrayal of a reckless, imperfect, and chronically bad decision-maker, which was refreshing but also stressful to follow. Her impulsivity snowballed into nail-bitingly cringe territory. The love interest, Danuwoa, is handsome, kind, and endlessly patient with Ember’s transgressions. The dynamic cast of side characters, particularly Walela, added depth to the story, and I hope Walela gets her own book.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is fun, fresh, and zingy, which added a lot of value to the story.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The story brings much-needed Native American representation into the romance genre, which is a significant and appreciated aspect of the book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the story is fun and fast-paced, it’s also incredibly stressful, to the point where I felt medically advised to set it down at periodic intervals due to an elevated heart rate.

While I didn’t dislike the main character, I found her difficult to connect with. Throughout the book, she criticized her brother for his illegal actions, yet she herself engaged in illegal behavior without hesitation, which revealed a troubling inconsistency in her priorities. I struggled with her personality, particularly her tendency to lie. Although I understood her first lie was a response to systemic racism, the subsequent white lies felt unnecessary and added stress to the narrative. I questioned how Danuwoa, the male lead, could maintain a serious, trusting relationship with someone who lied about trivial matters. I wanted better for him, as the main character's behavior seemed detrimental to a healthy relationship.",

In contrast, Danuwoa, the main romantic interest, felt almost too perfect and somewhat flat. His avoidant attachment style could have been explored more deeply, particularly in relation to Ember, which would have added meaningful tension to their relationship. The smut was enjoyable, featuring some enticing dirty talk, though it wasn't always highly descriptive. I’d rate it a solid tasty lemon. The semi-public sex scene, like the printer room fantasy, was well-executed, but it might not be for everyone.",

I'm thrilled to have received this ARC and wish the author all the best with their debut.

I would have loved to see more of him, as his traits—like being a cat owner and tech-savvy—made him instantly appealing. Ember, on the other hand, can be challenging to like due to her persistent lying. While the book ultimately addresses her situation well, her deceit felt redundant for much of the story. However, I didn’t dislike her; she has room to grow, much like many of us. Her initial lies are understandable given the racism she faces in the workplace and the world, which I can't fault her for.\n\nThe romance between Danuwoa and Ember could have been more fleshed out.

            "I appreciated the strong Indigenous and Down Syndrome representation in the story. The portrayal of Native culture effectively addressed themes of family and forgiveness, particularly through the touching bond between Danuwoa and his younger sister, who has Down Syndrome. However, Ember, the female main character, struggled with authenticity; she lied about both trivial and serious matters, including her allergies. Her excessive concern for others' feelings felt exaggerated, making her constant dishonesty—especially towards her partner and friends—difficult to empathize with. The trope of the clueless girl in her 20s felt overused and unrelatable, and her involvement in illegal activities further diminished her likability. Danuwoa, the male main character, came across as one-dimensional, defined mainly by physical traits like his long hair and height, with little exploration of his interests or hobbies.

To everyone. About everything. And at some point, I just got so sick of it like girl STAND UP.  \n  Miss ma’am you broke that good man’s trust, he shouldn’t want anything to do with you!!!\n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  There was so much focus on her job and the office that a lot of the romance felt underdeveloped. Tbh I can’t 100% tell what Danuwoa even saw in her — ESPECIALLY at the end.  \n  This was overall, fairly tame in the romance department (and I’m a freak nasty feral animal).\n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  Seeing two Native American main characters in a romance is such a slay. This had such a genuine energy to it.\n\n- **Plot and Writing Quality:**  \n  The whole book had really solid bones. The foundation is definitely there and just needs some tightening up to really be an out-of-the-park romance for me.  \n  Some of the references made went clear over my head.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Re-read Potential:**  \n  There were a couple of moments where I was kicking my feet and giggling.  \n  Now the real question is… will I keep this and reread it? Or should this be unhauled? I don’t know 😩 I kept the Brown Sisters series and Helen Huang’s books because I was absolutely head over heels about them and could see myself rereading in the future. I’m not so sure here but also it could potentially happen… maybe? 🤔 I’ll sleep on it I guess.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong foundation and genuine energy, particularly in its cultural representation, the underdeveloped romance and Ember’s excessive lying made it hard to fully enjoy.

            "The last five chapters were fantastic, and I'm glad I persevered. However, the details about office life felt tedious. Perhaps it was just the setting that didn't resonate with me.",
            "From the very first page, I found myself rooting for Ember, whose messy internal dialogue contrasted beautifully with her confidence and self-esteem. The \"Native daddy\" character was sweet, family-oriented, calm, and considerate, creating a compelling juxtaposition between the two. However, I must admit that this might be the most tedious romance I've ever read. The pacing was excruciatingly slow, with the romantic tension built on flimsy foundations. There was little chemistry between the main characters until they finally connected in chapter twenty-something. The story could have benefited from more tension and less exposition from Ember. \n\nOn a positive note, I loved the representation in this book! The characters were well-developed, and there were strong moments throughout. I appreciated how the narrative addressed racism and highlighted the impact of microaggressions, which many of us experience daily. I'm thrilled to see a multi-racial author writing a Native romance, and I hope to see more stories like this in the future!"

            "Ember comes across as immature and unprepared for a committed relationship, indicating that she has personal issues to resolve. Danuwoa, the hero, is well-liked but feels too good for her. Ember's poor choices, particularly in her career, make it difficult to root for her. However, the family dynamics are a strong point; her relationships with her brother and aunt are realistically complex and engaging. In contrast, the father-daughter dynamic is underdeveloped, introduced too late in the story without enough context to convey emotional depth.\n\nThe romance itself fell flat for me. While the book shows potential, the external conflict—forces keeping the main characters apart—felt contrived and unrealistic for a contemporary setting. The stakes, involving lies, crime, and job risks, lacked believability and justification. Ultimately, I couldn't buy into the happily-ever-after because Ember's immaturity suggests she may continue to lie in the future.",

I can imagine being her friend would stress me out.  \n   - Her constant lying about trivial things was frustrating and made her unlikable, especially in front of the Love Interest.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - I loved the setup of the book and enjoyed the exposition, particularly the part where she lies on her job application to secure an interview.  \n   - However, the story became exhausting as she continued to lie about insignificant things, which detracted from the overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n   - The Love Interest deserved better, and this feeling lingered in my mind, which isn’t ideal for a romance novel.  \n\n- **Narrative Perspective:**  \n   - I’m deducting a star because the Male Main Character (MMC) doesn’t get a point of view (POV), a choice I strongly dislike in romance novels.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong setup and an engaging exposition, the unlikable main character, her frustrating behavior, and the lack of the MMC’s POV significantly impacted my enjoyment. The romantic dynamic left me feeling unsatisfied, as the Love Interest seemed to deserve better.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Original rating: 3 stars  \n- Adjusted rating: 2 stars (due to the absence of the MMC’s POV)."

She was insufferable, annoying, naive, and, worst of all, a pathological liar. Discovering halfway through the book that she was 25 was mind-boggling.

Ember’s constant lying made it hard to understand what Danuowa saw in her. Additionally, the pacing of their relationship felt off. While Ember’s feelings for Danuowa were clear from the start, his shift from being just a coworker to suddenly being romantically interested in her felt abrupt and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narrator on the audiobook truly embodied Ember’s character, but I’m unsure if this enhanced or worsened the story.  \n\n- **Genre Suitability:**  \n  I believe this story would have worked better as regular contemporary fiction rather than a romance, given the issues with character dynamics and pacing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite being one of my most anticipated books of the year, this novel fell short due to its unlikable protagonist, juvenile writing, and poorly developed romance.

            "I'm thrilled to see more Native representation in romance novels. However, I found Ember to be a pathological liar, which made her both ridiculous and unlikable. Her poor judgment leads her to make one mistake after another, digging herself deeper into trouble. She lied to secure her job and continued to fabricate stories to cover her tracks.

His openness about his feelings and unwavering support for Ember, even when she didn’t deserve it, made him someone I couldn’t help but root for. In contrast, Ember was challenging to like. Her constant selfish lies created a barrier to connection.

Her delivery was inconsistent, shifting abruptly from a normal tone to overly dramatic outbursts, which made the listening experience jarring and unpleasant. It felt as though she was acting out Ember's emotions or thoughts in an exaggerated manner, almost yelling at times, before returning to a calm tone.

This was the only aspect I genuinely liked.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Decisions:**  \n  The lies in the story were excessive and often felt absurd. Many of them were so poorly executed that I couldn’t sympathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. I found myself thinking, “I don’t feel bad for you,” which made it hard to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Narration and Format:**  \n  I didn’t enjoy the narration style, and I don’t think I would have liked it even if I had read the book physically instead of listening to the audiobook. The format didn’t work for me, and I struggled to stay invested in the story.  \n\n- **Engagement and Interest:**  \n  While listening to the audiobook, I was walking my dog near a train, and the noise made it hard to hear. However, I didn’t bother pausing it because I realized I didn’t care enough about what was happening in the story to follow along. This lack of engagement ultimately led to my low rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s diversity and Native representation were commendable, the excessive and poorly executed lies, unengaging narration, and lack of interest in the plot made it a disappointing read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1 star."
