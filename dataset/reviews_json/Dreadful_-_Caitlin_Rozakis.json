As the wizards draw near, Gav must unravel the ritual's purpose while navigating the chaos of a garlic festival organized by the village mayor. The interplay of these events creates a palpable sense of urgency and tension. Despite the intricate plot, which includes the looming ritual, the garlic festival, and Gav's internal conflicts, the pacing is expertly managed, and the various storylines are skillfully intertwined.",
            "In this captivating tale, the protagonist, Lord Gav, embodies a morally gray character in line with contemporary storytelling trends. His moral ambiguity arises from a fractured memory caused by magic, leaving him to grapple with his former identity as the malevolent Dread Lord Gavrax and contemplate whether he wishes to reclaim that past. This internal conflict enriches his character, adding significant depth. The supporting cast is equally well-developed and memorable, particularly the princess, who defies the typical damsel in distress trope. With her intelligence, sharp wit, and unimpressed demeanor toward Gav's flirtations, their dynamic introduces an entertaining layer to the narrative.",

Since our daughters love Baldree's works, I expected to like *Dreadful* as well, and the comparison held true.  \n\n- **Main Character (Morally Gray Protagonist):**  \n  The protagonist, Lord Gav, is morally gray, which aligns with current trends in storytelling. His moral ambiguity stems from his inability to remember much of his past due to his magic. He struggles with reconciling his current self with his former identity as the evil Dread Lord Gavrax, questioning whether he wants to return to being \"that person.\" This internal conflict adds depth to his character.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The story revolves around Lord Gav's predicament: he has a princess locked in his dungeon, kidnapped as part of a heinous ritual involving three other dark wizards. As the wizards' arrival approaches, Gav must uncover the purpose of the ritual while dealing with the chaos of a garlic festival hosted by the village mayor. The ticking clock and overlapping events create a sense of urgency and tension.  \n\n- **Humor and Dialogue:**  \n  The novel excels in humor, particularly through the interactions between Gav and his goblin staff. The dialogue is witty and engaging, and the humorous scenes add levity to the story. Learning secrets about the staff alongside Gav was a delightful experience.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The characters are well-developed and memorable. Gav's dynamic with the princess is particularly interesting—she is not a typical damsel in distress but rather smart, sharp-tongued, and unimpressed by his attempts at flirting. Their relationship adds an entertaining layer to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Complexity:**  \n  The book has a lot going on, from the impending ritual to the garlic festival and Gav's internal struggles. Despite the complexity, the pacing is well-handled, and the multiple plot threads are woven together seamlessly.  \n\n- **Genre Appeal (Cozy Fantasy):**  \n  This novel is a great introduction to the cozy fantasy genre. It combines humor, engaging characters, and surprising plot twists, making it an enjoyable read for those new to the genre or fans of it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Dreadful* is a fun, engaging, and humorous cozy fantasy that delivers on its promise to appeal to fans of Travis Baldree's works.

However, liberated from his past, Gav begins to recognize these harmful thoughts and embarks on a path of growth, which I loved exploring in his character arc. Orla, the goblin chef, was absolutely endearing—I adored her character! My only complaint is that I wished there had been more of her in the story.

Since *Dreadful* opens with a character who has lost his identity, I got to discover the world alongside Gav. Gav and I were on this journey together, which made the story immersive from the start.  \n\n- **Character Development (Gav):**  \n  While it’s clear from other characters’ reactions that Gav was once a dreadfully evil person, I felt a lot of affection for him. Even though Gav has forgotten his past, his brain and body seem conditioned to react toxically to rejection, humiliation, and shame. He experiences multiple intrusive thoughts and feelings that reflect toxic masculinity. Without the baggage of his past, Gav is able to recognize these thoughts as toxic and begins to grow. I loved this aspect of his character arc.  \n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**  \n  The central question the book asks is: *Are people redeemable?* Using Gav to explore this question was both effective and interesting. I won’t spoil the answer, but the exploration of redemption was compelling and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Character Development (Orla and Side Characters):**  \n  Orla, the goblin chef, is the most adorable character! I LOVED her. I ADORED her. My only complaint is that I wanted more of her in the story. The other side characters were also lovable, and I enjoyed learning about their individual stories and seeing them develop new relationships with Gav.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  If you enjoyed *Assistant to the Villain* and *The House in the Cerulean Sea*, I think you would love *Dreadful*.

I kept wanting to pick the book back up to find out what would happen next, which is a feeling I haven’t had about a book in a while.  \n\n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The premise was fantastic! I particularly enjoyed the villain’s journey of trying to figure out why he was a villain and his attempts to hide his memory loss by bluffing his way through villainous deeds.  \n\n- **Character Development (Gav):**  \n  This felt like a great antihero story. Gav no longer had the motivation to be the villain he once was. While he still wasn’t perfect and acknowledged his cowardice, he began to show compassion for the people he had previously terrorized. I found myself rooting for him very quickly.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  My only slight quibble is that I would have preferred a more neatly wrapped-up ending. That said, I was fine with how it concluded. The open-ended nature leaves room for a potential sequel, but it doesn’t feel necessary.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a fun and engaging story with a unique premise and a compelling antihero. While the ending was open-ended, it didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment. I was thoroughly invested in the narrative and found myself eager to keep reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It’s a satirical, darkly humorous, and clever romp that delivers on its premise. The idea of a man waking up in a Dark Lord’s lair, only to realize he *is* the Dark Lord, is both fresh and entertaining. The self-aware humor and the exploration of whether he *has* to be the villain add depth to the concept. ★★★★★  \n\n- **Plot/Pacing:**  \n  The plot is well-paced and constructed, though it doesn’t quite reach the same level of excellence as the concept. The story unfolds with a good balance of humor, intrigue, and character development. However, there are moments where the pacing feels slightly uneven, which keeps it from being perfect. ★★★  \n\n- **Enjoyment:**  \n  This novel was a hit for me. It’s a fun, clever, and highly enjoyable read. The humor lands well, and the story keeps you engaged from start to finish. It’s the kind of book that makes you laugh out loud while also keeping you invested in the protagonist’s journey. ★★★★  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The humor is one of the strongest aspects of the book. It walks the fine line between being over-the-top and self-aware without crossing into “too much” territory. The satirical tone is consistent and adds a layer of charm to the story.  \n\n- **Comparison to Similar Works:**  \n  I couldn’t help but compare *Dreadful* to *Assistant to the Villain*, which I found underwhelming. *Dreadful* is everything I wanted from that book—a classic European/feudal-vibed fantasy romp with well-executed humor and pacing. If you were disappointed by *Assistant to the Villain*, this is the book you’ve been waiting for.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I highly recommend *Dreadful* to fans of K.J. Parker or anyone who enjoys clever, humorous fantasies. Rozakis has a clear talent for this genre, and I’m excited to see more from her in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Dreadful* is a satirical, darkly humorous fantasy that delivers on its clever premise. With a strong concept, well-paced plot, and plenty of laughs, it’s a highly enjoyable read that stands out in its genre. If you’re looking for a fun and self-aware romp, this is the book for you.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Concept: ★★★★★  \n- Plot/Pacing: ★★★  \n- Enjoyment: ★★★★"

His performance enhanced my experience, and I hope to hear more audiobooks narrated by him in the future.  \n\n- **Production Team:**  \n  I want to extend my gratitude to everyone involved in this work, especially those at Tantor Media, Inc., for bringing this story to life.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful read, combining humor, memorable characters, and an engaging plot. The audiobook narration was excellent, and the imaginative elements, like the goblins and Grrribeetle, added a unique charm.

The tone is reminiscent of T. Kingfisher's works, though it has its own distinct feel. The inclusion of absurd elements, like a rooster, adds to the comedic charm.\n\n- **Plot and Stakes:**  \n  The stakes are high throughout the story, though the limits of these stakes remain unclear for much of the book. The plot involves evil wizards, foolish heroes, and curious bystanders, with some unexpected twists. However, the stakes of \"The Ritual\" and Zarconar's ultimate goals are not fully explained, which could have added more depth and menace to the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Gav, the protagonist, is a compelling character to follow. His journey of trying to remember his past to save himself is both engaging and ethically complex. Rozakis does an excellent job of making him likable while highlighting his flaws, such as his dark wizard past. The side characters, like the goblins (especially Orla the chef), Valevna the evil sorceress, and Siraco, are well-developed and add richness to the story. Siraco's backstory, in particular, is a standout element.\n\n- **Violence and Gore:**  \n  The book isn't excessively violent, but there are moments of gore and death. These deaths often feel pointless, which seems intentional and adds to the story's dark humor.\n\n- **Room for Improvement:**  \n  As a debut novel, there are areas where the story could be polished. For instance, the stakes and motivations of certain elements, like Zarconar's goals, could have been clearer. However, these minor issues don't detract significantly from the overall enjoyment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book is a highly enjoyable read, blending humor, darkness, and memorable characters. While there are areas for improvement, the story is engaging and well-crafted, making it a strong recommendation for fans of comedic fantasy. I’m excited for Rozakis’ next work, *The Grimoire Grammar School Parent Teacher Association*, which promises to be equally entertaining.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5⭐"

While it fell slightly short in sophistication and world-building for an adult audience, the tight plot and fun characters, particularly the dark wizards, made it an enjoyable experience overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The combination of humor and philosophical undertones makes the story engaging and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  While the story feels a bit old-fashioned at times, it maintains a steady pace that keeps the reader invested.

            "My only minor concern is the portrayal of Eliasha’s true appearance as “plain/unattractive.” While I commend the effort to subvert the beautiful princess stereotype, it suggests that a character cannot be both intelligent and beautiful. Nevertheless, this choice ultimately serves the story, as her plainness allows her to be seen as the “extra/unnecessary” royal sibling who wouldn’t be missed.",

This approach turns exposition into an engaging part of the story, similar to how Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings use outsider characters to introduce their magical worlds.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  While the premise and execution are strong, some elements of the plot and backstory feel overly drawn out. The pacing could be tighter in certain sections.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite minor pacing issues, the novel succeeds in delivering a fun and engaging fantasy experience. It stands out among other attempts at blending humor and fantasy, making it a refreshing read, especially after encountering disappointing books recently.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a clever and humorous take on fantasy, with a strong premise, consistent tone, and effective world-building.

            "The story opens with Lord Dread Gavrax (Gav) awakening in a state of complete amnesia—he has no recollection of his identity, location, or circumstances. The initial confusion was so overwhelming that I nearly set the book aside, feeling just as disoriented as Gav. I even questioned whether it was a sequel to a story I hadn’t read. However, I chose to persevere, and ultimately, it proved to be a rewarding decision.",

His efforts to maintain a facade while concealing his amnesia are both amusing and charming. The interactions between Gav and his servants are a highlight, especially as they begin to notice his odd behavior. Additionally, the princess in the dungeon contributes to the humor with her witty remarks, adding depth to her captive predicament.",

Gav's evolution from a feared Dark Lord to a more thoughtful and \"nice\" individual perplexes those around him, adding depth to the narrative. The stark contrast between his new personality and his former reputation generates a wealth of entertaining angst."

My attention wasn't held completely, but I honestly feel like it was just my mood or current slump.  \n\n- **Premise and Originality:**  \n  The premise felt new and fresh. It wasn't that the premise wasn't interesting; I just wasn't exactly prepared for it. The underlying problem of the impending dark spell being cast was an unusual twist that I don't usually see in fantasy.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were entertaining. I loved how the goblins, townspeople, and each person had their own twist to how they came to be where they were or why they stayed. It was so fascinating.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n  This is a journey of self-discovery and, as the blurb says, figuring out who Gav wants to be without his memories to guide him. It has *Assistant to the Villain* vibes but without the romance aspect. Maybe Gav has a crush, but it's hardly the point of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, it was a fun read, and I would recommend it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I struggled to stay fully engaged due to my current reading slump, I still found the book enjoyable and unique.

It explores the tension between his desire for redemption and the lingering impact of his past actions on others.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are well-developed and intriguing, particularly when viewed from the villain’s perspective.

I appreciated how the story revealed their complexities, making it clear that they weren’t entirely good or bad.  \n\n- **Moral Ambiguity and Forgiveness:**  \n  The central question of forgiveness is compelling but also challenging. While the protagonist didn’t “do” the bad things in his current state, his past actions had significant consequences for others. This moral ambiguity made me hesitant about whether he truly deserved forgiveness, especially since his past self exhibited incel-like behavior and misogynistic tendencies.  \n\n- **Character Motivation and Empathy:**  \n  Despite my reservations, I found myself slightly rooting for the protagonist’s chance at redemption. His descent into evil was partly due to being ostracized for his looks and made to feel like he didn’t belong, which added a layer of empathy to his character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a thought-provoking exploration of redemption, forgiveness, and moral complexity through a unique and engaging plot.

            "I appreciated the diverse range of main characters, each bringing something unique to the story. They were well-developed and enriched the plot. However, I found Gav's emotional journey less satisfying. His constant quest for validation from Eliashia—striving to be someone she would like and professing his love for her—felt repetitive and frustrating. It would have been more rewarding if Gav had made choices for himself and grown independently, rather than relying on her opinion. Although the author does address this by the end, it remained a persistent irritation throughout the narrative.",

Can you take the same basic material (nature) and choose another path?  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  I adored the goblins and felt genuine pity for many characters, such as the long-suffering mayor and the rooster.  \n\n- **Plot and Originality:**  \n  The author avoids clichés and takes unexpected turns, culminating in a true team effort to defeat the antagonist. The story starts with a tone similar to Scalzi and Kingfisher in terms of writing and humor but gains depth as it progresses, becoming more reminiscent of Pratchett.  \n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  I didn't enjoy the actor's cartoony voice for the two main characters, and at times, it was difficult to distinguish between characters.

The discussions around the struggle between good and evil, especially the challenges of transitioning from evil to good while still benefiting from the privileges of being evil, were super interesting and added a lot of depth.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is truly hilarious, with a sharp wit that kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The book features so many fun characters, each adding to the charm and humor of the story.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending didn’t quite deliver the payoff I was hoping for, but it was still satisfying in its own way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was almost a 5-star read for me, thanks to its brilliant concept, hilarious writing, and thought-provoking themes. While the ending fell slightly short of my expectations, it was still a satisfying conclusion. I had a blast reading it and would definitely recommend it to others.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (originally considered 5 stars but adjusted due to the ending)."

It delivered on humor, character depth, and a satisfying conclusion, making it an enjoyable read despite its gory elements.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5 stars"

It needed to either be sillier or darker, but it fell somewhere in between, failing to fully commit to either direction.  \n- **Character Likability:** One of the main characters needed to be more likable, but they weren’t, which made it harder to connect with the story.  \n- **Plot Execution:** The plot needed to be stronger and more engaging, but it fell short of expectations.  \n- **Concept and Potential:** The idea behind the book was fun and had potential, but the execution didn’t do it justice.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:** While the book isn’t bad, it feels underwhelming and forgettable, existing without leaving a strong impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had an interesting concept and some enjoyable characters, but it struggled with tone, character likability, and plot execution. It’s not a bad read, but it fails to stand out or fully deliver on its potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It delves into themes of breaking with one's past and seeking redemption, which I found delightful and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character's growth is compelling, especially as he grapples with the challenges of being a Dark Lord, such as performing evil deeds and dealing with persistent heroes. His interactions with the princess he holds captive are particularly endearing and add depth to his journey.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  My primary criticism is that the story feels unnecessarily drawn out. It could have been more effective as a novella, as the pacing drags at times, and the narrative could have been condensed without losing its essence.  \n\n- **Timing and Market Context:**  \n  The timing of the book's release is questionable, as it coincides with the release of two other Dark Lord-themed books, one of which is also a parody. While this novel is far superior to *Become The Dark and Die Trying* (which I found offensive at times), the competition may overshadow its impact.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This is a standalone fantasy parody that succeeds in blending humor with a heartfelt story. It’s a cozy fantasy with a comedic twist, perfect for fans of T. Kingfisher or those who enjoy lighthearted, character-driven tales.  \n\n- **Recommendations:**  \n  I recommend this book to fans of cozy fantasy, T. Kingfisher, and those who appreciate redemption stories with a comedic edge. However, it may not appeal to readers who prefer deeper world-building, faster pacing, or detailed explanations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Dreadful* is a charming and humorous take on the Dark Lord trope, with a strong focus on character growth and redemption. While its pacing and length could have been tighter, it stands out as a superior parody in its genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The story begins with the Dread Lord Gavrax trying to piece together his identity after losing his memory. His lab is on fire, he’s missing his eyebrows, and he has a kidnapped princess in his dungeon. As he uncovers more about his past, he realizes he might not like the person he used to be. The central question of the story—when does pretending to be someone else turn into becoming who you really are?—is intriguing but ultimately felt underdeveloped.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building relies heavily on assumptions and leans into typical fantasy stereotypes. While it provides a familiar backdrop, it lacks depth and originality, which made it harder for me to fully immerse myself in the setting.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The main character, Gavrax, has a dry sense of humor that I enjoyed. However, his personality and quirks didn’t feel particularly fresh or groundbreaking. The supporting characters, like the kidnapped princess and the evil men admitting their misdeeds, added some flavor but didn’t stand out as memorable.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot, at its core, didn’t feel believable to me. Many moments felt forced, and I struggled to stay engaged because the story didn’t flow naturally. While there were some fun elements, like moat squids and garlic festivals, they weren’t enough to carry the narrative.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Overall Impression:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I did find some enjoyment in the book. The humor and quirky elements, like the moat squids and garlic festivals, added a layer of charm. However, the lack of originality in the world-building and the forced plot made it a “mid” read for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Dreadful* has its moments of humor and charm, it falls short in terms of originality and believability. The world-building feels stereotypical, and the plot often feels forced. That said, it’s not without its entertaining quirks, making it a decent but unremarkable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n★★★ (3/5)"

The style of humor really worked for me, making it a great choice for anyone looking for a quick, cozy fantasy that delivers laughs.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  I couldn’t help but feel for Gav and root for him in his journey of self-discovery. His character was engaging and relatable, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Relationships:**  \n  I really loved the goblins and how Gav’s relationship with them develops. This aspect of the story added a unique and charming dynamic to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  While I was thoroughly enjoying the book in the beginning, I kind of lost steam in the second half and felt my interest waning a little. The ending was cute but left me feeling slightly underwhelmed compared to how I felt at the start.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the pacing issues, I would definitely still recommend this book because I did enjoy reading it. For an enhanced experience, I’d suggest listening to Medieval Bardcore covers while reading.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a cozy, humorous fantasy with a charming protagonist and delightful goblin relationships. While the second half didn’t quite maintain the initial momentum, it’s still a worthwhile and enjoyable read, especially for those seeking lighthearted entertainment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 ⭐️"

All she wanted to do was become a chef, and the apron comments made me smile.  \n\n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  - The concept was fun, and I was hooked by the first sentence: “He woke up with no eyebrows and no idea how he’d gotten into such a position.”  \n  - It felt original, especially since I’ve gotten stuck in fantasies telling the same story just with different characters. This was different, and I think that’s my favorite part about it.  \n\n- **Humor and Enjoyment:**  \n  - The book was enjoyable and mildly funny.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful introduction to comedic books for me. Its originality, charming characters like Orla, and engaging concept made it a standout read. While the humor was mild, it added to the overall enjoyment, making it a refreshing break from repetitive fantasy tropes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The protagonist, a Dark Wizard, wakes up after a ritual with no memories and no eyebrows. He recalls kidnapping a princess, but she turns out to be more than she seems. The plot thickens with the introduction of his major domo and chief torturer, who has secrets and a great singing voice. Additionally, there are goblins and a Hero who ends up wearing a rooster's head, adding to the chaotic and farcical nature of the story.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book leans heavily into silliness and farce, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The humor and absurdity of the situations kept me entertained throughout.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are quirky and memorable. The Dark Wizard is an intriguing protagonist with his memory loss and eyebrow predicament. The princess is not what she appears to be, adding an element of mystery. The major domo and chief torturer is a standout character with his secrets and unexpected talents. The inclusion of goblins and the rooster-headed Hero adds to the eccentric cast.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I had a great time reading this book.

While it didn’t completely detract from my enjoyment, it did make certain parts of the story feel uneven or less impactful.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  - The novel attempted to explore deeper themes, such as the incel dynamic, but it didn’t fully realize its potential. I kept hoping for more depth and resolution in this aspect, but it fell short.  \n\n- **Character Development and Resolution:**  \n  - Gav’s character arc was intriguing, and it was clear he was a better person than Gavrax. However, I felt he didn’t get a proper chance to prove this or fully resolve his journey, which left me wanting more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had a fun concept, likable characters, and an immersive world, but it struggled with pacing and failed to fully deliver on its deeper thematic potential. While I enjoyed the story enough to keep reading, the lack of a satisfying resolution and uneven execution left me feeling somewhat disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

It left me wanting more, especially when it came to the quirky goblin character.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It felt unnecessary and detracted from my enjoyment of the story.  \n  The tension surrounding whether the young princess and the middle-aged dark wizard would get together was frustrating. While they ultimately didn’t end up together, I could have done without that entire subplot.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel avoided a problematic romantic pairing, the inclusion of the virginity plot and the lingering tension between the princess and the dark wizard diminished my overall experience. These elements felt unnecessary and detracted from the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It had potential, but the execution left me wanting more.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The result, as the title suggests, was \"dreadful.\"\n\n- **Humor:**  \n  The humor in the book was described as the most ridiculous, which may not have resonated well with the reader.\n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The attempt to create a \"cozy\" atmosphere within an isekai setting did not seem to work effectively, contributing to the overall negative impression.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel \"Dreadful\" by Catlin Rozakis attempted to combine popular trends like the likable villain, isekai, and humor, but the execution fell short, resulting in a disappointing read. The humor felt over-the-top, and the cozy atmosphere did not land as intended.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

I kept hoping he would show some intelligence, charm, or humor, but he never did.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The opening was promising, with an intriguing setup of a wizard regaining consciousness with amnesia. However, the story failed to deliver on this potential, and the mayhem that followed was not enjoyable for me.  \n\n- **Spoilers and Reader Experience:**  \n  I won’t go into further details to avoid spoilers, but I found the overall experience to be dreadful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had a strong opening but quickly lost its appeal due to its lackluster humor, unlikable protagonist, and failure to deliver on its initial promise.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  I was immediately drawn to the premise of *Dreadful*. The idea of an evil, dark wizard who forgets he’s the villain and reacquaints himself with a princess, other dark wizards, goblins, and a lot of garlic while trying to foil an evil plan he was part of sounded incredibly intriguing. It had so much potential to be a unique and engaging story.  \n\n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n  Unfortunately, the execution didn’t work for me. While the premise seemed ripe for comedy, the humor felt juvenile rather than clever or satirical. The clichéd villain tropes didn’t land as satire, and the tone reminded me of an early 2000s kids’ morning cartoon. I didn’t find it funny, which was disappointing given the comedic potential of the concept.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Genre Fit:**  \n  I don’t think I’m the right audience for this book. With its pacing and premise, I believe it could have excelled as a YA novel. However, it would need some tweaking to remove a few of the more mature topics and better align with the tone and expectations of that genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Dreadful* had a fantastic premise and plenty of potential, the execution fell flat for me. The humor felt juvenile, and the tone didn’t resonate with my expectations. I think it could work better as a YA novel with some adjustments, but as it stands, it wasn’t a great fit for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The characters felt flat, making it difficult to connect with them. I found it particularly frustrating that the protagonist didn't even bother to learn the goblins' names because he deemed them too difficult to pronounce. While he may not be purely evil anymore, he certainly isn't good either.",

I finished it only because I bought a physical copy and wanted to add it to my physical TBR challenge, but it was a rough experience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were very flat, which made it really hard to care about them.  \n\n- **Moral Complexity and Character Behavior:**  \n  I had a problem with the protagonist not even caring to learn the goblins' names because they \"were too hard to say.\" You may not be pure evil anymore, my guy, but you still aren't good.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book failed to engage me due to its flat characters and the protagonist's questionable behavior, making it a difficult read despite my efforts to finish it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
