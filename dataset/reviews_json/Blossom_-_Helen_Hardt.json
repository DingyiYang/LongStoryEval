            "Initially, I was uncertain about Ronan, but his striking resemblance to Jamie Frasier and his penchant for wearing kilts quickly drew me in. His Dominant side, when revealed, was compelling and expertly crafted. Mary's internal struggle and journey of self-discovery were equally fascinating, as she navigated her evolving needs and confronted the possibility that her current life might not align with her true desires. Her growth and the choices she faced added significant depth to her character. The unsung hero of the story is Ronan's grandmother, mémé Yvette. I found her character utterly endearing and would love to read a story centered on her life. She brought a unique charm and warmth to the narrative."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - This is a steamy BDSM insta-love romance, though it leans more heavily on the romance than the BDSM elements.  \n  - The book is part of a trilogy centered around the Black Rose Underground Club members, and it serves as a satisfying conclusion to the series.  \n\n- **Series Continuity and Stand-Alone Potential:**  \n  - While this book could be read as a stand-alone, characters from the previous books are mentioned, so skipping the earlier installments might leave readers missing some foundational context.  \n  - The series could potentially continue, as there are many more characters who could take the spotlight, but it is currently intended as a trilogy.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  - The book is more of a short story or novella than a full-length novel, but it is well-plotted with a clear beginning, middle, and end.  \n  - The pacing and structure provide a satisfying reading experience.  \n\n- **Content and Tone:**  \n  - The book contains heavy spice, so it may not be suitable for readers who prefer less explicit content.  \n  - For readers who enjoy steamy romance, this book is a delightful and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a steamy, romance-heavy conclusion to the Black Rose Underground Club trilogy. While it can be read as a stand-alone, readers may benefit from starting with the earlier books for better context. The novella-length story is well-structured and satisfying, though its explicit content makes it best suited for fans of spicy romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This is a steamy BDSM insta-love romance, though it leans more heavily on the romance than the BDSM elements. It’s the third book in the Black Rose Underground Club members series and serves as a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.  \n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  While the series could easily continue, as there are many more characters who could take the spotlight, it’s currently planned as a trilogy. This book can be read as a standalone, but references to characters from the previous books might leave readers feeling they’ve missed some foundational context.  \n\n- **Story Structure and Length:**  \n  The books in this series are more like short stories or novellas rather than full-length novels. However, they are well-plotted, offering a complete narrative with a satisfying beginning, middle, and end.  \n\n- **Content and Tone:**  \n  The book is heavy on spice, so readers who prefer less explicit content might want to steer clear. For those who enjoy steamy romance, this book is a delightful and indulgent read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a steamy, romance-focused conclusion to the Black Rose Underground Club trilogy. While it can be read as a standalone, readers might benefit from starting with the earlier books for better context. The novella-length stories are well-structured and satisfying, though the explicit content may not appeal to everyone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her character arc felt incomplete until she confronted her past failures, paving the way for her future with Ronan. Both characters demonstrated significant emotional growth: Mary learned to trust herself, while Ronan learned to open up to others. Their relationship emphasized emotional connection over physical attraction, which was fitting for the story's context. Although Ronan's preference for wearing a kilt added a touch of intrigue, the emotional depth of their bond truly stood out. The balance between emotional and physical elements was skillfully executed, creating a compelling dynamic.",
