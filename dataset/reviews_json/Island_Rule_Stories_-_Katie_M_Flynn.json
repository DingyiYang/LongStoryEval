While the characters from each story intersect with others, even if briefly, the lack of a cohesive structure made it difficult to follow and maintain interest.  \n\n- **Engagement and Interest:**  \n  The book failed to capture and hold my interest. Despite making it to page 120, I found myself disengaged, often wondering when each chapter would end and wishing the book would conclude sooner. A few individual stories were interesting, but not enough to sustain my overall engagement.  \n\n- **Author Familiarity and Expectations:**  \n  I went into the book with no expectations, as I am unfamiliar with the author, Katie M. Flynn, and the authors she is compared to (Jennifer Egan and Karen Russell). This lack of familiarity may have contributed to my difficulty in understanding and appreciating the novel.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Future Outlook:**  \n  For now, I wouldn’t recommend this book. However, I plan to explore other works by Katie M. Flynn and familiarize myself with Jennifer Egan and Karen Russell. I hope to revisit *Island Rule* in the future with a potentially different perspective.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Island Rule* has moments of intrigue, its disjointed structure and lack of sustained engagement made it a challenging read for me. I appreciate the opportunity to read and review the book, but it didn’t resonate with me as I had hoped.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
