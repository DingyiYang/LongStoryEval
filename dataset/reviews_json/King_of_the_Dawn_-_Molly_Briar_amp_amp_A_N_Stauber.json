            "Evie embodies incredible strength, particularly in her mental resilience, which left me in awe. Her ability to endure 16 years of hardship is truly remarkable. However, I deducted one star because her continued civil relationship with neglectful relatives, like her nephews and brother Callum, felt unrealistic; they didn’t deserve her kindness or forgiveness. Eoghen, despite his reasons, also did not merit Evie’s forgiveness or the right to call her his stepmother, given his despicable actions. \n\nJericho stands out as a character with a beautiful, self-sacrificing nature. He has truly earned the right to be by Evie’s side and deserves her love, adoration, and trust. While I admire his selflessness, it sometimes frustrated me, as I wished he would take bolder steps to ensure Evie’s happiness. Rose, a character I loved in her own book, shines in this duet, while Alistair, whom I admired in *Iron Rose*, lost my respect in *The Black Crown*. Aside from Corbin, I found the Irish men in these stories unlikable.\n\n*The Black Crown* is a tragically beautiful masterpiece and one of my favorite romance duets. Evie and Jericho have become two of my most beloved main characters."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Black Crown* is a beautifully tragic and emotionally gripping novel. While Evie’s strength and Jericho’s selflessness shine brightly, certain character dynamics, particularly with Evie’s relatives, felt unrealistic. Despite this, the duet stands out as a favorite, with Evie and Jericho becoming unforgettable characters.",

            "Aoibheann is a captivating character whose significant growth throughout the book is both inspiring and beautifully depicted. In contrast, Jericho is often frustrating and insufferable, primarily due to his poor communication skills and persistent self-pity, which make it challenging to empathize with him. Aoibheann's development is further emphasized by her deep bond with her new family, a central theme of the story. The miscommunication between Jericho and Aoibheann serves as a major source of tension, as his reluctance to express his fears and feelings adds to the frustration of their relationship.",
