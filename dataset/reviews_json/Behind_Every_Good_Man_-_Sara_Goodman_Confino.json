This trend emerged more prominently in the early '90s.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The novel was a surprisingly fun read, blending elements of drama and politics. The story revolves around a stay-at-home wife who discovers her husband's infidelity and decides to become the campaign manager for the opposing senate candidate against her soon-to-be ex-husband’s boss. It was reminiscent of *The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel*, but with politics replacing comedy.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character was compelling and relatable. Her transformation from a stay-at-home wife to a skilled campaign manager was engaging and well-executed. She proved to be far more competent in this role than her husband, which added a satisfying layer of empowerment to her journey.  \n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  The book was rich with references to the early 1960s, which added depth and authenticity to the story. The historical backdrop enhanced the narrative and made the setting feel vivid and immersive.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n  The author’s writing style was enjoyable, with a touch of humor that kept the story lighthearted despite its dramatic undertones. I particularly appreciated the inclusion of a short, funny true story about the author’s dad and uncle at a deli, which added a personal and charming touch to the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was an entertaining and engaging read, combining a strong plot, well-developed characters, and a richly detailed historical setting. The humor and personal anecdotes woven into the story made it even more enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story is strikingly relevant to today's political climate, despite being set in the 1960s. Beverly Diamond discovers her husband, Larry, having an affair with his secretary. This was a time when most women were homemakers without financial independence, and Beverly is also a mother to two young children.",

            "This book addresses numerous issues that remain relevant in 2024, particularly in the context of the current election. It reflects a persistent hope for progress, yet highlights how little has changed. One quote that struck me was Beverly's optimism for her daughter's future: “Maybe by 1996, the world would be ready for a female president.” It’s disheartening to realize that, in 2024, the United States still seems unprepared for this reality. Another powerful quote encapsulates women's desires: “Freedom. Self-sufficiency. Respect for who we are, not who other people want us to be. The same life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness that this country promises men.”"

Many aspects mirrored the 2024 election and the one portrayed in the book.

Beverly is hopeful for her daughter’s future: “Maybe by 1996, the world would be ready for a female president.” Sigh, and here we are in 2024, and the world still isn’t ready.

            "The story opens with a young wife and mother discovering her husband's infidelity with his secretary, a premise that may seem clichéd. However, the author revitalizes it by placing the narrative in 1962 and weaving in the societal attitudes of the time, such as the pressure from other characters for her to overlook the affair and accept her husband's mistress. This detail adds authenticity, even though I was a child in 1962 and lack personal memories of adult themes from that era.",

            "While this book may not offer the same innovative perspective as the author's earlier work, *Don't Forget to Write*, which cleverly reinterpreted clichés from the Fifties and Sixties, it presents a more cohesive narrative overall. This cohesion is why I rated it 5 stars."

However, this book feels more cohesive as a whole, which is why I gave it 5 stars.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story begins with a young wife and mother catching her husband cheating with his secretary, a somewhat hackneyed premise. However, the author freshens it by setting it in 1962 and incorporating societal attitudes of the time, such as other characters urging her to ignore the affair and let her husband have a mistress. This detail feels authentic, even though I was a child in 1962 and can't recall adult themes from that era.  \n\n- **Integration of Politics:**  \n  The book intertwines the protagonist's personal life with the politics of the time. Her husband is a campaign manager for a Republican Senate candidate, while she takes a job with the Democratic candidate as a way to retaliate against him during their divorce. The political scene, locations, and local color are well-represented. The author avoids making omniscient remarks about the less polarized nature of 1962 politics, allowing the story to speak for itself.  \n\n- **Pacing and Entertainment Value:**  \n  Like the author's previous book, this one is fast-moving and entertaining.

            "Initially, I perceived Beverly's actions as driven by revenge, but they ultimately serve as a catalyst for her personal growth. I admire how she comes to recognize the value of women beyond her initial circumstances. Michael is another standout character; I love what he represents and his motivations for running for office. Why can't we have more leaders like him in politics? I also appreciated Larry's thoughtful approach during his conversation with Bev at the police station. However, it left me questioning whether Beverly engaged in deeper self-reflection, as women of her era often contributed to the dependency men had on them.",
            "Initially, I was hesitant to dive into a book centered around politics, campaigns, and Washington D.C., especially given the current climate. However, this story offers much more than just a political backdrop. Beverly, a 1960s housewife, embodies a feisty, determined spirit that challenges the status quo and highlights women's strength and significance. Her journey serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of asking for help and allowing others to support us.",
            "I absolutely loved this book—it's likely my favorite by this author so far and definitely one of my top picks for 2024! I can always rely on this author to make me laugh out loud, even in the most inappropriate settings, like quiet doctor's offices, on airplanes, or while my spouse is sleeping beside me."

Despite my initial hesitation about its political backdrop, it delivered so much more, leaving me thoroughly engaged and reflective. Beverly's journey from revenge to growth, coupled with Michael's inspiring character, made this a memorable read. It’s a beautiful reminder of the importance of self-worth, asking for help, and the power of women.",

I think it's probably my favorite Sara Goodman Confino book yet!  \n  - DEFINITELY one of my top books of 2024!  \n  - I can always count on Sara to have me in fits of laughter (out loud) in maybe not the most appropriate places—like quiet doctors' offices, airplanes, or while my husband is sleeping next to me.  \n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n  - Honestly, I was a little leery because politics, campaigns, elections, and Washington DC are all the last things I want to consume more of right now. But, while those all play a piece into this book, there is sooo much more here.  \n  - As a 1960s housewife, Beverly's feisty, get-it-done attitude and strong backbone to ensure she's not being walked over by men lead the way from discomfort to a path of showing women matter and can achieve.  \n  - A beautiful reminder of the importance of asking for help—LETTING others help.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Yes, at first, I think it was all out of revenge, but it provided her an opportunity for growth!  \n  - I appreciate that Beverly sees the worth of women beyond her day at the beginning of the book.  \n  - I can't help but also love Michael, what he stands for, and his reasons for running for office. Why can't we have more Michaels in politics?!?!  \n  - I appreciated the recognition and thought Larry put into the situation with his police station conversation with Bev. But it left me wondering if she did more of her own self-reflections—women of this time period enabled so much of the reliance men have/had on women.  \n\n- **Desire for Continuation:**  \n  - I'd really love more of Beverly and Michael's story! ;-)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a standout for me, blending humor, strong character development, and thought-provoking themes.

However, she soon finds herself genuinely invested in her candidate and dedicates herself to securing the votes necessary for his election. The book offers a compelling exploration of the influence of women's votes and the votes of people of color, particularly in the early 1960s, a time when women had the right to vote but often did not participate.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed Bev's children and her parents, whose roles added significant depth to the narrative. The characters were well-developed, and the fact that all the main characters were Jewish introduced a unique cultural layer to the story.",

It’s a feel-good, funny read that balances humor with meaningful themes.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Beverly, who discovers her husband cheating on her and takes a job with a competing senate campaign to get revenge. She ends up finding her candidate well worth her support and works hard to secure the votes needed for his election.

The characters felt well-developed and added depth to the narrative. It was also interesting that all the main characters were Jewish, which added a unique cultural layer to the story.  \n\n- **Social and Cultural Commentary:**  \n  The book touches on themes of antisemitism, such as an instance at a country club, but it doesn’t seem to significantly impact the candidates in their political roles. This subtle inclusion adds to the story’s authenticity without overshadowing the main plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a feel-good, funny, and thought-provoking novel that combines humor with meaningful political and social commentary.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author and Context:**  \n  This is my first time reading a book by Sara Goodman Confino (SGC). I have loved seeing her books grow in popularity among the niche Peloton Mom’s Book Club and have had her other books on my TBR for ages. When I saw an opportunity to request an ARC for her newest book, I decided it was meant to be and requested a copy.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  *Behind Every Good Man* is a historical women’s fiction novel with a side of wholesome romance. This book gives off major *Marvelous Mrs. Maisel* vibes; you have a strong female lead hell-bent on breaking down patriarchal systems in the 60s, Jewish representation, and political history.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I am convinced that SGC firmly pulled inspiration for Beverly Diamond’s character development from Miriam Maisel, and you cannot convince me otherwise. I adored this book; it was rich in history, humor, politics, Jewish identity, female empowerment, etc.\n\n- **Connection to Other Works:**  \n  I have since learned that SGC’s most recent book published last year, *Don’t Forget to Write*, is a tie-in to this new book, and I have already snagged a copy so I can read more about the elusive and equally interesting Marilyn Kleinman. I really need to hear more about this window-shattering kiss with the rabbi’s son.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you like historical women’s fiction with romance and Jewish representation, this is a book you absolutely should check out. *Behind Every Good Man* comes out on August 6th.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to Lake Union Publishing and NetGalley for the opportunity to review this book; all opinions are my own.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis review highlights the reader’s enthusiasm for *Behind Every Good Man*, praising its strong female lead, historical depth, Jewish representation, and connection to Sara Goodman Confino’s other works. The reader highly recommends it to fans of historical women’s fiction with romance and Jewish themes.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the revenge theme in the story; it was engaging and well-executed, earning a solid 5/5. However, the attempt to intertwine the divorce and senate race plots fell short for me. The divorce narrative overshadowed the political aspect, creating an imbalance. While I recognize that the divorce was central to Bev's journey, I felt the political plot was underdeveloped and cut short. For that reason, I would rate it 3.5/5.",
            "Bev is portrayed as independent and intelligent, yet her character lacks significant development throughout the book. Her unnecessary rudeness towards Stuart, especially when she threatens his job, left a negative impression, as she never offers an apology. While she is genuinely caring towards her children, parents, and friends, I expected her to be more likable, which ultimately affected my feelings about her character. Rating: 3.5/5\n\nThe supporting cast is a highlight of the story. Characters like Nancy, Linda, Michael, the children, and Bev's father are well-developed. Stuart, while decent, is often on the brink of a stress-induced breakdown, which aligns with his character. Larry and Sam serve as effective villains, and Larry's transformation at the end adds a heartwarming touch. Rating: 5/5\n\nThe book features a rich portrayal of Jewish characters and culture, focusing specifically on American Jews without delving into Holocaust survivor narratives. The author commendably emphasizes the significance of minority voters, including women and Black individuals. The female characters are particularly well-written and strong, leaving no room for complaint. Rating: 4/5",
            "This book offers an easy read, occasionally bordering on overly simplistic, making it ideal for a relaxing vacation. The satisfying ending adds to its appeal. Rating: 4/5."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, the book has a strong plot idea and a great supporting cast, but the double plot structure felt unbalanced, and Bev’s character could have been more likable. It’s an easy, enjoyable read with good representation, though somewhat niche in its cultural focus.",

            "What I appreciate about her stories is the consistent growth and empowerment of the female lead. In this narrative, the main character navigates a divorce after discovering her husband's infidelity. Having spent years in the shadows of men in politics, she takes charge by working on the campaign of the Senator opposing her soon-to-be ex's candidate. I admire her determination to become the campaign manager at a time when such roles were rarely held by women, and she proves her critics wrong by excelling in the position. Additionally, I value that the author often features Jewish protagonists. In an era marked by rising anti-Semitism, it's refreshing to see a main character who proudly embraces her Jewish identity. The story subtly addresses the underlying currents of hatred without overtly emphasizing them.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the story and writing in this book. Like the author's previous works, the storytelling captivated me, prompting me to read all three earlier books in just one week. This latest installment was equally engaging, and I finished it in just two days.",

        "conclusion": "*Behind Every Good Man* is a compelling and empowering story set in the early 1960s, featuring a strong female lead who defies societal expectations. While it didn’t quite reach the 5-star level of the author’s previous work, *Don’t Forget To Write*, it was still an enjoyable and inspiring read. The representation of Jewish identity and the subtle handling of anti-Semitism added depth to the narrative. I highly recommend it and look forward to the author's future works.",

            "As a mom of two young boys, I found myself putting this book down frequently, but I never wanted to. Its fast-paced and engaging narrative made it easy to dive back in right where I left off.",
            "The strength of the women in this novel is truly remarkable. Beverley and her mother, Mildred, navigate the challenges of broken marriages during a time when divorce was heavily stigmatized. In an era when women had limited rights and relied on men for credit, home ownership, and financial support, their resilience in facing personal struggles and supporting one another is profoundly inspiring.",
            "I absolutely loved this book! It was the perfect way to kick off the New Year. Light and fun, I felt an immediate connection to the characters, as if I were watching a 1960s-era drama infused with political satire. I could vividly picture them and hear their voices, making the story incredibly immersive. The author's talent for weaving wit into her characters kept me chuckling throughout, adding a delightful layer to the narrative."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I loved this book! It was a great way to start off the New Year. It was light and fun, and from the moment I started reading, I felt as if I knew these characters. It was like watching them in a 1960s-era *Mad Men* meets *Veep* type series. I could picture them and hear their voices, which made the story incredibly immersive.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The strength of the women in this novel stood out to me. Both Beverley and her mother, Mildred, are dealing with marriages that have fallen apart in a time when being a divorcée was stigmatized. Women had very few rights and depended on men for everything from credit to home ownership and financial support. However, the strength these women showed in dealing with their respective issues—and each other—was inspiring.  \n\n- **Humor and Wit:**  \n  Sarah Goodman Confino has a knack for incorporating wit into her characters, which kept me chuckling as I read. The humor added a delightful layer to the story.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Relationships:**  \n  I also loved the men in this book. We saw four different men, each with distinct views on women’s roles both in and out of the home. What I appreciated most was how they all learned to support the women based on the unique needs of their relationships.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  While I had to put this book down over and over (mom of two young boys here), I never really wanted to. It was quick-moving and completely entertaining, making it easy to pick up right where I left off.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful and engaging read, blending humor, strong character development, and a compelling portrayal of relationships in a 1960s setting. The strength of the female characters and the witty writing made it a standout for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Sara Goodman Confino's female characters are strong-willed, confident, and witty. The protagonist, in particular, is compelling as she navigates her husband's betrayal and seeks revenge by working on a political campaign. Her resilience and humor make her one of my favorite characters of all time—I wish she were real so we could hang out.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book offers deep reflections on marriage and politics, set against the backdrop of the 1960s. The commentary on women's roles in marriage during that era is infuriating but serves as a powerful reminder of societal progress. The references to the Kennedy family and '60s fashion add an enjoyable historical layer to the story.\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  Confino's signature humor shines through, even when tackling serious topics. I found myself laughing out loud multiple times, which is a hallmark of her writing style and one of the reasons I love her books.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  While I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I don’t consider it her best work. That honor goes to *Don't Forget to Write*. However, this novel is still great and highly recommendable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a delightful blend of humor, strong character development, and thought-provoking themes. While it may not be Confino's best work, it is still a highly enjoyable read that I would recommend to fans of her writing and newcomers alike.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Beverly Diamond has just discovered her husband in a compromising situation and is ready to end their marriage. As a key aide to a senator, her husband's reputation hangs in the balance—but in the patriarchal landscape of the 1960s, does it truly matter?",

As one of the running senator's right-hand men, his reputation could be on the line—though, given it's the 60s in patriarchal America, is it really on the line?  \n\n- **Character Motivation and Backstory:**  \n  To seek her revenge, Beverly, who has extensive knowledge of the political system due to her father being a former leader, decides to take on the role as the right-hand woman to the opposing party. This is while being a full-time mother and not having worked previously—again, because it's the 60s.  \n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  The story is set in the 1960s, a time when women and people of color were significantly underrepresented in politics. Beverly pairs up with running senator Michael Landau, the newbie on the political block, and they strive to show the underrepresented women and POC of Maryland that, with Michael, they will be represented.  \n\n- **Conflict and Tension:**  \n  What could go wrong with a strong, smart woman working alongside a strong, smart man? I'll let you figure that out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my usual reluctance toward politically themed books, I found this novel engaging and well-crafted.

While this might be an accurate reflection of the time, it makes other aspects of the campaign—such as catering to minorities and underrepresented groups—feel extremely performative. This might just be a reflection of the early 1960s, and the campaign could still be considered progressive for that era.  \n\n- **Exploration of Sex Inequality:**  \n  I appreciated how the story highlighted the profound sex inequality that completely controlled the protagonist’s life and dominated her decision-making. It was refreshing to see her defy that inequality despite the immense challenges.

The main character falls for the first man she meets, even while still married, which contradicted her supposed independence and strength.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the historical setting and exploration of women's rights in the 60s were compelling, the novel fell short in terms of plot development and character consistency. The predictable romance and lack of surprises made it a mediocre read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5/5"

I understood what the author was trying to do, but it ended up feeling like a female using her parents' money and power to make something happen while simultaneously trying to make her cheating ex-husband mad (while still spending all “his” money).  \n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I did listen to this on audiobook, which also didn’t help with the cringe. Maybe reading it would have made a difference.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the theme of female empowerment and am a fan of the author’s previous works, this book fell short for me due to the underdeveloped main character and the cringe-worthy experience of listening to the audiobook.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars because I love this author."
