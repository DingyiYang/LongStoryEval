The plot was intriguing enough to hold my interest, but it often felt convoluted and confusing. I couldn't determine if the complexity was intentional or simply excessive. Although the twists were engaging, they sometimes obscured the overall clarity of the narrative.",

I couldn’t tell if it was intentionally written as a mystery or if it was just overly complicated. The twists, while engaging, sometimes detracted from the overall clarity.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I really liked the characters, especially the friendships. Alex and Anna’s relationships with Olivia stood out to me as particularly well-developed. The dynamics between the characters were a strong point of the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  The hints of romance were so minor that I think they could have been left out entirely. Neither romantic thread went anywhere significant, and (minor spoiler) Anna’s romance couldn’t progress due to the ending. These subplots felt unnecessary and didn’t add much to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Mythology:**  \n  I loved that the story was rooted in Celtic mythology. It’s a refreshing and underutilized theme in literature, and I appreciated the unique perspective it brought to the narrative.  \n\n- **Imagery and Descriptions:**  \n  The imagery and descriptions were fantastic. The author did a great job of creating vivid and immersive scenes that added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was bittersweet, which isn’t my personal preference. While it fit the tone of the story, I didn’t find it entirely satisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was engaging and kept me engrossed while reading, but the convoluted plot and bittersweet ending left me with mixed feelings.

If the author had aged down the characters while maintaining the rest of the story, it would have been an excellent fit for middle-grade or early teen readers. As it is, the narrative feels too juvenile for a young adult novel. Although the characters are meant to be seniors, they read more like 14-year-olds. The premise is intriguing and holds promise, but it would resonate better with a younger audience if the characters' ages aligned with the tone and maturity of the story."

If the author had aged down the characters and kept everything else the same, it would have been a perfect middle-grade or early teen book. As it stands, the story feels too juvenile to be considered a young adult novel. The characters are supposed to be in their senior year, but they come across as 14-year-olds.  \n\n- **Premise and Potential:**  \n  The premise of the story is interesting and has potential. It could work really well for a younger audience if the characters' ages had been adjusted to match the tone and maturity level of the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise is intriguing, the book feels misaligned with its intended young adult audience due to the juvenile tone and characterization. It would have been better suited as a middle-grade or early teen novel with adjusted character ages.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 rounded up to 3."

        "conclusion": "While the book had some engaging elements, such as the well-developed female friendships and a Narnia-like alternate world, the pacing made it a slow read for me. It leaned more toward fantasy than horror, and while the story was enjoyable, it didn’t stand out as particularly memorable. The ending, however, was satisfying, making it a decent recommendation for YA fantasy fans.",
