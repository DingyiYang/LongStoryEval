The heroine's immediate fixation on the reflection prince within just three hours of their first conversation felt baffling and frustrating. Her naivety and unwarranted assumptions about both princes were hard to tolerate. The secondary romance also struggled with consistency, oscillating between developments and setbacks while both characters displayed poor communication. The heroine was particularly exasperating, making impractical decisions, displaying rudeness, and being easily manipulated. Her frequently changing memories, influenced by others' remarks, rendered her unreliable and frustratingly naive. I found it difficult to connect with her character, as her actions often felt embarrassing.",

The heroine’s instant obsession with the \"reflection prince\" within three hours of meeting him, despite having only one actual conversation, was baffling and frustrating. Her naivety and irrational assumptions about both princes were hard to stomach. Even the secondary romance felt inconsistent, leaping forward and then stepping back repeatedly, with both protagonists being messy and terrible at communication.  \n\n- **Characterization (Heroine):**  \n  The heroine was infuriating. She made impractical, out-of-pocket decisions, was rude, and was far too easily manipulated. Her constantly shifting memories, which changed every time someone mentioned something, made her seem unreliable and frustratingly naive.

The characters often come across as contrived, as their actions and allegiances shift just to advance the plot. The concluding moments are particularly disappointing, featuring a cringe-worthy exchange that undermines the story's credibility. Overall, the resolution is unsatisfying and fails to address the many unresolved issues.",

She repeatedly made unwise decisions, displayed a lack of critical thinking skills, and came across as a perpetual victim. Her ongoing misfortunes—ranging from kidnappings to betrayals and poisonings—quickly became repetitive and tiresome. Moreover, her emotional responses, such as losing her virginity shortly after her brothers were executed for her crimes, felt jarring and insensitive. \n\nThe romance was one of the weakest aspects of the book, featuring a poorly executed quasi-love triangle between the Real Prince and the Mirror Prince, with Ying's feelings shifting inconsistently.

The thriller aspect in the beginning was particularly engaging, and I was invested early on.\n\n- **Pacing and Interest:**  \n  However, I began losing interest quickly, possibly around the 30% or 40% mark. The story became boring, and I found myself skimming through parts just to finish it. I even considered DNFing at 60% but decided to push through since I was nearly done.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ying, one of the main characters, became very annoying, and I grew tired of her. I couldn’t care less about her fate or what happened to her. The prince was equally uninteresting, and I saw very little potential in his character.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance between Ying and the prince felt forced and unconvincing. Their transition from enemies to lovers was abrupt and cringe-worthy. The explanations for their feelings didn’t resonate with me, and I didn’t buy into their love story. A certain reveal around the 58% mark made their feelings seem even more sudden and out of place.\n\n- **Tone and Drama:**  \n  The story became overly dramatic at a certain point, making it hard to take seriously. This contributed to my growing boredom and disinterest.\n\n- **Overall Potential:**  \n  The book had a lot of potential with its unique concept, but it ultimately fell flat for me. I was disappointed because I had high hopes for it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started strong with an intriguing concept and engaging thriller elements, it quickly lost my interest due to poor pacing, unlikable characters, and a forced romance. The overly dramatic tone and lack of convincing character development made it a disappointing read overall.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5⭐  \n\nMany thanks to Random House for providing an ARC via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review!"

However, none of these tropes were executed well. They felt randomly tossed into the plot without depth or coherence, making the story feel disjointed and predictable.\n- **Plot Twists:** The plot twists were poorly executed, with no prior allusions or buildup. This lack of foreshadowing made the twists feel forced and elicited frustration rather than surprise.\n- **Dialogue:** The dialogue did not align with the historical fantasy setting. The characters spoke in a modernized manner, including excessive use of the word \"fuck,\" which felt out of place and disrupted the immersion in the historical context.\n- **Integration of Chinese Language:** The use of Chinese words was poorly integrated. The author often included both the pinyin and the English translation side by side, which felt redundant and awkward. For readers familiar with Chinese, this resulted in reading the same word twice, breaking the flow of the narrative. A better approach would have been to allow readers to infer the meaning from context.\n- **Plot and Characters:** The review intentionally avoids delving into the plot and characters, as the reader feels they would be overly critical and harsh in their assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel suffers from poorly executed tropes, forced plot twists, anachronistic dialogue, and awkward integration of Chinese language.

The other characters, like the prince and his mother, are described as honorable or cunning, yet these traits are not convincingly portrayed, leaving them feeling one-dimensional.

However, it is barely fleshed out beyond some dumped worldbuilding through dialogue. The potential of the premise was not fully realized, leaving me disappointed.\n\n- **Dialogue and Setting:**  \n  The modern dialogue is entirely at odds with the historical setting, making it difficult to immerse myself in the kingdom of Jinghu Dao. For example, the prince casually calling people \"man\" felt jarring and took me out of the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Ying, is initially likable but becomes intolerable due to her naivety, irrational decisions, and lack of consequences for her actions. Other characters, such as the prince and his mother, are told to be honorable or cunning, but these traits are not shown effectively, making them feel flat.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  Both romances in the story feel rushed and underdeveloped. The first romance expects the reader to believe Ying fell in love within a day or two, while the second is insufferable due to Ying's extreme and illogical mood swings. The relationships lack depth and feel forced.\n\n- **Pacing and Worldbuilding:**  \n  The book speeds past important elements, such as worldbuilding, which is often reduced to dialogue infodumps. Conversely, it lingers too long on slow or irrelevant scenes, creating an uneven pacing that detracts from the story.\n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The narrative constantly tells the reader how to feel instead of showing, which diminishes emotional engagement. For example, Ying's feelings of betrayal and love are explicitly stated rather than naturally developed, making it hard to connect with her or the plot twists.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot twist is predictable due to heavy-handed foreshadowing, and key moments, such as the refusal to deal with the enemy, feel underdeveloped and frustrating. The story lacks the depth and nuance needed to make these elements impactful.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an intriguing concept and well-done imagery, it falls short in execution.

The idea of a mirror or reflection realm is exciting at first but ultimately becomes boring and confusing. The bigger picture of this realm isn’t explained well, leaving readers unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The plot suffers from poor execution. The twists and turns are bland and predictable, making it feel like the author didn’t intend to surprise readers. The solutions to major conflicts are weak and lack aftermath, leaving the story feeling incomplete. The plot often feels like it exists solely to accompany the romance, which detracts from its potential.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters are insufferable and annoying. The female main character (FMC), Ying, is stubborn, lacks depth, and constantly puts herself in trouble while refusing help. Her instant love for someone she just met feels unrealistic and unearned. The male main character (MMC) is equally uninteresting, with a robotic personality and a lack of growth or initiative. His mysterious miscommunication adds frustration rather than intrigue.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance is trope-y and poorly developed. It features an insta-love dynamic with no chemistry or tension. The love triangle feels forced, and the rapid change of feelings between characters is hard to believe. The romance often distracts from critical scenes, making it feel out of place.  \n\n- **Creativity and Originality:**  \n  The story lacks creativity and originality. It feels like a rehash of familiar tropes with minor changes, making it predictable and uninspired. The author’s debut shows potential, but the lack of fresh ideas is a significant weakness.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had high potential with its intriguing concept but ultimately failed to deliver due to poor execution, weak plot development, and unlikable characters. The romance felt forced and lacked depth, while the story’s predictability and lack of originality left me disappointed.

While the book is action-packed, it feels overly condensed, preventing the plot from fully developing and leaving it somewhat unsatisfying by the end. The rapid pacing urged me to rush through the story, as there was always something happening. I believe the narrative would have benefited from being a duology, providing more space for character and plot growth.",

The romantic elements often required me to suspend my disbelief, detracting from the experience. While the angst and tension felt contrived, I appreciated the concept of the two main characters together, so I accepted it as part of the narrative. The prince’s jealousy toward his mirrored self, reflecting his insecurities, was the most compelling nuance in the romance."

The character dynamics are complex and engaging, exploring themes of arranged marriage, enemies-to-lovers, and betrayal.",
            "I was truly captivated by the exceptional quality of the writing. From the very first pages, the book immersed me in an eerily beautiful world that is both creepy and haunting. The author’s skill in crafting a setting where nothing is quite as it appears is truly masterful.",

            "This book masterfully employs a diverse array of tropes, such as arranged marriage, royalty, enemies-to-lovers, instant love, slow burn, one bed, one horse, one dragon, kidnapping, magic, and prophecy. Each element is seamlessly integrated into the narrative, enriching the overall reading experience.",

Keshe Chow’s ability to create a setting where not everything is as it seems is masterful.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story had me guessing my loyalties constantly. Just when I thought I was right and could trust someone, BAM, they showed me otherwise. The plot is filled with twists and surprises that kept me hooked from the first word to the last.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Ying, the protagonist, is betrothed to the son of the Emperor, a political and customary arrangement. She initially believes the Prince to be cold and unfeeling, but as strange things begin to happen—especially when she looks at her reflection—she discovers a whole new world lurking behind the mirrored glass. The dynamics between characters are complex and intriguing, with themes of arranged marriage, enemies to lovers, and betrayal.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world Chow creates is rich and immersive, blending elements of Asian YA fantasy and mythology with magic, alchemy, and dragons. The mirror world concept is particularly fascinating and adds a unique layer to the story.\n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The book incorporates a variety of tropes, including arranged marriage, royalty, enemies to lovers, instant love, slow burn, one bed, one horse, one dragon, kidnapping, magic, and prophecy.

            "The story's central concept was intriguing, but it was hindered by its characters, romance, and pacing issues. Although I enjoyed the initial chapters, the overall execution left me frustrated and fatigued by the conclusion.",
            "The introduction of the Crown Prince marked a significant turning point, resulting in a loss of tension and horror. Ying's dislike for him felt unconvincing, and her sudden affection for his Mirror counterpart lacked proper justification. The resulting bizarre and poorly developed love triangle became a disappointing focal point of the plot. None of the characters, including Ying, felt authentic or well-developed, making it difficult to connect with or care about their actions and relationships. The chemistry among the characters was absent, and the author’s attempts to convey it felt forced. This lack of emotional depth rendered the romance unengaging and frustrating to read.",
            "The horror elements were initially captivating, with Ying's reflection inducing genuine creepiness and establishing a tense atmosphere. While the book may attract fans of instant love stories—especially with the dual love plot—it ultimately didn't resonate with me."

I was genuinely creeped out by the way Ying's reflection terrorized her, creating a tense and unsettling atmosphere.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The introduction of the Crown Prince marked a turning point where the tension and horror were lost. Ying's decision to dislike him felt unconvincing, and her immediate love for the Crown Prince's Mirror counterpart lacked justification. The romance, which formed a bizarre and poorly developed love triangle, became a central but disappointing part of the plot.  \n\n- **Character Authenticity:**  \n  None of the characters, including Ying, felt genuine or well-developed. This lack of authenticity extended beyond the four central characters (Ying, Mirror Ying, Crown Prince, Mirror Prince), making it difficult to connect with or care about their actions and relationships.  \n\n- **Chemistry and Emotional Investment:**  \n  There was no natural chemistry between the characters, and the author's attempts to convey it felt forced. This lack of emotional depth made the romance unengaging and frustrating to read.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Execution:**  \n  The central concept of the story was intriguing, but it felt bogged down by the characters, the romance, and pacing issues. While the first few chapters were enjoyable, the overall execution left me feeling frustrated and tired by the end.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  The book may appeal to readers who enjoy instant love stories (doubled in this case), but it ultimately did not resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel began with a strong and eerie horror premise but quickly lost its momentum due to an unconvincing romance, underdeveloped characters, and pacing issues.

While I typically enjoy these elements, their combination here felt frustrating. Furthermore, the author frequently told us about the characters' chemistry instead of demonstrating it, which hindered my ability to feel their connection.",

However, the execution lacks depth in character development and worldbuilding. Key elements like the mirror world, prophecy, songs, and myths receive only fleeting mentions, while the magic system remains vague until the conclusion. I would have appreciated a more in-depth exploration through snippets of myths, extensive research by the main character, and insights from varied sources to enrich our understanding of the magic in both realms.",

Additionally, the author often told us about the chemistry between characters instead of showing it, making it hard to feel the connection.  \n- **Concept and Execution:**  \n  The concept was strong, blending portal fantasy with Chinese lore and introducing evil versions of the characters.

I thought Ying would realize that sealing the mirror people away was no better than their own actions, but this moral complexity was overlooked.\n\n- **Villain Perception:**  \n  It was hard to see the mirror people as villains when their behavior was a direct result of mimicking humans.

            "In this captivating tale, Ying finds herself in a bewildering world of mirrors where trust is elusive for both her and the reader. With limited information, she navigates her challenges and faces adversity with admirable resilience. At no point did I feel frustrated with her choices; instead, her decisions felt authentic and justified. The characters are relatable and deeply human, embodying the kindness and love that Ying has always longed for.",
            "The author exhibits remarkable worldbuilding in their debut novel, maintaining my engagement throughout. As Ying navigates the dynamics of the mirror world alongside the “real” world, the reader experiences this learning curve with her. Whenever I had a question about the workings of this reality, so did Ying, creating a seamless exploration of this captivating universe.",
            "This novel explores the unsettling idea of your reflection taking independent action, blurring the line between reality and illusion. It will leave you questioning the trustworthiness of your mirror—if you ever had any to begin with. The tension rises throughout, creating moments of palpable danger that keep you on edge.",
            "I couldn't put this novel down and finished it in one sitting. The tension builds gradually, leaving you uncertain about who will survive until the end. One particular scene shocked me to my core and significantly raised the stakes."

The initial portion is highly engaging, offering a horror-like atmosphere that evokes genuine chills. The suspense surrounding trust and the constant red flags from characters keep the reader absorbed. However, the second half feels less compelling. The ending leans towards the cheesy, reminiscent of the \"and then everyone clapped\" meme, and leaves several questions unanswered. While the two antagonists are imprisoned, their immortality undermines this resolution. Similarly, the mirror people are simply pushed back into their world, which feels inadequate. These sentient beings, cursed as reflections, leave the story's conclusion unsettlingly unresolved, as it implies a return to normalcy for the characters without addressing the deeper implications of their plight.",

The romance was lovely, though it wasn’t my favorite aspect of the story—not because it was bad, but because everything else was simply exceptional.  \n\n- **Overall Uniqueness and Recommendation:**  \n  This book is one of the most unique I’ve read this year, and I have no doubt it will be in my top 3. I highly recommend it and am excited to see what the author writes next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations with its unique world-building, intricate plot, and compelling characters. Despite my initial hesitation, I found it to be a standout read that I’ll remember for a long time.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nActual rating: 4.5 stars"

The plot also lacks coherence, making it feel messy at times. Nevertheless, the book remains an enjoyable read for those looking for a fun East Asian fantasy.",
            "While the protagonist is portrayed as a strong female character, she comes across as frustratingly naive and easily deceived, which ultimately undermines her strength. The characters, including both the protagonist and the villains, lack depth and are one-dimensional, each driven by a single, simplistic goal. Ying’s transformation from a human girl to a phoenix feels superficial, suggesting she hasn't genuinely evolved from her starting point. Additionally, the relationship between the protagonist and the prince is underdeveloped; it's hard to believe she falls for him in just 15 days after initially despising him. Their declaration of love feels abrupt and unrealistic, especially given their earlier assertion that love has no place in royal marriages."

The real Prince appeared only briefly, and the insta-love with the mirror Prince felt forced and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was uneven, with too much focus on mundane details like wedding prep and not enough on meaningful plot development. The story lacked depth and failed to engage me.  \n\n- **Tone and Writing Style:**  \n  The writing felt juvenile and unconvincing. The lack of reasoning behind events made the story feel arbitrary and boring.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book did not work for me. The lack of coherent plot, world-building, and character development, combined with the juvenile writing style, made it difficult to stay engaged. I ultimately stopped reading at page 270 because the story felt flat and unbelievable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

The idea with the mirrors and the reflections had a spooky touch, which was really nice for the season. I was hoping for more of that throughout the story.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The story took a more classic turn, which could have worked just fine since the idea wasn’t that bad. However, it didn’t deliver on the initial promise, and by the end, I felt like I had read something completely different from what I expected.  \n\n- **Characterization (Main Character):**  \n  The main character, Ying, was insufferable. She cried a lot, complained excessively, and constantly blamed others. Her naivety made her even more frustrating, and she had no redeeming qualities that made me sympathize with her.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  I kept reading because I don’t like to DNF (Did Not Finish) a book, but the experience was disappointing overall. There was a nice starting point, but the story didn’t live up to its potential.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing and spooky concept at the beginning, it failed to maintain that momentum.

            "The plot is intriguing and creates a genuinely creepy atmosphere, particularly with the terrifying concept of mirrors. The scene where the main character is dragged through a mirror by her hair is chilling, as is the notion of being trapped in a mirror world. The line, “[we're] perfectly mimicking you. If you don’t notice, we’re doing our job well,” sent shivers down my spine and made me wary of mirrors afterward. However, the overall pacing felt rushed—not just in the romance, but throughout the plot. The story would have benefited from being a duology or trilogy, allowing for more extensive world-building and character development. Many key plot points were rushed, leaving the story feeling condensed and underdeveloped.",
            "The main character often frustrated me with her naive and impulsive decisions, particularly her unwarranted trust in her reflection. It took her far too long to recognize its malevolent nature, which felt unrealistic given the context. I appreciated when the prince confronted her about her irritating naivety and hypocrisy. Her sassy, dismissive comments toward him, particularly telling him to seek concubines because she could never love him, made her come across as unsympathetic. However, I was impressed when she attempted to stab her reflection’s heart, indicating some character growth. \n\nThe romance was the weakest aspect of the book, characterized by poorly executed instalove on two fronts. The relationships felt rushed and inadequately developed, to the extent that I found myself hoping one of the love interests would turn out to be a villain. The love triangle involving the prince and the mirror prince was amusing yet underwhelming, with the main character flip-flopping between affections too quickly, rendering the relationships superficial. Overall, the romance seemed hurriedly included to fulfill the love triangle trope, leaving both pairings lacking in depth and attention."

The insta-love trope with the mirror prince feels painfully forced and poorly executed, especially when his villainous nature is so apparent.",

The subplot involving Ying as the prophesied fish was particularly confusing, especially her transformations into a fish, then a dragon, and finally a phoenix.

            "The central love triangle felt underwhelming, as both love interests lacked maturity, especially in contrast to Ying's sheltered upbringing. For a nearly 500-page novel, I anticipated greater development in the romantic relationships. Since I found it challenging to invest in the romance, I hoped for stronger platonic and familial dynamics as a compensation.",

Although it draws from folkloric roots and an imperial backdrop, the characters’ dialogue often comes across as jarringly modern. While Ying's lenient upbringing is briefly mentioned, it fails to convincingly account for her headstrong demeanor, disregard for court procedures, and unusually advanced sexual knowledge, all of which feel anachronistic for the time period.",
            "The novel's premise, steeped in obscure Chinese folklore, captivated me. The idea of a mirror world existing alongside our own, featuring reincarnation and shapeshifting, presents intriguing possibilities. I admired the chilling details, particularly the pain that mirror beings experience when deviating from their real-world counterparts and the repercussions of neglecting their duties. These elements beautifully illustrate the contrasts of both worlds, making Ying's fascination with the mirror realm and Mirror Ying's yearning to return to reality particularly compelling. However, I wished these themes had been explored with greater emphasis throughout the story."

I was hoping to find one—just one—YA five-star read for 2024. Unfortunately, this book turned out to be YA in every negative sense of the word.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The first 50% of the book was an absolute slog to get through. It was uneventful and lacked the excitement I was hoping for.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ying, the main character, is one of the most insufferable MCs I've ever come across. She's annoying and constantly makes dumb decisions that put her into trouble. The characters lacked chemistry, and the initial 'love triangle' was absolutely terrible and not believable.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style bothered me throughout the book. The prose is juvenile, and the dialogue was cringy and too modern, standing in stark contrast with the historical-esque setting.\n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The plot itself was very weak and predictable. I could see most of the twists coming, and watching Ying fall into such traps over and over again was extremely frustrating as a reader. The concept of a mirror world was very cool and had so much potential but was totally butchered. There were quite a few glaringly obvious plot holes that were not explained.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Just as I was starting to enjoy the book a bit more with the high stakes and all, the conclusion was disappointing. In a shocking turn of events, the thing that saves the world from its downfall is *gasp* THE POWER OF LOVE!!! This particular plot device has aged like milk for me. Love that is not even believable saving the world is just incredible.\n\n- **Author Potential:**  \n  Overall, I feel like Keshe Chow had all the ingredients for an amazing story but got the recipe wrong. The author definitely has potential, though, and can definitely put out great stories.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my high expectations, *The Girl With No Reflection* fell short in many areas, including pacing, character development, writing style, and plot execution. While the concept had potential, the execution left much to be desired. However, I believe the author has the potential to create compelling stories in the future.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n🌟🌟/5"

Additionally, her frequent crying and inconsistent actions detracted from her characterization.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Lore:**  \n  I really liked the concept of the mirror world and its lore, which was described by Mei Po, a side character and my favorite in the novel. The idea of why the mirror world is forced to mimic the real world was intriguing. I also enjoyed the prophecy surrounding Ying, the FMC, and how it all came together. The message of the story was quite touching, and it was the mystery and lore that kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Execution and Writing Style:**  \n  Unfortunately, the book fell flat in its execution. While it had the potential to be a good story, it was ruined by juvenile writing that bordered on cringe territory. The writing felt lazy, especially when convenient plot devices were used to move the story forward without proper buildup or justification.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were one-dimensional and lacked depth. Ying, the FMC, was particularly frustrating. Her development felt forced and unearned, as things conveniently happened to her whenever she faced challenges. I also didn’t like how often she cried or how her actions sometimes felt inconsistent with her character.  \n\n- **Romance Plot:**  \n  The romance was a major letdown. It felt like insta-love and was executed poorly. The FMC and MMC’s relationship was inconsistent and often out of character. One moment they would hate each other, and the next they would be in a full-on makeout scene. The romance also happened at inappropriate moments, such as during serious or emotional scenes, which made it feel jarring and disconnected from the story.  \n\n- **Villains:**  \n  The villains were predictable and generic, lacking any real complexity or depth. This made their actions and the overall conflict feel underwhelming.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  There was a betrayal scene that should have been impactful, but because there was no buildup or emotional connection to the characters, I felt nothing. It was hard to care about what was happening.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a lot of potential with its intriguing concept and lore, but it was ultimately let down by poor execution, one-dimensional characters, a forced and inconsistent romance, and lazy writing. It’s one of my most disappointing reads of 2024.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The action scenes, featuring Ying battling creatures, facing imprisonment, and attempting to repair the barrier, held promise but ultimately fell flat, lacking excitement and engagement. The pacing felt sluggish, making it hard to remain invested in the story. Set in a royal court, the novel combines mythic fantasy with an enemy-to-lovers trope centered around an arranged marriage. Ying Yue is poised to marry the crown prince, Shan Zhang Lin, and while the premise is intriguing—especially with Ying discovering a parallel world through palace mirrors and encountering the prince’s kinder reflection—the execution becomes muddled and underwhelming. As tensions rise and a revenge quest unfolds, the resulting twists and turns feel tedious and predictable, detracting from the overall experience.",
            "The characters fail to make a lasting impression. Ying Yue comes across as careless and overly emotional, lacking meaningful depth. The antagonistic elements of the relationship are underdeveloped, while the romantic subplot feels stiff and often forced, leading to moments of frustration.",

            "The writing style often felt redundant, with the author occasionally reiterating points but elaborating on them more effectively later. The author’s love for nature shines through; their vivid descriptions of a first day spent among willow branches and exotic blooms create a lush atmosphere. However, this richness is undermined by a lack of confidence in the reader, resulting in both showing and telling. The tone appears inconsistent, combining youthful young adult descriptions with more mature language and scenes. Ying, in particular, struggles with this inconsistency—while it’s easy to sympathize with an impulsive character, her erratic behavior makes it difficult to connect with her.",

Ying, in particular, suffered from this inconsistency; while it’s not hard to get behind an impulsive character, it is hard to get behind an erratic one.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style often felt redundant, with the author telling something and then elaborating in a much better way. For example: “She’d always loved nature…Her first day had been spent trailing her hand through willow branches, breathing in the lush fragrance of the abundant exotic blooms…” It seemed like Chow lacked confidence in the reader, resulting in both showing AND telling.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book could stand to lose about 20% of its wandering narrative. The pacing felt uneven, and more time should have been spent developing the characters.  \n\n- **Concept and Potential:**  \n  Overall, the concept was interesting, but the execution didn’t fully deliver on its potential.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile “The Girl with No Reflection” had a promising start and an intriguing concept, its inconsistent tone, redundant writing style, and uneven pacing made it difficult to stay engaged.

The antagonists, Reflection Ying and the Mirror Prince, have significant potential but are underutilized and disappear midway through the story, which feels like a missed opportunity.

The eerie vibe of the Mirror World, especially when Ying sees her own reflection, was captivating and hooked me immediately.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ying began as a fierce and determined protagonist, but her character felt inconsistent as the story progressed. She came across as naive and overly quick to judge, which diminished my connection to her.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance felt rushed and unconvincing. Ying falls deeply for a character after only three conversations, which made the relationship seem forced and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Plot and Prophecy:**  \n  The prophecy element was confusing and underdeveloped. The “chosen one” angle lacked sufficient explanation, leaving me unsure of why or how Ying fit into it. Additionally, the inclusion of random “fish” references added to the confusion.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The Mirror World was the strongest aspect of the novel. Its eerie and mysterious atmosphere was compelling, but I wished the story had explored its secrets and intricacies more deeply.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Girl with No Reflection* had a strong start with its eerie Mirror World and initial intrigue, it ultimately fell flat due to inconsistent character development, a rushed romance, and a confusing plot. The world-building showed potential but wasn’t fully realized, leaving me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 ⭐️"

Her tumultuous relationship with the prince serves as a central theme, creating a compelling internal conflict between her desires and responsibilities.

The intriguing history of the mirror world is enhanced by a touch of horror that adds depth. Although the map is beautifully illustrated, it seems superfluous since the characters do not traverse the empire extensively. While there are diverse settings, they are not fully explored.",
            "This book beautifully balances sweetness and melancholy, especially in the tender interactions between characters. Ying's unwavering loyalty and love for those around her are refreshing, as she remains committed to even the background figures.

Despite ample clues and significant red flags, Ying often seems oblivious or dismissive, making the eventual plot twist feel unremarkable. Additionally, while much of the narrative unfolds in the royal palace, the court intrigue is surprisingly minimal. Although the author attempts to introduce this element in the second half, it feels abrupt and jarring.",
            "The characters were quite frustrating. The protagonist, Ying Yue, is outspoken and assertive—traits I typically admire in strong female characters. However, she also comes across as impulsive, stubborn, and naïve, often neglecting the consequences of her actions. Initially, I felt sympathy for her due to her mistreatment and isolation, which helped me understand some of her choices. Yet, as the story unfolded and secrets were revealed, her naiveté persisted, undermining her growth. She acknowledges her flaws, but her actions often contradict her words.\n\nThe prince's character development is marked, transitioning from cold indifference to deep admiration for Ying. While we eventually learn the reasons behind his earlier behavior, this backstory is primarily conveyed through exposition rather than shown, which diminishes its impact.\n\nIn contrast, the mirror characters offer a more intriguing perspective, reflecting both the virtues and flaws of their human counterparts. I wished the author had explored their depth further, as I felt their potential was underutilized. Unfortunately, the romance fell flat for me; there was a lack of chemistry between the characters. Their attraction seemed forced, especially since the prince initially couldn't distinguish between Ying and her mirror self. I needed more buildup to believe in their connection, as the rapid shifts in their feelings became exhausting to follow.",

The author does an amazing job in the beginning at keeping the reader in suspense.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were really frustrating. Our main FL character, Ying Yue, is outspoken and assertive, which I usually love in strong female characters. However, she is also very impulsive, stubborn, naïve, and doesn’t really think about the consequences of her actions. In the beginning, I was sympathetic towards her—being locked up and neglected, I understood her desires and how it impacted certain decisions she made. However, as secrets are slowly revealed, she continues to be naïve and stubborn. The character even acknowledges these traits, but her actions don’t reflect the maturity of her words.  \n  As for the prince, his growth was very drastic. He goes from being cold and indifferent to being enamored by her. Later, we do find out why he was so uncaring, but again, it was a lot of telling rather than showing.  \n  The mirror characters, though, were definitely a bit more interesting. Their reflection of the human counterparts really shows both the good and ugly of human beings. I wished the author had dived more into these mirror characters, as I felt she only touched the surface of their potential.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance, unfortunately, lacked chemistry for me. The characters barely knew each other. The prince couldn’t even tell the difference between Ying and the mirror Ying in the beginning, and yet they are instantly attracted to one another. For me, I needed more of a buildup. The drastic changes in their feelings were very tiresome to read.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  There were a lot of twists, but they were really predictable. There were so many clues and HUGE red flags, but Ying was either too dense to see it coming or would just brush it aside to ponder it for another time. So, when the plot twist finally happens, it’s not really unexpected.  \n  I also found it strange that a lot of the story takes place at the royal palace, but there was very minimal court intrigue. I think the author tried towards the second half of the novel, but it just felt really sudden and out of place.  \n\n- **Setting and Dialogue:**  \n  The tone of the novel didn’t really match the setting of the dynasty era. The use of modern dialogue really took me out of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI really wanted to like this novel. It had such a promising premise, and I think the author has really good ideas and concepts. I can see people really enjoying the spooky, fantasy aspect of the novel. Unfortunately, this story just wasn’t for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.7 stars (rounded up to 3 stars)"

            "Although I predicted the plot twists before Ying did, I thoroughly enjoyed the journey. The story was engaging, and the pacing kept me captivated throughout.",
            "Initially, Ying's naivety was quite frustrating. I predicted each betrayal, and her persistent trust in others—despite repeated disappointments—was exasperating. Yet, her innocence and bravery eventually made her a lovable character, and her evolution into a strong, independent protagonist was genuinely compelling. The romance, rooted in classic enemies-to-lovers tropes (such as the shared bed, wound-cleaning scenes, and the \"I hate you but you're attractive\" dynamic), was surprisingly enjoyable and engaging.",
            "The writing was compelling and enhanced my overall enjoyment of the book.",
            "The integration of Chinese culture was both refreshing and skillfully executed. The use of metaphors, dragons, fish, and yin and yang enriched the narrative and added a unique flair. The world-building struck a perfect balance, providing ample information at just the right moments to keep the plot engaging and immersive without becoming overwhelming.",
            "The hanging of Ying's brothers comes across as emotionally jarring and excessive, especially since their names were never introduced to us. This element feels unnecessarily heavy within the narrative."

        "conclusion": "This book came at the perfect time, pulling me out of a reading slump. It was an enjoyable read with a mix of love, war, and cultural richness. It changed my perspective on standalone novels and featured a protagonist with a remarkable transformation. Despite a few flaws, it was a well-crafted and memorable story.",

It’s been a long time since a fantasy book gripped me so intensely.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ying):**  \n  At the beginning, Ying was somewhat annoying due to her naivety. I foresaw every betrayal, and there were many. It was frustrating how she kept trusting people despite being repeatedly betrayed. However, her naivety and bravery made her endearing, and her transformation into a strong, independent female protagonist was compelling.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  While I saw the plot twists coming before Ying did, I still enjoyed the journey. The story was engaging, and the pacing kept me hooked.  \n\n- **Cultural Elements:**  \n  The incorporation of Chinese culture was refreshing and well-executed. The use of metaphors, dragons, fish, and yin and yang added depth and uniqueness to the story.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was well-balanced—not overwhelming, but with just enough information at the right times to make the plot understandable and immersive.  \n\n- **Standalone Nature:**  \n  I usually prefer sagas because I feel one book isn’t enough when I love the characters. However, this standalone novel made me realize that sometimes less is more. The story felt complete, and the characters got their well-deserved happy ending.  \n\n- **Chosen One Trope:**  \n  I’m a fan of the “chosen one” trope, and this book delivered it perfectly. Watching the protagonist rise to the occasion was satisfying.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The hanging of Ying’s brothers felt unnecessarily heavy and emotionally jarring. Since we didn’t even know their names, it seemed like an excessive addition to the story.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The love story followed classic enemies-to-lovers clichés (one bed, wound-cleaning, “I hate you but you’re hot”), but it was executed in a way that felt enjoyable and engaging.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was strong and contributed to the overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book came at the perfect time, pulling me out of a reading slump. It was an enjoyable read with a mix of love, war, and cultural richness. It changed my perspective on standalone novels and featured a protagonist with a remarkable transformation.

            "This book suffers from repetition and unnecessary length, detracting from the overall experience and causing certain sections to feel drawn out. Some events unfold too quickly, leaving the reader struggling to grasp their context or significance. The story centers on Ying Yue, who discovers a mirror world on the eve of her wedding day. In a desperate bid to escape her reality, she trades places with her reflection, only to unearth dark secrets about the imperial family and the mirror realm. The concept of the mirror world, along with its history and the curse on the palace, is both unique and fantastical, making for an engaging read. Additionally, the portal fantasy element, featuring Ying's travels through reflective surfaces, adds an intriguing layer to the narrative.",
            "Ying experiences notable growth, shifting her focus from self-centeredness to a broader perspective. She enhances her ability to read people and learn whom to trust, though she still makes occasional missteps. Despite her development, Ying often appears selfish and obnoxious, prioritizing her own feelings while neglecting to acknowledge her flaws in critiquing others. The Prince, a moody and brooding character, provides a unique counterbalance to Ying, adding depth to their dynamic.",

This aspect was intriguing and well-executed.  \n\n- **Opening Chapters:**  \n  The first few chapters were fantastic. The horror of the moving reflection was set up brilliantly, and I was genuinely excited to see how it would unfold.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements (Insta-Love):**  \n  The insta-love was a major letdown. The main character fell in love with men within hours, which felt unrealistic and shallow. It seemed like the relationships were based solely on physical attraction and one meaningful-ish conversation, which didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Intimate/Kissing Scenes:**  \n  The intimate scenes were cringe-worthy, especially the emperor moaning in front of his subjects and the excessive PDA in inappropriate settings. The prince and his mirror counterpart moaning into the MC’s mouth every time was over-the-top and uncomfortable.  \n\n- **Main Character (MC):**  \n  The MC was frustrating. She alternated between overthinking and underthinking, diving headfirst into action while trying to strategize ineffectively. This made her come across as shallow and inconsistent. Her lack of meaningful connections with other characters, like Li Meng or her family, further highlighted her superficiality.  \n\n- **Setting and Supporting Cast:**  \n  While I enjoy royal court and political intrigue, the confined setting and lack of a robust supporting cast made the story feel unfulfilling. The additional characters were underdeveloped, like sprinkles on raw dough that didn’t add much to the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Genre Balance:**  \n  The book leaned heavily into romance and physical attraction, which overshadowed the fantasy elements. If you’re looking for a romantasy focused on spice, this might work for you. However, if you prefer a fantasy novel with romance as a secondary element, this isn’t the right choice.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI had high hopes for this book based on the cover and synopsis, but it ultimately fell short.

Keshe Chow's depiction of the enigmatic Mirror Universe and the intricate world-building and history between Ying's familiar world and the new realm she encounters were particularly engaging.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  While the Mirror World is detailed and abundant with information, I felt there was a lack of exploration in Ying's 'real' world, leaving a significant gap in the overall world-building. This imbalance made the setting feel incomplete to me.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing in the beginning was perfect, with Ying questioning and unraveling the mysteries of the Mirror World. However, the story slowed down around chapters 15-20, which didn’t align with my preferences. The unexpected twist at the conclusion redeemed the pacing issues for me.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I struggled to connect with the main characters. The Prince’s immature and disrespectful behavior made it hard for me to empathize with him, even after learning his backstory. While Ying is portrayed as a strong, capable female character, I felt she lacked depth despite her significant development.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers plot felt contrived and lacked tension. The romance seemed rushed and was one of the quickest I’ve read, making it less believable and authentic, especially within this trope.\n\n- **Language and Dialogue:**  \n  The modern dialogue clashed with the Chinese Fantasy Kingdom setting, which is rich in folklore and mythology. This inconsistency made it challenging for me to fully immerse myself in the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept and initial world-building were captivating, the uneven pacing, underdeveloped characters, rushed romance, and mismatched dialogue detracted from my overall enjoyment. Despite these issues, the unexpected twist at the end was a highlight. This genre may not be my cup of tea, but I believe it will resonate with many other readers.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot unfolds in a formulaic and predictable manner, rendering both romantic moments and plot twists unsurprising and emotionally flat. Ying's role in advancing the storyline is diminished, as she receives solutions with little effort, and her choices often lead to negative outcomes for others without consequences for herself.",
            "In this story, the protagonist Ying struggles with a vague sense of want, goal, or character arc, which hinders readers' ability to connect with her journey. Her characterization feels one-dimensional, relying on clichéd tropes such as \"I'm not like other girls\" and \"horny,\" without any depth or engaging development. Despite being 18, her mental maturity and reasoning resemble that of a 12-year-old, leading to discomfort during more explicit scenes. The secondary characters are similarly underdeveloped, defined solely by superficial traits like “possessive” for Mirror Prince, “jealous” for Prince Zhang, and “evil” for Reflection-Ying.",
            "The dialogue is filled with clichés and anachronistic modern social values that conflict with the historical Imperial Chinese setting."

        "conclusion": "‘The Girl with No Reflection’ has an intriguing premise but falls short due to inadequate character development, predictable plot progression, and cliché dialogue. The lack of depth in both the protagonist and secondary characters, combined with anachronistic elements, makes it difficult for readers to become emotionally invested in the story. While the novel shows potential, it feels unfinished and in need of substantial editing.",

            "The characters lack depth. The real Prince starts off as brutish and harsh towards Ying, but this serves merely as a thin façade for his true self. His subsequent reveal feels predictable. Likewise, Ying comes across as simplistic, which may stem from my perspective as an adult reading a YA novel with young protagonists. Her trust in the Mirror Prince feels unearned; while she questions the real Prince's motives, her bond with the Mirror Prince remains underdeveloped. The real Prince at least exhibits relatable motives for the greater good, whereas the Mirror Prince feels flat and lacking in substance.",
            "I appreciated the writing style and found the concept to be an enjoyable journey. However, I would have preferred a more mature voice to better align with the fun premise. Had I read this during my college or high school years, I likely would have loved it even more.",
            "The world-building in this story felt rushed, with important back lore—such as the connections between fish, dragons, and phoenixes— glossed over rather than fully explored. This lack of depth diminished the atmosphere, leading me to draw comparisons to *Six Crimson Cranes*, a reference I’d prefer to avoid. Overall, the narrative would have benefited from a more thorough development.",
            "The portrayal of princes leaning against doorways felt clichéd, but I was captivated by the idea that mermaid stories stem from glimpses of the reflection world. This intriguing concept prompted me to pause and ponder its possibilities. I hope the author explores this idea further in a future novel."

However, I would have preferred a more mature voice to match such a fun concept. If I were in my college or high school years, I probably would have loved this more.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot is simple but drawn out too long, with many roadblocks that divert from the main goal of closing the barrier. These hurdles often felt like distractions rather than enhancements to the characters' journey.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are very simple. The real Prince starts off brutish and harsh toward Ying, but it’s a paper-thin façade to protect himself. When his deeper layers are revealed, it felt predictable. Ying, too, was shallow and lacked depth. This might be because I’m an adult reading a YA novel with 17-22-year-old protagonists, but it still felt too simplistic.\n\n- **World Building:**  \n  The world-building felt rushed. Some of the back lore, like the connections between fish, dragons, and phoenixes, was glossed over instead of fully explored. I didn’t feel a strong vibe or atmosphere, which made me compare it to *Six Crimson Cranes*, something I don’t like doing. It could have been more fleshed out.\n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  Ying’s trust in the Mirror Prince felt unearned. While she questions the real Prince’s motives, the Mirror Prince’s connection with her didn’t feel fully developed. The real Prince at least felt like a tangible person with motives for the greater good, whereas the Mirror Prince felt flat.\n\n- **Tropes and Originality:**  \n  The princes leaning against doorways felt forced and tropey. However, I loved the concept that mermaid stories originated from glimpses into the reflection world. This one line was so cool that I had to pause and let my mind wander around the idea. I hope Chow explores this in another novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a decent debut with a lot of originality.

            "*The Girl with No Reflection* is a captivating third-person YA epic fantasy romance set in a world inspired by Imperial China. The story centers on Ying Yue, who is wed to the future emperor, Zhang Lin. Desperate for change, she strikes a deal with her reflection to swap places, only to discover that her reflection has no intention of aiding her. With its intriguing premise, the novel deftly weaves together themes of fantasy, romance, identity, and deception.",
            "The slow-burn romance is masterfully executed. Initially, Ying perceives Zhang as cold, but her feelings shift when she encounters his mirror image in the mirror world. After returning and witnessing her reflection's betrayal, she spends more time with Zhang, gradually uncovering his positive traits. The contrast between the charismatic, manipulative mirror prince and the genuine, reserved Zhang adds depth to their relationship. As we peel back Zhang's layers, his motivations become clear, reinforcing why he is the better choice. The mirror prince’s manipulative tactics—such as love-bombing and subtle control—offer a crucial lesson for teen readers about recognizing predatory behavior in romance. His actions underscore the risks of falling for someone who seems perfect but has hidden motives. This dynamic is both captivating and educational.",
            "A standout element of the story is its incorporation of Chinese folklore, especially the tale of carps transforming into dragons. This folklore blends seamlessly with fantasy tropes, including the Chosen One narrative. The connection to Ying’s family, who guide carps to the gate for their transformation, adds both cultural richness and personal significance to the narrative.",

Additionally, the pacing could benefit from addressing and smoothing out inconsistencies.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n  - The novel is a Young Adult romantic fantasy with an Asian-inspired setting.  \n  - The title initially suggested a vampire theme, but the story introduced a unique concept of cursed mirror versions of characters.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  - The female protagonist, Ying, is strong, self-reliant, and skilled in combat.  \n  - The love interest involves an original twist: two princes who are the same person but one is the mirror version.  \n  - Character development felt inconsistent at times, with abrupt shifts in behavior (e.g., cold in one chapter, hot in the next, then cold again).  \n  - A specific example highlighted the inconsistency: Ying’s actions and the prince’s reactions during the cabin scene felt illogical and pulled me out of the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story includes familiar tropes like the “only one bed” scenario, which was used to develop the relationship between Ying and the real Prince Zhang.  \n  - Certain plot choices felt contrived to facilitate specific scenes, such as the cabin scene, which was important for building affection but lacked logical setup.  \n  - The pacing could have been improved by revisiting and smoothing out inconsistencies.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The world presented by Keshe Chow has potential but could be more fleshed out.  \n  - The concept of mirror versions and the cursed reflection is intriguing and leaves room for further exploration in future stories.  \n\n- **Language and Accessibility:**  \n  - I appreciated the inclusion of non-English words but missed a translation list, which would have enhanced understanding.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel despite its flaws. The unique concept, strong protagonist, and romantic elements were engaging, but inconsistencies in character development and plot logic occasionally pulled me out of the story. With more polish and deeper world-building, this could have been an even stronger book. I would be interested in seeing more stories set in this world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "Set in a land that once thrived on magic, now dimmed after an ancient emperor sealed away the mirror world, the story follows Ying Yue, a reserved noblewoman chosen to marry Crown Prince Zhang. It delves into her struggles with isolation and her navigation of an unfamiliar court, intertwined with encounters from the enigmatic mirror world. The plot intensifies when her reflection offers to take her place, unveiling a hidden agenda. Although the narrative maintains a steady pace, it loses some momentum in the middle before regaining traction toward the conclusion.

Ying’s reflection, however, harbors her own motives, adding complexity to their character dynamics.",

            "The story was engaging, but I had significant issues with the main plot, especially its ending. While the book introduces important themes such as “remember who the real monsters are” and “not all mirror people are evil,” the conclusion undermines these ideas by condemning all mirror people to a similar fate. This left me feeling disheartened for both the main characters and the mirror people who were fighting to escape their nightmarish existence. The resolution felt unsatisfying and inconsistent with the earlier messages. I was particularly troubled when the mirror people were trapped in their mirrors again, as the narrative failed to effectively conclude the theme of recognizing true enemies. \n\nThe story could have greatly benefited from a darker turn in which the main character pursues a path of revenge, evolving into a villain and creating a cautionary tale about violence, generational trauma, and retribution. Instead, the ending was presented as a happily ever after, leaving me with lingering sympathy for the mirror people.",

Her compassion for her reflection, her servants, and even the prince—despite his coldness—is truly commendable. She bravely risks her life to rescue her kidnapped maid and persistently pursues the prophecy to seal the mirror world, facing betrayals and uncertainty at every turn. \n\nYing and Zhang's relationship embodies a lukewarm enemies-to-lovers trope. While their banter is entertaining, their initial interactions come across more as attraction than deep emotion. It’s only as they open up to one another that their love truly feels authentic.

While their banter was excellent, their feelings seemed more like attraction for most of the book. It wasn’t until they began opening up to each other that their love felt genuine. I appreciated the gradual growth of their relationship and the eventual realization of their mutual love.  \n\n- **Cultural and Mythological Elements:**  \n  The incorporation of Chinese mythology was a highlight. The creatures and alchemy were explored in depth, adding richness to the story. While I had some familiarity with these elements from C-dramas, the novel provided a deeper understanding.  \n\n- **Accessibility for Readers:**  \n  My only critique is that I wish there had been footnotes or a glossary for readers unfamiliar with the Chinese vocabulary. While most terms were decipherable from context, a few required me to look them up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and thrilling adventure with flashes of horror (I may never look at a mirror the same way again!) and a wonderful love story. The unique concept, strong character development, and rich cultural elements made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story features an enemies-to-lovers romance and a love triangle. While some readers may appreciate this dynamic, I found myself disengaged during the romantic scenes, as teenage relationships aren't my preferred subject. The novel is an East Asian mythology-inspired coming-of-age fantasy centered on Princess Ying Yue. It begins with her facing a loveless marriage to the crown prince, but her life takes a dramatic turn when her reflection pulls her into a mirror world. Initially a refuge, this new realm soon reveals itself as a greater threat to her home after an attack from a mythological snake, making Ying the key to stopping it. The plot is engaging and refreshing, reminiscent of live-action Chinese fantasy dramas.",
            "Ying is a compelling protagonist whose choices occasionally seem naive or sheltered, a reflection of her age and upbringing. She embodies emotional depth and perseverance, reminiscent of Usagi/Sailor Moon, and her determination to stand up for her beliefs is truly admirable. Her growth throughout the story is a standout element.",
            "The author's writing excels in the action scenes, which are immersive and expertly crafted. By unflinchingly portraying the gore and danger within the story, the author enhances both the intensity and realism of the narrative."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Girl with No Reflection* is a fun and refreshing read with a compelling protagonist, well-executed action scenes, and a unique mythology-inspired plot.

The crown prince's reflection, in contrast to the real prince, is kind, warm, and supportive, adding depth to the character dynamics.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel excels in creating a vivid and imaginative world, particularly the reflection world. The concept of reflections having their own lives and intentions is fascinating and well-executed. The stakes are high as Ying discovers the true intentions of her reflection and races to save what matters most, adding urgency and excitement to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The story explores themes of betrayal, self-discovery, and the consequences of one's choices. The tone is a blend of fantasy, adventure, and romance, appealing to fans of these genres. The novel successfully balances magical elements with emotional depth, making it a compelling read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis fantasy novel is a captivating blend of magic, deception, and romance, with a unique premise and engaging characters. While the protagonist's immaturity can be frustrating at times, the story's imaginative world-building and thrilling plot make it an enjoyable read for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While I wasn't entirely surprised by the revelation that the mirror prince had been on Ying's side all along, I thoroughly enjoyed this twist. It was refreshing to see a female protagonist who isn't overly trusting, a trope often found in many stories.",
            "I found Ying to be unfair to the real prince at several points in the story. Having read many YA books where the main love interest betrays the protagonist, I was initially skeptical of the mirror prince, thinking he was too good to be true—and I was right! Still, I developed a soft spot for the crown prince and felt bitter about Ying's unfair treatment of him. While her actions weren't entirely justified, the structure of the story made them understandable. The chemistry between the crown prince and Ying was fantastic and added significant depth to the narrative, making their dynamic one of my favorite aspects of the story.",

Similarly, the real prince becomes infatuated with Ying almost immediately after she returns from the mirror world, despite barely knowing her. His jealousy and past actions, like locking her in her rooms for months, make the romance even less believable.

The plot lacked a cohesive narrative, coming across as a disjointed sequence of events rather than a unified story. Multiple plot threads were introduced but either abandoned or resolved in a frustrating manner. For instance, the lead priest's act of throwing the main character out after poisoning her, only for it to be revealed later that it was under the empress's orders, felt unresolved. Additionally, the empress's murder of the emperor was mentioned but never adequately addressed, leaving a troubling gap in the narrative.",

Similarly, the empress murdering the emperor was acknowledged but never properly addressed, leaving a strange gap in the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Reactions and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The MC's reactions to significant events, such as her brothers' execution, felt inconsistent. Her immediate thought of confessing her feelings to the prince, followed by rage and sadness later, was jarring and poorly executed.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The constant monologue of the MC's thoughts became tedious.

            "The plot is intriguing and captivating, but it suffers from poor execution and an unrealistic ending. Set in a dynasty ruled by an emperor who commands the sun, the story portrays a time when women's influence was limited. While the author aims to modernize the narrative by emphasizing women's empowerment, this approach results in clichéd and inauthentic settings that undermine historical accuracy. Ultimately, the unrealistic resolution feels like a jarring departure, detracting from the novel's overall quality.",

She begins as a timid reflection of her time but quickly transforms into a strong-willed woman who makes poor decisions and misjudges those around her. Her responses to betrayals come off as naive and immature, lacking any genuine surprise. Ying's self-destructive behavior—defying wise counsel, wallowing in self-pity, and treating the prince cruelly only to immediately regret it—often provokes eye-rolls from the audience."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot:**  \n  - The plot is intriguing and captivating, but it is ruined by poor execution and an unrealistic ending.  \n  - The timeline is set in a dynasty where the emperor ruled the sun, and women had limited influence and power.  \n  - The author attempts to modernize the novel by emphasizing women empowerment, but this leads to cliché and unrealistic settings that detract from the historical authenticity.  \n\n- **Character Depiction:**  \n  - The main character, Ying, is frustrating and poorly developed.  \n  - Initially timid and reflective of her era, Ying suddenly transforms into a strong-willed woman who makes idiotic decisions and poorly judges others.  \n  - Her reactions to betrayals lack surprise, making her seem naive and childish.  \n  - Her behavior, such as defying advice, wallowing in self-pity, and treating the prince cruelly only to regret it immediately, is eye-roll-inducing.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  - The ending is unrealistic and feels like an abomination, further diminishing the overall quality of the novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an intriguing premise, it is ultimately let down by poor writing, inconsistent character development, and an unrealistic ending. The attempt to modernize the story with themes of women empowerment results in clichés and a loss of historical authenticity. The main character’s frustrating behavior and the unsatisfying conclusion significantly detract from the reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- The review implies a low rating, though no specific score is mentioned."

            "The plot is dull and features several illogical moments. For instance, the decision of the mirror people to openly announce their attack date rather than launching a surprise strike is baffling. The empress's confession of colluding to assassinate the emperor feels unnecessary and unrealistic. Additionally, the resolution, which hinges on a folk song, comes across as contrived and unsatisfying. Ying's realization about the prince's significance, followed by her decision to abandon him, feels inconsistent and poorly executed. Moreover, the romantic chemistry between Ying and the prince is lacking, as their interactions are minimal and unconvincing.",
            "Ying, the protagonist, often makes bewildering decisions that detract from the story. Her dislike for the prince combined with her affection for the mirror prince—whom she knows nothing about—creates a frustrating contradiction. Additionally, her blind trust in her shady mirror-self is perplexing. Despite lacking combat experience and having more pressing responsibilities, she insists on joining battles, which defies logic. Her assumption that her maid has been kidnapped, without considering the possibility that it could be her mirror-maid, reflects a significant lack of critical thinking.

            "Initially, I appreciated Ying’s characterization as a spoiled and self-centered individual, a fitting reflection of her status as the only daughter in a powerful family. Her tumultuous upbringing, especially after a near-fatal childhood incident, provided context for her traits. I admired that she wasn't depicted as flawless, a common pitfall for female protagonists in contemporary stories. However, her kindness was undermined by her extreme naivety. The plot heavily relied on her obliviousness, which escalated her selfishness to the point of triggering an interdimensional war and resulting in countless deaths—this felt both frustrating and unrealistic. Moreover, her indecisiveness—constantly shifting her affections and priorities—made it hard to connect with her. One moment she desired one character, then another, and soon after, she was focused on saving a friend, only to throw a tantrum over trivial matters. This inconsistency became unbearable, ultimately leading me to abandon the story.",

She was spoiled and self-centered, which made sense given her background as the only daughter of one of the most powerful families in the kingdom.

            "The romance in this book ultimately fell flat for me. As a fan of romantasy, I usually enjoy the tension of will-they/won’t-they dynamics, but here, the romance felt superficial. The princess seemed more enamored with the idea of love itself, quickly attaching herself to the first kind man she encountered and then to his counterpart. This portrayal undermined any semblance of a “soul mate” connection or prophecy. By the time the more compelling parts of the story began to unfold, I had already lost interest. The pacing felt off, and the weak romance overshadowed the stronger plot elements.",

I’m normally a romantasy fan and love angsty will-they/won’t-they tension. However, the romance here felt shallow.

The constant bickering between the female main character (FMC) and the male main character (MMC) made it difficult to believe their relationship. Additionally, the love triangle was frustrating. The FMC, Ying, came across as naive, and her feelings for the two love interests were inconsistent and unconvincing. The insta-love trope made the romance feel cringy and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ying’s character lacked depth and maturity. Her naivety and indecisiveness in her romantic relationships made her difficult to connect with. The rushed development of her feelings for both love interests further undermined her credibility as a protagonist.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  This book was one of my most anticipated releases of the year, and I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations, leaving me disappointed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Girl with No Reflection* had potential, its inconsistent pacing, poorly developed romance, and lack of depth in the main character made it a letdown. Despite my initial excitement, the book failed to deliver a satisfying reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The Girl With No Reflection had a lot of potential with a unique premise that could have led to incredible worldbuilding, but it fell short in execution.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding was flat and lacked depth. The magic system was neither developed nor explained, leaving it feeling incomplete and unsatisfying.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was stilted and often juvenile. It awkwardly mixed attempts at formal, flowery language with an excessive use of colloquialisms, creating a disjointed reading experience.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was as substantive as a reflection—meaning, not much at all. It was riddled with plot holes from the outset and felt disjointed throughout. What began as a horror-fantasy quickly devolved into a poorly executed attempt at YA romantasy.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was insta-love at its worst, made even more frustrating by the inclusion of a love triangle. Neither love interest was compelling, and both lacked depth and dimension, feeling as flat as a piece of paper.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its promising premise, The Girl With No Reflection failed to deliver on multiple fronts. The underwhelming worldbuilding, stilted writing, disjointed plot, and poorly developed romance made for a disappointing read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5 stars"

            "The story is packed with twists that elevate it beyond the typical YA fantasy, resulting in a highly engaging and surprising plot that is often hard to put down. I commend the author for choosing to present it as a single, relatively long novel rather than splitting it into a series; it truly works well as a standalone. While the ending leans a bit towards a 'happily ever after' that may feel unrealistic, it remains sweet and satisfying for characters who have faced significant challenges. Additionally, the bonus epilogue in the FairyLoot edition adds a touch of realism to the conclusion, enhancing the overall experience.",

While I loved the first half and the dark romance love triangle, the pacing slowed in the second half, making the story feel longer than necessary. Despite this, the themes and horror elements were compelling, especially for someone with a fear of mirrors.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She begins to cuss and yell at people, which seemed somewhat jarring. While I understand that she starts out fearful of being forced into a marriage with a man she doesn’t know or love, her shift in demeanor reflects a newfound desire for freedom that she ultimately cannot attain.

Reflections in mirrors, bodies of water, and other reflective surfaces represent an alternate realm inhabited by individuals who lead separate lives from their counterparts. However, these reflections must appear wherever their real-world counterparts are when a reflective surface is present. This concept led me to envision reflections rushing across town to position themselves before a pond, which didn't happen and felt implausible.

It is a simpler style that would be really accessible to teens, but still is good at providing imagery. The book as a whole was really easy to read, and I was able to read it very quickly.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  I really enjoyed the first couple of chapters of the book with the main character starting to recognize that her reflection was behaving weirdly, and in most cases, in very creepy ways. The book doesn’t end up turning into a horror story, though, as it is revealed that the reflections are separate people in a parallel world. I think the author could write a really good horror novel.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building of this book did not make that much sense. The reflections that occur in mirrors, bodies of water, and other reflective areas are actually another world of people. These people live a different life than their reflection counterpart but are required to appear in the locations that their counterpart are in when there is a mirror or other reflective surface. I could only imagine a reflection, like, taking a nap or something, and all of a sudden rushing across town in order to go stand in front of a pond to be the reflection seen by the true person in the real world. Of course, that doesn’t happen in the book, but it was hard to imagine the reflections being their own people and living their own separate lives. I overlooked that very glaring (pun intended) aspect of the world-building and kept on reading since it was so easy to read.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  One other small criticism I had is that the main character, Ying, starts off very reserved as a character, but after she visits the mirror world for the first time, her character does a complete 180 and starts cussing and yelling at people. I sort of get it as initially, she is scared of her situation of being forced to marry a man she doesn’t know nor love, and while in the mirror world, she saw a potential freedom that she couldn’t actually have. And she’s not cussing all the time, but it felt like a new character.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I think it’s a decent debut and it kept my attention through the end. It’s likely a really good book for its intended young adult audience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

The bits we got were too little and left me wanting more.  \n  - The worldbuilding was heavily info-dumped, which felt jarring and disrupted the flow of the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  - The pacing was too quick and rushed, making it difficult to fully engage with the story.  \n  - Key elements, such as the insta-love, felt underdeveloped. We were told the FMC was in love but never shown how or why, which made it feel unconvincing.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Tone:**  \n  - The modern dialogue felt out of place and gave me whiplash, clashing with the tone of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise and initial setup of the book were promising, the execution fell short for me. The rushed pacing, lack of depth in the mirror world, jarring info-dumps, and unconvincing insta-love made it difficult to fully enjoy the story. Despite my initial excitement, the book didn’t meet my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story quickly lost its momentum, although I can't pinpoint exactly why. The romance felt rushed and unengaging, moving at a breakneck pace that diminished its impact.

Initially, I felt engaged and hopeful about the story.\n\n- **Characterization (POV Character):**  \n  Ying, the POV character, was a little hard for me to connect with. I attributed this to her being young and the novel being YA, so I assumed the intended audience might vibe with her better.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story went downhill quickly, and I can’t pinpoint exactly why. The romance felt rushed and unengaging, especially when it moved at a breakneck pace. The middle 40%-80% of the novel felt bloated, with multiple points where the story seemed to wind down only for something new to happen. I think cutting around 200 pages could have made the story feel much tighter.\n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  I didn’t particularly care for the plot or characters emotionally. It often felt like a series of events were happening, and I was supposed to feel a certain way, but it fell flat.\n\n- **Execution and Potential:**  \n  There were some good bits that could have been polished more, and many parts that could have been cut. The bare bones of the story were pretty good, but the execution didn’t work for me, which left me feeling disappointed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept and premise of the novel had potential, the execution fell short for me. Issues with pacing, emotional engagement, and bloated storytelling made it difficult to connect with the plot and characters. Despite some promising elements, the novel didn’t work for me overall.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the mirror prince was an okay character, the romance sometimes felt off-putting.  \n- **Character Judgment:**  \n  The main character consistently trusted suspicious characters while doubting those who were genuinely good, which was hard to understand and added to the frustration.  \n- **Plot and Worldbuilding:**  \n  Despite the issues with the characters and romance, the plot was very interesting, and the worldbuilding and magic system were pretty cool.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the main character’s lack of critical thinking and the frustrating romance plot were significant drawbacks, the story’s intriguing plot and well-developed worldbuilding made it an engaging read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "Ying, the main character, faces the challenges of an arranged marriage to a man who is indifferent to her. While I sympathize with her struggles, her questionable decisions often lead her into trouble, particularly her lack of restraint in physical confrontations. Though her stubbornness isn't entirely negative, it can come across as childish and impulsive, which is disorienting at times. \n\nThe prince is a morally ambiguous character, adding intrigue to the story; I neither loved nor hated him. However, I appreciated how the author gradually revealed his true nature, ultimately making him more likable than Ying. This complexity enriched the narrative. \n\nThe romance between Ying and the prince caught me off guard, as it seemed to emerge abruptly. I wished for a deeper exploration of the enemies-to-lovers trope, with more opportunities for the characters to truly know each other. Their dynamic was satisfactory, but stronger development would have enhanced their relationship.",

The setting is refreshing and vibrant, with beautiful nature and traditional themes that frame the story beautifully. The start of the book is gripping and keeps you hooked throughout.  \n\n- **Main Character (Ying):**  \n  Ying, the main character, has a lot on her plate, especially with her arranged marriage to a man who wants nothing to do with her. While I sympathize with her struggles, her actions are often questionable. She constantly flings herself into trouble and lacks restraint, particularly when it comes to physical confrontations. Her stubbornness, while not inherently bad, makes her seem childish and brash, which can be disorienting.  \n\n- **Prince (Secondary Character):**  \n  The prince is a morally grey character, which makes him intriguing. I neither liked nor hated him, but I appreciated how the author slowly revealed his true nature, making him more likable than Ying. His complexity added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The romance between Ying and the prince surprised me, as it felt like it sprang up suddenly. I wished the enemies-to-lovers element had been fleshed out more, and I wanted more room for the characters to get to know each other. Their dynamic was alright but could have been stronger with more development.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**  \n  The story is fast-paced and filled with twists and turns, which kept me engaged. However, I felt the characters could have been more fleshed out, and the storytelling could have relied more on showing rather than telling.  \n\n- **Cultural Themes:**  \n  The Ancient Chinese themes were prominent and a treat to read about. They added a unique and immersive layer to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a fast-paced and interesting YA fantasy novel with a refreshing setting and intriguing premise.

I was baffled by how quickly she fell in love with the mirror Prince, as it felt rushed and unrealistic.\n\n- **Character Consistency and Abilities:**  \n  The MFC was supposedly an amazing warrior, but I felt like she needed to be saved all the time.

Lin.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Girl with no Reflection by Keshe Chow is a captivating debut novel that blends mesmerizing writing, vivid imagery, and rich mythological and royal elements. While the story starts slowly, it quickly gains momentum with unexpected twists and turns. A glossary of Chinese terms would have enhanced accessibility, but the book remains a strong recommendation for fans of Asian Fantasy and authors like Elizabeth Lim and Judy L. Lin.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n🌟🌟🌟🌟✨ (4.5 stars)"

I’ve encountered too many audiobooks that butcher non-English terms, but this one did them justice.\n\n- **Story Concept:**  \n  Ever since one of my favorite artists released the cover design for this book, I’ve been eagerly anticipating its release. The concept of the \"Mirror World\" was incredibly intriguing, and the idea of the Mirror Princess and the Real Princess swapping places immediately captured my interest.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  Around the 40% mark, the story begins to lose its focus. After that, I felt like I was reading a different book altogether. The story revolves around two worlds on the brink of war, but the seemingly high stakes never fully materialized, and the story became unexpectedly romance-heavy.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  Don’t get me wrong—I do like romance, but having two insta-love love triangles of sorts felt superficial and unengaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The FMC kept making one wrong decision after another, and for all the wrong reasons. It’s no fun cheering for a character who never learns from their mistakes.  \n\n- **Villains and Tension:**  \n  The villains were far more compelling than the main characters, yet they disappeared halfway through the book. There is a noticeable lack of urgency in the actions of all the characters since. It was truly unfortunate, as their presence could have added depth and tension to the plot.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I would have enjoyed the book had it focused more on world-building. I would have loved to see more of The Mirror World, the Mirror People, and the Chinese folklore.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the audiobook narration was excellent and the initial concept of the \"Mirror World\" was captivating, the story lost its focus and became overly reliant on superficial romance.

However, I felt that some characters and plot points could have been further explored, and certain questions remained unanswered, leaving me wanting more closure.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The Prince, on the other hand, was the star player for me—I enjoyed his personality and growth more than Ying’s.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  What stuck out most to me was the author’s take on how reflections play into our lives and what humanity means. This added a unique and thought-provoking layer to the story.  \n\n- **Tone and Target Audience:**  \n  I’m not sure what the tone of this book is, which is probably my biggest gripe.

Her sudden hatred for the prince felt unjustified, as his actions were logical within the world’s context. Additionally, her naivety and tendency to forget important details made her seem unintelligent and frustrating to follow.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers romance lacked depth and believability. The protagonist’s instant attraction to the first romantic interest felt rushed, and her animosity toward the prince seemed contrived. The romantic dynamics didn’t feel organic or compelling.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  Despite the intriguing premise, the story failed to maintain my interest. With over 200 pages remaining, it didn’t feel worth continuing. Even after finishing the book, I found that it didn’t improve.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Girl with No Reflection* had a promising premise and some strong elements of world-building, it ultimately fell short in execution. The distant narrative voice, inconsistent character development, and jarring tonal shifts made it difficult to stay engaged. The romantic subplot lacked depth, and the protagonist’s actions often felt frustratingly naive. Overall, the novel didn’t live up to its potential, and I wouldn’t recommend it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (No specific rating mentioned in the review.)"
