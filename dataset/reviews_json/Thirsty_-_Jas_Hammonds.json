            "The depiction of alcohol dependency through Blake's character is both authentic and heart-wrenching. Her internal struggle as she confronts her addiction is one of the most compelling portrayals I've encountered in young adult realistic fiction. Additionally, Blake grapples with a toxic, abusive relationship with Ella and the complexities of her biracial identity. I appreciated how the author addressed the conflicts stemming from having a White parent who has not confronted their own internalized racism, highlighting its effects on their children. This discussion is not an indictment of interracial relationships but rather an important dialogue about validating all aspects of a child's identity. In my view, the fallout from this relationship significantly contributes to Blake's drinking.",
            "This author has become an auto-buy for me; they never disappoint! This novel is truly wonderful and offers a striking contrast to *We Deserve Monuments*. I'm thrilled to see the author exploring a diverse range of topics.",
            "*Thirsty* delves into the timeless question of how much drinking is too much for the young. The novel addresses themes of alcohol dependency, abusive relationships, and the complexities of biracial identity through the experiences of Blake and her friends. The author skillfully navigates these issues without offering definitive solutions, which some readers may find frustrating. However, the author's note provides valuable context, emphasizing that recovery is a personal journey and that individuals seek different resources for support. Ultimately, the novel aims to convey a message of hope and solidarity to young readers, encouraging them to recognize they are not alone and to seek help when needed.",
            "The novel poignantly illustrates the reality of adolescent drinking and the difficulty in recognizing its potential for addiction. Drawing from my own college experience, I found binge drinking to be far more prevalent than I expected; it was normalized, celebrated, and almost expected among students. This reflection raises troubling questions about how many of my peers might have been struggling with unacknowledged addiction, obscured by their youth and the surrounding culture."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Thirsty* is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that delves into themes of addiction, identity, and relationships with raw honesty. The ability to portray complex emotions and societal issues through relatable characters makes this a standout read. While it doesn't offer easy solutions, it provides a message of hope and understanding, making it a valuable addition to young adult literature.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Skill and Consistency:**  \n   - Jas Hammonds is an auto-buy author for me at this point. They literally cannot miss!  \n   - This was truly a wonderful novel. It's strikingly different from *We Deserve Monuments*, but I'm happy to see that Jas is continuing to write about a variety of topics.  \n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n   - *Thirsty* tackles the age-old question, \"When you're young, how much drinking is too much drinking?\"  \n   - The novel explores alcohol dependency, abusive relationships, and the challenges of biracial identity.  \n   - Hammonds beautifully and painfully examines these themes through the lens of Blake and her friends.  \n\n- **Characterization and Internal Dialogue:**  \n   - Hammonds' portrayal of alcohol dependency through Blake was real and gut-wrenching.  \n   - The internal dialogue Blake experiences as she fights the realization of her addiction was unlike any other I've seen in young adult realistic fiction.  \n   - Blake is also struggling with her toxic, abusive relationship with Ella and her challenging relationship with her biracial identity.  \n\n- **Representation and Social Commentary:**  \n   - I was elated to see Hammonds address the conflicts that can arise from having a White parent who has not reckoned with their own internalized racism and the impact it has on their children.  \n   - This conversation wasn't a means to target interracial relationships but a way to openly dialogue about the importance of validating all facets of a child's identity.  \n   - In my opinion, the fallout of this relationship greatly impacted Blake's drinking.  \n\n- **Realism and Relatability:**  \n   - The novel captures the reality of drinking in adolescence and the inability to recognize when it becomes an addiction.  \n   - As someone who attended college and pledged, binge drinking turned out to be a lot more common than I anticipated. It was considered normal, fun, and an expectation of college kids.  \n   - It makes me wonder how many of my peers were actually deep in the throes of addiction that went unrecognized due to their age and environment.  \n\n- **Narrative Approach and Message:**  \n   - Hammonds brings all of this to light without providing exact solutions. While some may take issue with that, I think the author's note gives better context.  \n   - Every recovery process looks different, and people seek different resources to assist with their addiction.  \n   - The aim was to provide a message of hope and support to young readers who may find that they are not alone and may be more encouraged to reach out for help.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Thirsty* is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that delves into themes of addiction, identity, and relationships with raw honesty. Jas Hammonds' ability to portray complex emotions and societal issues through relatable characters makes this a standout read. While it doesn't offer easy solutions, it provides a message of hope and understanding, making it a valuable addition to young adult literature.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 Stars"

The exploration of her drinking habits, driven by a desire to fit in and embody the life of the party as “Big Bad Bee,” adds to the understanding of her often self-destructive behavior.",
            "This book is an excellent, albeit at times uncomfortable, read. Rather than being solely an \"issue book\" centered on Blake's struggle with alcohol, it presents a well-rounded coming-of-age story that explores various facets of her life. The engaging and thought-provoking narrative makes for a unique and impactful experience.",
            "This book addresses the normalization of binge drinking among high school and college students, revealing how it can obscure deeper issues. It thoughtfully examines the challenges faced by women of color, particularly within elite social circles, and the pressures to conform.

            "Blake's battle with alcohol addiction at such a young age was deeply distressing, yet I empathized with her journey. Having once been a loner, she faced immense pressure to conform and struggled to express her true self. Peer pressure, especially from Ella, significantly fueled Blake's destructive choices. When she drank, she transformed into the life of the party, and the new sorority thrived on her energy. As the pledging process escalated, so did her drinking, spiraling her life out of control. It was heartbreaking to witness her drown in addiction before she recognized the severity of her situation.",

Ever since I read her debut novel, *We Deserve Monuments*, I’ve been eagerly anticipating her next book.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  While *Thirsty* didn’t top her first book, I still really enjoyed it.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Impact:**  \n  Blake’s struggle with alcohol addiction at such a young age stressed me out, but I understood her journey. As a former loner, she felt pressured to fit in and couldn’t be her true self. Peer pressure played a significant role, and I felt Ella, in particular, encouraged Blake’s destructive behavior. When Blake was under the influence, she became the life of the party, and the new sorority fed off her energy. As the pledging intensified, so did her drinking, turning her life upside down. It was heartbreaking to see her drowning in addiction before she realized how bad things had gotten.  \n\n- **Toxic Relationships and Growth:**  \n  I was so pleased when Blake finally cut Ella off, as their relationship was incredibly toxic. Blake’s realization, “I don’t like who I am when I’m around you,” was a powerful moment of growth.  \n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n  The author tackled heavy topics like anxiety, alcoholism, identity, poor decisions, toxic relationships, sobriety, social acceptance, and family. This was likely a challenging book to write, but it’s an important one. The story sheds light on issues many young people face, especially the normalization of alcoholism among youth, which needs more discussion.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Overall, it’s a book I’d definitely recommend.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Thirsty* is a compelling and impactful novel that addresses critical issues affecting young people today.

I almost gave up multiple times because of the excessive focus on trivial details like outfits and appearances.  \n  - The story only became engaging at the halfway point, where it finally clicked into place.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  - The exploration of the gradual descent from \"normal\" drinking and partying into a destructive lifestyle was compelling and well-executed.  \n  - The author’s personal connection to the themes, as mentioned in the afterword, added authenticity and emotional weight to the story.  \n\n- **Representation and Social Commentary:**  \n  - The exploration of race, particularly being biracial with a white mother, was insightful and appreciated.  \n  - The inclusion of gender identity through a side character added depth and relevance to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n  - The secret society element didn’t resonate with me, likely because I have no personal connection to Greek life or similar experiences.  \n  - Some elements of the story felt clunky, and the plot took too long to gain momentum.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Accessibility:**  \n  - I’m curious about how teen readers will connect with this story, as it tackles mature and complex themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a slow and frustrating start, the novel ultimately delivered a fresh, important, and authentic story. The exploration of addiction, race, and gender identity stood out as particularly impactful, though some elements of the plot and pacing could have been improved.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I was curious about the substance abuse themes and the fact that it’s a YA novel. Going in blind made the experience more enjoyable, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved it.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story centers around joining a society, which was familiar in concept but still engaging. The hazing, challenges, and clear goals for the main character kept me invested. The exploration of substance abuse was handled well, making it a core focus rather than just a plot point. The added layers of family dynamics, class, racial issues, and gentle touches on gender and sexuality were unexpected but appreciated. I wish the gender identity plot had been explored more deeply, though.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  I enjoyed the characters overall, though the teenage angst was intense at times. The drama and bitchiness were entertaining, reminiscent of shows like *90210*. Blake, the emotionally unstable female lead, was a standout for me. Her messy, party-girl persona added depth and obstacles to her journey. The friendship between Blake and Annetta was a highlight, with its ups and downs feeling authentic and perfectly resolved.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The book was easy to read but still emotionally gripping. The character development was believable and gritty, making the story feel real and impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Thirsty* was a messy but exciting read with great relationships and layered themes. The exploration of substance abuse, family dynamics, and social issues added depth, while the drama and character development kept me hooked.

            "In this story, Blake (Bee) grapples with alcoholism and an addictive personality, and their growth is refreshingly well-executed—unlike many troubled characters who lack adequate support. Nattie stands out as a loyal friend, embodying a ride-or-die mentality and winning the audience's affection from the beginning. In contrast, Ella is consistently self-centered and unsupportive, both as a girlfriend and a friend, making her character unlikable throughout.",
            "This book tackles heavy themes, including self-hatred, suicidal ideation, racial microaggressions, transphobia, and alcoholism. Set within a YA fiction framework, it unfolds as a queer romance that weaves together a secret society and a dual timeline, exploring both past and present."

While Ella’s character is unlikable, the overall execution of the story and character arcs is commendable. I highly recommend the book for its emotional depth and engaging narrative.",

The resolution of her fraught miscommunication with her parents felt flat, as it hinged on a single conversation. Additionally, the Spencers’ complicity in Blake’s alcohol abuse, particularly beyond Ella’s treatment, was a missed opportunity. While these themes were hinted at, they could have been more thoroughly developed.",

It was such a fast, easy read, which I give the author a lot of credit for, especially considering the heavy subject matter.  \n  - The pacing of the plot, along with the flashbacks, worked nicely, and I really liked the second-person interludes.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  - The book tackles heavy themes like drinking, anxiety, and the tension, guilt, and shame of draining friendships and relationships.  \n  - These themes are swirled together with self-realizations that most teens wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole.  \n  - Despite the heaviness, it’s written in a way that I think 15-year-old me could’ve understood.  \n\n- **Character Development and Inner Monologue:**  \n  - Blake’s inner monologue was compelling and added depth to her character.  \n  - However, I wish her relationship with her family had been explored further. The fraught miscommunication with her parents boiling down to a single conversation/resolution felt flat.  \n  - Similarly, the lack of recognition of the Spencers’ complicity in Blake’s alcohol abuse, beyond Ella’s treatment of her, was a missed opportunity. These aspects were hinted at but could have been untangled more thoroughly.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution and Missed Opportunities:**  \n  - An additional scene with her parents about what happened that summer, or a more concrete realization from Blake herself about the Spencers, could have helped tie the story together more effectively.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a gripping and emotionally resonant read, with strong pacing and relatable themes. However, certain aspects of character development and plot resolution felt underdeveloped, leaving some loose ends that could have been explored further.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The exploration of alcohol abuse, self-loathing, and eventual healing was raw and impactful.

Her experience, though not explicitly labeled as alcoholism, felt authentic and relatable. The narrative effectively captures the complex emotions associated with early recovery and the process of reevaluating one’s relationship with alcohol. The author skillfully illustrates how drinking can provide fleeting pleasure, even as it inflicts significant harm on oneself and others. Additionally, the portrayal of the physical toll of alcohol is both raw and honest."

I've long been of the opinion that it's awful how our culture has normalized drinking to the point where if you're an adult, people will judge you for not drinking. It's even worse in this story because Blake is still a teenager, and yet all of the other kids around her think it's totally normal to get drunk. They don't understand yet how awful alcoholism is.  \n\n- **Narrative Approach and Resolution:**  \n  *Thirsty* takes the topic seriously. Though Blake makes a lot of bad decisions, I love the way she gets help and the way the story resolves.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJas Hammonds delivers another powerfully told story in *Thirsty*, tackling heavy themes like addiction and cultural norms with depth and care. The character of Blake is compelling, and the resolution of her journey is both satisfying and meaningful.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Once Blake chose to quit drinking, she was met with significant support, offering a hopeful perspective for readers.

These scenes, despite not naming body parts, are quite graphic and leave little to the imagination."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n   - I went into the book expecting a story about sirens and their struggles, but it turned out to be about a teenager's drinking habits and how a sorority encourages it.  \n   - Hammonds provides warnings in the prologue, which I appreciated, but the book still didn’t align with my initial expectations.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I increasingly disliked the characters as the story progressed.  \n   - The girlfriend’s excuse for cheating felt insulting and poorly justified.  \n   - Characters often came across as melodramatic or immature, which made it hard to connect with them.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Subplots:**  \n   - There were quite a few subplots, but they felt randomly thrown in rather than thoroughly explored.  \n   - The book’s structure felt odd, as if Hammonds was working from a checklist, which made the narrative feel disjointed.  \n\n- **Realism and Execution:**  \n   - The issues and scenarios described in the book were realistic, but they were explored in an odd and incomplete way.  \n   - While the realism was present, I didn’t enjoy watching the characters go through these situations because of how they acted.  \n\n- **Themes and Potential Impact:**  \n   - Hammonds states that the events in the book are based on their own and friends’ experiences, which adds authenticity.  \n   - Despite its flaws, I think this could be an important book for people who need to find hope in similar situations.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Audience Fit:**  \n   - I found the book annoying and boring, and I was not the intended audience.  \n   - I’ve DNF’ed Hammonds’ work before, but I’m willing to try their other works because they explore interesting themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book tackles realistic and important issues, its execution fell short for me. The characters were unlikable, the subplots felt disjointed, and the narrative structure was odd. However, I recognize its potential to resonate with others who might find hope or relatability in its themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It moved beyond my initial expectation of a narrative focused on vandalism and racism, which could have also been intriguing. Instead, it tackles the toxic dynamics of sororities and secret societies, particularly emphasizing the experiences of women of color. The story thoughtfully navigates toxic relationships, offering depth to its flawed characters and making them more relatable. Key themes include childhood trauma, low self-esteem, the perils of using external sources to mask insecurities, the dismissal of children's feelings, and the struggles faced by biracial and economically disadvantaged individuals.",

However, the prolonged denouement occasionally detracted from the story’s impact, giving it a somewhat simplistic tone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"
