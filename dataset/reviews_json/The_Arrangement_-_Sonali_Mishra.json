Nisha, the love interest, stands out with her strong personality and complex backstory, which includes her challenges with divorce and a lost passion for writing. Supporting characters like Dan, Erica, and Arjun‚Äôs colleagues enrich the narrative, providing valuable advice and support. While the portrayal of Indian-Americans is impressive, it can feel somewhat unrealistic, as all characters are highly accomplished‚Äîsuch as Ivy League graduates and Stanford professors‚Äîmaking it less relatable for readers who don‚Äôt fit this elite mold.",

Reluctantly, he decides to consider arranged marriages, exploring biodatas provided by Dhanya aunty.",

His coworker, Nisha, a failed novelist with a backstory of divorce and disinterest in remarrying, adds depth to the narrative.

The enemies-to-friends dynamic between Arjun and Nisha is charming and enhances the story's appeal.

For instance, Arjun's ability to write, publish, and release a cookbook in under a month was unrealistic, as that process usually takes years. Overall, everything felt rushed.",

This was the exact opposite of Nisha‚Äôs supportive nature.  \n\n- **Pacing and Timing:**  \n  The pacing and timing were my biggest gripes. The beginning was slow, and then Nisha and Arjun became best friends almost immediately, with no gradual development in between. The timeline felt off, with major events crammed into a 2‚Äì3-month period. For example, it was unrealistic how Arjun managed to get a cookbook written, published, and released in a month or less, a process that typically takes years.

It was enlightening to see the process unfold, even with the understanding that practices can vary widely among matchmakers and families.

At thirty, he sees his friends settling down, getting married, and having kids, which makes him feel adrift despite having a great job and a nice place to live. His decision to pursue an arranged marriage to feel more anchored added depth to his character.\n   - I appreciated Arjun‚Äôs mixed feelings about his choice to pursue an arranged marriage.
