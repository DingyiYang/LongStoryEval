The flashbacks lacked the magical chemistry I was hoping for, and their reunion didn’t spark the passion I anticipated. Without that emotional pull, I couldn’t fully root for their love story.  \n\n- **Non-Romantic Themes:**  \n  I absolutely loved the exploration of racial discrimination, privilege in Hollywood, and Kaliya’s struggles to break into the industry as a woman of color. These themes were incredibly powerful and engaging. The focus on storytelling, filmmaking, and fighting for justice really elevated the plot and made the story stand out.  \n\n- **Character Development and Ending:**  \n  The ending tied things up nicely, with the characters growing into inspiring, world-changing figures. Their personal growth and the resolution of their individual arcs were satisfying and well-executed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the romance fell flat for me, the novel’s exploration of important themes and its strong focus on character development made it a solid and impactful read.

The heroine’s lack of agency and the hero’s unlikable behavior made the novel unenjoyable. The outdated theme of a woman waiting for a man to validate her didn’t resonate with me, leading me to stop reading halfway through.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This romance is beautifully crafted, with healthy communication between the characters that feels refreshingly real. The unfolding relationship between Kal and Danny has a delightful romcom quality. Their vulnerability and reluctance to rekindle their romance are relatable, and several moments tugged at my heartstrings. The flashbacks depicting the beginnings and breakdown of their relationship add meaningful depth. Their love feels natural, marked by an effortless understanding. Kaliyah is truly inspiring; her journey of self-assertion and pursuit of her dreams in the film industry showcases the power every woman possesses to succeed. Danny Prescott emerges as a genuine, funny, and caring character, clearly intent on supporting Kaliyah, even as he seeks to mend their past.",

Danny, initially charming yet flawed, is a complex character, and I found myself rooting for him despite his missteps.

Their backstory kept me on edge until its eventual reveal, making the romance profoundly affecting and nearly devastating. Each character, even the antagonists, is realistically portrayed, contributing to the story's authenticity. The well-crafted interactions between characters enhance the overall richness of the narrative.",

It felt unsatisfying and didn't meet my expectations.  \n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  I found the female main character (FMC) kind of annoying by the end of the story. Her actions or personality didn't resonate with me in the later parts of the book.  \n- **Character Development (Supporting Characters):**  \n  Surprisingly, I really liked Bella, the FMC's younger friend. She stood out as a more enjoyable and relatable character.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my issues with the third act and the FMC, I still enjoyed this romance overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had some issues with the third act and the FMC's characterization, the novel was still an enjoyable read, largely due to the charm of supporting characters like Bella.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up to 4."

            "The book fell short in portraying Danny's remorse, lacking the necessary groveling to address his actions adequately. Conflicts felt one-sided, with Kaliya consistently taking on the role of the forgiver. A dual POV would have offered valuable insight into both characters, enhancing our understanding of their motivations and relationship. Additionally, a deeper exploration of their past could have enriched the narrative.",
            "Danny began dating another girl just one week after his breakup with Kaliya, overwhelmed by Kaliya's confession of love. Despite this betrayal occurring seven years ago, Kaliya forgave him without anger. Danny had promised her a director’s assistant position, only for the studio to give the role to someone else, a setback Kaliya accepted with grace. However, when Kaliya ended their relationship after an article damaged her reputation, Danny reacted with anger. Kaliya later apologized and took him back, but her willingness to forgive repeatedly came across as overly passive, as if she were a doormat. Her responses often lacked the assertiveness that Danny's behavior warranted, raising questions about accountability in their dynamic."

        "conclusion": "While the book had its strengths, the unbalanced character dynamics and lack of accountability from Danny, paired with Kaliya’s passive forgiveness, detracted from the overall experience. The story would have been more compelling with deeper exploration of their past, a dual POV, and more meaningful groveling from Danny.",

There was also some fun friendship banter and some “ex” drama. I really loved the vision behind the film Danny wanted to create—his parents’ love story. How sweet and endearing is that?!  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I feel we get more independent character development than romance, which is okay because Kaylia was a likable FMC. Danny came off very detached, so I wasn’t really feeling him much; maybe it would’ve been nice to get his POV?  \n\n- **Romance and Emotional Impact:**  \n  It just didn’t give me the feels I desired when it came to the romance. To be a romance, it felt really… glum. Their second chance at love seemed feasible, working in the same industry and meeting years later, but their history was kinda lackluster. The way they broke up—or did they even break up? Just ghosted? It’s a more soulful romance than sweet and cutesy, and that’s okay.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *WITOY* had some strong elements, like its exploration of being Black in Hollywood and the heartfelt vision behind Danny’s film.

I was excited about a romance set in the film industry, but it fell short.\n   - The tension between Kaliya and Danny was palpable at the beginning but fizzled out as the story progressed.\n   - The back-and-forth dynamic between Kaliya and Danny became annoying, especially Danny's inconsistent behavior.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**\n   - Around the halfway mark, the story began to slow down and drag.\n   - The revelation of what happened seven years ago that broke Kaliya's heart was confusing and frustrating. I couldn't understand why she took Danny back so easily.\n   - The third breakup act felt unnecessary and seemed like it was thrown in just to create drama.\n\n- **Satisfaction with the Resolution:**\n   - Once Kaliya and Danny finally got together, it didn't feel satisfying.\n   - The resolution lacked the emotional payoff I was hoping for after the buildup.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel had a strong start with compelling writing and an intriguing setup, the romance failed to deliver on its promise.

            "The novel centers on former college friends Kaliya Wilson and Danny Prescott, who reconnect after nearly a decade apart. Their potential love was tragically interrupted, prompting the question of whether it’s too late for them to rekindle their relationship. Kaliya, a talented individual with ambitious dreams, has faced years of rejection in the film industry, leaving her on the brink of giving up. Meanwhile, Danny has become a successful filmmaker and presents her with an opportunity to collaborate on a passion project about his parents’ unconventional love story. Although significant, this subplot takes up a considerable portion of the narrative, detracting from the more compelling development of Kaliya and Danny’s relationship. A character likens Danny’s parents’ tale to a second version of the movie *Loving*, which, while fitting, feels overused and less original.",

The book moved at a nice pace and was easy to understand. It was especially easy to keep up when the story would go into a memory.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The story is a second-chance romance set in the film/TV industry. It features a Black female lead with the hopes of changing Hollywood and addressing its racist antics. The narrative not only revolves around the second-chance romance but also explores an interracial relationship through the eyes of their son, Danny.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I loved the way Danny stood up for Kaliya, especially since it was his film. Kaliya’s friend also had her own storyline, and their friendship was a great example of how real good girlfriends should be to and for each other.  \n\n- **Conflict and Antagonism:**  \n  The ex plotting with the film company was just evil. It reinforced the message of never letting anyone else tell your story. The gossip site’s portrayal was also noteworthy—they didn’t do their work to tell the full story, which is something many gossip/blog sites need to take heed of.  \n\n- **Emotional Moments:**  \n  Visiting Danny’s mom was such a sweet moment, and the ending was so perfect.  \n\n- **Author’s Note:**  \n  I highly recommend reading the author’s note—it adds depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an engaging and well-paced novel with strong themes of representation, love, and resilience.

Kaliya, working as a receptionist at a film studio, faces a pivotal opportunity for career advancement through Danny’s offer, but it requires her to trust him again. The story delves into Hollywood politics and scandal, posing threats to both Kaliya's career and the production. While the romance is central, Kaliya's professional and personal growth is equally captivating. The narrative flows smoothly, making it an engaging read from start to finish. However, the last 20% of the book feels rushed, featuring significant time jumps that leave some character development and subplots underexplored. Despite this, the intricate subplots beyond the romance provide a satisfying experience overall.",

The dynamic between her and Danny, her former lover and current director, adds complexity to the story. The emphasis on Kaliya's professional journey and commitment to self-care is both engaging and empowering.",

Additionally, the examination of Hollywood politics and the characters' ethical dilemmas adds significant depth to the narrative.",

The detailed and immersive subplots made the book enjoyable, even without a strong emotional investment in the romance.

They were so engaging that I was tempted to make a playlist.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n   - I both listened to and read *When I Think of You*.

            "The initial breakup between Danny and Kaliah remains unexplained, leaving readers puzzled about the root of their pain. Additionally, the ex-girlfriend is depicted in a misogynistic light, framed as the villain, while Kaliah also plays a significant role in attempting to fit into Danny's life.",
            "Initially, I found Kaliah to be an appealing character with strong, unconditional female friendships. However, her overwhelming infatuation with Danny caused her to compromise her self-worth. She quickly forgives him after his apologies, even when she isn't at fault, and struggles to assert herself, seemingly idolizing him despite his poor treatment.\n\nDanny's character left me frustrated throughout much of the story. He oscillates between hot and cold, often neglecting communication and making unilateral decisions. For three months, he hides the fact that his girlfriend dumped him, and when Kaliah confronts him, he dismisses her feelings, claiming he cannot love her due to his past. His actions, such as showing up with another girl and defending his ex to Kaliah, felt unfairly manipulative.\n\nThe dynamic between Kaliah and Danny struck me as unhealthy. His confession of feelings only comes after Kaliah goes on a date with Eric, which seemed contrived. The subsequent sex scene felt more awkward than romantic. Meanwhile, Eric, a seemingly better match for Kaliah, was relegated to a mere plot device to drive her back to Danny, leaving me disappointed.",

While the characters' naiveté occasionally tested my patience, the story's emotional depth, timely themes, and strong character development made it a rewarding read. Myah Ariel's thoughtful handling of race, sexism, and self-belief in the context of Hollywood adds significant weight to the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book felt more like a poorly crafted Wattpad romance than a polished novel. The initial chapters were engaging and humorous, setting high expectations that the rest of the story failed to meet. The romance came across as unconvincing and juvenile, especially for characters intended to be adults.",
            "Kaliya's obsessive fixation on Daniel felt both frustrating and unrealistic, especially since he comes across as unworthy of her attention. Celine, portrayed as a stereotypical evil ex-girlfriend, was equally disappointing. Despite being 26, the characters lacked maturity and seemed more fitting for a young adult novel.",
            "The book features humorous moments, particularly with the characters Neha and Bella. However, the name of the production studio, WAP, felt distracting and out of place."

The romance felt juvenile, the characters were underdeveloped, and the plot was riddled with tropes I dislike. Despite the promising start, the book failed to deliver a compelling or mature story.

The non-linear timeline was skillfully executed, adding depth to the narrative. However, I felt the pacing was uneven—some sections dragged while others raced by. There were also moments that lacked detail, requiring me to fill in the gaps as a reader, likely a result of reading an early copy. Overall, it was an enjoyable read.",

            "This novel provides a refreshing perspective on the second-chance romance trope, steering clear of the usual misunderstandings and reunions. In this story, the misunderstanding acts as a catalyst for the FMC's development rather than dominating the plot. Although the third-act breakup occurs at the 90% mark, leaving me frustrated, I admired the FMC for standing her ground. However, the ending felt rushed, and the epilogue came across as more of a setup for new beginnings than a satisfying conclusion. Much of the epilogue focused unnecessarily on Kaliya's dress, diverting attention from key moments like Danny's Oscar win and the proposal, which felt overshadowed and underdeveloped.",
            "Kaliya, the female main character, is well-crafted and relatable, making her journey enjoyable and free from the irritation I often feel with FMCs. In contrast, the male main character, Danny, is difficult to like. His failure to support Kaliya when she lost her job and his romantic involvement with someone so different from her rendered him untrustworthy. Kaliya’s friends serve as strong supporting characters, enhancing her journey, while Danny’s parents, particularly his mother, add depth to the narrative. However, the relationship between Kaliya and Danny feels uneven; his inability to prioritize her and his questionable decisions make it challenging to root for him. Additionally, the romantic tension and resolution seem incomplete, culminating in a rushed ending.",
            "The single point of view from Kaliya was effective, enabling a deep connection with her character. While the pacing was generally strong, the abrupt ending left some questions unresolved."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a unique and engaging second-chance romance with a strong FMC and a flawed MMC. While the ending felt rushed and some aspects of the romance were unsatisfying, Kaliya’s journey and character development made the story worthwhile.",

            "The novel centers on Kaliyah and Danny, who reunite after years apart for a second-chance romance. While the author weaves in several subplots—such as Kaliyah's best friend's relationship struggles, Danny's adaptation of his parents' love story into a film, and themes of racism during the Jim Crow era, grief, and the challenges faced by Black women in Hollywood—these elements detract from the main narrative. As a result, the story feels less focused. Additionally, the timeline is disjointed, with crucial details about the characters' pasts revealed too late, hindering the overall flow. Improved pacing would have enhanced the cohesiveness and engagement of the reading experience.",

I also felt that their individual journeys of self-improvement before reuniting were underdeveloped, leaving me wanting more insight into their personal growth.",

            "I thoroughly enjoyed Kaliya and, by extension, Daniel. The characters were mature and consistent, and the story avoided excessive angst and melodrama. This lovely debut was well-written, and I found it thoroughly enjoyable.",
            "One personal critique is the lack of depth in Kaliya and Daniel's emotional backstory and their attempts at reconciliation.

Since the narrative is entirely from Kaliya's perspective, I found myself curious about Daniel’s deeper emotions.",

However, as indicated by my rating, I was pleasantly surprised and ultimately won over."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Nostalgia and Genre Appeal:**  \n  The novel reminded me of 90s rom-com movies, which added a nostalgic charm to the story. It captures the essence of a second-chance, right-person-wrong-time romance, with the odds consistently stacked against the characters.\n\n- **Character Development (Kaliyah):**  \n  I particularly enjoyed Kaliyah’s journey as an African American woman striving to establish her presence in Hollywood. Her experiences felt relatable and authentic, making her personal story stand out more than the romance itself.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  While the romance between Kaliyah and Danny is a significant element of the story, it didn’t overshadow Kaliyah’s individual growth and struggles. The romantic aspect was engaging but secondary to her personal narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a delightful and heartwarming read that blends a nostalgic rom-com vibe with a strong focus on personal growth and relatable experiences. Kaliyah’s journey as a woman navigating Hollywood was the highlight, making the story both inspiring and enjoyable.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Some incidents and thoughts could have benefitted from Danny's perspective, especially his thought process outside of interacting directly with Kaliya.  \n\n- **Pacing and Romance Development:**  \n   - At times, the book felt like the slowest burn/second chance romance, which made sense for the storytelling but also frustrated me when certain things happened.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n   - Myah's writing style is incredibly well done.

            "I admired Kaliya's resilience throughout the story. After struggling for years to break into a difficult industry, particularly as a Black woman, she had nearly resigned herself to her situation. Despite despising her job and the treatment from her colleagues, she persevered. When she finally got her chance, Kaliya fought to make her voice heard, which was truly inspiring.\n\nI also found Danny’s parents’ history captivating and wished there had been more exploration of this aspect. However, I didn’t perceive the book as a second-chance romance. The pacing felt slow, and even by the halfway point, the main characters had barely interacted in a meaningful, romantic way. There was a noticeable lack of longing and deep connection between them, which is essential for characters reuniting after a significant time apart.\n\nAdditionally, the single perspective from Kaliya was a drawback. Incorporating Danny's viewpoint would have added depth and balance to the romance, enhancing the overall narrative.",

The combination of humor, romance, and thought-provoking themes made it a captivating read. Kaliya and Danny’s chemistry, the exploration of Hollywood’s harsh realities, and the well-executed second-chance trope all contributed to a story that was both entertaining and meaningful.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The use of intertwined flashbacks in this book is exceptional; it may be one of the best examples I've encountered. I appreciate how the flashbacks emerge unexpectedly yet flow seamlessly within the narrative, maintaining the story's momentum. The subtle teasing of the characters' breakup—where we know it happened but not the details—keeps me eagerly turning the pages, discovering new insights with each chapter. It's a captivating experience that has left me feeling deeply invested, as if I've spent a lifetime with this book, and I'm only halfway through. Butterflies galore!",
            "Kaliya embodies the experience of many Black women, reflecting the struggle of feeling unworthy of the opportunities they truly deserve. Her relatable journey highlights the irrational thoughts that often accompany these feelings. Danny’s attraction to Kaliya is rooted in her lack of awareness of his status, which adds depth to their connection. The film's title, \"What Love Made,\" conveys a deeply romantic sentiment—if someone expressed that about me, I would be genuinely flattered.",
            "This is why I read—because there are still talented writers out there! This book is a true testament to that. Thank you, Jesus, for this masterpiece! The inclusion of the script within the narrative is brilliant; it’s exactly what I love. The author has crafted a well-developed story, demonstrating her dedication and thorough research. Unlike many authors who tend to over-describe, Myah strikes the perfect balance, conveying emotions, settings, and atmosphere just enough for vivid visuals to form in our minds.",
            "Why do some of my favorite books reference Stevie Wonder songs? Any book that includes a nod to \"As\" by Stevie Wonder is a definite win for me!",
            "Perhaps it was the fact that I hadn't read a romance novel in a while, combined with being on my period and listening to \"Feels Like\" by Gracie Abrams, but the meet-cute in this book gave me butterflies. At times, the emotions felt overwhelming. This is my favorite read of 2024! The letter Danny wrote to Kaliya? I would start wars over that!"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The book starts off with a strong second-chance trope, which I found to be well-executed. The miscommunication between characters was handled in a way that felt realistic and not overly exaggerated. The overarching themes of second chances and true love were compelling and resonated throughout the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each character had their own point of view, which allowed for significant growth and maturity. I particularly enjoyed how Danny’s parents’ story served as a backdrop to explore Danny’s desire for a soulmate-type love. This added depth to his character and made his journey more relatable.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was a bit unexpected and threw me off slightly, especially since the story was so engaging up to that point. However, it did provide a satisfying happily-ever-after (HEA), which tied the narrative together nicely.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was a heartfelt exploration of second chances and true love, with well-developed characters and a plot that kept me engaged. While the ending was a bit surprising, it ultimately delivered a satisfying conclusion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The communication between Kaliya and Danny is minimal, which detracts from the authenticity of their relationship. Bella, a side character, is a standout and adds significant value to the narrative. The romance between Kaliya and Danny unfolds as a slow burn, hindered by unresolved past issues and a lack of meaningful dialogue, making it less compelling. Additionally, the second-chance trope feels underexplored, and Kaliya's eagerness to rekindle their relationship without addressing previous conflicts is frustrating.",

As she navigates the complexities of her professional and romantic life, Kaliya faces challenges, including the dynamics with Danny's controlling girlfriend, Celine, and the racial discrimination prevalent in the industry. The narrative delves into themes of second chances in love and career, highlighting Kaliya's personal growth and resilience throughout her journey.",
            "Kaliya is a complex character grappling with insecurities, yet I wished she would assert herself more, particularly in her interactions with Celine. While the chemistry between Danny and Kaliya is strong, the numerous challenges they face sometimes make their relationship feel excessive. Celine's manipulative and controlling nature adds tension but comes across as one-dimensional. In contrast, the friendships among Kaliya, Neha, and Bella are well-developed and supportive, with Bella's storyline being especially satisfying. However, Eric's character feels underdeveloped; his storyline could either be cut or expanded for greater impact.",

The inclusion of a potential cheating scenario made me uncomfortable, and Kaliya's decision to run away after they finally embraced their relationship felt unnecessary. As someone who enjoys a bit of spice in romance, I also hoped for more than just one spicy scene in the book."

            "Kaliya, the main character, is difficult to root for due to her lack of meaningful growth. Her journey feels incomplete, as any supposed improvement is merely stated rather than demonstrated. This absence of visible transformation makes it hard to connect with her or invest in her arc. Danny, on the other hand, is unreliable and lacks redeeming qualities, which undermines any support for his relationship with Kaliya. His repeated disappointments become frustrating, leaving little reason to believe in their bond. The romance between Kaliya and Danny feels unconvincing, lacking spark and tension. Flashbacks meant to highlight their chemistry and history fall flat and are stylistically confusing. Additionally, the time they spend apart, which could have been an opportunity for growth, feels hollow and fails to impact their reunion meaningfully.",

While the subplot involving Danny’s movie and the character of Neha provided some enjoyment, the main characters and their relationship lacked depth and emotional resonance. The narrative structure and writing style further hindered the story’s impact, making it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Despite being born in the late 90s, all the songs mentioned were from the 70s, 80s, and 90s (e.g., Stevie Wonder, Prince, Madonna).  \n   - The absence of current artists, especially given the characters’ college years in the mid-2010s during the streaming era, was noticeable. For example, I expected at least a mention of Drake.  \n   - This inconsistency made me double-check the book’s setting, which is 2022/2023.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story, characters, and themes resonated deeply with me, and the author’s writing was compelling. While the music references felt out of place, it didn’t detract significantly from my overall enjoyment. This is a must-read for anyone with big dreams or a love for heartfelt, relatable stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The chemistry between the leads was decent, and I didn't find Danny as problematic as some readers did. He made a mistake while grieving and was still quite young, so his emotional outburst in the third act felt understandable. However, I was bothered by his unfulfilled job promise. I would have preferred to see more of their relationship develop on-screen rather than relying on a third-party character to explain it. The third-act breakup felt obligatory for the genre, and breaking up twice began to suggest a pattern of incompatibility. On a positive note, I really enjoyed the female friendships in the book, which helped offset the ex-girlfriend drama. Kaliya was a delightful main character; I appreciate characters who are passionate and knowledgeable about their interests, even if I’m unfamiliar with them, like film."

While I appreciated the chemistry between the leads and enjoyed Kaliya as a character, the second-chance romance trope didn't fully work for me.

However, the strong female friendships and Kaliya's passion for her career were highlights. I might try another second-chance romance in the future to see if it resonates better.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Trope Suitability (Second Chance Romance):**  \n   - This is my first second chance romance, and I think perhaps it's simply not a trope for me.  \n   - The idea of characters growing apart and then reconnecting didn't fully resonate with me, especially since Kaliya decides within the last forty pages that she needs to figure out who she is \"without Danny,\" despite having been apart for seven years.  \n\n- **Character Development and Chemistry:**  \n   - I thought the chemistry between the leads was decent.  \n   - I didn't find Danny as egregious as some other readers did. He made a mistake when he was grieving and barely more than a kid, and his emotional outburst in the third act felt understandable.  \n   - The only thing that really bothered me was his unfulfilled promise of a job.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n   - I wish we had seen more of them together as a couple to understand what they are to each other, rather than having it told to us by a third-party character.  \n   - The third-act breakup felt like a requirement of the genre, but breaking up twice starts to feel like a pattern of incompatibility.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Subplots:**  \n   - I really enjoyed the female friendships in this book; they made up for the ex-girlfriend drama for me.  \n   - Kaliya was an enjoyable main character. I love characters who are passionate and knowledgeable about their interests, even if I know nothing about them (like film).  \n\n- **Career and Personal Growth:**  \n   - It's a shame that Kaliya's career didn't shape out as she dreamed, although her steps were satisfying in their own way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book left me with mixed feelings. While I appreciated the chemistry between the leads and enjoyed Kaliya as a character, the second-chance romance trope didn't fully work for me. The repeated breakups and lack of on-page relationship development made it hard to fully invest in their story. However, the strong female friendships and Kaliya's passion for her career were highlights. I might try another second-chance romance in the future to see if it resonates better.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating score was mentioned in the review."

While the third-act breakup wasn't the worst, it felt unnecessary; their relationship would have benefited from facing challenges, such as the scheming ex, as a team instead of separating again. By the end, their future remained uncertain, as they never demonstrated the ability to resolve issues together.",

Kaliya’s tendency to forgive him too quickly made her feel like a doormat until very late in the story.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  The miscommunications between characters and the repetitive push-pull dynamic made the relationship development feel stagnant. The third-act breakup, while not the worst, felt unnecessary. Their relationship would have been better served by tackling challenges, like the evil ex’s scheming, as a team rather than separating again. By the end, their future still felt uncertain because they never demonstrated the ability to work through issues together.  \n\n- **Themes and Subplots:**  \n  The discussions about race and privilege in Hollywood were engaging and well-done. Additionally, the subplot about Danny’s parents’ love story was a highlight and added depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some strong elements, such as its exploration of race and privilege and the charming subplot about Danny’s parents, the frustrating character dynamics, repetitive conflicts, and lack of meaningful resolution made it a disappointing read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5⭐️"

            "The book demonstrates self-awareness by acknowledging questionable decisions and moments of miscommunication, which adds depth to the characters, making them feel flawed and relatable. The resolution effectively ties up all loose ends, ensuring that no major plot points are left unresolved.",
            "Kaliya's personal and professional journey is both compelling and inspiring, culminating in remarkable growth by the novel's end. The third-act conflict, along with Kaliya's empowering decision to prioritize herself, adds a satisfying depth to the story.",
            "This book delves into the challenges of navigating career aspirations in your 20s, juxtaposing dreams with reality. It thoughtfully addresses issues of privilege and power in Hollywood, providing a nuanced perspective on Black creators in the industry. Additionally, the narrative serves as a love letter to cinema and 90s music, rich with nostalgic references.",
            "While marketed as a romance, the novel leans more toward Women's Literature, primarily due to its single perspective from Kaliya and its exploration of themes beyond the central love story. At its core, it presents a second-chance romance between Kaliya and Danny, but it also thoughtfully addresses career struggles, privilege, and the power dynamics in Hollywood, particularly regarding Black filmmakers and their narratives."

        "conclusion": "When I Think of You is a layered and thought-provoking debut novel that transcends its romance label. While the second-chance love story is central, the book shines in its exploration of career struggles, privilege, and personal growth. Kaliya's journey is inspiring, and the novel's self-awareness and satisfying resolution make it a standout read. I eagerly anticipate more works from this talented author in the future.",

It delves into themes of trust, redemption, and the challenges of navigating both Hollywood and personal history. However, I found the jealous ex subplot less appealing, as I'm not a fan of that trope, and the ex's unlikable nature only added to my discontent.",
            "From the moment Danny and Kaliya reconnected after years apart, it was clear he was still in love with her. I admired his determination to fight for her and create a place for her in his life. Kaliya, a relatable protagonist, had spent years behind a reception desk while her filmmaking dreams felt distant. The strong female friendships, especially between Kaliya, Neha, and Bella, were a standout feature, with their witty banter and supportive dynamic adding warmth and authenticity to the narrative. The intense connection between Kaliya and Danny was palpable, making their journey of rediscovery both compelling and engaging.",

            "While the premise held promise, the execution ultimately fell flat. The storytelling lacked passion, rendering the narrative uninspired. The second-chance romance between Kaliya and Danny failed to resonate; Danny was involved with another woman for much of the book, and Kaliya briefly entertained someone else, which weakened their emotional connection. They spent less than 10% of the story together before a third-act breakup, leaving readers seeking a romance-focused narrative feeling unsatisfied.",
            "The story took too long to explore the events between Kaliya and Danny from seven years ago, and when the revelation finally came, it felt underwhelming. The character development and overall depth fell short of their potential. I was particularly frustrated by Kaliya's inability to find her voice or advocate for herself in various situations, which was especially disappointing given the real-world challenges faced by women of color and women in professional environments.",

It follows Danny Prescott and Kaliya Wilson, former college sweethearts who reunite seven years after their breakup. While Danny has found success, Kaliya struggles to regain her footing. The layered storyline kept me engaged, as I eagerly wondered if they could rekindle their relationship. A subplot honoring Danny's parents' love story added depth to the narrative. I appreciated the slow-burn pacing; although there aren't many physical scenes, the ones that are present are impactful. The tone strikes a perfect balance between emotional depth and humor, making it a well-rounded read.",

The dynamic between Bella and Kal was refreshing, characterized by a genuine ride-or-die spirit rather than competitiveness. Minnie was a delightful character, and her words resonated deeply with me.

            "The only drawback is that the story is told from a single point of view. However, by the end, I found that Danny's perspective was less essential than I initially thought. The single POV ultimately enhanced the narrative.",

It was refreshing to see her confront her flaws by the end of the book. Danny’s yearning for Kaliya was intense—so much so that I noted in my journal it was on par with ‘The Buccaneers’ level of longing! I also wish we had more about Nathan and Minnie Prescott; their love story captivated me and added depth to the narrative. I would have loved to explore their relationship further.",

A surprise reunion with her college sweetheart, now a top director, presents her with an opportunity to work on his next project. As they collaborate, they begin to dismantle the emotional barriers they built after their relationship ended seven years ago.",
            "I was genuinely invested in Kaliya and Danny's journey, especially as we learned more about their past few years. Their relationship felt authentic and engaging. The backdrop of Danny's parents enriched the narrative, enhancing my overall enjoyment. I also appreciated Bella, a supporting character who contributed significantly to the story.",

There were times in this book when I was talking out loud, like how you would if you were yelling at a TV because you're so invested.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Depth:**  \n  I wish we could have seen more of the initial love story so we could understand why they were so in love in the present day. Although I understand why Kaliya walked out toward the end, I wish the reunion would've been longer. I needed more!  \n\n- **Author’s Skill and Potential:**  \n  To read that this was a debut is incredibly impressive. I looked forward to picking up where I left off every time. I'm inspired by the author!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a captivating and engaging read, especially for a debut novel. The relatable characters and quick pacing kept me invested, though I wished for more depth in the backstory and a longer reunion. The author’s talent is evident, and I’m excited to see what they write next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Including his perspective would have enriched the story and provided a more complete understanding of the plot. As it stands, the narrative feels incomplete, requiring the reader to fill in too many blanks. This lack of clarity undermines the story, leaving key moments and motivations unexplained.",

This raises questions about her deep affection for someone who appears emotionally unavailable. Danny's erratic behavior creates a frustrating dynamic, leaving both Kaliya and the reader in the dark.

She is portrayed as chasing after Danny, a man who often doesn’t consider her during pivotal moments. This makes it hard to understand her deep love for someone who seems emotionally unavailable.  \n\n- **Character Development (Danny):**  \n  Danny’s hot-and-cold behavior creates a frustrating dynamic. His lack of consideration for Kaliya leaves her (and the reader) in the dark, making their relationship feel underdeveloped and one-sided.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  The romance never truly takes off due to the unresolved tension and lack of emotional reciprocity between Kaliya and Danny.

            "I appreciated the characters and the emotional depth of their experiences. The romance was enjoyable, and the central conflict was both believable and resolved effectively. However, the book felt a bit more \"woke\" than I prefer. I recognize that it can be particularly challenging for women, especially women of color, to succeed in Hollywood. Kaliya's choice to settle for a receptionist role seemed like a missed opportunity to further explore her potential. In contrast, characters like Bella, who come from wealthy backgrounds, find success more easily, highlighting real-life disparities that may feel unfair.",

            "I loved Kaliya; she is incredibly strong and handles everything thrown her way. In contrast, Danny is quite annoying. He recognizes that the other woman is not good for him but allows the situation to escalate, which feels like loser behavior. Even when he messes up at the end, he shifts the blame onto her, despite the fact that all her problems stem from him. He’s not the best male character. Their breakups felt excessive—like fifty times—and during their first relationship, it seemed like only Kaliya was in love, which left their connection poorly defined. I actually wished there hadn’t been a second chance for them. I found myself rooting for her friends more than for the main relationship."

The supporting characters, particularly Kaliya’s friends, were more compelling than the central romance.

Myah Ariel showed a great deal of promise, especially for a first book. The story had the potential to be a 4- or 5-star read, but it just missed the mark.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Interest:**  \n  While the book didn’t fully meet my expectations, I would still be open to reading more from Myah Ariel in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a strong start and showed potential, but it fell short in some areas, particularly with communication issues between the main characters.

While the conflict resolution could have been more nuanced, the overall story was engaging and heartwarming.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

I’ve been telling my coworkers that I’m starting to read grown-up books now, and this one was a great choice.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There were moments where both of the main characters made very irksome choices that could have been avoided. However, these decisions added depth to the story. You can see how they matured throughout the book, which made their journey compelling.  \n\n- **Unique Elements and Humor:**  \n  I loved the unintentional song recommendation at the end by the author. It was funny when I played Janet Jackson’s *When I Think of You* and realized, “I ALREADY KNOW THIS SONG!” It added a personal and humorous touch to the reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was an enjoyable read with well-developed characters and a few humorous, relatable moments. While some character choices were frustrating, they contributed to the story’s progression and the characters’ growth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I'm not upset with this choice, I might have preferred a different outcome for the characters. I found it realistic that she chose not to pursue directing films, as many of us change careers, but I didn't fully embrace this decision.",

I felt he lacked the assertiveness to stand up to his colleagues, particularly when it came to honoring his commitments.

The romance in the story was delightful, and I particularly enjoyed the chemistry between the characters and the added spice in their interactions!",

It was a true slow burn, which I appreciated as it allowed the relationship to develop naturally.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book was beautifully written, with a narrative that felt immersive and heartfelt.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is an amazing second-chance romance that I thoroughly enjoyed. The characters, their chemistry, and the emotional depth of the story made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nLoved. (Implied high rating, though no specific score is mentioned.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I was so excited to read this book and purchased it when it was released. It has two of my favorite tropes, Second Chance and Hollywood, which initially drew me in. However, it just didn’t live up to my expectations.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  I love second-chance romances because I’m a firm believer in romance and the idea of rekindling love. However, this story didn’t deliver the romantic vibe I was hoping for. Instead, it felt toxic and unhealthy.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The characters are amazing individually, but together, they were a disaster. Their relationship was more of a trauma bond due to his parents’ influence, and it didn’t feel like a genuine romance. He repeatedly inconvenienced her, and I didn’t feel he deserved more chances.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  The book gave me a similar vibe to *Reel* by Kennedy Ryan, which is one of my favorite books. The review from Kennedy on the front cover was promising, but this story didn’t quite hit the same mark.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I gave this book 3 stars, which feels generous. Maybe if I reread it in the future, it might hit differently, but for now, it didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its tropes and individual characters, the toxic dynamic between the main characters and the lack of genuine romance left me disappointed. It didn’t live up to my expectations, and I felt the relationship was more harmful than romantic.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

While the third-act breakup and some communication issues between the characters didn’t fully work for me, the engaging Hollywood storyline, relatable characters, and excellent audio performance made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

On a positive note, the exploration of Danny's parents' love story and its adaptation for the big screen brought a romantic richness to the narrative.",

Kaliya's journey to rediscover her passion and zest for life is particularly engaging. While Danny is endearing, his emotional infidelity toward his ex-girlfriend in the first half of the book left me feeling confused and uncomfortable.",

While Kaliya encounters constant roadblocks and stereotyping, Danny’s privileged background allows him to navigate the industry with ease.

Kaliya seemed to accept the bare minimum from him, and there was no moment of resolution that helped me understand why she continued to love or forgive him. While the text described their chemistry, I felt none of it. The only character who truly stood out was a side character, and the roles of other female characters in the conflict felt unjustified.

The angst and unresolved feelings I crave in second-chance romances were lacking.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Kaliya and Danny, the main couple, had potential, but their connection felt underdeveloped. The chemistry and passion that make you root for a couple were missing, which made it hard for me to fully invest in their love story.  \n\n- **Character Impact:**  \n  The characters overall didn’t leave a lasting impression on me. I wanted to feel something more for them—whether love, frustration, or heartbreak—but they remained somewhat distant and didn’t leap off the page.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the cover was stunning and the premise of a second-chance romance initially excited me, the story fell short in delivering the emotional depth and character connection I was hoping for. The lack of chemistry and underdeveloped characters made it difficult for me to fully engage with the love story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Kaliya Wilson is a remarkably relatable character, trapped in a mundane 9-to-5 job that leaves her feeling unfulfilled and unappreciated. Despite her dissatisfaction, she continues to work to pay the bills, and her struggles with dead ends and drifting away from her true goals resonated deeply with me. On the other hand, Danny Prescott, Hollywood’s golden child, embodies the ideal man, which ironically complicates their relationship. Both Kaliya and Danny must navigate their individual identities and determine what their relationship means for their futures—or if a future even exists for them. Their journey is both authentic and compelling.",

She’s stuck in a mundane 9-5 job, feeling unfulfilled and unappreciated, yet she has no choice but to keep working to pay her bills. Her struggles with dead ends and the growing distance from her true goals resonated deeply with me.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n  Danny Prescott, Hollywood’s golden child, is portrayed as the ideal man, which ironically becomes a challenge in itself.

Their journey felt authentic and compelling.  \n\n- **Nostalgic Appeal:**  \n  The story gave me strong 90’s classic vibes, which I absolutely loved. It felt like a throwback to timeless romance narratives, and I’m a sucker for stories that mend broken hearts and offer second chances.  \n\n- **Genre and Representation:**  \n  This is a beautifully crafted romance novel, specifically a Black romance, which adds depth and cultural richness to the story. It’s a refreshing take on adult fiction, and I appreciated the representation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMyah Ariel’s debut novel is an ordinary love story told in an extraordinary way.
