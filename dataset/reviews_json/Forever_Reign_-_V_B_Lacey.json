Isla, our self-sacrificing heroine, remains devoted to others but is learning to accept help and embrace the love surrounding her, discovering what it means to be happy. The romance is delightful! Although it's a no-spice story, don't let that deter you—there's still plenty of romance, tension, and longing that made me kick my feet in excitement while reading.",

Meanwhile, Kai and Aiden's relationship flourished, culminating in the birth of their child. Jade's struggle after losing her connection to the earth and grappling with Celestine's betrayal added significant depth to her character. While each character's journey was intriguing, I found myself wishing for a deeper connection to them.",

            "Isla's journey in *Long Live* is truly beautiful. She learns to set boundaries, recognize when to push herself, and when to simply sit with her feelings. Her growth reveals her true capabilities. Sebastian's development is equally impressive; after facing significant challenges, he overcomes mental obstacles and becomes more relatable and real. I adore him and he will always hold a place on my book boyfriend list. Rynn's evolution, as he confronts the consequences of his past actions, is also compelling. I loved witnessing Jade transform from a jaded character to someone open to communication and personal growth. The author explores each character's struggles and fears in a poignant yet beautiful manner, making their experiences feel almost tangible. Kai and Aiden remain my favorites throughout the story.",

            "Isla and Sebastian exceeded all my expectations—I adore them. Sebastian's internal monologues and letters to Isla are profoundly moving. For instance, he reflects, *“He couldn’t help the fact that he’d known her for years…had watched her and admired her from the hidden pockets of his mind, even while under Celesine’s control. She was a ray of sunshine breaking through an eternal storm. She felt like home, and he didn’t want to let go.”* He also confides, *“I’ve watched you for two years, Isla. Despite her control, you became the only truth I knew.”* \n\nThe authenticity of their relationship is palpable, as illustrated when Isla tenderly replies, *“I’ve always been yours, Sebastian,”* and he proposes, *“Then marry me, Isla Vasileia. Be my queen, my wife, my equal in every way.”* Their bond is both genuine and deeply emotional.",
            "*“Last night, I took my mother to stargaze and shared stories about you. It was the first time she smiled in months. Your presence brings me new joys every day, even from afar. Forever yours, S.”*",
            "This duology and its characters have truly captured my heart. I absolutely loved it and find it deeply underrated. The scarcity of fan art and edits only intensifies my post-reading blues. It took me eight months to finish the book because I wasn't ready to say goodbye to the characters and their world."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This duology left a profound impact on me, and I am deeply attached to Isla and Sebastian’s story. The emotional depth, character development, and beautiful writing made it a memorable read. It’s a shame that it’s so underrated, as it deserves far more recognition and appreciation.",

I absolutely adored this duology and am deeply saddened by how underrated it is.  \n  - The lack of fan art and edits is going to make my post-reading hangover even worse.  \n  - I took eight months to finish the book because I wasn’t ready to say goodbye to the characters and their world.  \n\n- **Character Development (Isla and Sebastian):**  \n  - Isla and Sebastian were everything I hoped for and more. I love them so much.  \n  - Sebastian’s internal monologues and letters to Isla were incredibly moving. For example:  \n    - *“He couldn’t help the fact that he’d known her for years…had watched her and admired her from the hidden pockets of his mind, even while under Celesine’s control. She’d brought him the smallest amounts of peace in those times, a ray of sunshine breaking through an eternal storm. She felt like home. He didn’t want to let go.”*  \n    - *“I’ve watched you for two years, Isla, and however lost I may have been to her control, you became the only thing I knew better than myself.”*  \n    - *“I want to know you in any life, in any way, Isla Vasileia. And if that means starting over, then that’s what we’ll do.”*  \n  - Their relationship felt authentic and deeply emotional. For instance:  \n    - *“I’ve always been yours, Sebastian,” she said, running her fingers through his hair and kissing his nose, then his cheek. “Then marry me, Isla Vasileia. Be my queen, my wife, my equal in every way.”*  \n\n- **Writing Style and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The writing beautifully captured the depth of Sebastian’s feelings for Isla. For example:  \n    - *“I took my mother to watch the stars last night and told her about you. It was the first time she’s smiled in months. You bring me new joys every day, without even being here. Forever yours, S.”*  \n    - *“He ended each letter the same way. And each time, her chest tightened.”*  \n  - The dialogue and internal reflections were poignant and added layers to the characters’ connection.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis duology left a profound impact on me, and I am deeply attached to Isla and Sebastian’s story. The emotional depth, character development, and beautiful writing made it a memorable read. It’s a shame that it’s so underrated, as it deserves far more recognition and appreciation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The inclusion of Sebastian’s perspective greatly enriched the narrative, offering deeper insight into his character and his relationship with Isla.

            "The ending of the story tied up key plot points, such as Rynn and Annalise’s marriage and Sebastian proposing to Isla, but it felt abrupt and emotionally flat. While the final scenes, including the kiss in the rain and the wedding, were sweet, they didn't compensate for the overall lack of engagement. The plot centered on Isla’s disappearance, the loss of elemental powers, and Earth's rebellion against humans. Although the concept was intriguing, the execution was often convoluted and difficult to follow. The introduction of primal gods, the Chamber of Iona, and the rebellion added layers of complexity that sometimes felt disjointed. Furthermore, the resolution, in which Isla sacrifices herself and restores the elements to Earth, felt rushed and ultimately unsatisfying.",

Whereas they felt forced in the first installment, the added depth of the characters made them more believable and engaging this time around. However, the multiple POVs, alongside new characters and extensive world-building, were occasionally overwhelming, especially since my focus was primarily on Isla. Additionally, I found the romance underwhelming; the dialogue often felt childish, giving it a YA vibe rather than an adult one. While I don’t believe every adult romance needs explicit content, the interactions lacked the maturity I expected.",

The first book set strong foundations for this duet, but the second book didn’t live up to my expectations.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The pacing felt off, especially in the first 100-150 pages. The momentum from the first book’s ending was lost, and it took too long to get back into the suspense.  \n   - There should have been a novella to bridge the two books, as the transition felt abrupt and overwhelming.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n   - The found family dynamics improved significantly in this book. While it felt forced in the first book, the added depth of the characters made it more believable and engaging.  \n   - The multiple POVs, new characters, and world-building were overwhelming at times, especially when my focus was primarily on Isla.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - The romance was underwhelming for me. It didn’t feel like an adult romance; the dialogue often came across as childish, which made it feel more like a YA novel.  \n   - While I don’t think every adult romance needs spice, the interactions lacked maturity.  \n\n- **Moral and Ethical Concerns:**  \n   - I was uncomfortable with a certain character getting a happily ever after despite their abusive behavior. It felt unjust and left a bad taste.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - This isn’t necessarily a “bad” book, and I can see how it might work for others. However, it didn’t resonate with me as much as the first book did.  \n   - Despite my disappointment, I still think it’s worth a shot for fans of the first book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the second book in this duet had its strengths, such as improved found family dynamics and deeper character development, it fell short in pacing, romance, and addressing moral concerns. The transition between the two books felt jarring, and the romance lacked maturity.

The pacing was excellent, and I found myself binge-reading late into the night, unable to put the book down.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The growth of the characters was a highlight for me.

It felt empowering and relatable.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  This book evoked a wide range of emotions—it made me smile, laugh, gasp, and even shed a tear or two. The emotional depth kept me fully invested in the story.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world created by V. B. Lacey is incredible, and while I didn’t want to say goodbye, the ending felt perfect and satisfying. The elemental magic and the found family trope added layers of richness to the narrative.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance was beautifully written, with witty banter and a \"he falls first\" dynamic.

            "The story picks up a few months after the poignant conclusion of the first book, with characters grappling with their trauma in unique ways. When they reunite, they join forces to search for a magical dagger that could restore nature's balance. This narrative transcends a simple quest, delving into character development, deep emotions, political intrigue, secrets, sacrifice, and love. The ending is both perfect and satisfying, leaving me bittersweet—sad that the journey has ended but overwhelmingly happy for the characters' fates.",
            "The characters are well-developed, with their growth serving as a central focus of the story. The strong female main character is fiercely devoted to her loved ones, while the male main character is both witty and charming. The found family dynamic among the characters adds a special, heartwarming touch to the narrative.",
            "The multiple points of view are skillfully executed, enhancing the story's flow rather than disrupting it. This approach allows readers to become deeply invested in several characters, which I thoroughly enjoyed.",

The characters are all coping with the traumatic events in their own ways, and once they reunite, they band together to continue their quest to find a magical dagger that will hopefully restore the balance of nature. The story is much more than a quest—it’s full of character development, deep emotions, political intrigue, secrets, sacrifice, and love. The ending was perfect and super satisfying. I was sad that it was over but overwhelmingly happy for all the characters.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are well-developed, and their growth is a central focus of the story. The strong female main character (FMC) is willing to do anything for those she loves, and the male main character (MMC) is witty and charming. The found family dynamic among the characters is special and heartwarming.  \n\n- **Writing Style and POV:**  \n  The multiple points of view (POV) are well-executed and don’t disrupt the flow of the story. Instead, they provide a wonderful opportunity to become invested in multiple characters, which I loved.  \n\n- **Themes and Elements:**  \n  The story includes themes of found family, epic quests, elemental magic, and a swoony romance full of delicious tension (but no spice). It also features a happily ever after ending, which I adored.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a beautifully crafted continuation of the duology, blending emotional depth, character growth, and an engaging plot. The found family dynamic, multiple POVs, and satisfying ending make it a standout read. I highly recommend this duology to fans of strong FMCs, charming MMCs, and stories filled with magic, romance, and heart.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The plot revolves around Isla’s mission to restore the elementals’ magic, with high stakes—whether the world or Isla herself will face destruction. However, the narrative undoes much of what was accomplished in the first book, which felt like a setback.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Perspective:**  \n  The book is written in the third person, with an overarching, almost ominous narrative voice. The frequent \"POV changes\" are not true shifts in perspective, as the story remains in third person throughout. This style made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the story, as I typically prefer first-person narratives.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The themes of found family, happy endings, and slow romance are well-executed and enjoyable. The emotional moments between characters, particularly Isla and Sebastian, are touching and add depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book is a fun read with engaging character dynamics, heartfelt moments, and a compelling world. However, the slow start, unnecessary length, and third-person narrative style made it challenging to fully connect with the story. Despite these issues, the friendships, romance, and witty banter kept me entertained.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
