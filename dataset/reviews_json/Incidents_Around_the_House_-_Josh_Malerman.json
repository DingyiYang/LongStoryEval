            "This story centers on Little Bela and her imaginary friend, the other mother, who resides in her closet and appears by her bedside. However, this other mother is not a true friend; she is a malevolent entity that seeks to invade Bela's heart, growing more powerful and shadowing her every move. As Bela's family begins to unravel, the entity's influence intensifies, leaving her with no means of escape. The plot compellingly explores whether Bela can save her family or confront the monster before it claims her heart—and at what cost.",

            "I anticipated the overall direction of the ending, though the specific details caught me off guard. While it wasn't entirely surprising, the conclusion was still chilling and felt like the only logical resolution to the story.",
            "At first, I found the young child narrator off-putting due to its overly juvenile tone. Typically, I dislike the absence of quotation marks around dialogue, but in this instance, it enhanced the story's creepiness. The child's casual demeanor when recounting terrifying events added an unsettling layer to the narrative.",
            "This book presents a much scarier, adult-oriented twist on *Coraline*, evoking the eerie atmosphere and dread reminiscent of *Paranormal Activity*. The character of Other Mommy is particularly unsettling, surpassing even the demon from *Paranormal Activity* in terms of creepiness.",
            "This book was so terrifying that I had to put it down late at night and finish it the next morning to escape the fear. It's one of the scariest horror novels I've encountered, rivaling Stephen King's *The Tommyknockers*. The fear is palpable, featuring intense bursts of terror interspersed with prolonged tension and panic."

        "conclusion": "*Incidents Around the House* is a deeply unsettling and terrifying horror novel that kept me hooked despite my initial reservations about the narration style. The combination of a child’s perspective, the lack of quotation marks, and the relentless creepiness of the story made it a standout read. While the ending was somewhat predictable, it was still effective and fitting. Overall, this is one of the scariest books I’ve encountered in years.",

The narrative acts as a supernatural cautionary tale about the perils of parental neglect and the real-life threats that vulnerable children face. It delves into themes of neglect, vulnerability, and the loss of innocence, with Other Mommy symbolizing the dire consequences of parental absence.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n   - I don’t often read horror, but this book appealed to me. It’s a chilling horror novel about a haunting, and I think it would translate well to the big screen.  \n\n- **Narration and Perspective:**  \n   - The story is told entirely from the unique first-person perspective of eight-year-old Bela, which adds a compelling layer to the narrative.  \n   - The Audible narration by Delanie Nicole Gill is fantastic and enhances the experience.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The story revolves around Bela, who is being targeted by an entity called “Other Mommy” that seeks reincarnation. The entity manipulates Bela, pretending to be her friend while growing increasingly impatient.  \n   - The desperation of Bela’s family—Daddo, Mommy, and Grandma Ruth—as they try to save her is palpable and adds emotional depth.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tension:**  \n   - The evil in the story is always lurking just out of view, creating a constant sense of dread, much like the movie *A Quiet Place*.  \n   - I felt terrified for Bela throughout the story, and the tension was masterfully maintained.  \n\n- **Ending and Impact:**  \n   - The ending left a lasting impression on me. I finished the book last night and woke up still thinking about it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a gripping and chilling horror novel that stands out due to its unique perspective, intense atmosphere, and emotional depth. The story lingers long after reading, and the narration adds an extra layer of immersion. It’s a must-read for fans of the genre and has the potential to be a great film adaptation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review."

The plot is somewhat predictable, particularly in explaining Bela's encounters with Other Mommy. While the origins and nature of Other Mommy remain mysterious, this ambiguity may leave some readers craving more clarity. The narrative unfolds gradually, allowing the story to develop at its own pace. Although the repetitive style is effective, it may come across as overly verbose to some.",

The repetition in the writing flows smoothly, effectively contributing to the story's buildup.",

It successfully unsettles, drawing us into the unknown, with a persistent sense of being haunted by a demonic presence. While it echoes *The Exorcist* by William Peter Blatty, it falls short in complexity and depth. Though it doesn't strive to be groundbreaking, it delivers a solid and unsettling reading experience."

This emotional resonance is a testament to the story's power.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author's Other Work:**  \n  In some ways, this book felt even better than *Bird Box*, another work by Josh Malerman. The darkness and intensity of the story stood out to me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel excels in its use of a child's perspective to create a believable and chilling narrative. The inclusion of Bela's parents as active participants in the story adds depth, and the emotional impact of the ending is profound. While I initially rated it highly, I believe it has the potential to earn a perfect score upon further reflection.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nPotentially 5/5, as it surpasses *Bird Box* in certain aspects."

            "The story intensifies rapidly when Other Mommy reveals herself at a parents' party, shattering the reality of those present. The family's efforts to confront the entity—through occult groups, priests, and home improvements—infuse the plot with tension and depth. The introduction of Brian, a self-proclaimed expert who insists on proof of the entity's existence, adds a relatable, human dimension to the narrative.",
            "Bella's relationship with the entity known as Other Mommy is intricate. At times, she finds comfort and laughter in its presence, while at other moments, she questions its true intentions. Bella's parents, especially her mother, are flawed; although irresponsible, her mother makes some attempts to keep Bella safe during their parties. Other Mommy is both clever and patient, initially offering friendship before resorting to manipulation and fear, ultimately preying on Bella's innocence.",

The normalization of alcohol in Bella's life, despite being a character flaw, adds an unsettling yet realistic dimension to the narrative. While the ultimate sacrifice proposed by the occult leader raises questions given earlier events, the boldness of the ending is commendable for its willingness to take risks.",
            "Other Mommy is a masterfully crafted character, skillfully instilling genuine fear and unease. Her manipulation of Bella, through whispered lies and ever-changing appearances, adds a chilling layer to the story. The horror is deeply psychological, as Other Mommy exploits Bella’s vulnerabilities and uncovers family secrets, creating an unsettling sense of dread that lingers throughout."

While some aspects, such as Bella’s cognitive development and the portrayal of alcohol, may feel off-putting or inconsistent, the story excels in creating an unsettling atmosphere and delivering a psychologically gripping plot. The ending is daring and memorable, solidifying the novel as a bold entry in the possession subgenre.",

            "The story is narrated in the first-person perspective of Bela, an eight-year-old girl. Initially, her voice feels choppy and simplistic, but it becomes more engaging as the narrative unfolds. Bela's unique perspective brings a sense of wonder and acceptance to the strange events around her, making her an ideal narrator. The novel introduces the supernatural threat early on, with each encounter proving intense and impactful. However, the middle section tends to feel repetitive, as characters move from one set piece to another in their attempts to escape danger, which could have been streamlined for better pacing. Fortunately, the final third of the book significantly picks up, delivering both emotional and narrative payoffs.",
            "Bela's parents, Mommy and Daddo, harbor underlying tensions and secrets that Bela uncovers through her keen observations, enriching the story's emotional depth. Meanwhile, Bela's grandmother emerges as a nurturing and perceptive support system, offering an emotional anchor for the characters.",
            "This story delves into intricate family dynamics, featuring deeply moving moments that brought tears to my eyes. The ending, though divisive, is effective and caught me off guard in a meticulously crafted and intentional way."

        "conclusion": "*Incidents Around the House* is a unique and emotionally resonant horror novel that combines a chilling supernatural threat with a deeply human story of family dynamics. While the middle section drags slightly, the narrative's unique perspective, terrifying antagonist, and poignant moments make it a memorable read. The ending, though divisive, is thoughtfully crafted and leaves a lasting impression. This book has solidified my interest in the author's storytelling, and I look forward to exploring more of his works.",

            "I typically don't enjoy stories narrated from a child's perspective, but this one surprisingly resonated with me. I anticipated the plot twist early on, yet I was taken aback by its timing, occurring almost at the very end. Despite this, I found the execution genuinely creepy and satisfying. However, the final few sentences left me a bit confused, as their meaning wasn't entirely clear.",
            "My favorite characters were Bela and Lois, who felt incredibly real and relatable. I particularly adored Lois for her sweet and endearing personality. In contrast, Ursula was my least favorite; she often came across as unpleasant and seemed to lack genuine affection for her daughter, Bela. I truly appreciated the heartwarming and touching relationship between Bela and her father.",
            "While the repetitive phrases like \"mommy says\" and \"daddo says\" became somewhat grating, I found the writing style enjoyable. The dialogue-driven narrative allowed the chapters to flow quickly, making for an engaging read. I would have preferred more varied and eerie dialogue from the other mommy, as the repetition detracted from the overall creepiness. Nevertheless, the book's brisk pace and spooky atmosphere make it an excellent choice for anyone seeking a quick, atmospheric haunted house story.",
            "The haunted house atmosphere was exceptionally creepy and skillfully crafted. There were times when I couldn't bear to read it in the dark! The descriptions of the other mother, especially her appearance and movements, were particularly unsettling."

It was engaging and added a unique perspective to the story.  \n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The book genuinely spooked me during the first two-thirds, creating a strong sense of tension and unease.  \n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was a major letdown. It felt like a whole lot of nothing, hidden behind rambling and incoherent metaphors. I found it unsatisfying and confusing.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, especially the mom, were unrealistic and poorly written. The portrayal of the mom was so exaggerated and awful that it felt like the author had a personal vendetta against women.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the first two-thirds of the book had me hooked with its child narration and spooky atmosphere, the ending fell flat and left me disappointed. The unrealistic characters, particularly the mom, further detracted from my overall enjoyment. I’m left wondering if I missed something about the ending, as it didn’t resonate with me at all.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The book is narrated entirely from Bela’s perspective, which may take some adjustment but ultimately lends a unique voice to the story. The fast-paced writing style is engaging and keeps the reader hooked. While the ending is well-crafted, it is also predictable, with many readers likely guessing the outcome early on. Additionally, the story becomes repetitive, cycling through different locations and encounters with ‘Other Mommy’ in a manner that feels like “wash, rinse, repeat.” This redundancy diminishes the overall impact of the horror elements.",
            "The adult characters' actions are frustratingly illogical, undermining the story’s potential. Despite clear evidence that 'Other Mommy' is on the move, the parents continually change locations, creating an air of redundancy. Their final attempt to resolve the situation is even less logical than their earlier choices.",

While her parents initially regard this as mere imagination, they soon become alarmed as 'Other Mommy' begins to make increasingly disturbing demands of Bela."

            "The story follows eight-year-old Bela, who discovers a mysterious figure called Other Mommy lurking in her closet. As her family attempts to escape and confront this entity, others begin to see it as well. The plot evokes memories of the 1980s film *Poltergeist*, with Bela reminiscent of Carol Anne. However, unlike *Poltergeist*, the narrative lacks coherence and ultimately unravels. The reason for Other Mommy's presence remains unclear, leaving me unsatisfied after nearly 400 pages. The open-ended conclusion was particularly frustrating; after investing so much time in the story, I expected a clearer resolution or explanation for the events.",
            "The story is narrated from the perspective of an eight-year-old, employing short and repetitive sentences that may not resonate with all readers. The audiobook features a high-pitched narration reminiscent of Minnie Mouse, which can be quite grating. Additionally, increasing the playback speed to 1.5X only amplifies the repetitive nature of the text."

While the choice to narrate the story solely from Bela’s perspective is intriguing, it ultimately falls flat. I struggled to truly connect with Bela; she came off as one-dimensional instead of a rich, complex character. Children are not blank slates—they possess depth, memories, and associations. Incorporating brief interludes from adult perspectives, such as Grandma or Lois, would have added layers to the story and fostered a deeper investment in the characters' outcomes.",

However, the synopsis inaccurately claims that Bela is 8; she comes across as more like 6. Additionally, the repeated use of \"Daddo\" became somewhat grating. While the early descriptions of Other Mommy were genuinely frightening, that sense of creepiness diminished as the story unfolded. Once the family hit the road, their encounters with Other Mommy became repetitive and ultimately lost their fright factor."

However, its potential is limited by underdeveloped secondary characters, particularly the parents, which detracts from the overall impact of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

While this viewpoint initially feels fresh and engaging, it tends to become repetitive as the plot progresses. The narrative is fairly predictable; although the overarching story is somewhat unclear, many individual events and spooky moments are telegraphed, diminishing the impact of the horror elements. The ending delivers intensity and resonance, but it feels somewhat anticipated after a while.

Ursula was particularly insufferable, treating her child as a sounding board for her adult problems.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n   - The first half of the book and the ending were very creepy, making it difficult to listen to at nighttime.  \n   - The eerie feeling was somewhat lost in the latter half of the book, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Narration and Character Development:**  \n   - Bela’s narration, while adding a sense of creepiness, felt too innocent and made it hard to connect with the deeper meaning of the story.  \n   - Ursula was insufferable, particularly in how she treated her child as a diary for adult woes.  \n   - Ruth and Russ were likable characters, though the constant use of “daddo” for the father felt odd and unnatural.  \n   - Other Mommy’s shape-shifting descriptions, reminiscent of a child’s drawing, took away from the horror element.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The “take away her innocence” plan felt flat and seemed like a ploy to insert a plot twist, making the layout feel strange.  \n   - The ending was rushed but also unexpected and sad, which I appreciated.  \n   - Once Ursula encountered Other Mommy, the story lost its flow and became disjointed, bouncing from one scene to the next.  \n\n- **Execution of Horror Elements:**  \n   - The attempts to fight the demon (e.g., using a knife and large dogs) felt unrealistic and undermined the horror of facing a creature from another realm.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had a strong start with a creepy atmosphere, but the latter half fell short in maintaining the eeriness and coherence. While the ending was unexpected and emotionally impactful, the disjointed plot, underdeveloped horror elements, and some character choices left me feeling underwhelmed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nOverall, meh. This book was okay."

            "This book offers a quick and engaging read, making it an ideal palate cleanser. However, the ending felt abrupt and left me feeling unsatisfied. The story is narrated by an 8-year-old girl named Bella, who befriends a mysterious figure known as \"other mommy,\" living in her closet. As her parents' marriage deteriorates and strange events unfold in their home, Bella grapples with the idea of letting this enigmatic presence into her heart. While the premise is intriguing, the execution ultimately did not meet my expectations.",
            "The parents were overly irritating, marked by their excessive drinking, poor choices, and inappropriate conversations with Bella, treating her as an adult. Additionally, many of the supporting characters lacked depth, making them frustrating to follow.",
            "Many readers have labeled the book as truly scary, but I found it more creepy than terrifying. While the image of another mother crawling on all fours was unsettling, it didn't elicit the level of fear I had expected."

I would definitely read it in one sitting!",

She feels like a hollow vessel rather than a fully realized character.  \n   - The adults, particularly Bela’s parents, are given more attention, but their dialogue feels forced and unnatural, often serving as a vehicle for the author to explicitly explain themes and morals.  \n   - The portrayal of Bela’s parents is problematic, with the father depicted as a flawless saint and the mother as the sole source of marital conflict, perpetuating misogynistic stereotypes.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n   - The horror elements are uninspired and fail to evoke fear or dread. The “horrifying” moments are straightforward and lack creativity.  \n   - The entity, ‘Other Mommy,’ is not effectively utilized to create a sense of terror or unease.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing feels lazy and bloated, with excessive repetition and a lack of narrative focus.  \n   - Themes and metaphors are clumsily spelled out through dialogue rather than being developed organically through the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Moral Messaging:**  \n   - The book’s themes are heavy-handed and poorly integrated, often delivered through unnatural philosophical ramblings by the adult characters.  \n   - The portrayal of marriage and gender roles is deeply flawed, with the narrative unfairly vilifying the mother while idealizing the father.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Incidents Around the House* by Josh Malerman is a disappointing and poorly executed horror novel. It fails to deliver on its promise of being a genuinely frightening read, instead offering a repetitive plot, poorly developed characters, and uninspired horror elements. The writing is bloated and lazy, and the themes are clumsily handled, often veering into misogynistic territory. Overall, the book was a frustrating and regrettable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n0.25 stars"

            "The author attempts to capture the perspective of an eight-year-old, but it falls short; Bela often sounds even younger than her age. The narrative style, lacking punctuation and dialogue marks, complicates the reading experience despite making it brisk. It begins strongly, with Bela enchanted by Other Mommy, but quickly becomes repetitive as the family moves from house to house to escape her. Although there is some tension in their attempts to stay ahead of Other Mommy, the plot lacks depth and variety. The ending is predictable and fails to deliver the intense climax I anticipated. While I did not expect a happy resolution given the premise, I hoped for something more impactful—perhaps a possession or a deeper exploration of Other Mommy's origins. The family's struggle to protect Bela creates urgency, yet the conflict feels underdeveloped. The efforts of the parents and grandmother to fight back lead to few significant revelations. Additionally, the absence of background information about Other Mommy leaves much to be desired.",

I appreciate the classic horror trope of a haunted house, and the addition of an entity connected to a child adds a unique twist.",

While it is not explicitly about child neglect or psychological abuse, these themes are present yet poorly executed.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narrative Perspective and Authenticity:**  \n   - The book is written from the perspective of an 8-year-old child, Bela, but her voice is inconsistent. At times, she sounds very young (e.g., calling an entity \"other mommy\" and referring to her dad as \"Daddo\"), while at other times, the narrative feels overly mature or forced.  \n   - The child's perspective often feels inauthentic, as if the author is projecting his own voice rather than capturing a genuine child's thoughts and emotions.  \n\n- **Adult-Child Interactions:**  \n   - The interactions between adults and Bela are problematic. The way adults explain complex, messy life situations to an 8-year-old comes across as psychologically abusive and traumatic.  \n   - These moments feel less like natural character interactions and more like the author directly addressing the reader, which makes the narrative heavy-handed and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n   - The book attempts to use foreshadowing and repetition (e.g., \"Daddo\" and the mother's unexplained cruelty), but these elements fail to create a cohesive or satisfying narrative.  \n   - The story devolves into clichéd life lessons that are neither relatable for adults nor appropriate for a child.  \n   - Despite not being a story about child neglect or psychological abuse, these themes are prevalent and poorly handled.  \n\n- **Final Resolution and Moral Messaging:**  \n   - The concept for the final resolution is intriguing, but its execution is melodramatic and crass.  \n   - The revelation feels overly filtered and lacks the nuance needed for an 8-year-old character to realistically grasp it.  \n   - The story's moral messaging about promiscuity and family structure comes across as judgmental and unnecessarily vilifies non-Catholic family ideals.  \n\n- **Author Comparison and Overall Impression:**  \n   - Compared to the author's previous works (\"Bird Box,\" \"Malorie,\" and \"House at the Bottom of a Lake\"), this book falls short.  \n   - The heavy-handed approach and inconsistent narrative have diminished my appreciation for Josh Malerman as an author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Incidents...\" is a novel with a promising concept but flawed execution. The inconsistent child perspective, problematic adult-child interactions, and heavy-handed moral messaging detract from the story's potential. While the final resolution has an interesting premise, its delivery is melodramatic and crass. Overall, the book fails to come together in a satisfying way, leaving me disappointed and less enthusiastic about the author's work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The ending left me feeling confused and unsatisfied. I anticipated more resolution or explanation regarding Bella's decision, its impact on her family, and whether it ultimately led to happiness. I expected a twist where Bella would say yes, but the story concluded abruptly, leaving the consequences unexplored.",
            "The unique format, presented as a child's narration, didn't bother me at all; in fact, it felt fitting. The book captivated me from the very beginning, making it impossible to put down.",
            "The book features intriguing twists and unsettling moments, but it ultimately falls short of its reputation as the scariest book ever. In comparison to other ghost, haunted, and fantasy novels, it lacks a truly frightening impact."

        "conclusion": "The book started strong with an engaging narrative style and kept me hooked throughout.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narrative Format and Style:**  \n   - The format didn’t bother me as the author explained in the beginning that the story was told like a child was narrating it, which felt appropriate.  \n   - The book had me hooked from the start; I couldn’t stop reading it.  \n\n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n   - The ending left me confused and unsatisfied. I expected more resolution or explanation, such as what happened after Bella’s decision, how it affected the family, and whether it brought happiness.  \n   - I thought the twist would involve Bella saying yes, but the story ended abruptly without exploring the consequences.  \n\n- **Genre and Atmosphere:**  \n   - While the book had some interesting twists and creepy moments, it didn’t live up to the hype of being the scariest book ever.  \n   - Compared to other ghost/haunted/fantasy books, this one didn’t strike me as particularly frightening.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Disappointment:**  \n   - Despite being engrossed in the story, the disappointing ending significantly impacted my overall enjoyment.  \n   - If a book captivates me but leaves me feeling let down by the conclusion, it’s hard to rate it highly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book started strong with an engaging narrative style and kept me hooked throughout. However, the abrupt and unsatisfying ending overshadowed the experience, leaving me disappointed.

            "The story centers on Bela's unsettling encounters with Other Mommy, who relentlessly poses the same question. While the premise is intriguing and offers opportunities for a compelling horror narrative, the execution ultimately falls short. The repetition undermines the suspense, leaving the story feeling shallow and monotonous, lacking the depth necessary to maintain engagement.",
            "Bela, an eight-year-old girl, often comes across as much younger, which undermines the believability of her character. The family's dynamics are dysfunctional, featuring a commitment-phobic mother and a passive father who fails to intervene. As a result, I struggled to connect with or care about any of the characters, making it challenging to invest in their outcomes.",
            "The narrative is overly simplistic and repetitive, reminiscent of a story told by a five-year-old. This style did not resonate with me, making the book feel less engaging and mature than I had anticipated."

        "conclusion": "While the novel had an interesting premise with potential for a chilling story, the execution fell short due to repetitive writing, underdeveloped characters, and a narrative style that didn’t align with my preferences. I wanted to love this book, but it ultimately didn’t resonate with me.",
