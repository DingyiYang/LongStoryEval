Additionally, the story bore a striking resemblance to *Knives Out*, resulting in predictable twists for those familiar with the film. The self-defense interludes seemed out of place and overly self-indulgent, likely reflecting the author's personal interest in martial arts.",
            "The characters, especially Tabatha and Callum, lacked depth and personality. Their witty banter couldn't make up for the absence of genuine development, rendering them one-dimensional. Tabatha's narrative voice was weak and heavily reliant on snark, failing to convey her supposed passion for magic or establish her as a compelling protagonist. Additionally, the portrayal of a gay character who dies came across as outdated and problematic, particularly in today's context.",

Phrases like \"oh, bless you,\" \"pray tell,\" and \"go on the lam\" come across as jarring and unrealistic. References used by the teen characters, such as Joe Hardy, seem outdated and unlikely to resonate with 2024 teens. Additionally, Tabatha's use of her last name when speaking to herself lacks authenticity, especially for a Chinese teenager. The depiction of Chinese immigrant parents, exemplified by Tabatha’s mother saying, “Don’t argue with me. It’s not filial,” feels stereotypical and perpetuates outdated cultural tropes.",

While Tang’s previous works relied on strong characters to carry the story, this one fell short in that regard.  \n- **Length:**  \n  The book felt too short for the story it aimed to tell. A longer length might have allowed for better pacing, character development, and exploration of the magic system.  \n- **Author Comparison:**  \n  Having read Tang’s previous works, I found this one disappointing in comparison.

            "The mystery was captivating, enriched by family scandals and unpredictable magic. However, the resolution felt rushed and unsatisfactory, as it lacked essential foreshadowing and character motives. The final 20 pages, in particular, were poorly anticipated, which detracted from the overall enjoyment. While the story's brevity worked well for much of the narrative, it ultimately harmed the ending. Additional scenes featuring the culprit could have strengthened the resolution and made the prophetic twist more rewarding.",

While I did get some of that vibe, it fell short of my expectations of a *Knives Out* meets *The Inheritance Games* experience.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  - The pacing was inconsistent. For a shorter book (256 pages), the plot would speed up abruptly, then stop, and repeat this pattern. The last 25% of the book flew by, and the ending felt rushed. I think it could have been fleshed out better.  \n\n- **Narration Style:**  \n  - The narration was unique, written in first person with Tabatha engaging the reader directly. It felt like an internal monologue, with bits of the story told through her thoughts. The style was more \"tell us, not show us,\" which didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n- **Character Development (Tabatha):**  \n  - Tabatha’s character fell a bit flat. She relied on the big personalities of other characters to drive the story, and I never felt like I got to know her deeply.  \n\n- **Magic Element:**  \n  - I expected more magic, especially since Tabatha is one of the greatest sorcerer’s apprentices. She only performs magic once or twice, and it wasn’t memorable.  \n\n- **Mystery and Plot:**  \n  - The mystery was intriguing, and I love a whodunnit with twists. However, the resolution felt rushed and the reason behind the mystery seemed like a miscommunication, trying to be profound but falling short.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Tone:**  \n  - Despite my criticisms, I enjoyed the story. It’s a fun YA book with magic blended well into a contemporary world. The characters are quick-witted, and there’s enjoyable banter. While it wasn’t a personal favorite, it’s not a bad book or story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an enjoyable YA mystery with a magical twist, though it didn’t fully meet my expectations. The pacing and character development could have been stronger, but the witty banter and intriguing mystery made it a fun read.

The idea of combining *Knives Out* with magic sounded exciting and unique.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  My biggest issue with the book is the lack of world-building. The world these characters inhabit is not established at all, which made it really confusing to follow along. It seems like a modern-day setting with magic, but the principles of the magic are not explained whatsoever. This lack of clarity made it difficult to immerse myself in the story.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book reads like we've been dropped into the middle of a story or even a series. This made it hard to get into and connect with both the characters and the plot. The lack of context or background information left me feeling disconnected.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  I found the romance side story unnecessary. It didn’t add much to the overall narrative and felt like a distraction rather than an enhancement.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  I was able to predict the ending, which made it a letdown. The lack of surprises or twists diminished my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Potential vs. Execution:**  \n  I think this book had potential that was sadly not reached. The intriguing premise and concept were not fully realized due to the issues with world-building, narrative structure, and predictability.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of a fortune-hunting mystery with magic was promising, the execution fell short for me. The lack of world-building, confusing narrative structure, unnecessary romance subplot, and predictable ending made it difficult to fully enjoy. However, if you enjoy the idea of *Knives Out* with magic, you might still find some enjoyment in this book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

This approach could help broaden readers’ perspectives.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  - While the book was fun, it ultimately fell a bit flat. It wasn’t bad, but it didn’t live up to the expectations set by comparisons to *The Inheritance Games*.  \n  - The marketing strategy of comparing it to IG may have done the book a disservice, as it created unrealistic expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has an interesting premise and offers a refreshing Asian American perspective, but it struggles with underdeveloped elements like the magic system and fails to meet the high expectations set by comparisons to *The Inheritance Games*. While enjoyable, it doesn’t fully deliver on its potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story often veers off on tangents, disrupting the flow and making it difficult to maintain focus. Its lack of a structured investigation and minimal action undermines the suspense and mystery. However, there is a decent twist at the end that adds some intrigue. Despite these flaws, the narrative kept me curious enough to finish and discover the identity of the murderer. The plot had significant potential, and the initial chapters were engaging, particularly the premise of a murder mystery involving a sorcerer’s death and a cryptic prophecy. Unfortunately, it ultimately fell short of expectations, lacking the depth of a true murder mystery and the necessary investigative elements.",

They rely more on motives than on a thorough examination of clues, spending only a short time in Sorcerer Solomon's workshop. Ultimately, Tabitha does not solve the mystery; the murderer reveals themselves, and she merely pieces the information together afterward.",

I would have liked more exploration of the magical apprenticeship and the relationship dynamics.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n   - Comparisons to *Knives Out* are accurate in terms of setup: a wealthy man with a bickering family is murdered, and an outsider solves the mystery. However, this story adds magic to the mix.  \n   - Comparisons to *The Inheritance Games* are less accurate. The only similarity is the fight for a fortune and the presence of moody teenagers.  \n\n- **Characterization and Tone:**  \n   - Tabatha’s tone as a narrator comes off as pretentious, argumentative, and unlikeable. Her interactions solidify this impression, crossing the line from prickly-but-loveable to sour-asshole.  \n   - Tabatha’s portrayal as a damsel in distress is frustrating. Despite being a witch and taking self-defense classes, she never uses her abilities or skills to save herself, which feels like lazy writing.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n   - The inclusion of a scene where Tabatha finds being pinned down in a self-defense class “kind of sexy” is problematic, especially in a YA novel. It sends a troubling message to teenage girls about being at a man’s mercy.  \n   - The lack of magic use by the witch is a major disappointment.

The repeated emphasis on characters being \"spoiled,\" \"rich,\" or \"rich white guy\" became overdone and distracting, to the point where it felt excessive and almost comical.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters came across as one-dimensional, lacking depth or complexity. This made it hard to connect with or care about them.  \n\n- **Mystery Element:**  \n  The mystery aspect of the story was underwhelming and not compelling enough to engage me. I found it unremarkable and chose not to delve deeper into it.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite finishing the book, it ultimately didn’t work for me. The combination of unnatural dialogue, flat characters, and an unengaging mystery made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I managed to finish the book, it failed to resonate with me due to its unnatural dialogue, lack of character depth, and unremarkable mystery. Overall, this novel wasn’t a good fit for my tastes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this light-hearted story, the snarky teenage protagonist, Tabatha, brings a fun energy to the narrative. However, some characters, such as Sorcerer Solomon's popular son and the paranormal detective, feel underdeveloped or underutilized, leaving gaps in the overall plot. While Solomon's murder serves as a central element, his character remains vague, making it hard to grasp its significance. Additionally, a subsequent character death seems jarring, given the unclear relationships with the family. On a positive note, the sibling dynamics and the involvement of parents—especially Tabatha's protective yet supportive mother—add depth to the story.",
            "The snarky tone often enhances the narrative, but it can sometimes come across as amateurish, particularly with excessive sighing or nicknames like \"squishy wizard.\" Certain jokes, such as the comments about Mormon funerals or the use of \"I'm gay\" as a snarky comeback, feel unnecessary or poorly executed.",

This juxtaposition lends a light tone to the narrative, despite its darker elements. However, certain magical aspects are not adequately explained, making it challenging to fully grasp how magic integrates into everyday life.",

            "The pacing in the middle of the book was notably slow, making it a prolonged read. While the story starts off with a fast pace, it drags in the middle before picking up again towards the end. The conclusion left me curious about Felix and how the family will adapt, especially as Tabatha inherits their legacy. Callum appears indifferent to the occult, yet Felix may still have an interest, and I’m intrigued to see how his life unfolds outside of a magical environment.\n\nHowever, the narrative often felt repetitive, making it difficult to follow the plot. The twist revealing Circe as the killer was unsatisfying; the mystery seemed resolved with Callum, only to shift to Circe without adequate time to process the change. There were too many potential suspects—Callum, his mother, Felix—but their motives lacked clarity and strength. Circe's actions felt unjustified, even considering her mental health challenges.",
            "I found the main characters lacking in depth; they weren’t bad, just somewhat unengaging. Callum was a suspect from the start, yet his interactions with the protagonist, Tabatha, painted him more as a troubled youth seeking his father's affection. Circe, the eventual antagonist, felt underdeveloped; she seemed like a whiny character grappling with mental health issues, but her role as the villain required more development. Felix, on the other hand, was a likable character, and I wished to explore more about him, particularly his kinetic magical abilities.",

Instead of high fantasy, it delves into magical realism, where sorcery is a common practice rather than an exotic element. This genre shift was jarring for me.

It’s not high fantasy but leans more toward magical realism, where sorcery exists but has become a common practice over time. This shift in genre was a bit jarring for me.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Background:**\n   - Tabatha Zeng, the protagonist, is an apprentice to a renowned sorcerer, Sorcerer Solomon. She comes from a non-magical family, while the Solomon family is a longstanding pillar of the magic community. This contrast is interesting but not deeply explored.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**\n   - The book briefly touches on themes like race and societal expectations, but these discussions are superficial and not fully developed. They feel like missed opportunities to add depth to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot revolves around Tabatha solving the mystery of Sorcerer Solomon’s predicted death with the help of his son, Callum. However, the pacing is uneven, with significant time jumps that make the timeline confusing. The ending feels rushed, leaving little room to unpack the complexities of the murderer’s motives.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building is weak. While we’re given snippets of information, such as a council approving the expansion of magic, there’s no context or exploration of the implications. This lack of depth makes the world feel underdeveloped.\n\n- **Dialogue and Language:**\n   - The dialogue and language felt inconsistent. Despite the story being set on the East Coast of the United States, the characters often use British phrases like “bloody,” and the syntax sometimes feels off. This inconsistency was distracting.\n\n- **Action and Suspense:**\n   - There’s very little action or suspense throughout the book. The sleuthing is minimal, and clues are scarce. The murderer’s confession comes abruptly, and the action is mostly confined to the last 15% of the book, with low stakes and quick resolutions.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**\n   - The narrative style occasionally breaks the fourth wall, addressing the reader directly. While this works in some parts (like the beginning and end), it becomes intrusive when used throughout the book, pulling me out of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I had hoped. The weak world-building, uneven pacing, and lack of action made it a slog to get through. However, I think it could appeal to younger YA readers who might not mind these issues as much.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While there is a romantic subplot between her and another character, it feels underdeveloped. Despite their time spent together and the heightened emotions from the murder investigation, the romance lacks meaningful buildup and isn't central to the narrative.

Upon the revelation of the murderer, I recognized the clues I had initially overlooked, having dismissed them too soon as suspects.",

The pacing becomes uneven, culminating in a rushed ending that leaves unanswered questions and weakens the climax's impact. The mystery lacks suspense, as Tabitha and Callum tend to speculate rather than actively pursue clues.

Their backgrounds and motivations are only briefly explored, making it challenging to form a deeper connection with them.",

However, I was disappointed that her skills in sorcery and prophecy, which were heavily emphasized, were rarely demonstrated. The one occasion she attempted to use her abilities ended abruptly and was forgotten. Tabatha's reactions, such as her amusement during the car scene, struck the right tone, shifting from emotional to awkward in a delightfully funny way.

It centers on a murder mystery involving a dysfunctional magical family, where outsider Tabatha partners with Solomon's youngest son to uncover the truth.

Despite these flaws, the plot's engaging turns keep the story compelling.",

            "This novel offers a quick and enjoyable read, featuring a lively tone and sharp-witted characters. The blend of modern fantasy with a murder mystery creates an engaging and fast-paced narrative. The mystery itself is well-crafted, with high stakes and authentic surprises. The final twist and the reveal of the murderer are particularly satisfying, as all the elements come together cohesively. However, I wished for a longer format to foster a deeper connection with the characters and to delve more thoroughly into the magic system.",
            "The characters are expertly crafted, with Callum emerging as a standout. His sarcasm and witty remarks, underscored by his trauma, make him both relatable and compelling. The development of Tabatha and Callum's relationship feels organic and refreshing, steering clear of clichés even as it hits some familiar beats. Additionally, the evolving dynamics within Sorcerer Solomon's family—comprising his ex-wife, children, and current wife—infuse the narrative with depth and tension.",
            "The magic system is both unique and accessible, enhancing the story's depth. I particularly enjoyed glimpses of Tabatha's apprenticeship and wished for a deeper exploration of her learning process and the nuances of the magic. The world-building effectively blends modern elements with fantasy, sparking my curiosity about the potential for more books set in this universe, as there is clearly room for further exploration."

The engaging mystery draws comparisons to *Inheritance Games*, keeping me captivated throughout.

            "The mystery was decent but could have been executed more effectively. Opening with Sorcerer Solomon prophesying his death to Tabatha diminished the intrigue; a gradual reveal would have enhanced the mystery’s appeal. While the pacing started off well, the book ultimately felt too short, leading to a rushed ending. More development could have added depth and made the conclusion more satisfying.",

Although her role as an apprentice and her adherence to rules justified some limitations, it ultimately felt insufficient. The introduction of magic was delayed, with much of the explanation unfolding halfway through the book. Beginning with Tabatha learning magic firsthand would have strengthened the narrative and made the ending more satisfying."

While her role as an apprentice and rule-abiding nature explained some of this, it still felt lacking.  \n   - The introduction of magic felt delayed, with much of it being explained halfway through the book. I think starting with Tabatha learning magic firsthand would have made the ending more satisfying.  \n\n- **Mystery Plot:**  \n   - The mystery was decent, but it could have been executed better.  \n   - Opening the book with Sorcerer Solomon prophesizing his death to Tabatha took away some of the intrigue. A slower reveal might have made the mystery more compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I mostly enjoyed the book, largely due to the engaging first-person narration and Tabatha’s distinct voice. However, the story felt underdeveloped in terms of pacing, magic utilization, and the mystery plot. With more padding and a stronger focus on world-building, it could have been a more satisfying read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This is a classic murder mystery featuring a wealthy, magical family, and it's packed with twists and turns. The pacing is brisk, keeping the story engaging from start to finish. My only complaint is that I would have liked a bit more action and danger; while the few action scenes were well-executed, I wished for additional moments of intensity.",
            "I really enjoyed the cast of characters, each with compelling reasons to be suspects. The only character I had a negative opinion about was Felix; I found him off-putting—perhaps because I anticipated a love triangle. The story primarily focuses on Tabatha, who reminded me of Pip from *A Good Girl's Guide to Murder*, but with a magical twist, and Callum, who felt similar to Ravi from the same book. Their relationship was well-developed, especially considering the story unfolds over the course of a week, and YA typically isn't known for being particularly spicy. I also found myself surprisingly enjoying the training scene.",

            "The pacing of the story is acceptable, but the magical action is surprisingly sparse for a book focused on sorcery. This lack of gripping scenes hampers engagement, and the twists and turns fail to sustain interest. The ending is predictable, with both the murderer and motive becoming apparent midway through. Although the final twist has a hint of magic, it ultimately does not redeem the ending, leaving it feeling anticlimactic and disappointing.",
            "The characters, especially the protagonist Tabatha Zeng, are tedious and tiresome. Her incessant whining renders it hard to feel any sympathy for her. Moreover, her harsh criticisms of the Solomon family as spoiled and entitled white wealthy individuals come across as hypocritical, considering her own privileged background—her mother is a lawyer, her father an engineer, and she attends the same elite school as Callum Solomon.",

        "conclusion": "While These Deadly Prophecies has an intriguing premise, it falls short in execution. The unlikable protagonist, lack of engaging magical action, predictable plot, and anticlimactic ending make it a mediocre read.

The lack of a thorough explanation regarding the mechanics of magic and its underlying philosophy weakens the story. Additionally, the world-building feels incomplete; there’s insufficient exploration of the interactions between the magical and non-magical realms.

While the characters, particularly Tabatha and Callum, are engaging, the pacing, underwhelming \"whydunnit,\" and unresolved plotlines detract from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- The review implies a lower rating due to the unsatisfying ending and unresolved questions, though no specific numerical score is provided."

Her internal struggle with parental pressure created potential tension, but it felt underdeveloped due to a lack of substantial dialogue with her family.",

It follows an apprentice of a powerful sorceress who is drawn into the investigation of her mentor's mysterious death, revealing layers of deception.

I expected at least a few pages dedicated to showcasing how formidable the sorceress was, but this aspect was neglected.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot had redeeming qualities, particularly the mystery element, as I didn’t truly know who did what until the very end.  \n   - However, some plot holes were too big, and certain end results felt predictable, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Themes:**  \n   - The theme of parental pressure and immigrant struggles was compelling but underutilized. More dialogue and interaction with the family could have added emotional depth and resonance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise and mystery elements of the story were strong, the execution fell short in several areas.

I particularly appreciated her portrayal of the main character, Tabitha Zeng, a young woman whose primary interest is learning from the famous fortuneteller Sorcerer Solomon.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The story revolves around Solomon's murder, with Tabitha becoming one of the suspects. Most of Solomon's family members have good reason to dislike her, except for his son, Callum. The plot is intriguing, and the ending is nicely wrapped up.  \n\n- **Narrative Voice:**  \n  The story is told through Tabitha's voice, which perfectly captures her personality—young, fun, somewhat too trusting, and rather clueless. Her lack of friends and inexperience with males is evident, especially when she ends up working with Callum to solve the murder.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The setting is fascinating, with details about the magical world Tabitha inhabits, which contrasts with the reality of others in the area. The inclusion of a detective tasked with uncovering those who misuse magical abilities adds depth to the world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *These Deadly Prophecies* by Andrea Tang is an enjoyable read with strong character development, an engaging plot, and a well-crafted magical setting.

            "The story maintains a steady pace, but the simplicity of the mystery made the identity of the murderer easy to predict. This predictability diminished the suspense and intrigue that could have enhanced the narrative. Following Tabatha, a sorcerer’s apprentice, as she investigates her boss Solomon's murder and seeks to prove her own innocence, the plot presents an imaginative blend of magical elements and societal themes reflective of our own. While the concept is engaging, the predictable resolution of the murder mystery lessened the impact of the who-done-it aspect.",

As she embarks on her journey to uncover the truth, her evolving feelings for Callum, Solomon's quiet and reserved youngest son, add complexity to her character. While their interactions are compelling, the potential for deeper exploration of their dynamic remains untapped.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  The story follows Tabatha, a sorcerer’s apprentice, as she tries to solve the murder of her boss, Solomon, and prove her own innocence. The plot is imaginative, blending a magical world with societal elements similar to our own. While the concept is engaging, the resolution of the murder mystery was somewhat predictable, which lessened the impact of the \"who-done-it\" aspect.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Tabatha is a 17-year-old protagonist who defies societal norms by choosing to be an apprentice rather than following her mother into law. She evolves throughout the story, balancing her quest to uncover the truth with her growing feelings for Callum, Solomon’s youngest son. Callum, though popular, is quiet and reserved, adding depth to his character. The interactions between Tabatha and Callum are compelling, though their dynamic could have been explored further.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world is rich with magic and mirrors aspects of our own society, but it feels underdeveloped. While the story is character-driven, the setting and magical elements could have been more fleshed out to enhance the immersive experience.  \n\n- **Pacing and Predictability:**  \n  The story maintains a steady pace, but the lack of complexity in the mystery made it easy to predict the murderer. This predictability detracted from the suspense and intrigue that could have elevated the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is an enjoyable read, particularly for fans of character-driven mysteries with a magical twist. While the world-building and predictability of the plot could have been stronger, the imaginative concept and well-developed characters make it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

More depth in this area would have been appreciated. \n\nThe story reminded me of *Knives Out*, but with a magical twist.

The dysfunctional Solomon family and their dynamics make for a compelling read, and the constant surprises kept me hooked until the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I was hoping for more details about the magical system and the society.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The characters had potential, but their development felt shallow.

The premise, blending *Inheritance Games* and *Knives Out* vibes with magic, was intriguing and drew me in immediately.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  My biggest complaint is the pacing, particularly in the middle 100 pages, which felt repetitive with the same sequence of \"who did it,\" \"did you do it,\" and \"did that person do it\" over and over again. The story only truly picks up around the 85% mark, making the middle section feel like a slog.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending was anti-climactic and left many major questions unanswered, which was disappointing after the buildup.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was a good, fun read overall. However, I wouldn’t read it again due to the pacing issues and unresolved ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise was engaging and the story had its moments, the repetitive middle section and unsatisfying ending detracted from the overall experience. It was an enjoyable read but not one I’d revisit.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

The engaging plot, relatable characters, and immersive world-building made it a standout read. I highly recommend it to fans of mystery, fantasy, and YA literature. While it’s a standalone, I found myself wishing for more time with these characters.

However, this book was nothing like either of those, except for the family dynamics.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was incredibly slow, to the point where I stopped reading and ultimately skipped the last 45 pages.  \n\n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n  The plot was insanely predictable, which made it difficult to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character became very predictable, which further diminished my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The book was boring and didn’t hold my interest. The focus on family dynamics wasn’t enough to save the lackluster story and content.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell short of my expectations. While it had some elements of family dynamics, the slow pacing, predictable plot, and unengaging characters made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I feel it could have been stronger if it had been written with older characters and targeted at a more mature audience.  \n\n- **Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the slow start, the story turned out to be a super fun \"who-did-it\" mystery that kept me hooked toward the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a slow beginning, it ultimately delivered an exciting and fast-paced mystery in its final act. It’s a solid YA read, though it might have resonated more with an older audience if the characters and tone had been adjusted accordingly.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 ✨"

From the start, I found myself captivated by the characters' motivations, as what seems innocent can often hide deeper surprises. With my extensive experience in murder mysteries, I developed a theory about the culprit that shifted multiple times throughout the narrative. Up until the last two chapters, I was thoroughly engaged—exactly what a good murder mystery should achieve. You may form guesses, but the true motivation remains elusive, keeping you on your toes.",
            "In addition to its murder, mystery, and magic, the story offers a poignant exploration of family dynamics. The differing impacts of their father's sorcery prestige on the Solomon children, as well as on his past and current wives, are heartbreakingly portrayed. The desire to win their father's approval leaves them feeling inadequate and fosters an unspoken competition among them. In contrast, it’s heartwarming to see Tabatha's mother support her choices—an admirable departure from Julian Solomon's approach.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Length and Pace:**  \n  - The book is relatively short, at around 250 pages, making it a quick read. Despite its brevity, it remains enjoyable and engaging.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The world-building is well-executed, with a magical realism approach that I particularly enjoyed. Magic is seamlessly integrated into the world as something that can be studied or apprenticed in, which adds depth to the setting.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Tabatha is a likable protagonist, though she may be unreliable, which adds an interesting layer to her character.  \n  - Callum, the son of the deceased, is a compelling character, and his dynamic with Tabatha is enjoyable.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  - The central mystery—the murder of Tabatha’s prophetic boss—is intriguing and well-developed. The array of potential suspects, most of whom are related to the victim, keeps the reader guessing.  \n  - The plot maintains its momentum and resolves the mystery in a satisfying way by the end.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The romance between Callum and Tabatha is light but effective, adding a pleasant layer to the story without overwhelming the main plot.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite initial concerns about the short length affecting the plot and character development, both aspects were solid and well-executed.  \n  - The book is a quick, fun read that I thoroughly enjoyed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful blend of magical realism, mystery, and light romance. Its concise length makes it a quick read, but the strong world-building, engaging characters, and well-crafted plot ensure it remains a satisfying and enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book took a while to reach a significant turning point, with little magic in the early chapters. Once the plot gained momentum, it became fast-paced and enjoyable, leaving me wishing the entire book had maintained that energy. The prophecy regarding Sorcerer Solomon’s downfall was also perplexing. The focus on who loved him the most was misleading; it actually referred to the Professor's most beloved, implying that person could have even hated him. This logic felt unclear, and I may have misunderstood it.",
            "The story introduces both main characters as potential murder suspects, but this angle lacks depth. The pressure from the police to prove their innocence is minimal, with law enforcement appearing only three times throughout the narrative.",
            "The sentence structure was frequently repetitive, particularly with the overuse of the phrase \"Well,...\". Additionally, some sentences felt awkward or overly lengthy, disrupting the narrative's flow."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the book was just okay. While it had moments of fast-paced fun, the slow start, repetitive writing, and underdeveloped plot elements made it less engaging than it could have been. The lack of exploration into the murder suspect angle and the confusing prophecy logic were notable drawbacks.",
