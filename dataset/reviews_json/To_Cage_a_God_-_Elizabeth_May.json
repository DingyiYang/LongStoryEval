It lacks distinctive plot and character development, ultimately failing to leave a lasting impression.",

It recycles familiar tropes, such as powerful nobles wielding magic, an evil empress, a hidden princess from a displaced dynasty, a traumatized warrior with a disability (who happens to be a lesbian for modern appeal), and a noble terrorist with a justifiable cause. The predictable happy ending, marked by a marriage proposal between the two main female characters, reinforces the overall lack of originality."

            "The story is fast-paced and delightfully funny, featuring a diverse range of perspectives. While some may find the frequent viewpoint shifts frustrating, I appreciated how they enriched the narrative and revealed each character's motivations. At times, though, it felt like a rather convenient narrative device.",
            "The sisterly bond between Sera and Galina is profoundly moving. Sera's protective nature contrasts sharply with Galina's brokenness and fear, yet it's clear that Galina holds the most potential. Katya's perspective adds a nail-biting layer as she maneuvers through her precarious position in the palace, relying on her wits for survival. \n\nThe romance is a standout element; Sera's tumultuous past with a dangerous fugitive assassin injects tension, while Galina‚Äôs delicate connection with the sheltered Princess is both tender and endearing. The characters, though morally complex, are undeniably relatable, and their relationships enhance rather than overshadow the plot. The romance satisfies romantasy fans with its sharp banter, heartfelt declarations, and intense passion. However, some ill-timed sexual scenes detract from the story, feeling misaligned with moments of high tension and danger.",

The sisters navigate a perilous environment where war is an ever-present threat. The palace, steeped in fear and uncertainty, poses particular challenges for Katya, who is at the mercy of the Empress's whims. The richly detailed world brims with court intrigue, forbidden love, raging gods, and explosive magic, creating a captivating backdrop for their struggle.",

The sisters live in this oppressive environment, where the stakes are high, and the threat of war looms constantly. The palace is a place of fear and fickle attitudes, especially for Katya, who exists at the whims of the Empress. The world is richly detailed, filled with court intrigue, forbidden love, raging gods, and explosive magic.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The sisterly bond between Sera and Galina is deeply touching. Sera is protective and defensive, while Galina appears broken and afraid, yet she holds the most potential.

This reliance on tropes over substance left me disengaged.\n\n- **Worldbuilding and Plot:**  \n  The worldbuilding is a thinly veiled retelling of the Russian Revolution, stripped of its political depth and meaning. The fantasy elements and magic system are underdeveloped and riddled with inconsistencies, such as the unclear origins of the nobility‚Äôs sigil-based powers and the lack of checks and balances for the gods‚Äô powers.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting.

Neither relationship was compelling or emotionally resonant.\n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  The book‚Äôs anti-violent revolution stance is jarring, especially given its Russian Revolution-inspired setting. It attempts to romanticize a violent revolutionary character while simultaneously condemning violent revolution, creating a confusing and hypocritical narrative.\n\n- **Representation of Mental Illness:**  \n  The portrayal of the lesbian protagonist‚Äôs intrusive thoughts starts with a creative device (using brackets) but quickly becomes heavy-handed and inconsistent. The thoughts disappear entirely after she meets her love interest, implying that love can ‚Äúcure‚Äù mental illness, which is problematic.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book failed to engage me on multiple levels, from its contrived writing style and reliance on tropes to its underdeveloped worldbuilding, flat characters, and unfulfilling romances. The inconsistent messaging around violent revolution and the mishandling of mental illness representation further detracted from the story.

            "The book's opening strikes a peculiar balance between slow and rushed.

            "In this captivating tale, foster sisters Sera and Galina embark on a quest to save their kingdom, and their dynamic is truly engaging. Initially, I hesitated about the romance, as I prefer to meet love interests early on. However, it ultimately exceeded my expectations. The chemistry, witty banter, and growth of their relationship added significant depth to the narrative. One love interest, in particular, stood out as a morally grey, slightly unhinged, yet utterly endearing character. His quirks and unwavering devotion made him memorable. The other romantic pairing offered a refreshing perspective, showcasing two individuals finding solace in each other, though I felt their relationship could have been explored more deeply. I look forward to seeing how it develops in the next book.",

            "The book is fast-paced yet failed to engage me, often leaving me bored to the point of wanting to stop reading. The plot is poorly constructed, riddled with plot holes and lacking cohesive direction. The sisters frequently plunged into situations without clear resolutions. The ending felt rushed, with swift resolutions that overlooked significant issues, such as the ongoing war and the defenseless state of their country.",
            "I found it difficult to connect with the characters due to their superficial backstories. Galina spends most of the book fixated on Princess Vasilisa instead of pursuing her mission to assassinate the queen. While Vasilisa's animosity toward her mother is understandable, it fails to justify her swift forgiveness of Galina's hidden motives. Sera and Vitaly‚Äôs relationship is riddled with miscommunication and lacks depth, with Vitaly coming off as one of the weakest protagonists I've encountered‚Äîhe seems to dislike everyone unless Sera intervenes. The romance between Galina and Vasilisa, intended to be a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers story, instead feels like a poorly executed insta-love, driven by lust rather than an authentic connection. Additionally, Sera and Vitaly's bond is weakly developed, reliant on fleeting flashbacks and monologues to explain their ties.",

After a perilous escape and a life on the run, they rejoin a rebellion aimed at overthrowing the tyrannical Empress Isidora. The story unfolds with a dark, fast-paced plot infused with court intrigue, war, and morally ambiguous characters.",

Content warnings include violence, chronic pain, ableism, war, death, child abuse, murder, self-harm, addiction, and implied suicide. While it won‚Äôt be for everyone, the tension and complexity of the story make it a gripping read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"To Cage A God\" is a dark, fast-paced fantasy with morally grey characters, a unique magic system, and an immersive world. The sisterhood between Sera and Galina, the forbidden romance between Galina and Vasilisa, and the passionate yet destructive relationship between Sera and Vitaly are standout elements.

The bond of sisterhood and trust between Galina and Sera is captivating as they navigate the harsh realities imposed by the Empire's ruling classes and their mother, a rebel leader intent on exploiting them. The second-chance romance between Sera and her estranged husband, Vitaly, is a highlight, featuring a slow-burn intensity and compelling enemies-to-lovers dynamics.

However, I wished for more exploration into the lore surrounding each dragon-esque god.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The deeply emotional, character-driven narrative was a standout.

Instead, the narrative centers heavily on the romantic dynamics between Sera and her love interest, sidelining the city, its inhabitants, and the broader conflict.",

However, when Sera introduces a new plan, Galina begins to reclaim her strength, showcasing her resilience beneath her troubled exterior. I appreciated the authentic sisterly bond between Galina and Sera; though not biological sisters, their shared history of being adopted and hosting gods created a relationship filled with mutual support and no animosity.",
            "The worldbuilding in this story was a challenge for me. The idea of royals being infused with gods to gain their ruling power is intriguing but ultimately underdeveloped. There‚Äôs a lack of detail regarding the history, the gods' names, and their interactions, making them feel almost irrelevant to the characters, who could have simply possessed their own powers. Even if these elements are to be explored in future installments, more groundwork was necessary to engage readers. The novel is set in a Russian-inspired world, where two sisters, Galina and Sera, have been hiding with gods within them. When the emperor is assassinated by the very rebellion they once supported, the sisters emerge from the shadows with their own plan to overthrow the empire.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author and Expectations:**  \n  I was drawn to read this book because of the author, Elizabeth May. I have known about her for a while but have not read many of her books. I read the *Seven Devils* duology she co-wrote and one under her Kendrick penname, but I wanted to explore more of her work. Unfortunately, *To Cage a God* didn‚Äôt quite live up to my expectations.\n\n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n  The novel is set in a Russian-inspired world where two sisters, Galina and Sera, have been hiding with gods inhabiting their bodies. When the emperor is assassinated by the rebellion they were once part of, they step out of the shadows with their own plan to overthrow the empire.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  I warmed up to both Galina and Sera, especially Galina, who starts off rough‚Äîwe meet her nursing a hangover from an alcohol binge. However, when Sera presents a new plan, Galina begins to stand up again, revealing her inner strength despite her damaged exterior. I appreciated the genuine sisterly bond between Galina and Sera, who are not biological sisters but were adopted and used to host gods. Their relationship felt authentic, with no animosity, just mutual support.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding was a struggle for me. The concept of royals being born with gods inside them, which grants them ruling power, is intriguing but underdeveloped. There‚Äôs a lack of detail about the history, the gods‚Äô names, and their interactions. The gods felt almost irrelevant, as the characters could have just had their own powers. Even if this is meant to be explored in future books, more groundwork was needed here to hook the reader.\n\n- **Plot and Rebellion:**  \n  The rebellion against the oppressive royals made sense, but the execution felt limited. The story lacked enough characters to make the rebellion and the city feel alive. The focus remained largely on the romantic interactions between Sera and her love interest, leaving the city, its people, and the rebellion underdeveloped.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, *To Cage a God* was mostly entertaining, especially if you enjoy romance. However, the plot felt wrapped up, and I don‚Äôt feel compelled to pick up the next book. It didn‚Äôt leave me curious about what happens next.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*To Cage a God* is an entertaining read with strong character dynamics and an intriguing premise, but it falls short in worldbuilding and plot execution. While I enjoyed the romance and the sisters‚Äô relationship, the underdeveloped elements left me uninterested in continuing the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The Russian-inspired setting, infused with references to historical revolutionary behavior, enhances the depth of the worldbuilding.",
            "This story features two well-developed romantic arcs: one between Sera and Vitaly, embodying a second-chance, enemies-to-lovers dynamic, and another between Galina and Vasilisa, showcasing a sapphic, enemies-to-lovers relationship. Vitaly, a morally gray character, candidly admits that his only principle is his love for Sera, adding depth to his persona. Both romances enhance character growth and plot advancement, feeling equally significant to the narrative. The protagonists are refreshingly older‚ÄîSera is 30, Vitaly is 32, and Galina is 28‚Äîbringing realism and depth to their involvement in the revolution. Notably, Sera and Galina are not ‚Äúchosen ones,‚Äù but rather individuals thrust into their roles by the zmei (dragon gods) contained within them.",

The first half felt uneventful, with little action in the first 200 pages, making it difficult to stay engaged. Although the latter half picked up and I read through it quickly, the sluggish beginning remained a significant drawback.",
            "The characters in this story are compelling, each grappling with trauma while striving to dismantle an oppressive regime. Galina and Sera's struggles with their haunting pasts are intriguing, and the princess‚Äôs storyline offers meaningful disability representation. Although Vitaly brings swagger and an unhinged obsession with Sera, his character feels somewhat one-dimensional. Katya‚Äôs perspective is the most captivating, as her enslavement to the empress and their toxic relationship are deeply engaging. The empress herself is a despicable villain; her hunger for power, while understandable, leads to horrifying actions. The sapphic romance is entertaining but feels rushed, quickly escalating to deep emotions that contrast with the book's otherwise slow pace. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the characters involved, so it didn't detract too much from my experience. The antagonistic dynamic between Sera and Vitaly is entertaining, yet I craved more depth, given their complicated history.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing:**  \n  - The slow pace and generally dull vibes kept the book from being a new favorite for me.  \n  - The first half felt uneventful, with almost nothing happening in the first 200 pages, which made it hard to stay engaged.  \n  - The latter half picked up, and I read most of it quickly, but the slow beginning was a drawback.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  - I enjoyed the Russian-inspired setting and found the magic system interesting, especially the concept of caging a dragon in one‚Äôs body to gain powers.  \n  - However, I wish the author had gone deeper into the world-building. The story felt insular despite its empire-wide ramifications, and I wanted to see more of the people‚Äôs strife and the operations of the Faithless.  \n\n- **Characters and POVs:**  \n  - The characters were compelling, each dealing with trauma while working to subvert an oppressive regime.  \n  - Galina and Sera‚Äôs struggles with their horrifying pasts were intriguing, and the princess‚Äôs storyline provided great disability representation.  \n  - Vitaly added swagger and was unhinged in his obsession with Sera, but his character felt one-note.  \n  - Katya‚Äôs POV was the most riveting, as her enslavement to the empress and their toxic relationship were deeply compelling.  \n  - The empress was a despicable villain, and her lust for power, while understandable, made her actions horrifying.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The sapphic romance was entertaining but felt rushed, moving quickly into deep feelings, which was ironic given the book‚Äôs overall slow pace.  \n  - I liked the characters involved, so I didn‚Äôt mind too much.  \n  - The dynamic between Sera and Vitaly was entertaining due to its antagonistic nature, but I wished for more depth, considering their history.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  - The book focused on court intrigue, romance, and themes of revolution, which I appreciated.  \n  - The tone was consistent, but the slow pace and shallow world-building kept it from being a great read for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *To Cage a God* was a good read with an interesting setting, compelling characters, and unique magic system. However, the slow pacing and lack of depth in world-building prevented it from being a great experience. If you enjoy slower stories with court intrigue, romance, and revolutionary themes, this might be a good choice for you.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 out of 5 stars."

            "The pacing of the story starts off slow, stabilizes in the middle, and then rushes toward the end. Some sex scenes feel forced or poorly timed, which detracts from the overall narrative. The book ultimately falls short of its potential. From the beginning, it feels as though you‚Äôre dropped into the middle of the plot, making it challenging to grasp the characters, storyline, and setting. While this approach is not uncommon in fantasy, it hinders emotional connection, leaving me unmotivated to return to the book between readings.",
            "The characters in the story are compelling, particularly Sera, Galina, and Vasilisa, whose backstories I found captivating. However, I wish Katya and Vatalik had received similar attention. Vatalik, especially, felt underdeveloped as a POV character; his portrayal came off as a caricature of a morally grey male love interest rather than a fully fleshed-out individual. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the banter between Sera and Vatalik. I also appreciated the representation of sapphic relationships and the thoughtful depiction of chronic illness and pain, with the representation of physical disability being particularly well-executed. This character was arguably my favorite in the story.",
            "The world-building and magic system were captivating yet lacked depth. I appreciated how godmagic could take on various forms, such as elemental and healing magic. It would have been intriguing to delve into the interactions between these magical types and the different species of dragons.",
            "The premise is captivating: a dark, Slavic-inspired sapphic fantasy where dragons can be caged within humans to bestow godlike powers. This power is monopolized by the nobility, who wield it to oppress the masses‚Äîexcept for two sisters, who are unwillingly infused with divine essence to become pivotal figures in the resistance. One sister operates undercover within the palace, while the other fights from the outside."

        "conclusion": "While the book had immense potential and several strong elements‚Äîsuch as its premise, representation, and certain character dynamics‚Äîit fell short in execution, pacing, and character development.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The premise is excellent: a dark, Slavic-inspired sapphic fantasy where dragons can be caged inside humans to grant them godpower. This power is reserved for nobility, who use it to oppress others, except for two sisters who were forcibly instilled with the gods to serve as the turning point of the resistance. One sister resists undercover from inside the palace, while the other continues the work outside.  \n\n- **Execution and Engagement:**  \n  The book didn‚Äôt fully live up to its potential. From the onset, it feels like you‚Äôre dropped into the middle of the story, leaving you to figure out the characters, plot, and setting. While this isn‚Äôt uncommon in fantasy novels, it made it difficult to feel connected to the story and characters. I didn‚Äôt feel the pull to return to the book between readings due to this lack of connection.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were interesting, and I loved the insight into Sera, Galina, and Vasilisa‚Äôs pasts. However, I wish the same level of attention had been given to Katya and Vatalik. Vatalik, in particular, didn‚Äôt need to be a POV character, as there wasn‚Äôt enough time to flesh him out, making him feel like a caricature of a morally grey male love interest rather than a fully developed and integral part of the story. That said, I did enjoy the banter between Sera and Vatalik.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The world-building and magic system were intriguing but underdeveloped. I loved how the godmagic could manifest as different types of magic (elemental, healing, etc.), and it would have been fascinating to explore the interplay between these types of magic and the different types of dragons.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  I appreciated the sapphic representation and the thoughtful portrayal of chronic illness/pain. The physical disability representation was particularly well done, and this character was perhaps my favorite overall.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was slow to start, leveled out in the middle, and then felt rushed toward the end. Some of the sex scenes felt forced or inappropriately timed, which pulled me out of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had immense potential and several strong elements‚Äîsuch as its premise, representation, and certain character dynamics‚Äîit fell short in execution, pacing, and character development. I‚Äôm undecided about continuing with the series, but if it builds on the strengths of this book, I would strongly consider it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and DAW Books for the opportunity to read *To Cage a God* as an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review."

            "I enjoyed the first half of the book, but found the second half disappointing and reliant on clich√©s. I struggled to finish it and likely won‚Äôt continue with the series.",
            "The story centers on two sisters, daughters of a deceased human rebel leader, each harboring a god within them. After their mother‚Äôs death four years ago, they distanced themselves from the rebellion but are now compelled to return. The sisters' bond is the emotional core of the narrative, and I appreciated that both characters are equally strong and significant. One sister is a multifaceted alchemist, healer, assassin, and strategist, while the other possesses formidable powers from the dragon within her and serves as a spy in the royal palace.\n\nThe book employs multiple perspectives, with the sisters as the focal points. Each sister navigates her own love story: one features a second-chance F/M romance between childhood friends who married, separated after a tragedy, and reunite on opposing sides of a war. The other explores an F/F romance between two women, both burdened by personal struggles like PTSD and chronic illness, who also possess powerful dragons and find themselves on different sides of the conflict. The narrative is rich with banter and sexual tension, though it avoids explicit scenes.",
            "The book unfolds in a Slavic and Russian-inspired world, featuring names and language deeply rooted in this culture, complete with a glossary. Set against the backdrop of a wintry northern Russia, it references various Slavic locations; however, I found the absence of a map a drawback for visualizing these places. As a Caucasian reader, keeping track of the fictional geography proved challenging. It's worth noting that the author is not BIPOC, which may influence the authenticity of the cultural representation. The heavy use of Slavic names and pet names can feel overwhelming at times. The story presents a society divided between ordinary humans and Alureans, who possess a god or dragon within them, bestowing them with special abilities. This class divide, with Alureans as the nobility and magic-less humans in a state of powerlessness and poverty, is a central theme that shapes the narrative."

However, the second half falters with predictable plot points and clich√©s, making it a struggle to finish. While the characters and relationships are well-developed, the pacing issues and lack of originality in the latter half left me disengaged.",

I‚Äôd never heard of the author before, so it wasn‚Äôt on my radar.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The book is set in a Slavic and Russian-inspired world, with names and language heavily influenced by this culture. There‚Äôs even a language glossary included. The setting is a wintry northern Russia, and many places with Slavic names are mentioned. However, I missed having a map to help visualize and differentiate these locations. As a Caucasian reader, it was sometimes challenging to keep track of the places, especially since it‚Äôs a fictional world where the geography isn‚Äôt immediately clear. It‚Äôs worth noting that the author is not BIPOC, so the cultural influence isn‚Äôt drawn from personal experience. The frequent use of Slavic names and pet names felt a bit overwhelming at times.\n\n- **Society and Magic System:**  \n  The society is divided into normal humans and Alureans, who have a god (or dragon) caged inside them, granting them special abilities. Alureans are the nobility, while magic-less humans are powerless and poor. This dynamic creates a clear class divide that shapes the story.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The story follows two sisters, daughters of the late human rebel leader, who both have a god caged inside them. After their mother‚Äôs death four years ago, they fled the rebellion but are now forced to reappear. The bond between the sisters is the heart of the story, and I appreciated that both were equally important and strong. One sister is an alchemist, healer, assassin, fighter, and mastermind, while the other has extremely strong powers due to the powerful dragon inside her and infiltrates the royal palace as a spy. The book features multiple POVs, with the sisters as the main characters. Both have their own love stories: one is a second-chance F/M romance between two people who met as children, grew up together, married, and separated after a tragic death, only to meet again four years later on opposing sides of a war. The other is an F/F romance between two individuals with powerful dragons inside them, both burdened by personal struggles (PTSD, chronic illness) and on different sides of the conflict.

            "The book relies on familiar tropes and clich√©s but offers a satisfying conclusion without a cliffhanger, making it suitable for standalone reading.",
            "The lesbian romance was engaging, but I found the hetero romance lacking. I‚Äôm not a fan of jerks, particularly when one attempts to harm the protagonist's sister multiple times without any remorse, despite her efforts to protect him. The sexual tension didn‚Äôt resonate with me, and the story doesn‚Äôt truly fit the enemies-to-lovers trope, as Sera and Vitalik never really engage as enemies; the lack of communication between them is the real issue. At around 80%, when Sera learns her friend is being tortured, she chooses to be intimate with her husband instead of devising a plan to rescue her friend. This decision felt baffling and frustrating.",
            "In this story, dragons are portrayed as gods, yet I find myself puzzled by how certain Alureans are born with these divine beings within them. What criteria determine their selection, and what types of gods are present? The magic system also lacks clarity; while some magic can heal broken bones, it fails to address illnesses. Additionally, I'm unclear about the motivations behind the desire for war among other countries‚Äîare they seeking more land, or is there something I overlooked?",
            "I received both an audio ARC and an e-ARC through NetGalley, and all opinions are my own. This book is particularly well-suited for dual reading with the audiobook, especially due to the numerous foreign words and names. The audiobook was invaluable; I'm not sure I would have completed the book without it. I have many questions, but I can't help but wonder if I missed some details during my reading, which is something I often do."

If you‚Äôre a reader who values detailed worldbuilding, particularly in terms of society, politics, and history, this book might not meet your expectations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book is best suited for readers who are deeply invested in character relationships and don‚Äôt require extensive worldbuilding. While I appreciated the strong female friendships and the romance, the lack of political and societal depth made it less satisfying for me as a fantasy reader.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75 Stars"

It took me a minute to get used to the name variations and language, but it honestly made for such a fun experience. The book was also incredibly quotable, and I wanted to write down everything as a quote for my review.  \n\n- **Quotes:**  \n  Some standout quotes include:  \n  - ‚ÄúMy morality begins and ends with you.‚Äù  \n  - ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather spend an eternity hoping we cross paths again than resign myself to a single moment without you. I‚Äôll always belong to you, until my last breath. In this life and the next.‚Äù  \n  - ‚ÄúYou can wrap me in silks and rest your head on my shoulder. But you can‚Äôt erase the memory of everything you‚Äôve done. A silk dress doesn‚Äôt lessen the weight of your foot on my spine.‚Äù  \n  - ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise you a future with me, but I can offer you this breath. And the next. And all those that follow, for as long as you take them.‚Äù  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  My only complaint is that the climax of the story didn‚Äôt last very long‚Äîit was only about two pages.

The portrayal of chronic illness and disability is also commendable. The male/female couple presents a compelling dynamic that is highly enjoyable.

Once I got the hang of the plot and world-building, it became more digestible.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Development:**  \n  I really liked what the relationship between Vitaly and Sera could have been, but it felt too muddled, and their morals quickly fell away. I feel like they never upheld the morals each of them built separately.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure (POVs):**  \n  The story jumps between five different characters‚Äô POVs, which was a bit too much for my liking. I was often disappointed when the narrative switched to a character I didn‚Äôt care as much for (like Katya).  \n\n- **Concept and World-Building:**  \n  The concept behind the story was great‚ÄîI quickly fell into the idea of gods being caged within people and the immense power they would hold. I could easily see how this could lead to these individuals developing god complexes and believing they‚Äôre better than others.  \n\n- **Execution of the Concept:**  \n  However, I feel like the author could have executed this concept better. Almost all of the world-building was ‚Äúshow, no tell,‚Äù which made it really hard to fully immerse myself in the plotline.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a compelling concept and moments of intrigue, its dense beginning, muddled character relationships, excessive POV shifts, and lack of clear world-building made it difficult to fully engage with the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I loved all the pairings, the banter, and the friendships!  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  - Something I truly enjoyed is how the ending had some finality to it. I might read any other books in this series, but I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs not a cliffhanger!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and engaging read with a unique premise and strong romantic elements. While the pacing and world-building had some uneven moments, the characters and relationships truly shone, and the satisfying ending left me content.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "The story begins abruptly, leaving much of the intriguing backstory‚Äîsuch as the mother's capture of the dragon gods‚Äîunexplored. The plot is confusing, caught between a lack of forward momentum and excessive details that fail to enhance the narrative. Action sequences are chaotic, making it challenging to follow the progression of events and often necessitating backtracking to grasp transitions.",
            "The main characters, Sera and Galina, felt underdeveloped, and their plot-driving plan was confusing and difficult to follow. The use of multiple perspectives did not add depth to the characters, making this narrative choice feel unjustified. Key figures, like the mother and the empress, were marginalized, leaving their potential untapped. While the book could have been a romantasy, it fails to fully embrace either romance or fantasy. The romance comes across as superficial, lacking emotional depth, while the fantasy elements are both confusing and underdeveloped.",
            "The Russian-inspired fantasy land is imaginative, populated by vibrant characters. The concept of the Alurea, a ruling class with dragon gods bound to their bodies, adds a captivating depth to the world. The incorporation of Russian language, names, and nicknames is both fascinating and skillfully executed. However, the world-building feels incomplete, leaving some aspects of the setting underdeveloped. The idea of dual souls‚Äîdragon and human‚Äîcreates a unique and compelling inner conflict, which is effectively portrayed. Nonetheless, the lack of clarity regarding the binding process, whether spiritual or physical, presents a missed opportunity and introduces some confusion."

Katya, who remains romantically independent, offers intriguing insights into the ruthless Empress, especially when contrasted with Princess Vasilisa‚Äôs memories of her mother. My favorite character is Vitaly, the leader of the faithless movement against the alurea. His unwavering determination and moral complexity, particularly in his interactions with Sera, make him both compelling and attractive. I also have a soft spot for Sera‚Äôs curmudgeonly dragon, who adds a unique charm to the story.

The origin story detailing how these dragons were summoned from another dimension and bound to humans through a complex process enriches the lore significantly. While the alurea, the noble class descended from the first bonded mortals, are thought to be the exclusive possessors of these gods, the revelation that commoners like Galina and Sera are also bonded introduces an intriguing layer of potential rebellion. The Imperial Russia-inspired setting further enhances the worldbuilding. The magic system is particularly compelling, especially the implications of having gods residing within mortals, as seen in characters like Sera and Vasilisa, whose struggles and abilities are intricately tied to their bonded dragons. The dynamic between these characters and their dragons adds considerable depth to the narrative."

It also employs multiple points of view (POVs) to tell its story.  \n  - \"Recommended if you like: fantasy, magic, Russian Revolution, disability rep, multiple POVs.\"  \n  - \"This is Russian inspired and I loved that May included the multitude of nicknames that are common in Slavic languages!\"  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world is richly detailed, with a clear divide between the nobility (alureas) and commoners (supplicants). The alureas possess gods (dragons) caged within their bodies, while supplicants are denied this power. The stark contrast between the opulence of the alureas and the poverty of the supplicants sets the stage for revolution.  \n  - \"I was fascinated with the world. The nobility are called alurea and are the ones who have gods (dragons) caged in their bodies.\"  \n  - \"The alureas live in opulent palaces and have gorgeous silk gowns while the supplicants live in tenements that threaten to collapse with them inside.\"  \n  - \"This, of course, makes great breeding ground for revolution, with the rebels being called 'faithless.'\"  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is a mix of action, magic, and political maneuvering, with a fast-paced narrative that keeps readers engaged. However, the lack of a map made it challenging to visualize the geography of the world.  \n  - \"There's a good mix of action, magic, and politicking going on throughout the book and I flew through this book.\"  \n  - \"I would've appreciated a map so I could better understand where everything was situated since I had kind of a hard time figuring it out on my own.\"  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are well-developed and intriguing, each with their own motivations and arcs.  \n  - **Sera:** The strategist of the revolution, combining book smarts and street smarts. She is resourceful and pragmatic, though her relationship with violence is complex.  \n    - \"Sera stays in the city gathering information and preparing elixirs to strengthen Galina's god for the final showdown.\"  \n    - \"I liked the combination of her being book smart and street smart.\"  \n  - **Galina:** A softer character who is healing from her traumatic past. She plays a key role in spying on the empress and connecting with the princess.  \n    - \"Galina is a little softer, though I think she deserves to be considering 1) she lost her family to the empress prior to being adopted by Sera's mom, and 2) definitely got the worse end of the deal with their mom's use of her god.\"  \n  - **Katya:** A compelling character seeking revenge against the empress for her sister's death. Her journey to break free from the empress' control is powerful.  \n    - \"Katya's journey toward being able to throw off the confines of the empress' control was powerful and satisfying.\"  \n  - **Vasilisa (Vasya):** The princess, who has a degenerative disease and uses her godpower to help supplicants. She is scientifically minded and challenges her mother's expectations.  \n    - \"Vasya has a degenerative disease and is simply refusing to harm her body anymore just to make her family look good.\"  \n  - **Vitaly:** Sera's love interest and the leader of the faithless. He is devoted to Sera but could benefit from more strategic thinking.  \n    - \"Vitaly does come across as the brooding bad boy type, but it's clear that he adores Sera and would cross any lines for her.\"  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book explores themes of class disparity, revolution, and the moral complexities of violence. The alureas' disregard for supplicants' lives highlights the deep-rooted inequality in the society.  \n  - \"They literally don't care if supplicants die due to their actions, it's not even something they consider pause worthy.\"  \n  - \"This book involves Galina healing from her past and recovering from everything that happened.\"  \n\n- **Potential for Future Books:**  \n  While the book could function as a standalone, it leaves room for further exploration in a sequel, particularly regarding the alureas' god-binding and the revolution's outcome.  \n  - \"I suspect book 2 will deal with this a little more.\"  \n  - \"I hope in book 2 we get to see her in action more since it seems like politically she's going to be very involved.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a captivating blend of fantasy, political intrigue, and social commentary, set in a richly imagined world. The characters are complex and engaging, and the story is both fast-paced and thought-provoking. While a map would have been helpful, the narrative is strong enough to stand on its own. It could be enjoyed as a standalone or as the start of a series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5 stars"

            "In this captivating story, the sisters are united by their shared experiences and deep love for one another, navigating the challenge of hosting gods from another realm within their bodies, transforming them into living weapons. The sapphic romance beautifully transcends typical boundaries, adding emotional depth to the narrative. Witty banter and the spirited gods inject humor and personality, enhancing the overall experience. The strong female main characters, who are unapologetically fierce, are a standout feature of the tale. I found myself enamored with all the characters‚Äîexcluding, of course, the Empress. Among them, the two sisters, a princess, a handmaiden spy, and a rebellious confectioner are particularly compelling.

Despite mixed reviews on Goodreads, the book drew me in completely, and there were nights when I couldn‚Äôt tear myself away. It‚Äôs the kind of story that captivates you and refuses to let go.\n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n  The story revolves around foster sisters Galina and Sera, who have powerful gods bound into their bodies by their ruthless mother. This sets them on a dangerous path to overthrow the tyrannical empress, Isidora. The world is inspired by Imperial Russia, with its exaggerated class divisions and historical parallels, such as the assassination of Tsar Alexander II. The blend of political intrigue and revolution is compelling, and the world is both beautiful and cruel.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are complex and well-developed. The sisters‚Äô romantic entanglements‚ÄîSera‚Äôs rekindled bond with her estranged husband, Vitaly, and Galina‚Äôs unexpected love for the princess, Vasilisa‚Äîare skillfully woven into the political plot. May‚Äôs background in romance writing shines through, as love and desire are portrayed as forces capable of driving social change.\n\n- **Handling of Disability:**  \n  Vasilisa‚Äôs disability is a natural extension of the world‚Äôs magical system, where binding gods into human bodies has consequences. Her chronic illness, reminiscent of inherited maladies in European royal families, adds depth and realism to the story. It‚Äôs a refreshing response to the misconception that magic in fantasy worlds precludes the existence of disabled characters.\n\n- **Villain Complexity:**  \n  My one critique is that the villains, particularly Isidora, lack nuance. While her god-bound power explains her ruthlessness, she comes across as almost cartoonishly evil, with no redeeming qualities. Given the complexity of other characters, it would have been satisfying to see some depth or sympathy in her motivations.\n\n- **Magic System and Consequences:**  \n  The magic system is intriguing, with tangible consequences. For example, Sera‚Äôs dragon/god requires her to give blood to wield its power. This adds a layer of realism and stakes to the story, making the magic feel more grounded and impactful.\n\n- **Standalone Potential and Sequel Setup:**  \n  The book tells a self-contained story while effectively setting up future conflicts. The defeat of Isidora is just the beginning, as other threats loom over the nation. I hope May continues this series, as I‚Äôd love to see how the characters build a more just world.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*To Cage a God* is a standout romantasy novel with a richly developed world, complex characters, and a compelling blend of romance and political intrigue. Despite its villain‚Äôs lack of depth, the story is engaging, thought-provoking, and sets the stage for future adventures.

The handmaiden's perspective is repetitive and fails to meaningfully contribute to the plot, while Vitaly‚Äôs viewpoint adds little, merely echoing his previous conversations with Sera. Princess Vasilisa's perspective offers some value by shedding light on her troubled relationship with her mother, but it ultimately feels underdeveloped. \n\nThe romance between Galina and Vasilisa feels rushed and unconvincing, relying on instalove rather than real development. Sera's second-chance romance with Vitaly shows promise, but Vitaly's POV chapters detract from it.

The U.K. cover is a statement, but not one I‚Äôd want staring at me from my shelves.  \n\n- **Premise and Setting:**  \n  - The promise of a Russian-inspired fantasy world with two sisters leading a rebel cause, combined with a dash of romance, immediately caught my interest and aligned with my personal preferences.  \n\n- **Character Perspectives (POVs):**  \n  - The book started strong with Sera and Galina‚Äôs distinct and enjoyable narrations. Galina, in particular, seemed like she‚Äôd be my favorite.  \n  - However, the introduction of three additional POV characters (totaling five) was overwhelming and unnecessary.  \n  - The handmaiden‚Äôs POV was repetitive, rehashing the same story beats without contributing meaningfully to the plot.  \n  - Vitaly‚Äôs POV added nothing new, as his thoughts merely echoed what he‚Äôd already expressed to Sera.  \n  - Princess Vasilisa‚Äôs POV was more worthwhile, providing insight into her troubled relationship with her mother, but even this felt underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The romance between Galina and Vasilisa felt rushed and unconvincing, relying on instalove rather than meaningful development.  \n  - Sera‚Äôs second-chance romance with Vitaly had potential, but his unnecessary POV chapters detracted from it.  \n\n- **Character Development and Action:**  \n  - Sera became my favorite character, driving most of the action and carrying the bulk of the story.  \n  - Galina‚Äôs storyline, initially promising, lost my interest due to the focus on her poorly developed romance.  \n\n- **World-Building and Fantasy Elements:**  \n  - The concept of gods being caged within people who harness their powers had a lot of potential.  \n  - However, the execution of these elements was inconsistent, with moments of strong writing overshadowed by disorganization.  \n\n- **Craft and Structure:**  \n  - The inclusion of too many POV characters, especially those without meaningful arcs, hurt the overall narrative.  \n  - The story would have been more successful if it had focused solely on Sera and Galina‚Äôs perspectives.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had the bones of a good story, with strong world-building and an engaging premise, but it was ultimately undermined by its structure and execution.

While Sera‚Äôs storyline was enjoyable, the overall experience was diminished by the book‚Äôs flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n7: I enjoyed one of the main characters a lot; unfortunately, she was one of five POVs, which drastically reduced my overall experience."

            "The story centers on sisters Sera and Galina, living weapons designed to topple a tyrannical empire. Rich in deception, court intrigue, and power struggles, the narrative also weaves in a compelling romance. While the plot is engaging and has the potential for greatness, it suffers from excessive filler scenes, haphazard events, and overly convenient situations.",
            "Sera and Galina, the protagonists, left me feeling lukewarm. While they were interesting and complex, they ultimately felt flat and detached, making it hard to connect with them. The portrayal of the sisters' bond was disappointing as well. Aside from Vitaly, the other characters, presented through third-person POVs, failed to leave a lasting impression. The book features two romances: a friends-to-enemies-to-lovers arc that captivated me, and a sapphic romance that, while intriguing, felt rushed. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy scenes.",
            "The writing is compelling, straightforward, and engaging, fully capturing my attention. The fast pace and short chapters made it hard to put the book down; I devoured it without experiencing any moments of boredom or heaviness.",
            "The world-building held great promise but ultimately felt underdeveloped. The setting, inspired by Imperial Russia, often came across as shallow and confusing, with crucial information presented haphazardly and then neglected. This was particularly disappointing, as the world-building was one of the aspects that initially captivated me. The idea of alurean humans containing caged gods within their bodies was intriguing and ripe with potential. However, I anticipated more interactions between the trapped gods and humans, which were largely absent, leaving me unsatisfied.",
            "I had high hopes for this book, given my admiration for the author's previous works and the intriguing premise. However, I was left disappointed; the story felt rushed and superficial, ultimately leaving me feeling lukewarm."

This representation is commendable and reflects a growing trend in literature to embrace diverse experiences.

Their individual journeys and uncertainties about their roles enrich the narrative. Vasilisa's mother, the Empress, is portrayed as a tyrant who has devolved from a decent person into a power-hungry ruler, surpassing even her abusive husband in her cruelty.",
            "The story begins slowly, likely due to my need to adjust to the richly detailed world and the complexities of the brewing revolution. However, once I became immersed, the narrative transformed into an engaging and thought-provoking experience.",
            "This book presents an intriguing blend of Imperial Russian history, Slavic folklore, and fantasy elements. The alureans, a wealthy class endowed with powers from otherworldly Gods (zmei), add significant depth to the narrative. However, the origins of these Gods and their connection to humanity remain obscured, as the Higher Class deliberately erases this knowledge to maintain their dominance. Against this backdrop of a brewing revolution, the story captures the people's frustration with oppression, cultural suppression, and the alureans' ostentatious wealth. It delves into themes of power, rebellion, and the moral complexities of survival and resistance. Vitaly, a morally ambiguous character, believes he is fighting against the Empress's tyranny, while Sera harbors secrets to protect her loved ones."

The alureans, a wealthy class with Gods (zmei) possessing powers from another world, add depth to the story. However, the origins of these Gods and how they came to inhabit human bodies remain shrouded in mystery due to the Higher Class's deliberate destruction of such information to maintain power.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Characters:**  \n  The story is told from the perspectives of five characters‚ÄîSera, Katya, Vitaly, Galina, and Vasilisa‚Äîeach playing a crucial role in the unfolding events.

This representation is appreciated and reflects a growing trend in literature to include diverse experiences.\n\n- **Pacing and World-Building:**  \n  The story has a slow start, which may be attributed to the reader needing time to acclimate to the richly detailed world and the complexities of the brewing revolution.

While Vitaly lacked depth outside his relationship with Sera, I found this acceptable, as it mirrors the roles often assigned to female characters. Katya emerged as my favorite; her bravery and resilience were admirable, and I appreciated Sera's prioritization of Katya's survival over the rebellion's success.

            "The ending suggests a standalone story while leaving room for potential sequels. It concludes with a satisfying happily-ever-after, albeit with a minor cliffhanger. In this world, the elite have discovered how to imprison gods (dragons) within human bodies, and our two main characters, commoners themselves, harbor gods within them as well. The narrative begins with the perspectives of each sister, but as the story unfolds, it expands to include around five different characters by the middle of the novel.",
            "This story features distinct characters, each with a unique voice, purpose, and personality. Even the villain, easy to despise, is humanized through reminders of their lost innocence before committing atrocities. The love stories, including a sapphic pairing, are filled with forbidden longing, as each sister suppresses her true feelings to protect the other, knowing that revealing their secrets could unravel their relationships. The flirtations, angst, and declarations of devotion left me in tears by the end. The novel also skillfully addresses chronic illness and disability; it wasn't until the last 25% that I realized I was reading about a character whose daily struggles mirrored my own. This representation felt seamless and deeply personal, making for a profoundly moving experience.",
            "The story opens with two sisters and approximately fifty pages of world-building. Although the information was presented smoothly and wasn't overwhelming, I initially found it challenging to remember the names of characters, places, and the political alignments. However, as I continued reading, my understanding deepened, and I soon became fully immersed in the narrative.",

While it wasn‚Äôt info-dumpy or frustrating, I initially struggled to remember names of people, places, and things, as well as figuring out who was on the good or bad side politically. However, as I kept reading, my understanding solidified, and I was quickly able to let the story consume me.  \n\n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  In this world, the elite have learned‚Äîand hidden‚Äîhow to cage gods (dragons) inside human bodies. Our two main characters are commoners who secretly have gods caged within them as well. The book starts with POVs for each sister, but as more characters are introduced, the POV chapters expand to about five different characters by the middle of the novel.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Each character felt distinct, with their voice, purpose, and personality shining through the pages. Even the villain, who was easy to hate, was humanized with reminders of their innocence before they began committing atrocities.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  Both love stories, including a sapphic pairing, were taut with forbidden longing. Each sister held back their true feelings to protect one another, knowing these secrets would unravel their relationships with their would-be partners. The flirtations, angst, and declarations of devotion left me weeping by the end of the novel.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The novel deftly handles chronic illness and disability.

Galina's character arc is especially abrupt; she transitions from severe depression and bed-ridden despair to infiltrating the palace after just a few words from Sera. Her struggle with alcoholism is resolved in a mere two paragraphs. This pacing leaves little room for meaningful development, and the brief scenes and chapters hinder the creation of depth and tension.",

The romance between Sera and Vitaly follows a predictable enemies-to-lovers trope, featuring clich√©d bickering and a tensionless knife-to-throat scene. Additionally, Sera's conflict with Vitaly regarding his use of violence feels inconsistent; she seems to expect to overthrow the aristocracy without any bloodshed.",
            "The narrative suffers from repetition, with simple facts reiterated unnecessarily. For example, several lines in the same chapter stress that Empress Isidora could kill Katya at any moment. Additionally, the use of \"panacea\" to describe an experimental drug meant to enhance Galina‚Äôs godpower is a notable inaccuracy. Descriptions of characters and settings are generic and lack specificity, while the inclusion of Russian (or Russian-sounding) words in dialogue feels superficial, failing to create a rich, immersive atmosphere. The author tends to over-explain motivations and thoughts, often telling rather than showing. For instance, we are repeatedly informed about the unbreakable bond between Galina and Sera, as well as Katya‚Äôs strategic mindset, but these traits are not effectively demonstrated through their actions.",

The plot revolves around Galina and Sera, who wield uncommon power after brutal gods are grafted into their bones by their mother. They lead a rebellion to end the cruel reign of royals possessed by destructive gods. The unfurling of the plot is clever and exciting, with a well-paced flow and seamless transitions between POVs. The story is filled with schemes and agendas, creating a symphony of devious and perilous ploys.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world is richly imagined, with shades of Imperial Russia, plagued by insatiable rulers hungry for power. The narrative is poignant and expressive, with evocative visuals and lyrical embellishments that set vivid scenes. The figurative speech is plentiful and creative, enhancing the immersive experience.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The sisterly bond between Galina and Sera is heartwarming and tugs at the heartstrings. Their relationships with their respective gods, who are dragons, are intriguing and accompany their pain. The romantic interests are well-developed: one is a reignited love, and the other is an enemies-to-lovers dynamic, with the attraction displayed invitingly. The villain is ideally hateful, making their eventual downfall highly anticipated. Additional POVs from other characters add depth and intrigue, making it hard not to root for them.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The narrative is colored with clever quips and humor, balancing the dark tone of the story. The writing is expressive and evocative, with scenes that reverberate in the imagination. The use of figurative language is creative and enhances the storytelling.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The book explores the dangers of power, the chasm between those who have it and those who don‚Äôt, and the wrongness of war‚Äîa topic that remains relevant today. It also delves into themes of revenge, revolution, and staying true to oneself.  \n\n- **Critiques:**  \n  Some ill-timed spicy or romantic scenes felt out of place and disrupted the narrative flow. Additionally, the mechanics of the gods' caging were unclear, leaving questions about whether the dragons are physically inside the characters or if it‚Äôs a mental bond. This lack of clarity was a minor frustration, though it may be addressed in the sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a gripping and immersive novel with a compelling premise, richly developed characters, and a vividly imagined world. Despite minor critiques, the story is a symphony of intrigue, emotion, and action, culminating in an explosive finale that leaves readers eagerly anticipating the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I found some sections, particularly toward the end, lacking in context and detail. I would have preferred more framing of the narrative and less emphasis on the romance, which felt repetitive. The plot is rich with power dynamics, malevolent rulers, dangerous rebels, secret labs, and a world teetering on the brink of war.

Sera, on the other hand, embodies the Badass Protective Heroine, but she suffers from similar underdevelopment.

While I enjoyed *Shadow & Bone*, I haven‚Äôt read *Fourth Wing*, and if this book is a combination, I won‚Äôt be picking that one up.\n\n- **Pacing and Initial Engagement:**  \n  I almost DNF this book twice within the first 25%. I promised myself that I could stop if I reached that point and it still wasn‚Äôt working for me, but thankfully the book picked up just before that point. That being said, the first 25% of the book was painful for me. It felt like I was walking into a sequel past the initial flashback with none of the knowledge I needed to actually connect.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  Any worldbuilding ‚Äì which I NEED in a fantasy book ‚Äì was brief or shoehorned in chunks that felt clunky and forced. I wish the dragons had more development and attention. I was left with more questions than answers about the most interesting points of the story, which was a real bummer.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters in that early section read like they were written by a young teenager trying to make the characters feel older and edgy. This improves by the halfway mark, but I couldn‚Äôt stand Galina‚Äôs italicized inner monologue that led up to that point ‚Äì she was more pitiful and sad than someone who had been through trauma and was just trying to cope. Sera had the same affliction, except her role was the Badass Protective Heroine who was also the brains of the operation. Neither of these characters developed much after the 50% mark, so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this book if you are big on character building. The only character I thought had real depth and growth was Vasilisa ‚Äì I loved the chronic pain representation and the decisions she chooses to make as she recognizes her own inner power.\n\n- **Plot and Originality:**  \n  As for the plot, it felt very familiar ‚Äì minus the Russian edge ‚Äì but it was interesting enough to keep me reading. I likely won‚Äôt remember it after my next read, and even writing this review I can‚Äôt say any development through the narrative really excited me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book improved after a slow and confusing start, it ultimately fell short in worldbuilding, character development, and originality. The only standout aspect was Vasilisa‚Äôs character arc, which provided meaningful representation and growth.

It revolves around a rebellion achieved by infiltrating the elite, with POVs from figures at various stages of the organized rebellion. However, the revolutionaries lack concrete plans for the post-revolution world, which feels underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Characterization and Relationships:**  \n  Sera is a standout character, and her relationship with her dragon-god is particularly enjoyable. However, some characters, like Katya, feel repetitive and underdeveloped, with her hatred for the empress remaining static throughout many scenes.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Prose:**  \n  The writing is often convoluted and indulgent, sometimes sacrificing clarity for poetic effect.

The narrative features five points of view, primarily focusing on Sera and Galina, with Vitali, Katya, and Vasilya providing additional perspectives that enrich the story.

They recognize that the current rebellion lacks foresight and are determined to use their illegally gained magic to challenge tyranny and protect the common people.  \n  - The book is an epic tale of magic, rebellion, and confronting oppression, with a strong emphasis on sisterhood and resilience.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - The central relationship is between the two sisters, Sera and Galina, who fight side by side and for each other amidst the chaos of war. Their bond is the heart of the story, reinforced by the ending, which highlights their mutual support and victory as sisters.  \n  - Both sisters have romances, each with distinct dynamics, but these relationships take a backseat to the sisters' connection.  \n  - There are five POVs in total, with Sera and Galina dominating the narration. Vitali, Katya, and Vasilya also contribute their perspectives, adding depth to the story. Vitali, in particular, stands out as a chaotic and destructive force, making him a favorite among the secondary narrators.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  - Sofia Engstrand narrates all five perspectives, effectively bringing the world and characters to life.  \n  - Each chapter begins with the name of the character narrating, which helps listeners quickly orient themselves to the plotlines and POVs.  \n\n- **Structure and Series Potential:**  \n  - While this is the first book in a duology, it stands well on its own, with the main story and antagonist resolved by the end.  \n  - The second book introduces a new threat and a new world, setting the stage for further exploration and excitement.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*To Cage a God* is a compelling and well-crafted novel that blends magic, rebellion, and the unbreakable bond of sisterhood.

However, my personal rating is around a 3.5.\n\n- **Expectations vs. Experience:**  \n  I liked this book far better than I expected based on early reviews. While it‚Äôs almost fatally overwritten, the story was interesting enough to overcome the writing stumbles. I also hope that some of the more annoying writing issues highlighted by other reviewers will be corrected in the final published version.\n\n- **Setting and Cultural Influence:**  \n  The Russian backdrop is much less important than the marketing suggests. While it‚Äôs inspired by the Russian Revolution, the cultural influence is limited to occasional mentions of onion domes and the use of patronymics.\n\n- **Mythology and World-Building:**  \n  The mythology feels entirely new and not derivative, but it‚Äôs unfortunately under-explained. There are noticeable holes in the mythology that could have been fleshed out more.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved Galina, Katya, and Vasilisa, but was indifferent to Sera. The character Vitaly fell completely flat for me. His insistence on being a hardened criminal with no empathy didn‚Äôt align with his actions, which made him come off as an okay guy. This inconsistency made it hard to believe his relationship with Sera was what gave him a moral compass.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  Overall, this is a solidly okay novel. I‚Äôm always a sucker for sapphic fantasy, and I‚Äôm really interested to see how more people feel about this one.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws, *To Cage a God* was an enjoyable read with an interesting story and strong characters, though it could benefit from tighter writing and more detailed world-building.

The story wrapped up satisfactorily while leaving the ending open for potential sequels to explore the consequences.",

I was drawn to Sera right away, but Galina's intrusive thoughts and self-deprecating tendencies were somewhat disheartening to read. However, she became a much more compelling character once she stopped drinking. I appreciated being inside the minds of the main characters; Galina, post-recovery, emerged as a fascinating figure, while Sera's determination was balanced by her strong moral compass, preventing her from repeating her mother's mistakes.

An additional 100-200 pages would have allowed for a deeper exploration of the relationships and more insight into Vitaly and Vasilisa's characters. The story revolves around four determined women on a mission to dismantle an empire, which I found particularly compelling. The inclusion of a second-chance romance and a forbidden love added significant depth to the narrative.",

They break away from the typical \"not like other girls\" trope often found in recent fantasy romances. Vitaly, while embodying the classic male romance hero archetype as a self-centered character focused solely on Sera, still manages to be engaging, and I enjoyed his relationship with her. Galina and Vasilisa‚Äôs romance is emotionally driven and compelling, though I would have liked to see more flirty exchanges between them. The sisterhood between Sera and Galina, along with their friendships with Anna and Katya, was a standout aspect of the story.",

I find this troubling. Even the ongoing hype around Bardugo‚Äôs universe shouldn‚Äôt motivate anyone to replicate such worlds or give any attention to a criminal nation. In *To Cage a God*, we not only have a fantasy Russia but also a fantasy era reminiscent of the fall of the Romanovs. The Communists are cleverly transformed into the \"Niewierni,\" and the corrupt, decadent nobility is given something called \"zmeya,\" a strange kind of dragon that grants superhuman powers. This moral ambiguity is hard to overlook.\n\n- **Storytelling and Tropes:**  \n  The author plays with familiar tropes: an oppressed people rising up to overthrow a cruel tyrant, here represented by the evil Empress. There‚Äôs a lost princess, rebels, and two sisters willing to risk their lives to free their nation. The story unfolds with a sense of grandeur, romantic tension, and hesitant love. While these tropes aren‚Äôt inherently bad‚Äîsome are even enjoyable and timeless‚Äîthe setting feels problematic. I have a few tropes I could read endlessly with a smile, but the focus on Russia detracts from the experience.\n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  I wonder why, when aiming to capture a Slavic spirit, the focus had to be on Russia, a nation with such a criminal legacy. Couldn‚Äôt the story have been set in any other Slavic country? I believe this would have brought much more freshness and originality to the narrative. The choice to center the story around Russia feels like a missed opportunity to explore lesser-known Slavic cultures.\n\n- **Personal Engagement:**  \n  I wouldn‚Äôt have picked up this book if it hadn‚Äôt been included in the Illumicrate box.

Told through the perspectives of five characters, each with unique motivations in the revolution against Alurean rule, the plot is filled with engaging twists and turns. The pacing is well-balanced, keeping me captivated from start to finish.",
            "This story features complex, morally grey characters that I found captivating. Sera and Galina, sisters and daughters of a martyr revolutionary leader, are determined to dismantle Alurean rule and assassinate the Empress. Galina, possessing powers akin to the Empress, cleverly infiltrates the empire as a spy. Vitalik, the ruthless leader of the revolution, is both vicious and compelling. Katya, the handmaiden to the cruel empress, and Vasilisa, the empress‚Äôs daughter, further enrich the narrative. Each character is flawed yet strives for improvement, making them relatable and intriguing. The beautifully crafted love stories, especially the WLW (women-loving-women) representation, add emotional depth, with the yearning between characters portrayed perfectly.",
            "The writing is exceptional, striking a perfect balance between action, emotion, and character development. The pacing is excellent, and the emotional moments, particularly the themes of yearning and love, are executed flawlessly.",
            "The world-building may not be extensive, but the setting draws inspiration from Slavic culture and language, which I found refreshing. The magic system, centered on the dragon gods of Alurea, is unique and well-integrated into the narrative. This seamless integration creates a cohesive and immersive experience."

The WLW representation and beautifully written love stories added depth to the narrative. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am eagerly anticipating the next installment in the duology.",

            "As a fan of fantasy romance, I found the romantic elements in this story to be more disruptive than enriching. They detracted from the plot's stakes and urgency. For example, in the opening scenes, we are repeatedly told that Galina's life is in danger, yet Sera completely disregards this when she spots her ex-lover, Vitaly, and chooses to focus on him instead.",
            "The characters lacked believability and felt overly juvenile for an adult fantasy. Sera's swift forgiveness of Vitaly, despite his attempt to have her sister assimilated, strained my ability to connect with the protagonists. It was difficult to invest in the sisters when they so readily overlooked each other and their revolutionary cause.",

The Slavic godpunk fantasy inspired by the Russian revolution was an intriguing concept.  \n\n- **Execution of the Story:**  \n  Unfortunately, the execution of the story itself fell flat. The plot lacked the depth and urgency needed to fully engage me.  \n\n- **Romance and Plot Integration:**  \n  I‚Äôm a sucker for a good fantasy romance, but the romance here felt more at odds with the plot than an enhancement of it. It undermined any sense of stakes or urgency. For instance, in one of the opening scenes, readers are repeatedly told that Galina‚Äôs life is somehow on the line, yet all consideration for her sister‚Äôs life goes out the window when Sera spies her ex-lover, Vitaly, and decides to ogle him instead.  \n\n- **Character Development and Believability:**  \n  The characters didn‚Äôt feel believable to me and came across as too juvenile for an adult fantasy. Sera was way too quick to forgive Vitaly after he attempts to have her sister assimilated. I found it hard to root for and care about the main sisters when they so easily forget each other and their own revolutionary cause.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *To Cage a God* by Elizabeth May had an intriguing premise and a unique Slavic godpunk setting, the execution of the story, the integration of romance, and the believability of the characters left much to be desired.

I usually push through to find out what happens or because I‚Äôm curious about the characters, but in this case, I didn‚Äôt feel compelled to keep going.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romances felt forced. There was instant attraction and ex-lovers who obviously never let each other go, but the tension wasn‚Äôt palpable at all.  \n\n- **Character Development and POVs:**  \n  Some character POVs were completely unnecessary, in my opinion. They seemed to exist only to force exposition on the reader. I would have preferred to figure things out through ‚Äúshow don‚Äôt tell,‚Äù but instead, I was given all the information about a character after only meeting them twice.  \n\n- **World-Building and Explanation:**  \n  There was a lot of repetition about certain things (e.g., the sister‚Äôs death), but very little explanation about the gods and their powers. For example, the gods ‚Äúwrithe against bones and skin,‚Äù but it‚Äôs unclear if they‚Äôre physically present or just shadows. Additionally, the mechanics of the powers were poorly explained. Sera, for instance, seemed to have abilities that allowed her to be a thief, which felt odd for a god.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  It‚Äôs disappointing because I was really excited about the concept of the book, but it fell flat for me in so many ways. It‚Äôs possible this just wasn‚Äôt the right book for me, but I needed to express my thoughts.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept of the book had potential, the execution didn‚Äôt work for me.

            "The plot lacked excitement, offering no significant twists or surprises; it followed a conventional rebellion narrative against an oppressive ruling class. While there were some engaging action scenes, they fell short of being exceptional.",
            "The characters had intriguing backstories and histories, but they ultimately felt flat, lacking significant development throughout the story. The relationships among the main characters were the highlight, featuring decent tension and buildup, though I wouldn't classify it as a romantasy read.",
            "The story unfolds through alternating perspectives of the main characters, which effectively propels the plot forward. While the initial info-dumping made it somewhat challenging to engage with at first, the overall reading experience remained accessible.",
            "I found the magic system challenging to grasp and visualize, as it felt underdeveloped. It appeared overpowered and overly simplistic, offering some scientific explanations but leaving significant gaps in understanding. While more details may emerge in future installments of the series, I'm uncertain if I'm engaged enough to continue.",
            "The book was marketed as an adult version of *Shadow and Bone*, emphasizing romance and romantasy, and I found this to be partially accurate. It shares similarities with *Shadow and Bone* in its setting, class system based on magical powers, and political atmosphere."

        "conclusion": "I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fantasy read with strong character relationships and world-building, but not to someone seeking an intriguing plot or a romance-focused story. While it had its strengths, particularly in character dynamics, the underdeveloped magic system and predictable plot left me wanting more.",

I particularly enjoyed the chapters from Sera‚Äôs perspective and wished for more emphasis on her character, especially regarding her poor judgment in men.

            "The title \"To Cage a God\" is somewhat misleading, as the gods (or dragons) are already bound to humans. The ruling class has inherited these divine beings, using them to dominate the rest of the population, known as supplicants. Sera and Galina stand out as exceptions; their mother secured gods for them in a bid to challenge the oppressive Empress and her noble allies."

This shift in focus detracted from the urgency and importance of their goal.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was presented in broad strokes, but I would have liked more depth and detail about the society, magic, science, and politics.

Galina‚Äôs ability to push past these barriers added layers to both characters.  \n\n- **Unresolved Plot Points:**  \n  I wish we had learned more about Irina‚Äôs experiments, but I‚Äôm hopeful this will be explored in the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an excellent read with strong world-building, compelling character dynamics, and a unique romantic subplot. The book balanced resolution with setup for the next installment, and the characters were well-developed and engaging. While some plot points remain unresolved, they leave room for anticipation in the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è"

Vitalik stands out as a morally black character who loves only one person, and I found his infuriating nature compelling‚Äîhis declarations are the highlight of the book. Sera, Galina, and Katya have endured significant trauma and abuse, and I was fully invested in their struggle against the truly evil empress. The narrative features two main romantic relationships, along with the dynamic between the two sisters and their co-conspirators. These relationships develop slowly but pay off beautifully.",

            "The story centers on foster sisters Sera and Galina, who were subjected to experiments by their foster mother, who implanted them with gods. After their mother was executed for her involvement with the Rebellion, the Faithless, the sisters set out for revenge against the Empress. The narrative is rich with cunning schemes, a fight for justice, morally ambiguous characters, power-hungry nobles, and a strong bond between the sisters. While the second half of the book captivated me, the first half dragged and left important details insufficiently explained.",
            "Sera and Galina drive a gripping tale of revenge, while Vitaly, the devoted assassin, emerges as a standout character and a personal favorite. Vasilisa, the enigmatic princess, captivates with her remarkable character growth as she discovers her true self. Other key figures, including Katya and Princess Vasilisa, contribute significantly to the narrative. The book features enjoyable romances, including a second-chance love story and sapphic relationships, adding depth to the plot.",

While the first half was slow and lacked clarity, the second half was engaging and rewarding. The romances, particularly Vitaly‚Äôs devotion and Vasilisa‚Äôs growth, were highlights.

            "This fast-paced novel features shorter chapters and a lighter approach to worldbuilding. It alternates between five main POV characters, offering insight into their actions and romantic entanglements. Set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution, this multi-POV romantasy follows sisters Galina and Sera, who are bound to powerful dragon-gods known as zmei and raised to dismantle an empire by any means necessary. Galina infiltrates the palace as a handmaiden and encounters Princess Vasilisa, while Sera rekindles her romance with Vitaly, a fellow revolutionary.",
            "The romantic dynamics between Sera and Vitaly are captivating, as Vitaly is determined to win back Sera, while she remains focused on their mission and Galina's safety. In contrast, Galina and Vasilisa's relationship unfolds as an enemies-to-lovers story, providing a fresh perspective alongside Sera and Vitaly's second-chance romance. The chemistry between Galina and Vasilisa is instant, intensified by the bond between their zmei. This novel is highly recommended for fans of Anastasia retellings and those looking for a fantasy with a strong romantic emphasis."

Aside from the language, the Russian elements did not significantly enhance the overall experience.",

While the premise is captivating, the story loses its depth after the mother‚Äôs off-screen death, leaving the sisters to continue her mission. Although the setting draws inspiration from early 20th-century imperial Russia and its civil unrest, it ultimately lacks the complexity needed to fully explore the historical political landscape.",

The sisters, Galina and Sera, didn‚Äôt stand out, and their development felt lacking. The love interests were also uninteresting, which made the romance feel dull and uninspired.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  While I enjoy romance in stories, the romance in this book was lackluster.

However, I found this perspective unconvincing, as the story clearly telegraphs who the villain is (the Empress) and places all blame for casualties on her. This lack of nuance contradicts the intended moral complexity.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters feel underdeveloped, more like sketches pasted over a worldbuilding document. They lack depth and fail to embody the shades of gray the author aimed for, resulting in a black-and-white morality that feels simplistic.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Fantasy Elements:**  \n  The worldbuilding relies on some weak YA shorthand, such as vague references to a \"dragon in my bones\" and \"silver eyes,\" which are not explored in depth. This makes the fantasy elements feel superficial and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sensual Content:**  \n  While the sex scenes are solid, the sensual content is overrated. Cutting to black and saying sexy things doesn‚Äôt justify a three out of five chili peppers rating; it‚Äôs more like a two out of five at best.  \n\n- **Historical and Cultural Representation:**  \n  The novel attempts to ape the aesthetics of Imperial Russia but fails to engage with the realities of that historical context. This lack of depth makes the setting feel shallow and unconvincing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this mid-market fantasy with a dash of romance falls short of its potential.

There wasn‚Äôt a whole lot of clarity surrounding the magic system.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book could have been a solid 200 pages shorter if every other line wasn‚Äôt wasted on explaining over and over again that they‚Äôre only pretending to be obedient to their oppressors. It felt repetitive and unnecessary.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  If the story had focused solely on Galina and Vasalisa, I would have loved it. Their dynamic was compelling and engaging.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  Vitalik and his love story with Sera were not believable. Vitalik kept ruining everything, and I don‚Äôt see why Sera needed a love interest at all. She could have easily been portrayed as a loving sister devoted to the greater good.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The leader of the faithless could have been a side character who simply inconvenienced the main characters, rather than being tied into an unconvincing romantic subplot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential, particularly in the dynamic between Galina and Vasalisa, it was weighed down by weak world-building, repetitive explanations, and an unconvincing romantic subplot involving Vitalik and Sera. The story would have benefited from tighter pacing and a stronger focus on its more compelling elements.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This novel, told from multiple perspectives, can be repetitive and occasionally slow-paced. However, the overall storyline is engaging. It features two main narratives centered on Galina and Sera, each with its own romantic subplot. Galina's sapphic love affair, characterized by a hidden identity and a deep bond, is beautifully rendered. In contrast, Sera's enemies-to-lovers relationship, marked by intense moments (such as a knife to the throat), felt somewhat contrived to me.",

            "The novel is a Slavic fantasy that evokes the essence of a dark fairytale."

It added a unique and intriguing layer to the story.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were great. There are five POVs, and I liked them all. I particularly felt for Katya and enjoyed seeing both sides of the two romances. Vasilisa and Vitaly really grew on me, and I ended up loving them both.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  However, I felt like there was minimal plot. The story was slow and felt mostly like filler. The key event needed to stop the villain happened off-screen and was resolved too easily, which made the story feel lacking in substance. I wish more significant events had occurred and that the end goal had been clearer.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  While we get a rough idea of the magic, the specifics were unclear. For example, the empress seems to be able to do a lot of things with her godfire magic, but it‚Äôs never explained how it works. This lack of detail was frustrating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had a lot of promise with its setting, characters, and magical elements, but it ultimately missed the mark for me due to its slow pacing, lack of substantial plot, and vague resolution. The unclear magic system also left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There was a devious plan to get someone admitted to the palace, but once she was there, there was no clear plan or purpose. Any significant changes in the plot seemed to arise from accidental circumstances rather than deliberate actions.  \n- **Romance Subplots:**  \n  The book included a couple of forced romances that didn‚Äôt resonate with me and felt unnecessary to the overall story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting premise and a fresh take on magic, the lack of purposeful plot development and the inclusion of unconvincing romances made it less enjoyable than I had hoped.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Katya stands out as a favorite due to her bravery and resilience as the Empress‚Äôs handmaiden working to overthrow the empire alongside Sera and Galina. On the other hand, Vitaly is the least favorite character, as he feels flat and overly dependent on Sera, making his presence seem unnecessary to the overall plot.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  The romance between Sera and Galina is compelling and adds depth to the story. Vitaly‚Äôs expressions of love and anger toward Sera are sweet and understandable, but his character lacks depth without her.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The story is well-written, with clear motivations and development for the characters, making it easy to understand why they act the way they do.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*To Cage a God* is a captivating dark fantasy with a strong focus on revenge, politics, and female rage. The multi-POV structure and intricate magic system add depth to the story, though some characters, like Vitaly, feel underdeveloped. The romance between Sera and Galina is a highlight, making this a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: 4.5 stars  \n- Spice Rating: 1.5/5"

Despite some initial confusion with the setting and a dislike for one character, the story‚Äôs originality, strong character arcs, and fluid writing make it a highly enjoyable read. I wholeheartedly recommend it!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall enjoyment: ‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è (5/5)  \n- World-building: ‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è (4/5)  \n- Character development: ‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è (5/5)  \n- Pacing: ‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è (4/5)"

This was disappointing because the plot itself had potential.\n\n- **Overall Experience and Regret:**  \n  Looking back, I think I should have just DNF‚Äôd (Did Not Finish) the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book‚Äôs plot had potential, the lack of clear worldbuilding and my inability to connect with the characters made the reading experience frustrating and unengaging. I regret not putting the book down earlier.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
