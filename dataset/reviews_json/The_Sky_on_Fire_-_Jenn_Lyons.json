            "The book is a fast and engaging read, but the pacing in the second half feels off. The story rushes toward the heist, only to encounter delays that disrupt the flow and make the ending feel crammed. It might have benefited from being a duology, allowing for deeper character development and plot progression. While I enjoyed the romantic relationships and felt Anahrod had great chemistry with both partners, the romance was poorly integrated. It was introduced too quickly, with instant attraction and flirting, but then sidelined for much of the narrative. The resolution of the romantic tension was unsatisfying, and the love confessions lacked credibility due to insufficient relationship development. Additionally, some spicy scenes felt awkwardly inserted into the story.",
            "The large cast of characters, united for an audacious heist, was well-developed and interacted effectively. The engaging banter and exploration of found family and friendship dynamics added depth to the narrative. However, the protagonist, Anahrod, felt somewhat flat; she lacked motivation and often came across as a tool for others’ plans rather than a driving force in the story.",

Although I'm not usually a fan of dragons, the world-building surrounding them captivated me.

I found the dynamic between dragon and rider particularly intriguing, especially given the distinct personalities of the dragons."

This sweeping high-stakes fantasy features dragons, heists, secrets, and a queer romance. While I initially picked it up for the dragons, I discovered it offers so much more. The intricately woven story includes well-timed reveals and suspenseful moments reminiscent of the early seasons of *Game of Thrones*. Although the heist plot starts slowly, the detailed world-building and dragon lore more than compensate for the pacing.",

The LGBTQIA+ representation is commendable, particularly the symbolic rings that signify gender, relationship status, and romantic preferences—an ingenious and meaningful concept. The tender, sweet, and swoon-worthy polyamorous throuple relationship involving the main character offers a refreshing dynamic that I thoroughly enjoyed.",

Some dragons were religious, others were not, and all had different affinities and personalities.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was very fast-paced and constantly moving, which kept me engaged throughout. However, I felt that the characters overcame challenges a bit too easily, which slightly diminished the tension.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character development wasn’t the best. While the characters were interesting, I wished they had more depth and growth throughout the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book. It offered something different with its unique blend of dragons and an epic heist, making it a refreshing and entertaining read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel is a fast-paced, plot-driven adventure brimming with surprises and rapid twists. While this keeps the story engaging, the characters' ability to adapt seamlessly to dire situations often feels unrealistic. The heist is thrilling, but the frequent \"but actually\" moments can create a sense of whiplash. Nevertheless, the brisk pace ensures that the story remains captivating from start to finish.",
            "In *The Sky on Fire*, the characters are largely underdeveloped, relying on familiar archetypes with just one or two defining traits that hinder deeper exploration. While the character concepts are promising, their execution misses the mark. However, I appreciated the novel’s focus on multiple female characters leading the heist, a refreshing shift from the typical male-dominated narratives in this genre. \n\nThe romance, unfortunately, fell flat. Anahrod's sudden attraction to dragonrider Ris, alongside her unresolved feelings for her ex, Sicaryon, felt superficial. The subsequent throuple dynamic lacked meaningful discussions about feelings, expectations, or boundaries, making it appear random and forced. Although the absence of a conventional love triangle was a positive choice, the overall lack of tension rendered the romance less engaging.\n\nOn a brighter note, the novel excels in showcasing female characters at the forefront of the heist, offering a unique and light-hearted approach to dragons and fantasy that avoids the genre's often serious tone. Additionally, its examination of class divisions and power dynamics through the lens of both dragons and humans adds an intriguing layer to the story.",
            "*The Sky on Fire* shines with its exceptional world-building. The story contrasts the high mountains, home to the affluent and powerful alongside dragons, with the lawless, sweltering jungles of The Deep, where the marginalized dwell. The Deep becomes a refuge for protagonist Anahrod, who is on the run from dragons. The novel offers a nuanced portrayal of these creatures, presenting them as complex characters with distinct abilities, beliefs, and attitudes toward humans. Rather than being mere mythological beings, dragons play a crucial role in the world’s class structure and power dynamics. Humans possessing magical potential are often compelled into dragonrider pacts, resembling a form of lifelong servitude. Additionally, the intriguing detail that each dragon hoards a specific item further enriches the story's depth."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite some shortcomings in character development and romance, *The Sky on Fire* is a fun and engaging fantasy novel with excellent world-building and a fast-paced plot. Its unique portrayal of dragons, refreshing female-led heist, and light-hearted tone make it a worthwhile read. I would recommend it to fans of Rachel Aaron’s *The Legend of Eli Monpress* and James Logan’s *The Silverblood Promise*.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The standout feature of *The Sky on Fire* is its fantastic world-building. The world is divided into the high mountains, where the rich and powerful live alongside dragons, and the lawless, scorching jungles of The Deep, where the poor and undesirable reside. The Deep serves as a hiding place for the protagonist, Anahrod, who is pursued by dragons. The novel presents a nuanced portrayal of dragons, depicting them as complex characters with different breaths, religions, and attitudes toward humans. Dragons are not merely mythological beings but integral to the world’s class divisions and power dynamics. Humans with magical potential are forced into dragonrider pacts, which often resemble lifelong enslavement. The unique detail of each dragon having a designated item they hoard adds depth and intrigue to the world.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The novel is plot-driven and fast-paced, filled with constant surprises, quick changes, and last-minute discoveries. While this kept the story exciting, the characters’ ability to pivot effortlessly in the face of dire situations felt unrealistic. The heist itself was thrilling, but the frequent “but actually” moments created a sense of whiplash. Despite this, the fast-paced nature of the story held my attention throughout.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters in *The Sky on Fire* are not deeply developed. They rely on familiar archetypes, with one or two defining traits, leaving little room for depth. While the ideas behind the characters are great, their execution falls short. However, I appreciated the inclusion of multiple female characters leading the heist, a refreshing departure from the male-dominated heist narratives often seen in literature.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance in the novel was disappointing. Anahrod’s insta-lust for the dragonrider Ris, combined with her lingering feelings for her ex, Sicaryon, felt underdeveloped. The eventual throuple dynamic between Anahrod, Ris, and Sicaryon lacked meaningful conversations about feelings, expectations, or boundaries, making it feel random and contrived. While it was nice to avoid the typical love triangle drama, the lack of tension and conflict made the romance less engaging.\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The novel shines in its representation of female characters taking center stage in a heist narrative. It also offers a unique and light-hearted take on dragons and fantasy, avoiding the overly serious tone often found in the genre. The exploration of class divisions and power dynamics through the lens of dragons and humans adds depth to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some shortcomings in character development and romance, *The Sky on Fire* is a fun and engaging fantasy novel with excellent world-building and a fast-paced plot. Its unique portrayal of dragons, refreshing female-led heist, and light-hearted tone make it a worthwhile read. I would recommend it to fans of Rachel Aaron’s *The Legend of Eli Monpress* and James Logan’s *The Silverblood Promise*.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The author masterfully crafts a rich, immersive world that extends well beyond the confines of the story. The diverse settings, intricate culture, and unique magic system captivated me. In this realm, dragons reign supreme but require human riders to control their power and prevent chaos from unchecked magic. The complexities of the dragon-human dynamic are compelling, particularly highlighted through Peralon’s bond with his rider and his unique perspective. The magic system, featuring elements like sorcery, inscription, animal communication, and dragon affinities, further enhances the depth of this fascinating world."

I felt like I knew them well enough to anticipate their reactions, which made them feel real. The entire cast is endearing, and I loved their interactions, banter, and back-and-forth discussions, even with side characters. Anahrod is a chaotic, disaster of a character, which I adore, and I also grew attached to Sicaryon, Peralon, Gwyndion, and Claw. Despite the relatively short time spent with them, they felt fully developed and memorable.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Lyons creates a rich, immersive, and creative world that feels fully formed and extends beyond the story. I was fascinated by the different settings, the culture, and the magic system. Dragons are the dominant power, but they must take on human riders to prevent them from going rampant due to magic usage. The dynamic between dragons and humans is complex, and I particularly enjoyed Peralon’s relationship with his rider and his perspective on the world. The magic system, which includes sorcery, inscription, animal communication, and dragon affinities, is intriguing and adds depth to the world.  \n\n- **Inclusivity:**  \n  The book features a queer-norm world with a unique system of rings that identify pronouns, gender, sexual preferences, career, and more. While the rings weren’t extensively explained, I hope the finished copy includes an appendix to delve deeper into this fascinating concept. I appreciated the discourse on the cultural divide between the peoples of the Deep and the sky cities, as well as the pushback against the concept of \"savages.\" The disability representation, particularly a double amputee character in a wheelchair, was well-handled and integrated as part of his character rather than his sole defining trait.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  As someone who is usually skeptical of heist stories, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this one. The focus on characters over the heist itself made it engaging and fun. The adventure was thrilling, and I loved the humor, absurdity, and goofy situations throughout. The book did an excellent job of wrapping up its story as a standalone, though the epilogue leaves room for potential sequels.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJenn Lyons has delivered another fantastic novel with *The Sky on Fire*. Fans of *A Chorus of Dragons* will love this book, as it captures many of the elements that made that series so compelling. It’s also a great entry point for new readers, with its straightforward storytelling and standalone nature. Rich world-building, well-crafted characters, inclusivity, and a fun, engaging plot make this one of my favorite reads of the year so far.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nAbsolutely Loved It, 5 stars"

            "The pacing of this book was painfully slow. While the prologue promised a fast-paced, action-packed adventure, I found myself struggling to continue reading just 20% in. What began as a captivating story quickly became a chore. As a fan of heist and quest novels, I was disappointed; the pacing hindered my enjoyment. The plot centers on Anahrod, who is reluctantly rescued from a warlord and pulled into a scheme to steal from the dragon regent, Neveranimas. Torn between her yearning for freedom and the dragon's wrath, she confronts a significant challenge. Although the premise was intriguing, the execution faltered due to pacing and character development issues.",

The other characters, unfortunately, were unremarkable and did not resonate with me.",

However, possibly due to the large cast of characters, there were some I didn't care about even when they died.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The majority of the plot revolved around planning for a heist, which led to a lot less action than I expected, until the very end. The beginning was slow and took some time to really pick up (for me, that was at the 20% mark).  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author's writing style leans more descriptive, which isn't a bad thing, but made the book feel longer than it really was.  \n\n- **Twists and Resolution:**  \n  I enjoyed all the plot twists, but found the resolution for Neveranimas anticlimactic and unbelievable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I did enjoy reading this standalone fantasy novel, especially for its rich worldbuilding and entertaining characters. However, I found it a bit lacking in terms of action and pacing. I would recommend it for fans of dragons, dragonriders, and heists!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n[No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.]"

            "The plot was captivating, but the pacing was inconsistent. It started strong but slowed considerably, making it difficult to stay engaged during the slower sections due to a lack of connection with the characters. The ending felt rushed, with events unfolding too quickly for me to fully grasp. I believe the story would have thrived as a duology or trilogy, allowing for improved pacing and deeper worldbuilding.",
            "I found Anahrod to be an unsatisfying main character. Lacking agency, she often felt like a pawn in the plot rather than an active participant in the heist, making her more of a passive observer. In contrast, Cary was a standout character—hilarious, cocky, and full of energy, he consistently infused the story with life. Unfortunately, the other side characters were underdeveloped; their motivations and personalities were only brushed upon, leaving me disconnected from them and their dynamics within the heist crew. \n\nWhile the book attempted to incorporate gender and sexuality inclusivity—including elements of sex and romance—it often felt forced and unnecessary. Themes like instalove, a fade-to-black threesome, and explicit BDSM flirting added little to the narrative. Additionally, the idea of wearing rings to signify sexual preferences seemed out of place and awkward. Ultimately, the romantic relationships lacked significance to the plot, and the conclusion for the lovers felt anticlimactic.",

The clever concept of dragons ruling the world and the division between Skylanders and Deepers offers great potential, but it could have been more fully developed.

She lacked agency, didn’t actively participate in the heist, and felt like she was constantly being kidnapped to move the plot forward. This made her feel more like a passive observer than a driving force in the story.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  Cary was a standout character—hilarious, cocky, and with great comedic timing. He brought energy to the story whenever he appeared. However, the rest of the side characters felt underdeveloped. Their motivations and personalities were glossed over, and I never bonded with them or felt invested in their dynamics as a heist crew.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding was intriguing but could have been more detailed. The concept of dragons ruling the world and the division between Skylanders and Deepers was clever, but I wanted more depth. The idea of dragon riders being treated as slaves was interesting, but it wasn’t explored as much as I’d hoped.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was super intriguing, but the pacing was uneven. The book started fast but slowed down significantly, and I didn’t care enough about the characters to stay engaged during the slower parts. The ending felt rushed, with too much happening too quickly, and I struggled to keep up. I think the story would have benefited from being a duology or trilogy to allow for better pacing and more worldbuilding.  \n\n- **Romance and Sexual Content:**  \n  The book included nods to sex and romance in a gender/sexuality-inclusive way, but it felt awkward and unnecessary. There was instalove/lust, a fade-to-black threesome, and explicit BDSM flirting that didn’t add to the story. The concept of wearing rings to indicate sexual preferences, including kinks, felt odd and out of place. The romantic relationships had no real bearing on the plot, and the ending for the lovers felt underwhelming.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was well done, with some great moments and well-written action scenes. However, the uneven pacing and rushed ending detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I loved the plot and concept of the book, the execution fell flat for me due to underdeveloped characters, uneven pacing, and unnecessary romantic elements. The story had potential but needed more time to develop, possibly as a duology or trilogy. Despite its flaws, the writing and Cary’s character were strong enough to make it an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI’m rounding up to 4 stars. It’s probably a 3-star book with some 5-star moments, but the writing and Cary’s character balance it out to a 4."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  - The “heist” didn’t happen until around the 50% mark and felt rushed, ending too quickly.  \n  - The action and suspenseful moments were glossed over, with problems solved too easily and without tension.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Development:**  \n  - The romantic relationships felt unbelievable and lacked depth; characters met, found each other attractive, and fell in “love” too quickly.  \n  - There was a lack of character development overall, making it hard to connect with most characters.  \n  - Side characters blended together and lacked distinct personalities.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The world felt underdeveloped; I never got a clear sense of the Skyland or the Deep beyond basic descriptions (e.g., a sky city and a jungle).  \n\n- **Dialogue and Language:**  \n  - The overuse of the word “sunshine” as an exclamation of amazement became repetitive and distracting.  \n\n- **Positive Elements:**  \n  - Guidinion (spelling uncertain) was an interesting character, and I wanted to learn more about his story.  \n  - The dragon/rider relationship and their shared abilities were intriguing and well-executed.  \n  - The audiobook narrator was fantastic and enhanced the listening experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its premise of dragons, heists, and a band of misfits, it fell short for me due to its meandering plot, lack of character development, and underdeveloped world-building. The rushed heist and unresolved romantic relationships further detracted from the story. However, the dragon/rider dynamic and the audiobook narration were highlights. I believe this story could have been stronger as a series or duology, allowing more time to flesh out the world and characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars"

I especially loved Sicaryon and wanted more backstory and deeper connections. Similarly, I wished for a more in-depth exploration of Anah and Gwyd’s sibling relationship. However, the trio of team members—Kaibren, Claw, and Naeron—seemed redundant and didn't contribute much to the narrative.",

It opens in the midst of an action scene, which initially intrigued me, but the early introduction of too many characters quickly became confusing.

            "The story's beginning was challenging due to the introduction of numerous characters and extensive world-building. However, the unexpected heist plot added depth, elevating it beyond a simple “good dragon vs. bad dragon” narrative. With plenty of heart, sass, and dragons, it proved to be a fun and satisfying read. The final act, though, felt rushed and could have benefited from more suspense and dialogue, similar to the earlier scenes.",
            "The characters were richly developed, showcasing lovable and detestable personalities, unique backstories, and distinct identities. The theme of found family resonated deeply, adding significant emotional depth to the narrative.",
            "The world-building is intricate and immersive, though it can be initially overwhelming. The incorporation of the garden rings system is well done, but a cheat sheet would have added clarity.",
            "After grasping the politics and magic system, the story became engaging and enjoyable. However, certain sections were weighed down by excessive details, making it challenging to re-enter the narrative after a break."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book is a satisfying and enjoyable read for fans of dragons, fantasy, and found family tropes. Despite some pacing issues and a slightly rushed ending, the engaging plot, well-developed characters, and immersive world-building make it a standout.",

While the plot is engaging, it occasionally overshadows character development.",

The polyamorous trio—Anahrod, Sicaryion, and Ris—offers a captivating dynamic, yet their relationships could benefit from deeper exploration. Some characters, like Peralon and Ivarion, possess intriguing backstories that leave the reader craving more. While the crew is enjoyable and witty, their individual development feels somewhat superficial; more time spent on their arcs would have been welcome.",

            "The heist was entertaining, filled with mishaps that enhanced the overall enjoyment. However, certain plot points felt repetitive, particularly Anahrod being knocked out and kidnapped multiple times.",
            "The characters, especially Anahrod, lack depth. Her interpersonal relationships, whether romantic or platonic, seem rushed and underdeveloped. Despite her claimed trust issues, she forms deep attachments quickly, which feels unrealistic. While the romance deviates from typical tropes, it escalates too abruptly.",

The concept of magically-blessed dragonriders, where dragons serve more as owners than partners, is both fresh and intriguing.

While this made the story somewhat predictable, I appreciated recognizing the familiar elements. The author's unique twist on the heist added a fun and engaging touch.

The magic system was incredibly cool, and I especially enjoyed how the author incorporated dragons into the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  - The heist plot really worked for me. I love heist stories, and this one followed the classic structure: assemble the crew, explain the plan, execute the plan, the plan goes wrong, make a new plan, and execute the new plan. While this made the story somewhat predictable, I didn’t mind because I enjoyed recognizing all the elements. The author’s unique twist on the heist was particularly fun and engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - While I really loved several of the characters, they felt a little flat. The story was very plot-driven, focusing more on what the characters were doing rather than delving into their thoughts and feelings. As a result, there wasn’t much obvious growth or transformation for any of the characters.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  - I shipped the polycule dynamic, but it didn’t quite have the emotional payoff I was hoping for.

The setting includes multiple cities and a dragon rider training school, though the narrative primarily centers on the heist rather than the schooling aspect. The dragons are friendly enough to bond with their riders but still have the potential for chaos, adding a thrilling element of danger. Each dragon possesses a unique breath power—such as fire, ice, or acid—which is far more entertaining than typical fire-breathing. While the shared consciousness between dragons and riders is a captivating concept, it leaves several questions unanswered.",

Lyons’s vivid descriptions of the jungle and the sky cities were absolutely gorgeous.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  I appreciated the LGBT themes woven throughout the story, which added a welcome layer of depth to the narrative. Anahrod’s sexuality is very nuanced. It’s not essential to the plot but is still an important aspect of her character. This is something I usually champion in fiction—the normalization!  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The primary characters are all complex and multidimensional, with Anahrod being a particular standout. Her tough-as-nails exterior hides a deep vulnerability that makes her all the more relatable. However, some of the supporting characters felt a bit one-dimensional, which made it hard for me to become fully invested in their stories.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The constant action and adventure were a major draw for me, and Lyons delivers on that front. There’s never a dull moment in this story, with battles, chases, and daring heists keeping me on the edge of my seat. The stakes are high, and the tension is palpable, making for a thrilling read. That said, at times, the pacing felt a bit uneven, with some sections feeling rushed or disjointed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I’d recommend *The Sky On Fire* to fans of fantasy and adventure who enjoy complex characters and high-stakes action. If you enjoyed *Six of Crows* or *Fourth Wing*, this may be a good choice for you.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The plot features an exhilarating heist for a magical artifact, with dragons playing vital roles as fleshed-out characters rather than mere props. Despite these pacing concerns, the narrative captivated me from the beginning, offering both enchantment and thought-provoking themes.",

The notable diversity in age, species, motives, life experiences, and skills adds depth to the dynamic. Anahrod, the fiercely independent main character, truly stands out. The romance is refreshing, featuring a love triangle that evolves into a polycule—a representation rarely seen and well-executed. However, the chemistry felt somewhat lacking, possibly due to the story's brevity. Some romantic elements came off as juvenile, with playful teasing about affections that didn’t resonate as strongly for me.",

            "The pacing of the story is uneven, oscillating between immediate action, political drama, jungle adventures, a journey with misfits, random spicy scenes, and an eventual heist. It often feels like the plot simply moves Anahrod from one scenario to another without a clear direction. The final quarter of the book is especially chaotic, brimming with events that make it difficult to become invested. This lack of focus renders the narrative hard to follow. While the concept of garden rings is intriguing, it ultimately feels disconnected from the main storyline, despite being frequently referenced. The idea of social rings indicating profession, origin, and marital status is engaging, but the inclusion of rings that reveal sexual and romantic preferences didn’t resonate with me. I appreciate a queer-normative fantasy, yet this book leans heavily into labeling, which felt misplaced.",
            "Peralon's relationship with Ris and his unique worldview stand out as highlights of the story. However, the characters and their connections remain underdeveloped. Anahrod, for example, lacks clear characterization and motivation, which undermines her impact. Her romantic relationships come across as rushed and superficial, making it difficult for readers to engage with the characters. Moreover, Anahrod's exile feels underexplored; with little background provided, it’s hard to feel invested in her struggles.",
            "The world is richly imaginative, featuring captivating settings, a distinct culture, and an intriguing magic system. I particularly enjoyed the segments set in The Deep. The dragons are formidable forces, yet they rely on human riders to maintain their control, adding an exciting twist to the narrative."

I especially enjoyed the parts set in The Deep. The dragons in this world are absolute powerhouses, but they need human riders to keep them from going rampant, which was a cool twist.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Peralon’s relationship with Ris and his perspective on the world were definite highlights. However, the characters and their relationships are really underdeveloped. Anahrod, for instance, had no real characterization or motive. Her relationships, especially the romantic ones, felt rushed and shallow, making it hard to connect with or care about any of the characters. Anahrod’s exile seemed like it should’ve been a bigger deal, but we barely got any background on it, which made it hard to care about her.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was all over the place. You get thrown into the action right away, some political drama, jungle adventure, a journey with a band of misfits, random spicy scenes, and finally a heist. It felt like the plot was just carrying Anahrod from one place to the next without any clear direction. The last 25% of the book was especially chaotic, with so much happening that it was hard to get invested in any of it. This lack of focus made the narrative feel directionless and hard to follow.  \n\n- **Plot Elements:**  \n  The garden rings concept was interesting but felt pointless to the storyline, even though they were mentioned a lot. The idea of social rings indicating one’s profession, place of origin, and marital status was cool, but rings that reveal your sexual or romantic preferences? Not for me. I love a queer-normative fantasy, but this book was all about labeling, which felt off.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  The book felt like it should have been split into two or three books. There’s just too much going on, and it suffers from being an unfocused mess. \"The Sky on Fire\" had so many good ideas, but it needed more space to develop them. When it was good, it was great, but the bad moments really took away from the good. It could have been so much better if it had been stretched over two or three books to give the story more room to breathe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws, the creative world-building and intriguing magic system make it worth a read, but it could’ve been so much more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for an advanced copy of this audiobook in exchange for an honest review."

            "Anahrod is an intriguing character, yet she remains flat throughout the book. Her personal conflicts, particularly her animosity toward her mother, are resolved too quickly and unconvincingly. The romantic subplot resembles a collection of personal dramas rather than a genuine, evolving connection. While the queernormative setting and the portrayal of bisexual characters are commendable, the absence of asexual representation makes the world feel less inclusive for ace readers.",
            "The worldbuilding was a highlight, featuring rich lore, a queernormative culture, and vivid descriptions. The tension between the Skylanders and Deepers, along with the presence of malevolent dragon gods, added significant depth to the setting. The arm rings representing sexual kinks and preferences were a creative touch, although the absence of asexuality was a notable oversight.",
            "The book grapples with its identity, caught between fantasy romance and adventure heist.

Listening at 1.75x to 2x speed was enjoyable and effective.\n\n- **World-Building and Pacing:**  \n  The book has a lot of potential but feels rushed. It might have worked better as a duology to allow for more detailed world-building. Some nuances were sacrificed for action, making it hard to keep track of characters and their roles, especially in audio format.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The large cast of characters made it difficult to remember who they were and their relationships. The concept of a found family was present but fell short due to insufficient background on each character. There were hints of romantic themes, including queer love, but no true romance, which was fine but worth noting for readers expecting it.\n\n- **Unique Fantasy Elements:**  \n  The dragons holding power over the riders was a refreshing and unique take on the dragon-rider dynamic in fantasy. The book introduced new concepts about their relationship and power balance, which I found intriguing.\n\n- **Overall Potential and Author’s Future Work:**  \n  I would definitely read more by this author, especially if it’s part of a series. With slower world-building and more character development, her books could be even more enjoyable. It’s challenging to balance world-building, romance, action, and a unique plot in a single fantasy novel, but the author shows promise.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has a lot of potential with its unique dragon-rider dynamic and intriguing plot, but it feels rushed and could benefit from more detailed world-building and character development. Despite these challenges, I enjoyed the narration and would read more from this author, particularly if it’s part of a series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building in \"The Sky on Fire\" is nothing short of incredible. Jenn Lyons crafts a fantasy realm ruled by dragons, where humans are considered inferior and serve the dragons to prevent them from succumbing to madness caused by their magic. The setting is immersive and captivating, from bogs that could erupt into an all-consuming fire to the dangerous yet rewarding task of harvesting precious stones from flying creatures. I was hooked from the beginning (well, almost), eager to explore every corner of this fantastic world.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are another highlight. Lyons excels in creating a diverse cast of quirky, distinct, and brash individuals. Anahrod, the independent and willful protagonist capable of communicating with animals, stands out as a strong lead. The dynamics within her group of misfits, who plan to rob the dragon queen’s hoard, are fun, bold, and compelling. Characters like Ris, the flirty and badass dragon rider, and Sicaryon, the charming rogue, add layers of charm and excitement to the story. Their rapid-fire banter and the relentless pace of the plot kept me engaged throughout.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character development is exceptional, and the plot twists and betrayals add depth to the narrative. Lyons doesn’t shy away from making her villains truly annoying and well-crafted, which only enhances your investment in the heroes’ journey. The heroine’s ability to call the shots and save herself at the end of the day is particularly satisfying.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"The Sky on Fire\" by Jenn Lyons is a captivating fantasy novel with incredible world-building, a diverse and compelling cast of characters, and exceptional character development. The immersive setting, bold dynamics, and satisfying narrative twists make it a highly engaging read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story was uneven, featuring a strong beginning and an engaging final act, but the middle dragged significantly, making it difficult to stay invested. While the writing was adequate, the book felt somewhat YA in tone, despite the characters being over 30 and the content not being PG.",
            "The story disappointingly glosses over key aspects, particularly character relationships, which should have been central to the narrative. As a result, I found it hard to connect with most characters, and emotional moments often fell flat. The main character's perspective, aside from one minor exception, was unengaging and lacked genuine motivation. While there were hints of potential, the book felt too brief to fully explore these elements. Additionally, the heavy focus on romance, which includes themes of lust, pining, uncomfortable discussions, and explicit scenes, did not resonate with me. While these elements may appeal to fans of spicy romance, they felt excessive and detracted from the overall story.",

I was excited to read a short standalone with dragons after finishing the massive *Oathbringer*. However, I should have checked the book’s content first, as it didn’t align with my preferences.  \n\n- **Romance and Themes:**  \n  The book is heavily romance-based, which isn’t to my taste. It includes elements of lust, pining, uncomfortable discussions, and explicit scenes. While these might be tame for fans of spicy romance, they felt excessive and unnecessary to me, taking up too much space in the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Many aspects, including character relationships, were glossed over, which was disappointing since they should have been a central focus. As a result, I wasn’t invested in most of the characters, and emotional moments often fell flat. The main character’s POV (with only one small exception) was uninteresting, uninvolved, and lacked real motivation. There were glimpses of potential, but the book felt too short to properly develop these elements.  \n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**  \n  The pacing was inconsistent, with a strong beginning and an engaging final act, but a sluggish middle that I struggled to get through. The writing was just fine, though the book felt somewhat YA despite the characters being 30+ and the content not being PG.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Representation:**  \n  The worldbuilding was intriguing but felt underutilized and wasted in this story. I did appreciate the representation, though the concept of rings showing sexual preferences was unsettling to me personally.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book falls somewhere in the middle for me.

            "Despite its length, the book maintains excellent pacing and presents a clear, engaging story. The author masterfully combines what could have been a series of separate tales into a cohesive narrative, avoiding the confusion of too many names or locations. Anahrod, presumed dead for 15 years, is unexpectedly found alive by a malevolent dragon ruler. When the wrong individuals are blamed for her survival, she is kidnapped from her jungle home filled with monsters. The narrative unfolds like a heist novel featuring dragons, showcasing unique bonds between dragons and humans, clever twists, and humorous moments. The plot is rich with thrilling adventures that kept me captivated from start to finish.",
            "The characters, particularly the heroine with her haunting origin story, are well-developed and feel authentic. The teacher at the magical dragon rider school, reminiscent of Snape, stands out as a memorable figure. The characters' flaws and challenges make them relatable and believable. The book also features diverse representation, addressing disability, mental health, and various genders and sexualities. While this inclusivity is commendable, some moments felt forced and confusing, momentarily pulling me out of the narrative. The romantic relationships are not a strong point, but since they are not central to the plot, they did not significantly detract from my overall enjoyment.",

The incorporation of various dragons, magical abilities, and other fantastical creatures enriches the narrative. Notably, the flying ships and the magical dragon rider school stand out as memorable features."

While most of the book is tame, there’s one scene in the second half that might make you cringe out of your skin.  \n  - The pacing is uneven. The story feels directionless for a long while, and some parts feel random until everything pays off in the last 25%.  \n  - The main romance suffers due to pacing issues. For 70% of the novel, it’s unclear who is involved in the romance with the main character. The flirting is mentioned but rarely shown, and the characters’ relationship development feels abrupt and unresolved.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - I’ll be looking forward to whatever Jenn Lyons writes next.  \n  - I would advise trying *Chorus of Dragons* as a first read for this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the book for its strong cast, intriguing worldbuilding, and engaging final act, the inconsistent spice level and uneven pacing—particularly in the romance—prevented it from being a 5-star read for me.

            "The story starts with uneven pacing, quickly jumping between multiple locations, which hinders immersion and connection with the characters. However, as the narrative unfolds, the pacing stabilizes and the world-building deepens, resulting in a more smooth and engaging reading experience.",
            "In the first half of the novel, I struggled to connect with the main characters, largely due to the swift introduction of three distinct locations within the first hundred pages. This made it difficult to form a strong bond early on. However, by Part 3, the pacing improved, and the world-building became more cohesive, allowing for greater engagement with the characters. The found family and ragtag crew trope in the main storyline was particularly enjoyable and added depth to the narrative.",
            "This novel offers a truly unique take on the fantasy genre, unlike anything I've encountered before. It is set in a world where dragons are revered as god-like beings, and humans serve as their bonded protectors to prevent the dragons from descending into madness and violence. I especially appreciated this fresh twist on the dragon-rider trope, as it focuses on servitude rather than affection. Furthermore, the concept of \"garden rings\" to signify characters’ pronouns and sexual preferences enriches the intricate society Lyon has crafted."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Sky on Fire* is a highly original and engaging fantasy novel with a unique take on dragon lore and a richly detailed society. While the character development and pacing had some initial challenges, the story found its footing by the second half, delivering a satisfying and immersive experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the found family dynamic and look forward to continuing the story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Originality and World-Building:**  \n  The novel is a very unique fantasy story, unlike anything I’ve read before. It centers around a world where dragons are seen as god-like creatures, and humans are bonded to them as servants to prevent the dragons from going crazy and killing. I particularly liked this twist on the dragon-rider trope, as it emphasizes servitude rather than affection, which is a refreshing change. Additionally, the use of “garden rings” to indicate characters’ pronouns and sexual preferences added a fascinating layer to the society Lyon created.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  In the first half of the novel, I found it challenging to connect with the main cast of characters. This was partly due to the rapid introduction of three separate locations within the first hundred pages, which made it hard to establish a strong connection early on. However, by Part 3, the pacing improved, and the world-building became more cohesive, making it easier to engage with the characters. The found family/ragtag crew trope in the main storyline was thoroughly enjoyable and added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt uneven in the beginning, with the story jumping between multiple locations quickly. This made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the world and connect with the characters. However, as the story progressed, the pacing stabilized, and the world-building became more detailed, allowing for a smoother reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Sky on Fire* is a highly original and engaging fantasy novel with a unique take on dragon lore and a richly detailed society. While the character development and pacing had some initial challenges, the story found its footing by the second half, delivering a satisfying and immersive experience.

However, while the team faces various obstacles that challenge their goals or force them to change direction, some solutions feel overly convenient, suggesting they were planned beforehand despite being unpredictable.",
            "Anahrod embodies the spirit of perseverance, refusing to succumb to adversity. In contrast, 15-year-old Gwyndinion's immature behavior and language often make him appear more like a 10-year-old, complicating the portrayal of his teenage years. While the romance is subtle and functions as a secondary subplot, it does help fuel the motivations of certain characters, influencing their loyalty and determination to endure.",
            "In this queer-normative world, dragon politics dominate, with dragons clearly ruling over humans. Both dragons and their riders, along with a select group of trained individuals like sorcerers, wield magic. The Deep evokes a sense of our own world in its more natural form, while Skyland represents an advanced society that has evolved from contemporary civilization."

Dragons possess magic, as do their riders and some other trained individuals, such as sorcerers. The \"Deep\" feels like our own world in its more natural state, while the \"Skyland\" area resembles an advanced society that evolved from the modern world.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The narrative begins at a brisk pace and never truly slows down. The shorter chapters, as well as the longer ones, move quickly due to the abundance of action and dialogue.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Anahrod is the epitome of a survivor who stops at nothing to persevere. Gwyndinion, however, is portrayed as 15 years old, but his behavior and language often make him seem closer to 10, making it difficult to picture him as a teenager.\n\n- **Romance and Subplots:**  \n  Romance is very light and serves as a slight subplot, though it does act as a minor driving force for some characters' motivations to persevere and maintain loyalty.\n\n- **Plot Conveniences:**  \n  While several obstacles block the team from their goals or force them to alter their course, many solutions seem overly convenient, as if they were planned ahead when they could not have been foreseen.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun heist novel involving dragons and a ragtag team of unlikely allies.

Lyons creates an imaginative and unique world system, both above and below, with standout elements like the ring system for designating individual preferences.  \n\n- **Magic System and Dragon Powers:**  \n  The magic system is well-crafted, and the unique powers possessed by different dragons add depth and intrigue to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  While the pacing starts slow due to the heavy focus on world-building, it picks up significantly once the world is established, maintaining interest throughout.  \n\n- **Plot and Heist Elements:**  \n  The heist elements, from planning to execution and adapting to unexpected outcomes, are engaging and well-executed. The story is filled with plot twists, world-changing revelations, and betrayals that keep the reader hooked.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Tropes:**  \n  The found family trope is effectively portrayed, showing the evolution from unlikely allies to family. The enemies-to-lovers trope is also well-executed, adding emotional depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook narration by Lauren Fortgang is exceptional. Fortgang excels at conveying the anxiety and tension inherent in high-stakes novels, making the audiobook a highly recommended format for experiencing the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Sky on Fire* is a richly crafted epic fantasy with a unique world, compelling magic system, and engaging heist elements. The pacing, while slow initially, builds momentum, and the well-executed tropes and audiobook narration enhance the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n✨✨ (Note: The review does not explicitly provide a numerical rating, but the enthusiastic tone and high praise suggest a positive rating.)"

It is never frowned upon or questioned if someone is trans, gay, or anything that isn’t considered “normal” in the real world. There are even rings that people wear to communicate their interests and share a bit about themselves.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is a fantastic ride with amazing foreshadowing and twists throughout.

However, since this is a standalone book and not a 400+ page series, some elements, like the development of trust between characters, feel rushed.  \n\n- **Standalone vs. Series:**  \n  Despite the rushed elements, I don’t wish for a second book. This is a fantastic standalone, and I would prefer another book set in this world rather than a series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a 5/5 book that delivers a unique and thrilling story with excellent LGBTQ+ representation.

The wealthy students, accompanied by their retinues, add a layer of social complexity. Notably, the dragons are adults at the time of bonding, choosing riders to prevent going rampant, which challenges conventional dragonrider dynamics.

The repeated reference to 100 years was unclear—was it about the duration of a dragon's sleep or how long it took for people to forget their past?

The book had so many twists and turns, and while a very few of them were predictable, they were all enjoyable and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.  \n\n- **Storytelling Structure and Writing Style:**  \n  I loved the structure of the storytelling, and the writing was fun and engaging.  \n\n- **Timing and Clarity:**  \n  There was some weakness in the sense of timing for me, which led to confusion. The repeated mention of \"100 years\" was unclear—I wasn’t sure if it referred to how long a dragon slept or how long it took for people to forget what they used to have. This was a flaw in the storytelling, especially since dragon riders and dragons were supposed to have such long lives. It seemed more plausible for some of these events to have taken place over a thousand years rather than just a hundred.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some confusion with the timeline, this book was really fun and kept me thoroughly engaged from start to finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n🥰 (Positive sentiment, though no specific numerical rating is provided.)"

(Probably because I listened to Black Veil Brides while reading this.)\n\n- **Plot and Detail:**  \n  I felt like something was missing, and it was a detailed description of the threesome between Anahrod, Ris, and Sicaryon.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book highly enjoyable and immersive, with strong character dynamics and representation. However, I felt the plot could have included more detailed moments, particularly in certain key scenes.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The wide variety of identities and relationship setups was a highlight for me.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  As a standalone epic fantasy, the pacing felt a bit off. It started slow but picked up significantly in the second half. I would have appreciated a bit more world-building, especially regarding the societal structure.\n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The characters and their interactions felt natural and well-developed throughout the story. Their growth was compelling and added depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  While I enjoyed the romance overall, there was one scene that felt out of tone with the rest of the book. It was a minor gripe but stood out to me.\n\n- **Dragons and World-Building:**  \n  The dragons were a standout element for me. Their interactions and characterizations were well-executed and added a lot to the story.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  I listened to the audiobook and thought the narrator did an excellent job. The unique names and spellings of characters might have been challenging to follow in print, but the narration made it easier to keep track of everyone.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was an easy five-star read for me.

Despite her villainous reputation, she had no idea what she was doing, which was such a mood.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was incredible! There was a moment where I thought, “Ugh, why does she always have to choose?” but then the book subverted expectations, and I was living for it.

It added a layer of unpredictability and excitement to the story.  \n\n- **Critiques:**  \n  My only issue was a few inconsistencies in the narrative. For example, Anahrod mentioned that dragons could see through walls, making her unsafe, but later, the crew and Anahrod were upset at Ris for not mentioning this fact, even though Anahrod already knew. These small contradictions occurred a few times throughout the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really loved this book and will definitely be reading more of Jenn Lyon’s work. It was a brilliant, engaging, and vividly crafted story with memorable characters and a refreshing take on romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This might be due to the oversaturated fantasy market, which has made many recent releases feel disappointing.\n\n- **Appeal to Specific Audience:**  \n  Fans of Dungeons & Dragons would likely enjoy this book. It features a flawed but likable main character who is universally hated and feared due to a dragon’s influence.

With elements like a heist, rampaging dragons, and side quests, the narrative feels like a trilogy condensed into a single book.",

It takes a few pages to get used to her rhythm, but once you focus on Anahrod as the main character, everything clicks. She maintains perfect control over the plot, addressing all questions and closing every loose end.\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story is divided into ten parts, each packed with intrigue, high stakes, and shifting goals. The characters are constantly resolving life-or-death situations, and their plans are far from flawless, which adds to the fun. The plot includes a heist, berserk dragons, and side quests, making it feel like a trilogy in one book.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The cast is large and diverse, with short chapters offering different points of view. Anahrod stands out as the top main character, and her journey, such as facing her fear of heights, leaves a lasting impression. The characters are confident, engaging, and drive the story forward.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The world is richly detailed and modern, not just in dialogue but also in its way of thinking. Unique elements like the ring system, which indicates social status and sexual preferences, add depth. The settings are diverse and memorable, with dragons and other massive creatures making their presence felt in every scene.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book balances high stakes with humor and a hint of modern ideals. While there’s a bit of heat, the focus isn’t on romance. It’s an entertaining, fast-paced adventure that keeps you hooked from start to finish.\n\n- **Reader's Emotional Connection:**  \n  I will miss these characters terribly if this is truly a standalone. I hope it’s a pilot for a new series because I’m fully invested. The book left me with so many favorite scenes that it felt like I’d read a trilogy.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJenn Lyons delivers a standalone fantasy novel that is action-packed, humorous, and richly layered.

The heist in the middle of the book was engaging, and I enjoyed seeing what happened afterward.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  There was no significant romance in the story.

However, it might appeal to readers who prefer a focus on plot over romance, especially when compared to *Fourth Wing*.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The hint of her connection to Gwydinion early on diminished any potential twist. **Ris:** Although she is portrayed as smart and attractive, her character lacks depth, and her relationship with Anahrod feels superficial, based primarily on physical attraction. **Gwydinion:** His significance comes across as rushed, and his friendship with the crew feels forced, making him less memorable compared to characters from *A Chorus of Dragons*. **Sicaryon:** He is primarily characterized by his attractiveness, lacking a distinct personality, and his ideals are presented in a heavy-handed manner rather than being subtly explored. **Jaemeh:** His betrayal is predictable, yet I found myself feeling sympathy for him, though his ending was ultimately unsatisfying. **Claw, Kaibren, and Naeron:** They were adequate but left no lasting impression. The romance between Ris and Anahrod felt superficial, focused more on physical attraction than emotional connection, and Sicaryon’s role in the dynamic added little value. While I appreciated the commitment to polyamory, it was not executed effectively.",

However, I was deeply disappointed. The first 100 pages were a struggle, and the rest of the book didn’t improve. It lacked the spark and depth I expected from the author.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding felt rushed and relied heavily on infodumping. While the concept of the rings was interesting, it seemed unrealistic for a society to be so universally tolerant. Additionally, the lack of a guide for terms like \"garden things\" made it confusing to follow.\n\n- **Prose and Humor:**  \n  The prose didn’t resonate with me as much as in *A Chorus of Dragons*. The humor fell flat, possibly due to the first-person perspective of Khirin or Anahrod’s older, less relatable snark. The writing lacked the charm that drew me into her previous series.\n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The plot felt disjointed and all over the place. Scenes jumped abruptly from the jungle to the sky, to a school, and to a heist, without smooth transitions. The heist itself was underwhelming, and the plot twist was predictable due to excessive foreshadowing.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - **Anahrod:** I struggled to connect with her. She felt distant, and her motivations weren’t compelling. Her connection to Gwydinion didn’t feel like a twist because it was hinted at early on.  \n  - **Ris:** While she was portrayed as smart and sexy, her character lacked depth. Her relationship with Anahrod felt shallow, based solely on physical attraction.  \n  - **Gwydinion:** His importance felt rushed, and his friendship with the crew seemed forced. He didn’t stand out compared to characters from *A Chorus of Dragons*.  \n  - **Sicaryon:** He was reduced to being \"sexy\" without much personality. His ideals felt heavy-handed rather than subtly explored.  \n  - **Jaemeh:** His betrayal was predictable, but I oddly felt bad for him. His ending was unsatisfying.  \n  - **Claw, Kaibren, and Naeron:** They were fine but didn’t leave a lasting impression.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance between Ris and Anahrod felt superficial, based more on physical attraction than emotional connection. Sicaryon’s inclusion in the dynamic added little value. I appreciated the commitment to polyamory, but it wasn’t executed well.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The pacing dragged, especially toward the end. I didn’t care about the characters or their fates, which made the high-stakes moments fall flat. The book failed to draw me in or leave a lasting impact.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell short of my expectations. While it had some interesting ideas, the execution was lacking in worldbuilding, character development, and plot structure. The humor and prose didn’t resonate, and the romance felt shallow. Overall, it was a disappointing read compared to Jenn Lyons’ previous work. I’ll be revisiting *A Chorus of Dragons* to remind myself of her storytelling potential.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned, but the tone suggests a low rating, possibly 2/5 or 3/5."

Instead of dragons serving humans or being equals, the dragons are overlords who use humans to prevent their own corruption. This was a fresh and intriguing concept. The lore about the dragons and the magic system were also compelling, though I wish the magic system had been explained earlier in the story.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The sibling dynamic between the protagonist, Anahrod, and her long-lost brother, Gwydinion, was a highlight. Gwydinion was a sunshine character—positive, intelligent, and brave, though a bit naive. His occasional ruthlessness added depth.

While some readers might enjoy it, it didn’t align with the tone of the story for me. On the other hand, the audiobook narration was fantastic and highly recommended.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n  The story explored themes of abuse and resilience, particularly through characters like Jaemeh. While I felt sad about his fate, I understood the narrative choice. The book also left room for potential future stories in this world, which I found exciting.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some issues with character relationships and pacing, I genuinely enjoyed this novel.

I was thrilled to see she released a standalone fantasy book this summer, as it seemed like a great way to get familiar with her work without committing to a series.\n  - The book’s cover is excellent—eye-catching at first glance, with intricate details of the castle and city that become more noticeable the longer you look. Kudos to the artist!\n\n- **World-Building:**\n  - The world-building is a standout strength. I loved how the author flipped the “dragon rider” trope on its head, creating a society where dragons are the dominant members instead of humans. This was a refreshing take on a popular SFF trope.\n  - The world feels expansive and lived-in, with the story taking us to numerous locations. While it sometimes felt overwhelming for a standalone book, it also made the world intriguing and worth exploring.\n\n- **Characters:**\n  - The characters were a major letdown. There were simply too many of them, with new ones introduced well past the point of reason. This overcrowding made it hard to connect with any of them.\n  - The love triangle, which later shifted into a polycule, didn’t work for me. I’m not a fan of polycule romances, and the lack of chemistry between the characters made the romance feel flat and, at times, cringe-y.\n  - The characters themselves felt underdeveloped, each defined by only one or two traits with little depth or growth throughout the story.\n\n- **Potential and Overall Impression:**\n  - Despite its flaws, the book shows potential. The author’s strengths in world-building and creative concepts could shine even brighter in a longer format or series.\n  - While I didn’t love this book, I’m still intrigued to check out the author’s other work, particularly her “Chorus of Dragons” series.\n  - For fantasy readers who enjoy polycule romances, this might be worth a read, but overall, it fell a bit flat for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis standalone fantasy novel has a lot of potential, particularly in its world-building and creative twists on popular tropes.

The side characters, including the dragons, are distinct and well-developed, and I found myself enjoying them by the end. The romance is subtle, with Anahrod caught between a long-time acquaintance and a sassy female dragon rider, but the relationships lack depth and justification beyond physical attraction.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The novel is action-packed with an intricate plot, but it moves at a relentless pace, akin to a Michael Bay movie.  \n  - The story could benefit from editing to trim down sections and allow room for breathing space.  \n  - The plot rewards persistence, with great reveals and a satisfying pull-together by the middle point.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The characters are highly nuanced and adult, avoiding overidealized teen tropes.  \n  - Anahrod, the protagonist, is snarky and capable, but it was hard to fully appreciate or root for her, especially with her troll identity evoking Shrek/Fiona imagery.  \n  - The side characters, including the dragons, are distinct and well-developed, and I grew to enjoy them by the end.  \n  - The romance is underplayed, with Anahrod torn between a long-time acquaintance and a sassy female dragon rider, but the relationships lack depth and justification beyond physical attraction.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  - The dragon-rider relationship is complex and intriguing, but dragons are introduced late in the story, which may disappoint readers expecting them sooner.  \n  - The book includes subtle BDSM undertones, though they are implied rather than explicit.  \n\n- **Narration (Audio Version):**  \n  - The narrator did a solid job, giving unique voices to the many characters, which made it easier to distinguish them in the audio version.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel is action-packed and features nuanced characters, its relentless pacing and late introduction of dragons may deter some readers. The romance lacks depth, and Anahrod’s troll identity felt cartoony at times. However, the story rewards persistence with satisfying reveals and well-developed side characters. The audio narration enhances the experience, making it easier to follow the diverse cast.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The plot is engaging and features well-executed twists, though they may not be particularly surprising. However, the author’s reluctance to fully develop key action sequences is disappointing. Several potential battles and intense moments are glossed over, resulting in a lack of detail and impact.",
            "The interactions among the dysfunctional found family are a standout feature, showcasing witty banter, sarcastic humor, sibling-like squabbles, and heartwarming flirtation. The tension and connection within the developing throuple are skillfully depicted, even in the absence of explicit spice. The novel shines in its LGBTQIA+ representation, ensuring that no character is misrepresented, even by their adversaries. The portrayal of transgender identities, including the concept of \"late-blooming\" gender, is approached with both sensitivity and creativity.",
            "The novel excels in its detailed worldbuilding and dragon lore, introduced gradually to prevent overwhelming the reader. The integration of a queer-normative culture, BIPOC Skylander society, and disability representation is seamless. Notably, the concept of garden rings—using coded flowers and leaves to signify gender identity, sexuality, and preferences—is both poetic and innovative."

The queer-normative culture, BIPOC Skylander society, and disability representation are flawlessly integrated. The garden rings concept, which uses coded flowers and leaves to indicate gender identity, sexuality, and preferences, is particularly poetic and innovative.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The interactions between the dysfunctional found family members are a highlight, featuring witty banter, sarcastic humor, sibling-like squabbles, and heartwarming flirting. The tension and connection within the developing throuple are well-portrayed, even though there isn’t explicit spice.  \n\n- **Dragon Depiction:**  \n  The dragons are intimidating, especially when they go rampant (a berserker-like, murderous rage). The mystery surrounding the frequency of rampancy adds intrigue. The portrayal of dragons as superior in class and status, yet often abusive toward their dragonriders, offers a refreshing twist on a classic trope.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is engaging, with well-delivered twists, though they aren’t particularly surprising. However, the author’s hesitation to fully develop certain action sequences is disappointing. Several potential battle or intense action scenes are written off as uneventful, lacking detail and impact.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  The novel excels in LGBTQIA+ representation, with no character ever being mislabeled, even by their enemies. The inclusion of transgender identities, such as the concept of a “late-blooming” gender, is handled with sensitivity and creativity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a fun and engaging read with strong worldbuilding, inclusive representation, and compelling character dynamics.

            "The book's queernormativity is thoughtfully crafted, yet it feels so organic that it doesn't significantly influence the narrative. While the central relationship is distinctly queer, I wouldn't recommend it as a representation of queer experiences, as it doesn't engage with real-world queer issues. The portrayal of transgender individuals is intriguing; society uses rings to denote gender and sexuality, and magical inscriptions enable instant gender reassignment. Some readers may see this world as an ideal, while others might find its simplicity off-putting. The book prompts important questions about whether a highly queernormative setting equates to effective queer representation, making it a valuable starting point for discussion.",
            "This book is a delightful read, brimming with modern flair. It boasts vibrant characters, a rapid pace, and clever plot twists, all set in an intriguing, technologically advanced world. As a fantasy enthusiast who adores dragons, I found it thoroughly engaging. The crew dynamics evoke a sense of camaraderie reminiscent of *Mistborn*, while the bright, cartoonish setting exceeded my expectations. The pacing is spot-on, leading to a satisfying conclusion.",
            "This book is marketed as romantasy, but it aligns more closely with epic fantasy. Unlike authors such as Sarah J. Maas and Rebecca Yarros, who often rely on shock value stemming from their protagonists' desires, the author's portrayal feels more natural and normative. The expressions of desire here lack the overt frustration that characterizes Maas and Yarros's writing. Lyons maintains her signature style, and new readers will likely appreciate her candid and authentic approach to these scenes."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a fun, modern epic fantasy with vibrant characters, a fast-paced plot, and a technologically advanced world. While it doesn’t deliver on the romantasy promise, it excels in its queernormative approach, though its representation may not resonate with everyone. Despite some marketing missteps, it’s a compelling and enjoyable read.",

Maas and Rebecca Yarros, whose works thrive on the shock value of their protagonists' horniness, Jenn Lyons's approach feels natural and normative.  \n  - The horniness in this book lacks the unshameless frustration that makes Maas and Yarros's writing effective.  \n  - Lyons's style is consistent with her previous series, *A Chorus of Dragons*, and new readers will likely notice her shameless, natural approach to writing such scenes.  \n\n- **Queernormativity and Representation:**  \n  - The queernormativity in the book is well thought out but feels so natural that it doesn’t significantly impact the story.  \n  - While the central relationship is very queer, I wouldn’t recommend this book as \"queer rep\" because it doesn’t relate to real-world queer issues.  \n  - The portrayal of transgender people is interesting: society uses rings to signify gender and sexuality, and magical inscriptions allow instant gender reassignment.  \n  - Some may view this world as a dream, while others might find the ease of it all insulting.  \n  - The book raises questions about whether an incredibly queernormative world constitutes good queer representation, making it a good starting point for discussion.  \n\n- **Comparison and Marketing:**  \n  - The book feels like a loose take on *Fourth Wing* but is better in my opinion.  \n  - The marketing as romantasy seems like an attempt by Tor/MacMillan to make the book go viral, which I don’t think will happen.  \n  - Despite this, the book is good, interesting, and addictive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a fun, modern epic fantasy with vibrant characters, a fast-paced plot, and a technologically advanced world.

            "The first 70% of the book was a struggle, but the final 30% was fantastic. The story follows Anahrod, a demonized female main character who survives a death sentence and is later recruited for an impossible heist involving dragons and sky cities. However, the narrative is bogged down by an overload of plots, subplots, and obstacles, making it feel overwhelming for a standalone novel. While the worldbuilding is intriguing, it often feels excessive, and the pacing is inconsistent. Expanding the story into a duology or trilogy could provide the necessary space for clearer direction, steadier pacing, and more developed characters and relationships.",
            "Anahrod's intriguing background contrasts with her somewhat bland personality, as she often feels swept along by the plot. In contrast, the secondary characters, particularly the heist team, are well-developed, distinctive, and engaging, with Sicaryon emerging as a standout favorite. However, the romance is underdeveloped and feels more like a tease, leaving me wanting more.",

Ris, Anahrod, and Sicaryon are all flirty and traumatized, while Gwydinion adds a slight twist as flirty but not traumatized. Their motivations remain largely unclear, with only Ris, who isn't the main character, having any depth.

Ris is flirty and traumatized, Anahrod is flirty and traumatized, Sicaryon is flirty and traumatized, and Gwydinion is flirty and not traumatized, adding a little variety. Their motivations are unclear, except for Ris, who is not the main character. The romance is poorly executed, with the protagonist and a side character trying to get together from the moment they meet. The \"garden rings\" concept, where characters advertise their kinks with ring symbolism, feels outdated and gimmicky.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot never stops, which is a good thing because the characters would likely grind to a halt otherwise. The story involves a heist that evolves into a deeper exploration of the magic system and politics. However, the pacing feels forced, as if the characters are being herded through plot points without room for meaningful role-play or development.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is extensive and detailed, with a deep magic system, intricate politics, and complex human-dragon relationship dynamics. The societal and social situations are well-crafted, and the book feels designed to be a trilogy. However, the characters are not strong enough to sustain a series, making the depth of the world-building feel somewhat wasted.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Jenn Lyons’s writing style is enthusiastic and detailed, with a focus on lore and world-building. However, it lacks the flexibility to allow characters to develop organically, resulting in a narrative that feels overly controlled and rigid.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excels in world-building and plot complexity, it falls short in character development and romance. The characters are one-dimensional, and their motivations remain unclear. The pacing keeps the story moving, but the lack of meaningful character interactions makes the narrative feel forced.

Frankly, it could have been about anything, and I would have picked it up based on the cover alone. Kudos to the cover artist—they’ve more than earned their fee on this one.  \n\n- **Premise and Inspiration:**  \n  I was pleasantly surprised to hear that *The Sky On Fire* was a mashup of *Dragonriders of Pern* and *Six of Crows*, two books/series I enjoy very much. The dragon/rider partnership was subverted from a (mostly positive) symbiotic relationship to a (mostly negative) master/servant dynamic, which I found intriguing and original.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Jemaeh’s ongoing emotional and mental abuse by his dragon, Tiendremos, was surprising and made for a very unique experience. Anahrod was a great character, and I enjoyed the crew a lot, particularly Naeron and Ris’ golden dragon, Peralon.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  I both enjoyed and disliked the pacing. On one hand, the brisk pace suited the heist novel format, keeping things moving and avoiding boredom. On the other hand, the breakneck speed scuttled deeper character-building and world-building details. For example, introducing new characters each chapter made it challenging to keep up with them all.  \n\n- **World-Building and Dragon Lore:**  \n  I was very interested in the bonding process between dragons and humans and wanted more dragon-related details.

            "The story centers on Anahrod, who was thought to be dead but has been living in a jungle-like environment known as the Deep. She is kidnapped by a ragtag group and reluctantly agrees to help them rob a fearsome dragon queen's hoard. This leads to thrilling and perilous encounters, forcing Anahrod and her companions to confront their secrets for survival. While the premise is captivating, much of the dragon-related action occurs late in the narrative, resulting in uneven pacing. The beginning is particularly challenging due to an overwhelming introduction of names and places, making it difficult to grasp the setting and characters until midway through the book. Although the ending offers some redemption, the overall pacing could have been significantly improved.",
            "The characters are humorous and snarky, but I struggled to form an emotional connection with them. The large cast made it difficult to keep track of everyone; a smaller, more focused group with deeper development would have been more effective. Although the characters are in their mid-20s to 30s, they often come across as teenagers. Ironically, my favorite character was Gwyndion, the one actual teenager.",
            "The world-building is impressive, though a map would have enhanced the visualization of the setting. The Deep evokes a jungle atmosphere, and the idea of dragons controlling riders adds intriguing depth. However, the book's beginning is overwhelming due to an excessive number of names, with some, like Jaemeh, feeling overly complicated and nearly causing me to stop reading.",

By the first 15 percent, I still hadn’t learned anything meaningful about the characters, their motivations, or their feelings beyond what was mentioned in conversations. The heist plot was only introduced around 30 percent through, and the action related to it didn’t occur until closer to 70 percent. The resolution near the end felt rushed, moving much too quickly compared to the rest of the book. I think the book would benefit from heavy editing to tighten the pace and plot.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding related to the setting is quite strong at the beginning, providing a solid visual backdrop. However, the worldbuilding for other elements was lacking, which made the overall world feel underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were weak, with extremely light development. This made it almost impossible to distinguish between the secondary characters or to care about the extensive dialogue and interactions.  \n\n- **Concept and Themes:**  \n  I enjoyed the dragons and the concept of dragon riders, which was fun to read. It was refreshing to see dragons portrayed as powerful beings who generally rule even the human world. However, this concept wasn’t utilized as strongly as it could have been.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis YA fantasy had a few decent aspects, such as the initial worldbuilding and the concept of dragons, but it was mostly underwhelming due to its slow pacing, weak character development, and underutilized themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nMy thanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for allowing me to read this work, which will be published July 9.

            "The pacing of the book felt overwhelming at times. It begins with immediate action, but the swift transitions between political drama, jungle adventure, heists, a flying ship crew, and intense romance left me feeling disoriented. I found myself needing to reread sections to fully grasp the story. I wish the book were longer, as it would benefit from more character development and slower-paced moments to allow for deeper engagement.",

            "This story blends elements reminiscent of *Six of Crows* and *The Hobbit*, yet it stands out as a unique creation. I appreciated its themes of found family, diverse relationship dynamics, and sharp, witty banter.",

I loved the themes of found family, unique sexual/relationship dynamics, and witty banter.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was exceptionally well done. The vivid imagery made me feel like I could smell the bog, see Crystalspire, and hear its sounds. It’s impressive how Lyons achieved this in a standalone book without resorting to info-dumping.  \n\n- **Dragon Concept:**  \n  The unique twist on dragons was a standout element. Dragons manipulating and controlling humans, each with distinct powers (from breathing acid to ice), was fascinating and refreshing.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was a bit overwhelming for me. While the book starts with immediate action, the rapid shifts between political drama, jungle adventure, heist, flying ship crew, and intense romance gave me whiplash. I had to reread sections to keep up. I wish the book was longer to allow for more character development and slower-paced moments to breathe.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship dynamic was unique but didn’t fully resonate with me. The throuple aspect felt like insta-love, and I wanted more development or a deeper discussion around the relationship dynamics.  \n\n- **Plot and Entertainment Value:**  \n  Despite the pacing issues, the book was highly entertaining. The plot twists and reveals were satisfying, and I was particularly invested in the dragon-rider relationships.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Sky on Fire* is a standalone fantasy novel packed with action, unique world-building, and a found family theme.

            "The plot was engaging, but the heist dominated the narrative more than I would have liked. While the overall story and content were strong, the pacing could use some improvement.",
            "Anahrod’s bisexuality was a refreshing and well-executed element of the story. Gwydinion and the gay dragon couple, Peralon and Ivarion, emerged as standout characters. However, Kaibren and Naeron felt underdeveloped; Kaibren was reduced to a plot device, speaking solely in flowery quotes from fictional plays, while Naeron came across as one-dimensional, often just saying “no” and grappling with PTSD. Additionally, Sicaryon’s hair design—bald except for a side braid—was somewhat off-putting.",
            "The book features some peculiar phrases, like calling an empty shot glass a “dead soldier” and describing Anahrod’s mom as “looking as though she had just swallowed raw fruit.” Additionally, the conversations often felt overly complex, with too many undertones that obscured the main points. This was my primary concern with the book.",
            "The worldbuilding in this story is exceptional, featuring vivid descriptions of various cities, the Deep, and cultural elements such as garden and social rings, vinegar water, dress styles, and cuisine. Although I wouldn't personally choose garden rings, I found their integration into the fantasy world intriguing. The dragon city, with its hoards and distinctive names, was especially captivating."

This was my biggest issue with the book.\n\n- **Accessibility:**  \n  The beginning was confusing and hard to get into.

It’s a great choice for readers who enjoy dragon fantasy novels, especially those interested in political intrigues involving dragons.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing of the story felt a little off.

However, I was deeply disappointed that I didn’t love this book as much as I had hoped.\n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  I struggled through the first 50% of the book. I listened to the first 20% at least three times, trying to determine if I was missing plot elements or if there were actual jumps in the narrative that made aspects of the plot feel rushed. The pacing felt uneven, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world is fascinating and queer-normative, featuring casual trans representation and a burgeoning polycule between three of the main characters. The various cultures and dragon overlords are intriguing. However, I think Lyons tried to include too much in this standalone, which worked better in her five-book series where she had more time to flesh out elements.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  What disappointed me most was how hard I found it to connect to the characters. While there were hints of the lovable and multidimensional characters I know Lyons can create, I never truly cared about any of them or their actions. This lack of emotional connection significantly impacted my enjoyment of the story.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Specific):**  \n  Lauren Fortgang’s narration is quite good. Those familiar with Lyons’ other work will recognize her from the last four *Chorus of Dragons* audiobooks. Her performance was a highlight of the experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a fascinating world and strong queer representation, it suffers from pacing issues, an overstuffed narrative, and a lack of emotional connection to the characters. Despite my high expectations, I found it difficult to fully engage with the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars (though it feels more like a 2 in reality)."

In this world, dragons see humans as slaves, pets, or mere tools to prevent them from going rampant. There are a few dragon riders, but being chosen as a rider means becoming a dragon’s slave for life. Not all dragons are self-serving, and Anahrod has the unique ability to connect with them through their minds. The magical virtues of some dragons added depth to the story.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Anahrod is a loner who prefers to keep to herself, but she’s drawn into a high-stakes adventure when a group needs her help to steal a dragon’s hoard. The oddball characters come together to form a team, and their banter keeps the story lively and engaging. The friendships and dynamics between the characters were well-developed, though there were moments when I felt a slight disconnect with the story’s purpose, possibly due to switching between e-book and audio formats.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is packed with life-threatening moments and moves quickly through plotting, friendships, and new discoveries. The heist is the biggest anyone has seen, and the stakes are incredibly high, especially since the dragon involved would surely kill Anahrod if given the chance. The pacing kept me engaged, though the occasional disconnect made some parts feel less cohesive.\n\n- **Audio Performance (if applicable):**  \n  Lauren Fortgang did an excellent job narrating the audiobook. She skillfully alternated between the different characters and even the dragon voices, which effectively conveyed whether the dragons were friends or foes. Her performance added a great flow to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a thrilling and unique story with a fascinating premise, engaging characters, and high-stakes action. While there were moments of slight disconnect, the fast-paced plot and excellent audio performance made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars  \n\nThank you to Tor Books, NetGalley, and Macmillan Audio for the copies!"

            "The book starts strong but quickly loses momentum. The middle section drags, and the plot only gains traction halfway through. The ending feels rushed, leaving little room for a proper conclusion to this political dragon epic, with most of the action concentrated in the final third. The romance is a fade-to-black affair, with explicit scenes occurring only while characters are blackout drunk. A subplot involving side characters is abandoned during the climax, which was disappointing since I was invested in it. However, the last 7% of the book was quite engaging and slightly improved my overall rating. Ultimately, the payoff for the dragon storyline felt unsatisfying.",
            "The characters lacked chemistry, leaving me indifferent to their fates. The f/f/m polycule felt underdeveloped, and I found myself only invested in two dragons who appeared far too infrequently.",
            "The social rings were believable, but the garden rings stretched credibility. It’s hard to imagine people adhering to such a rigid system without enforcement. By the halfway point, the garden rings felt largely neglected, serving mainly to introduce one love interest's BDSM kink, which the author failed to develop. Additionally, specific magic introduced early on was forgotten until the very end, leaving a sense of inconsistency."

Jenn Lyons has won me over, and I’ll definitely be reading more of her work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 out of 5 Dragonstones"

            "This story features casual yet brilliant representation, particularly with the innovative use of garden rings to indicate pronouns and preferences. **Main Character (Arahrod):** Arahrod is a wonderfully complex protagonist with an original magical ability, and I found myself rooting for her throughout the narrative. **Secondary Characters:** The secondary characters, including Ris, Sicaryon, Claw, Kaibren, and Naeron, are well-developed and memorable. Even the villains are skillfully crafted, adding depth to the story.",

Given her traumatic history—betrayal, a brutal execution attempt, and years of exile—I anticipated a greater emotional complexity. Instead, she experiences instant attraction from others and forms quick attachments. While I enjoyed the dynamics within the group, I didn’t connect deeply enough with the characters to feel a strong emotional impact during key events.

Instead, everyone instantly falls in love with her (insta-lust), and she forms attachments just as quickly.  \n  - I enjoyed the dynamic of the little group but didn’t connect deeply enough with any of the characters to feel a strong emotional impact when events unfolded.  \n  - I particularly liked Overbite, who reminded me of a dog, so I naturally loved her.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  - The narrator did a fantastic job, and I appreciated the audiobook experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the novel enjoyable and gave it a solid 3.5 stars.

            "The book begins slowly, making it challenging to keep track of the characters and their roles in the first 70-80 pages. However, once past this initial section, the pacing accelerates dramatically, filled with unexpected twists and fast-paced action. Unfortunately, the ending feels rushed and incomplete. The climactic battle is abruptly concluded with a “fade to black” transition, and the epilogue lacks a sense of closure. Ultimately, the buildup of intrigue and tension resolves in a simplistic “and they lived happily ever after” conclusion.",
            "The characters were charming, showcasing engaging interactions and dynamics. Some, like Ris, Claw, the trans father, the genius mom, and the biological dad, had intriguing backstories that were hinted at but not fully explored. While most characters were over 30, their behavior often resembled that of early 20-somethings, creating a sense of inconsistency. The \"love story\" felt more like a casual connection than a romance; although there was flirting, a drunken encounter, and expressions of familial concern, it lacked genuine romantic depth. The inclusion of a fade-to-black threesome further distanced it from typical YA themes, yet the romantic elements remained underdeveloped.",
            "The world is vast and intriguing, filled with creative and unexpected situations. While the political elements are captivating, I wished for deeper exploration of them. The ring system is fascinating but lacks clarity regarding the types of rings, their associations, and the associated rituals. Overall, the world feels incomplete, with many characters and relationships remaining underdeveloped."

However, with only one book, it can be challenging to fully convey all the worldbuilding.

            "This stand-alone fantasy novel revolves around Anahrod, a survivor of execution who is recruited for a daring heist to steal a dragon's hoard. The narrative delves into the tensions between dragons, their riders, and human civilization, portraying dragons as formidable and destructive beings rather than mere pets.",
            "Anahrod is a compelling protagonist, though at times she feels younger than her 30 years. The other members of the heist group lack depth and memorability, with the exception of Gwyndinion, whose character development is a highlight of the story. However, the romance between Anahrod and Ris comes across as unconvincing and abrupt, falling into the \"instalove\" trope, which I found unappealing.",

The story also explores the conflict between dragons, their riders, and human civilization. The dragons are portrayed as powerful and destructive, not as cute pets.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While Anahrod is a compelling protagonist, she sometimes seemed younger than her supposed age of 30. The other members of the heist group didn’t feel fully developed or memorable, except for Gwyndinion, whose growth throughout the book was enjoyable to witness.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance between Anahrod and Ris felt unconvincing and abrupt, leaning into the trope of “instalove,” which I didn’t find appealing.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was a standout aspect of the novel.

            "The storyline was impressive, divided into substantial sections that clearly marked the emergence of major plot points. Although the beginning was somewhat slow, focusing on character introductions and plot setup, the buildup proved worthwhile, leading to relentless action, adventure, and dragons. A potential polyamorous relationship was subtly hinted at, feeling natural rather than forced.

The descriptions are lush, with creatures and people painted vividly, intertwined with the unique systems of their world. However, I still don’t fully understand the meaning of the social and garden rings, which people seem to pick at 15 years of age. There was no clear explanation, only hints, so perhaps I missed something.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The storyline was amazing, split into sizable parts that allowed a clear sense of where new major plot points were unfolding. While the beginning was a bit slower, focusing on plot setup and introducing the characters, the buildup was worth it as it led to non-stop action, adventure, and dragons.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Gwydinion grew on me a lot, with his mischievous mind always turning. I also loved Sicaryon and wished there was almost more of him.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  There was a hint of a potential growing poly relationship, which didn’t feel forced or sudden. While the attraction between Ris and Anahrod felt quite quick, the story wasn’t entirely clear on how much time passed between the start and end. It wasn’t quite insta-love nor a slow burn.  \n\n- **Standalone Potential:**  \n  I see this as a standalone novel, even though the ending opens up the possibility for a sequel if needed.  \n\n- **Author’s Other Works:**  \n  Since this was my first Jenn Lyons book, I look forward to reading her other works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an engaging and action-packed high-fantasy novel with rich world-building and memorable characters.

While it delivers on this promise, it falls short of being a stand-out and addicting fantasy book.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world itself is not necessarily complex, but it takes a long time to delve into the nitty-gritty of its landscape. A map would have been helpful, but it was not provided in the copy I received. The dragons and their dynamics aren’t introduced until much later in the book, and when they are, it feels rushed and like an attempt to fill in the story’s gaps.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot feels stalled for the first half of the book (which is extremely long for a 450-page novel) and lacks motivation. The pacing is awkward, though the story becomes more entertaining near the end.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I liked Anahrod’s character — she’s capable, gritty, and has flaws that make her a fantastic protagonist. However, some of the side characters are extremely forgettable and lack development.  \n\n- **Romance and Representation:**  \n  The romance aspects felt rushed and thrown together, which is disappointing considering the potential for sapphic and poly representation.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  The book feels like it’s trying to accomplish too much without ever focusing on and perfecting one aspect that could make it stand out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has an intriguing premise and becomes more engaging toward the end, it struggles with pacing, underdeveloped characters, and rushed world-building and romance. It’s entertaining but lacks the depth and polish needed to truly shine.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I’m definitely going to be buying a hardcover just so I can look at it on my bookshelf.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  I would classify this book as a fantasy romance but with much more emphasis on the fantasy than the romance. The romance is definitely there, but it’s a subplot rather than the main focus of the story. That being said, I love the romance that is there and both of the love interests. Also love the bisexual representation.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is really well done. The magic system is super interesting, as is the world in general. You get to see different parts of the world, different governments, and different races, all of which are unique and well-written.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  All of the side characters are really well fleshed out and interesting, especially the dragons. I liked that the main villain was a dragon and not a human, which I felt was unique in the genre. The human characters are all believably flawed, and there are some really good twists and betrayals.  \n\n- **Narration (Audio Version):**  \n  The narrator is great! Her male voices are believable, and the dragon voices are spot on. The sound quality is good and consistent.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential for Sequels:**  \n  Overall, I loved the book and would read more from the author in the future. The book was well done as a standalone while still leaving room at the end for more books in the same world, and I hope there will be more!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a well-crafted fantasy romance with strong world-building, compelling characters, and a unique twist on the genre.

It was a delightful surprise, especially since I was concurrently reading the first book of the Temeraire series, which had some nice parallels with this world where people bond with dragons.  \n\n- **World-Building and Dragon Lore:**  \n  The world-building in this novel is fantastic. The dragons in this story are unique—not all of them can talk, but the FMC (female main character) can hear them and persuade them, as well as other animals. The concept of bonding with dragons and the intricacies of their communication were well-executed.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was engaging and kept me hooked. The FMC gets roped into a scheme to steal something from the head dragon, allegedly because she’s done it before, which is why she was thought dead for years. Along the way, she discovers that her young charge is actually her brother, and they take him to dragon rider school to get closer to the big bad. The pacing was well-balanced, with twists like the big bad trying to kill the brother and the revelation that she’s been avoiding insanity by pouring her madness into a stone, which turns other dragons insane.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The FMC is a compelling character, and her journey was both emotional and thrilling. I particularly loved how she woke the sleeping Big Daddy Dragon, who ultimately sets everything right. Her growth throughout the story felt authentic, and her connection with the dragons was deeply moving.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The spicy throuple romance added an extra layer of intrigue and excitement to the story. It was well-integrated into the plot and didn’t feel forced or out of place.  \n\n- **Emotional Payoff:**  \n  The emotional payoff was satisfying, especially when the titan drake she had to abandon at the beginning of the book turned out to be alive and played a crucial role in the final act. It was a moment I cheered for, and it tied the story together beautifully.  \n\n- **Standalone vs. Series Potential:**  \n  I was so immersed in this world that I’m genuinely disappointed this won’t be the start of a series. The story felt complete, but the world and characters were so rich that I would have loved to explore more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a fantasy dragon book done right, especially after being disappointed by some recent dragon stories. The world-building, character development, and emotional depth were all top-notch. While I’m sad it’s not the start of a series, it stands strong as a standalone novel that I thoroughly enjoyed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars"

            "While the story features a heist, it is brief and not central to the main plot. The romance subplot introduces a poly throuple, which may not resonate with all readers. Additionally, the pacing is quite rapid, with swift transitions between events that can make the narrative feel rushed at times.",
            "While some characters could have been more developed, I found Gwydinion and Sicaryon particularly engaging. However, the main character, Anahrod, occasionally frustrated me. The story features suggestive language and one unexpectedly risqué conversation, but anything more intimate fades to black. The romance subplot is minimal and may not appeal to everyone, especially those who aren't fans of polyamorous relationships.",

The heist, writing, and original world-building kept me engaged, and I appreciate the author’s ability to create complex characters. While the book could have benefited from more space to explore its lore and character arcs, it remains a strong addition to a series I love.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

            "The main character, intended to be in her 30s, often comes across as more like a teenager or someone in her early 20s, which detracts from her characterization. In contrast, some background characters are well-developed and likable, and I appreciated their return at the end of the book. The romantic relationships felt rushed and somewhat unexpected, though this may be addressed in the final version. On a positive note, the book showcases a commendable diversity that adds depth and warmth to the story.",

While the abundance of characters and some underdeveloped world elements posed minor challenges, the plot resolved neatly, and the narration enhanced the experience. It’s a solid read, especially for fans of dragon-centric fantasy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice level: 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️ (4/4)  \n- Overall rating: 3.75 (rounded up to 4)"

This surprised me because strong, well-developed characters are one of the reasons I love the *Chorus of Dragons* series.  \n\n- **Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  I really enjoyed the dynamics between dragons and their riders and how these relationships played into the story.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The book is quite fast-paced, and I finished it in about 24 hours, which was much quicker than I expected. The *Chorus of Dragons* series is dense and took me about a month to read, so this was a pleasant change.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The book starts strong, and I was instantly intrigued, which kept the pages turning. However, there was a lot of buildup to events and plot twists, but when they occurred, they felt rushed and ended too quickly.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I enjoyed the book overall, but it felt underdeveloped. The dragons were, of course, the best part of the story, and I appreciated that there was a good amount of dragon content (a pet peeve of mine is dragon books that aren’t dragon-y enough).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Sky on Fire* didn’t quite live up to the *Chorus of Dragons* series for me, it was still an enjoyable read with brilliant world-building and engaging dragon-rider dynamics. However, the underdeveloped characters and rushed plot twists kept it from being a standout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐3.75/5 stars⭐"

            "The plot was complex and challenging to follow in audiobook format. Introducing the entire heist crew at once created confusion, and by the one-third mark, I could only recall the names of the female characters. One male character communicated in cryptic quotes that only another character could interpret, further complicating the narrative. I believe reading the physical book would have allowed me to revisit passages for clarity. Additionally, I felt no romantic connection or chemistry between Anarod and Ris, despite frequent references to their relationship. This lack of believability became frustrating, especially given Anarod's interest in Ris after his kidnapping.",

Introducing the main heist crew all at once made it confusing, and by 33% of the way through, I could only remember the female characters' names. One male character spoke in cryptic quotes that only another character could decipher, which added to the confusion. I believe reading the physical book would have allowed me to reread passages for better understanding.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is very interesting, with distinct settings like the skylands (home to dragons and \"normal\" society) and the deeps (a dangerous chasm filled with monsters and swamps). The use of rings to signify gender preference and jobs was intriguing, though I personally wouldn’t want to share that much information with the world.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The author did a great job of including LGBTQ+ representation in a way that felt unique to this world. The diverse characters and themes added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  I felt no romantic connection or chemistry between Anarod and Ris, despite the constant mentions of their relationship. It became annoying, especially since Anarod’s interest in Ris felt unrealistic after being kidnapped.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook narrator was a drawback for me. While she maintained distinct voices for each character, all the female characters sounded evil, which was off-putting. I couldn’t detect Ris’s flirting with Anarod through the narrator’s inflections, and it only became clear through Anarod’s thoughts.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Sky on Fire* is well-written with an intriguing plot and unique world-building, it didn’t work well for me in audiobook format due to its complexity and the narrator’s performance.

            "The characters were a standout feature of the story. Anahrod brought humor, though at times felt a bit invulnerable. Ris, Cary, Claw, and Gwydinion were all engaging and memorable. As the oldest daughter, I found Gwydinion's experiences particularly relatable.",

While I appreciated this depth, I found myself wishing for more variety, particularly serpent-like dragons, which would have been a fantastic addition. Nonetheless, I respect the author's decision to maintain focus, as it may have ultimately served the story well.",
            "This book renewed my faith in fantasy's capacity to depict dragons beyond the confines of tedious political intrigue. Unlike many popular dragon narratives that treat dragons as mere fiery accessories in power struggles, this novel presents them as significant players in their own right. It thoughtfully explores their role as oppressors, examining the implications for both dragons and humans alike."

Unlike most popular dragon media, where dragons are reduced to fiery accessories in throne plots, this novel made dragons their own players and even explored them as oppressors, delving into the implications for both dragons and humans.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were a highlight. Anahrod was funny, though a bit plot-armored. Ris, Cary, Claw, and Gwydinion were all fun and incredible. As an oldest daughter myself, the Gwydinion parts resonated deeply with me.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  The dragon types and lore were super well-fleshed out. While I appreciated the depth, I did wish for more variety, such as serpent-like dragons, which would have been a great addition. That said, I respect the author for staying in their lane, which might have been for the best.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance was fun, though it felt a bit thrown-in at times. I understand there’s no “good time” for romance when characters are running for their lives, but the Ris/Anahrod scenes, in particular, felt a bit abrupt.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This was a fun queer fantasy read, a dragon book free from boring politics, and a really well-built universe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a refreshing and original take on dragons, with strong character development, rich lore, and an engaging, if occasionally abrupt, romance. It’s a standout in the fantasy genre, offering a unique perspective on dragons and their relationship with humans.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Premise:**  \n  - The novel offers a unique take on dragon riders, with dragons being in charge rather than the riders.  \n  - The ring system to designate preferences was a particularly cool and innovative idea.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The main character was compelling and well-developed.  \n  - I would have liked more background on the group of characters, as well as deeper exploration of their dynamics.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The magic system was interesting and added depth to the story.  \n  - The politics of the world and dragon lore were intriguing but could have been expanded upon.  \n  - The ending left room for the world to be further developed, which I found exciting.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The setup to the heist took a significant portion of the book, which I enjoyed as a fan of heist stories.  \n  - I felt the story might have worked better as a duology to allow for more detailed exploration of the world and characters.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  - Lauren Fortgang’s narration was wonderful, bringing the characters to life with nuanced performances.  \n  - There were a few instances where I got lost and had to pause or switch to the ebook, but this became less frequent as I progressed through the story.  \n  - Overall, I enjoyed the narration and would recommend the audiobook.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a fresh and engaging take on dragon riders, with a compelling main character, an interesting magic system, and a unique ring system. While I would have appreciated more depth in the world-building and character backgrounds, the story’s setup and ending leave room for potential expansion. The audiobook narration was excellent, adding depth to the characters and enhancing the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating was provided in the review."

The stakes are high, and the story starts strong with a fantastic prologue that immerses you in the world. It includes sexually mature content and adult overarching themes, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The book boasts a diverse set of characters, each with their own unique traits. While some characters were harder to connect with due to the narration, others were well-suited to the narrator's voice, making them more relatable.\n\n- **Pacing and Flow:**  \n  The pacing of the book is excellent, keeping the reader engaged throughout. The audiobook’s pacing and flow were particularly smooth, making the experience feel shorter than the actual length, which is a positive aspect.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The narration was clear and generally well-suited to the characters. However, the narrator’s voice didn’t always align perfectly with certain characters, which made it slightly challenging to connect with them. Despite this, the overall style of reading contributed to a smooth and enjoyable listening experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book offers a compelling mix of fantasy, heist, and mature themes, supported by a diverse cast of characters and strong pacing. While the audiobook narration had some minor drawbacks, it still provided a smooth and engaging listening experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars"

There was almost too much happening all at once, and I feel like there was easily enough plot for two books. This would have allowed more space for a bit of fluff in between.  \n\n- **World-Building and Elements:**  \n  The book was still great, with dragons, an amazing plot, and a fascinating magic system. It was a truly immersive experience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jenn Lyons managed to create so many characters in a single book and made me care about all of them. Gwyndinion was a particular surprise—I initially thought I wouldn’t like him, but I ended up loving everyone in the book.  \n\n- **Series Impact:**  \n  One small problem: I now really want to reread the entire *A Chorus of Dragons* series, but that’s like five really long books, which feels a bit overwhelming.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book mostly fulfilled my high expectations. Despite feeling like it could have been split into two books to better manage the dense plot, it was an incredible read with rich world-building, compelling characters, and a captivating story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5 Stars"

The lack of world-building made it difficult to get a grip on what was happening, and there was a lot of telling instead of showing.  \n\n- **Character Engagement:**  \n  I struggled to connect with any of the characters—none of them really grabbed my attention enough to keep me reading.  \n\n- **Pacing and Investment:**  \n  I pushed through and made it about 20% in, but I still wasn’t invested. I skimmed ahead to see if anything picked up, but nothing caught my interest, so unfortunately, this one became a DNF for me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This just wasn’t for me, but I’m sure others might enjoy it more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Sky on Fire* had an intriguing premise and the allure of dragons, the lack of world-building, unengaging characters, and slow pacing made it difficult for me to stay invested. I ultimately decided not to finish the book, though I acknowledge that others might find it more enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (No specific rating score mentioned in the review.)"

However, I only agree with this comparison up to a certain point. While it does feature dragons and human riders, the dragons in this story are portrayed as arrogant and view humans as beneath them. Additionally, it lacks the science element that was prominent in McCaffrey's books.  \n\n- **Main Protagonist and Plot:**  \n  The main protagonist has a unique ability that is perceived as dangerous to dragons, which leads to her being ostracized. This ostracism drives her to become involved in a heist, setting off a chain of events that ultimately leads to significant change.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  While I enjoyed the book overall, I felt the beginning was a bit too twisty and convoluted, which slightly impacted my reading experience.  \n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n  Despite the minor issue with the pacing, I would definitely read more books by this author in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book engaging and appreciated its unique take on dragons and human relationships, though it differed from the Pern series in tone and focus. The protagonist's journey and the heist-driven plot were compelling, even if the beginning felt a bit overly complex.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

I’d give it a 3.5 overall.\n- **Expectations and Excitement:** I was very excited for this read. It's got everything for a fantasy adventure! We love anything with dragons.\n- **Pacing:** It starts really strongly with a fantastic prologue, but then it felt slow-paced for a bit.\n- **Character Development:** The story was well crafted, but I just couldn't connect to any of the characters because it felt like so many were introduced so fast. This left me feeling like I was just there for the story instead of feeling like I was in it.\n- **Narration (Audiobook):** The narrator for the audiobook is amazing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book had many strong elements, such as a well-crafted story, a fantastic prologue, and excellent narration, the slow pacing and lack of character connection prevented it from being a fully immersive experience for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Overall: 3.5"

Even though it’s a fantasy novel, the lack of believability was a significant issue for me.  \n- **Characterisation:**  \n  The characterisation was simple and lacked depth. The characters didn’t feel fully developed or compelling, which made it hard to connect with them.  \n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The plot felt like a series of predictable events where X led to Y, which led to Z. The transitions between events were noticeable, making the story feel disjointed and less immersive.  \n- **Twists and Surprises:**  \n  The twists in the story were not surprising or impactful. They failed to add the excitement or intrigue that I was hoping for, which was disappointing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel fell short of my expectations. The forced and unrealistic elements, simple characterisation, predictable plot, and lack of surprising twists made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This setting creates a rich backdrop for the story, with its divided society adding nuance to the central conflict and shaping the characters' motivations. The dragons, with their unique personalities, abilities, and specific hoarding preferences (e.g., weathervanes), are a standout feature of the world-building.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is heavily plot-driven, structured like a quest narrative that takes the adventuring group across various locations as they work through their main mission and occasional side quests. While there are bursts of fast-paced action, some sections lack focus and momentum, though the plot often picks up before becoming a slog. The inclusion of subplots, including character relationships and a bit of romance, helps maintain interest.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Anahrod, the protagonist, is a reluctant exile who is thrust back into the world she tried to escape. Her history with the dragon Neveranimas adds depth to her character and the central conflict. However, the development of side characters could have been more substantial to enhance their roles in the story.  \n\n- **Action and Entertainment:**  \n  As a heist story, the novel thrives on action and chaos, delivering clever surprises that keep the reader entertained. The high-stakes nature of the mission and the unpredictability of the dragons contribute to the book's excitement.  \n\n- **Areas for Improvement:**  \n  The plot could have been streamlined to reduce unnecessary tangents, and the side characters could have been given more depth. Despite these minor flaws, the novel remains a solid and entertaining entry into the epic fantasy genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Sky on Fire* is a compelling and entertaining fantasy novel that combines dragons, heists, and a richly imagined world.

Anahrod’s relationships with two other characters were prominent, but I liked that it wasn’t a simple love triangle—it felt more nuanced, similar to \"A Chorus of Dragons.\" The characters felt diverse and multidimensional, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The plot moves in many directions but keeps a central goal in sight. It felt a bit wobbly at times, but I enjoyed the fast-paced nature and the exploration of the universe through various locations and numerous characters. The balance between the relationships and the overarching plot was well done.  \n\n- **Dragons as Characters:**  \n  The dragons were a highlight for me. They were portrayed as diverse and complex—some were cruel, others kind and fair, and some were driven by power and ego. This diversity made them feel more like sentient beings, similar to humans, which I found refreshing and engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, \"The Sky on Fire\" was a great read with a cast of characters I cared about, a fast-moving plot, and a wonderfully crafted world. While it didn’t quite reach the level of \"A Chorus of Dragons\" for me, it was still a pleasant surprise and an enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book is both incredibly fast-paced and surprisingly slow to read. Each chapter is packed with non-stop action, yet the extensive world-building, numerous characters, and intricate plot require careful attention. While this depth may slow the reading experience, it’s not a drawback; rather, it allows for a richer understanding of the story without any unnecessary fluff.",
            "While I wouldn't label this as a romantasy, it does feature a romance—a throuple, to be precise—and I was completely on board with it!",
            "At its core, the story explores the conflict between dragons and humans. As humans learn to ride dragons, their relationship shifts from symbiotic to parasitic, leading to subjugation. This power struggle unfolds through thrilling heists and intense battles."
        ],

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Cover and Initial Appeal:**  \n  I was drawn to request *The Sky on Fire* partly because of the gorgeous cover, but also because I've been reading and enjoying a ton of fantasy/romantasy lately, and I am truly a sucker for dragons. Picking this book based on the cover did not let me down!  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  The blurb suggests this book is perfect for fans of *Fourth Wing*, but apart from the presence of dragons and dragon riders, I don’t see a strong connection. To me, it felt more similar to *Assassin’s Blade* (from the *Throne of Glass* series) or *Six of Crows*, given the heists, twists, turns, and found family vibes.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  This book is oddly super fast-paced but also simultaneously a slow read. It’s non-stop action, with something exciting happening in every chapter. However, the extensive world-building, numerous characters, and complex plot made it a slower read for me. This isn’t a bad thing—it just meant there wasn’t much fluff, and I needed time to absorb everything.  \n\n- **Themes and Conflict:**  \n  At its heart, the story revolves around a conflict between dragons and humans. While humans learn to ride dragons, they become subjugated slaves to them, turning what should be a symbiotic relationship into a parasitic one. The power struggle between dragons and humans manifests in heists and all-out battles.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  I wouldn’t classify this as a romantasy, but there is a romance—a throuple, in fact—and I was totally here for all of it!  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Desire for More:**  \n  I really enjoyed this book and would love to read more in this world. In fact, I’d be particularly interested in a prequel about a certain red-headed dragon rider to learn more about her and her dragon’s past adventures.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFans of fantasy, especially those who enjoy dragons, heists, and found family vibes, will find a lot to love in *The Sky on Fire*. It’s a richly layered, action-packed story with a compelling conflict and a touch of romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars. (Still thinking about this book days later, which speaks volumes!)  \n\nThank you to Lyons, Tor, and NetGalley for the eARC in exchange for my honest review."

The inclusion of romantic and sexual content seemed forced; for instance, a drunken threesome was barely addressed, while an awkward episode of dirty talk during a ship escape felt out of place. These moments appeared to be attempts at relevance rather than meaningful contributions to the plot. As a heist fantasy, the story's heist elements were overshadowed by clumsy relationship dynamics, and the pacing suffered as a result, especially in a novel exceeding 500 pages.

It did not serve the story in any way. The inclusion of spice (romantic/sexual content) felt forced and out of place.

The shallow characters and underdeveloped setting left me wanting more, particularly regarding the dragon society and the human world's nuances.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot Complexity and Pacing:**  \n  The plot can be convoluted at times and moves quickly, which occasionally creates confusion. For example, I still don’t quite understand why Anahrod’s family threw her into the Deep in the first place. Additionally, tracking the characters’ alliances and emotional states was sometimes challenging. However, the twists and turns were never boring, and I was always eager to discover what happened next.\n\n- **Originality and Avoidance of Tropes:**  \n  SKY definitively avoids subscribing to the formulaic trends often seen in female-led fantasy, such as the overused \"shadow daddies\" trope. This originality made the story all the more entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the unique portrayal of dragons as generally unpleasant beings in this world.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are richly drawn and compelling. Anahrod and the supporting cast are well-developed, making them memorable and engaging.\n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The audiobook narration by Lauren Fortgang is exceptional. Her considerable voice talent elevates the story, adding depth and nuance to Anahrod and the other characters.\n\n- **Availability and Special Editions:**  \n  SKY was Inkstone’s Q3 2024 subscription offering, and it might be available on resale websites. Additionally, small business @bib.leo.phile is offering a special edition through August 12.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some moments of confusion due to the plot’s complexity and pacing, SKY is a highly engaging and original fantasy novel. Its richly drawn characters, avoidance of overused tropes, and excellent audiobook narration make it a standout read. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and would recommend it to fans of unique, female-led fantasy.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
