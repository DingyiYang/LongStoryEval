            "The subplot of Mel's bartending competition and her aspiration to open a bar didn't resonate with me, but the strong romance was enough to sustain the story. The book offers valuable context for readers unfamiliar with polyamorous relationships, though the characters occasionally come across as archetypes defined by their sexualities.",

However, her connection with Bebe reignites a part of her that she believed was lost. The romance among Mel, Bebe, and Kade is captivating, and I appreciated the way their individual dynamics evolved before they embraced a polyamorous relationship. Kade stands out as my favorite character, as I loved witnessing their journey toward greater confidence and self-discovery."

Some scenes, such as using therapy-speak to defuse a loud argument between NHL fans, feel unnecessary and detract from the narrative. Additionally, instances like chastising someone for incorrect pronoun use or oversimplifying discussions on undiagnosed ADHD come across as forced.",
            "The main characters—Mel, Bebe, and Bebe’s wife—struggle to come across as genuine or relatable. This disconnect makes it challenging to invest in their relationships or personal growth. Furthermore, their conflicts and resolutions are simplistic and lack emotional depth.",

            "The book examines a contemporary form of online queerness that feels overly simplistic, presenting issues in stark black-and-white terms with clear right and wrong answers. While it touches on themes of polyamory and queerness, the exploration of different dynamics lacks depth and nuance. Characters are reduced to their sexuality, gender, trauma, and mental health issues, resulting in one-dimensional portrayals that make it difficult to connect with them.",

Though excessive drama isn't always necessary in romance, the polycule's relationship came across as too perfect, missing the nuance and complexity I'd expect. The portrayal of their dynamic as an ideal example of polyamory felt somewhat unrealistic. The premise is certainly enticing: Mel, a bartender at one of NYC's hottest bars, isn’t seeking love after her divorce but finds herself drawn to the gorgeous and charming Bebe, who is married to the brooding artist Kade. As their relationship develops, Mel discovers she may also have feelings for Kade, adding an intriguing layer to the narrative.

It was difficult to form strong opinions about it, which made rating and reviewing challenging.\n\n- **Polyamorous Representation:**\n   - As someone who is not polyamorous and has only a basic understanding of the dynamics, I can’t speak to the accuracy of the representation. However, I didn’t feel personally invested in the romance(s), which was disappointing for a romance novel.\n\n- **Lesbian Representation:**\n   - I appreciated that the book featured a lesbian main character who was explicitly referred to as a lesbian. It was refreshing to see the word used boldly and proudly, especially since it’s often avoided even in queer literature. Additionally, it was great to see a romance between a lesbian and a nonbinary character who wasn’t portrayed as “Woman Lite™️.” This representation felt meaningful and rare.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters—Mel, Bebe, and Kade—felt flat and one-dimensional. They seemed to exist solely as their identities (lesbian, poly, genderqueer) and jobs (bartender, lawyer, artist) rather than as fully realized individuals. Mel’s transition from being disinterested in romance to falling in love with Bebe and Kade was underwhelming and lacked depth. I wanted more exploration of her hesitations and emotional journey.\n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**\n   - The chemistry between the characters was lacking. Mel and Bebe had clear physical/sexual attraction, but the romantic connection felt underdeveloped.

Mel's evolving bond with both characters was skillfully done, and the delayed introduction of a triad added an intriguing dimension. However, as a single POV romance, it limited my view of Kade and Bebe together, something I wished to see more of. Additionally, some unresolved issues with Daniel, Mel's best friend, felt like a missed opportunity for deeper exploration.",

Her whirlwind romance with Bebe is quick, fun, and flirty, infused with genuine emotional depth. In contrast, her relationship with Kade unfolds more gradually, beginning as a friendship and blossoming into a heartfelt courtship. Bebe’s magnetic personality enriches the narrative, providing an engaging backdrop. Additionally, the subplot involving a drink-making competition seamlessly complements Mel's journey of personal growth and her understanding of poly relationships.",

            "In this engaging story, Mel, a New York City bartender reeling from a failed marriage, embarks on a journey of self-discovery and connection with Bebe, a lawyer, and Kade, a non-binary artist. Both Bebe and Kade are well-rounded characters with distinct personalities, making their relationship dynamics compelling. I particularly enjoyed the evolution of Mel's connections, especially when she and Kade finally bonded after her ongoing relationship with Bebe. The romance strikes a perfect balance between sweet and spicy, with moments that elicited both \"Awwwh\" and \"Oooh\" reactions—each encounter more electrifying than the last. I found myself rooting for these characters to form a cozy \"cuddle puddle.\" Although their polyamorous dynamic may shift, I love the idea of Mel moving in and them living happily ever after.",

I now desperately want a Rock Dove cocktail because Mel’s character was written with my exact taste in mind.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Enjoyment:**  \n  - The book was cute, frothy, and ultimately really sweet. It felt like a romp, and I had a great time reading it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis romance novel was a delightful read, blending fun chemistry, creative intimacy, and a touch of cheesiness with genuine moments and a charming subplot. Despite some initial reservations, it turned out to be a perfect fit for my tastes, leaving me thoroughly entertained.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Instead of resolving the story naturally, the author used a one-year-later epilogue to tie everything up neatly, which felt lazy and uninspired.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The attempt to represent queer and non-traditional relationships is appreciated and adds a refreshing layer to the romance genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s premise and representation of queer and poly relationships are commendable, the lack of depth in character development and the poorly executed ending significantly detract from the overall experience. The story had potential but fell short in execution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars."

            "The story is well-paced and engaging from beginning to end. The development of the relationships is both natural and satisfying. Additionally, Mel's bartending adds a unique element, inspiring me to consider taking a mixology class myself.",
            "This story features a nonbinary main character, queer representation, and both polyamorous main and side relationships. Content warnings include homophobia and misgendering. Mel, the female main character, begins as a closed-off bartender in NYC, grappling with feelings of unworthiness after a failed marriage. Her journey towards accepting love from two partners is beautifully portrayed. Bebe, a confident and charming high-powered lawyer, adds a dynamic energy to the narrative, especially in her supportive role during Mel’s challenges. Kade, Bebe’s initially grumpy partner, reveals a deeply thoughtful and caring nature as their relationship with Mel develops. The snowed-in cabin scene is particularly memorable, highlighting the growth of their connection.",

Their talent for creating characters you deeply connect with is unparalleled, eliciting genuine emotions—I cried twice while reading this book.

The relationships depicted—both queer and polyamorous—offer a nuanced perspective on love, while the characters’ journeys of personal growth and healing from past trauma resonate deeply. Overall, the narrative successfully intertwines these themes with compelling storytelling."

            "The story follows Mel, a love-weary bartender who unexpectedly finds herself entangled with Bebe and, later, Bebe's wife, Kade, as they navigate an open marriage that evolves into a polyamorous relationship. While the concept is intriguing, the narrative falls short in exploring how Mel integrates into Bebe and Kade's dynamic. Her initial discomfort is not adequately developed, making her subsequent ease with the situation feel abrupt. I hoped for deeper character exploration, particularly concerning their relationships. Kade is introduced as Bebe's wife, leading to the assumption that Kade is female, only for it to be revealed later that Kade identifies as non-binary. While I value the representation, I wish this aspect had been communicated earlier for better clarity on Kade's identity.",

I adored the representation, the balance of themes, and the unique elements like the cocktail recipes. While I wished for more professional details about Bebe and Kade, this didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment. The snowstorm and cocktail competition scenes were highlights, and the emphasis on communication and consent made the story even more compelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Final Rating: 5 stars."

They felt well-developed and engaging.  \n- **Plot and Subplots:** The side plots were all interesting and kept me engaged throughout the novel.

            "The novel is structured into three parts: Old Fashioned, Corpse Reviver, and Three Parts Tequila, providing a clear framework for the narrative. It follows Mel's journey of personal growth and her exploration of polyamory, which is handled thoughtfully. However, several significant plot points, such as the bar takeover and Bebe's legal case, are introduced but not fully developed, detracting from the overall impact of the story. The conflict involving Bebe's rival attorney and the bar takeover lacks detail and resolution, leaving these threads unresolved. Additionally, the ultimatum for Bebe to choose between her case and her relationship with Mel feels implausible and is ultimately ignored, weakening the storyline.",
            "Mel's journey from a recently divorced, love-skeptical bartender to someone embracing polyamory and personal growth is skillfully depicted. While Bebe and Kade are compelling characters with contrasting personalities, their development occasionally takes a backseat to the emphasis on gender identity. Additionally, Kade's hinted mental health struggles, particularly concerning ADHD, are not formally explored, which may be a missed opportunity.",
            "The writing is engaging and adeptly conveys the characters' emotions and growth. However, the alternating pronouns for Blue on the same page can be confusing and disrupt the narrative flow. Additionally, the novel becomes repetitive and frustrating when characters are introduced solely by their gender identity, only to quickly vanish from the storyline.",
            "The novel adeptly addresses themes of gender fluidity and identity, serving as a thoughtful guide for readers to grasp diverse gender experiences. While polyamory is a central element, the narrative sometimes veers off track, introducing multiple conflicts and varying interpretations of gender identification."

While the character development and exploration of diverse identities are strengths, the narrative is occasionally disrupted by unresolved plot points and repetitive elements. The novel provides a thoughtful guide to understanding gender identity but could benefit from more focused storytelling and resolution of its conflicts.",

Having read their other books, I trusted them to portray this community accurately, upliftingly, and accessibly for those unfamiliar with polyamory—and they delivered spectacularly. I particularly loved the inclusion of the \"Guidelines for Poly Living\" in the text and how it evolved alongside the characters' dynamics.  \n\n- **Treatment of Jealousy:**  \n  I have mixed feelings about how jealousy was handled in the novel. On one hand, jealousy and compersion are such common issues in polyamory that resolving them with a single conversation felt a bit idealized. On the other hand, it felt revolutionary to have a book so wholly focused on poly joy, which was refreshing and uplifting.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The first half of the book heavily focused on Bebe, which left me wanting more scenes showcasing the relationship between Mel and Kade. Their dynamic felt underexplored, and I think there’s enough material here for a sequel!  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This book was an absolute joy to read. It was heartwarming, insightful, and a celebration of polyamory that felt both authentic and accessible.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTJ Alexander's novel is a groundbreaking exploration of polyamorous romance, filled with joy, authenticity, and thoughtful representation.

The lack of meaningful conflict or tension made the plot feel too convenient and unengaging.\n   - The story lacked a compelling push to move it forward, resulting in a flat narrative.\n\n- **Realism and Coincidences:**\n   - While it’s realistic to have a diverse group of queer and polyamorous people in real life, the way it was handled in the book felt contrived.

This made Mel seem like a disinterested and self-absorbed person, which made it hard to root for her to have a healthy relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *Triple Sec* had an interesting premise and attempted to explore polyamory in a romance novel, the execution fell flat.

The story follows a casual relationship turning serious and then evolving into a triad. Personally, I think a Vee-style relationship would have been more interesting, but I respect the author's vision.  \n\n- **Plot Depth and Complexity:**  \n  This is a very simple but fairly fun story, with enough layers to allow some investment. However, for me, the story felt a bit too thin. At times, it seemed like it was begging for more plot arcs and complications—they were practically trying to develop right on the page, but we never got there.  \n\n- **Focus on Relationships vs. External Stakes:**  \n  The flirting and more steamy parts of the relationship (which I'll admit I'm not the target audience for) took priority. While many readers will likely enjoy this, I felt that elements like the work drama and vacation complications could have added more stakes and depth to the story. Instead, it remained low-stakes throughout with only surface-level drama, which isn't really my preference.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its merits as a light, fun read with a polyamorous romance at its core, it lacked the depth and complexity I was hoping for.

            "This novel redefines the traditional concept of “happily ever after” (HEA) by highlighting the importance of relationships, even those that don't endure. Kade's perspective on love—recognizing that one person can't meet all needs—is both refreshing and realistic. The ending is satisfying, emphasizing the present happiness and love shared among the characters.",
            "The triadic romance among Mel, Bebe, and Kade is portrayed with remarkable complexity and realism. Bebe and Kade's established, communicative relationship provides a solid foundation for Mel's entry into their dynamic. Mel's authentic journey into polyamory showcases her struggles and personal growth. The contrasting relationships—Bebe and Kade's enduring love, Bebe and Mel's fiery chemistry, and Kade and Mel's slow-burning tension—are compellingly executed. Kade emerges as a standout character, embodying the \"still waters run deep\" archetype with hidden passion and emotional depth.\n\nThe romance is both sexy and relatable, focusing on negotiations, boundaries, and rules within relationships. The explicit sex scenes are well-crafted, highlighting a range of dynamics with a strong emphasis on consent and communication. Kade's dirty talk and the palpable chemistry among the characters enhance the heat of these moments. The story effectively represents healthy polyamory and features genderqueer representation, crafted by a trans nonbinary author. As a slice-of-life narrative, it prioritizes character development and realistic relationships, while the inclusion of high-end bartending and cocktail-making enriches the plot.",
            "This story features strong writing, excellent character development, and a refreshing focus on romance rather than excessive drama. It portrays grown adults realistically navigating their relationships and emotions. The third-person perspective from Mel’s viewpoint effectively allows readers to engage with her journey while still feeling the presence of Kade and Bebe.",
            "I commend the author's representation of trans nonbinary individuals and the visibility it brings to the narrative. The story resonates deeply, especially for readers who appreciate queer and polyamorous themes."

Her transformation from a divorcee to a member of a throuple was captivating and effectively illustrated through her final idea. The ending was heartwarming and well-crafted, bringing the story together beautifully.",
            "Mel and Bebe’s relationship felt flat, lacking genuine intimacy and chemistry. Their connection came across as underdeveloped, featuring only a few dates and minimal substance. In contrast, Mel and Kade exhibited much more tension and dynamic chemistry, making their interactions far more compelling and deserving of greater focus. While the exploration of the relationships among Mel, Bebe, and Kade was enjoyable, it could have been further developed. Mel’s character growth, particularly her changing views on love and relationships, was well-crafted, and Kade’s complexity added depth that enhanced the overall story. However, the book would have benefited from more spicy scenes, which could have contributed to the intimacy and overall appeal.",

            "In this compelling narrative, we follow Mel, a jaded, divorced bartender with a shaved head, tattoos, and a passion for mixology, as she embarks on her journey into polyamory.

The evolving dynamics of their throuple are beautifully illustrated, though I wished for deeper exploration of their relationship as the story progressed. The book presents a queer, polyamorous romance centered around Mel, a lesbian, Kade, a non-binary love interest, and Bebe, a plus-size love interest. With prominent gay secondary characters, it thoughtfully navigates themes of polyamory, mixology, and queer relationships. The representation feels authentic and is particularly accessible for those new to polyamory.",

            "The novel follows Mel, a bartender determined to avoid love after her divorce, who unexpectedly becomes entangled in a complicated relationship with Bebe and Kade, a couple in an open marriage. A subplot featuring Mel's entry into a cocktail competition enhances the narrative, introducing additional layers beyond the romance. A snowed-in weekend serves as a pivotal moment, revealing Kade’s true feelings and infusing the story with tension and emotional depth.",
            "In this novel, Mel is a passionate yet cautious character, wrestling with her reservations about polyamory as she navigates her feelings for Bebe. Bebe exudes confidence and flirtation, while Kade's reserved and seemingly disapproving presence adds depth to the trio's interactions. Each character has a distinct personality, making their relationships dynamic and allowing readers to connect with them more deeply. The story thoughtfully explores polyamorous relationships, educating readers and challenging traditional dating norms. Mel’s initial hesitations about the lifestyle provide a relatable perspective, particularly for those unfamiliar with it. The evolving dynamics among Mel, Bebe, and Kade are nuanced and compelling, filled with moments of tension and emotional discovery.",

            "I was pleasantly surprised by the story's non-closed triangle romance, especially when Mel and Kade found themselves snowed in together. However, Kade’s character development felt uneven, as the buildup to his feelings for Mel was not adequately foreshadowed.",
            "I appreciate how the author carefully developed each character's individual relationship before diving into their polyamorous dynamics, a thoughtful approach that's often overlooked in this genre. The extended metaphor of Mel's contest drink beautifully symbolizes her comfort in a non-traditional relationship. Mel's emotional confession about feeling the need to be perfect to deserve love was both powerful and relatable. However, I found Kade to be somewhat enigmatic. While the character concept was strong and the author's intentions were clear, Kade didn’t receive enough attention to fully come alive. Though Kade reminded me of my ex, showcasing a well-rounded character, I struggled to grasp the basis of their crush on Mel. Kade’s sudden revelation felt out of the blue; while it made sense for Mel to be blindsided, I wished for earlier hints to better anticipate this development."

        "conclusion": "This book has many strengths, particularly in its thoughtful development of relationships and emotional depth. While Kade’s characterization and the pacing of their storyline could have been stronger, the novel remains an enjoyable and heartfelt read that explores non-traditional relationships with care and nuance.",

While their character concept was strong and I loved what Alexander was trying to do with them, I felt they didn’t get enough screentime.  \n   - Kade reminded me of my ex in both good and bad ways, which shows they were a fully realized character, but I didn’t fully understand why they had a crush on Mel.  \n   - The revelation of Kade’s crush felt sudden, and while it made sense for Mel to be blindsided, I wish there had been more hints for the reader to pick up on earlier.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - I didn’t expect the story to be a non-closed triangle romance until Mel and Kade were snowed in together, which was a pleasant surprise.  \n   - The pacing felt uneven regarding Kade’s development, as their feelings for Mel weren’t sufficiently foreshadowed.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Despite my minor drawbacks, I REALLY liked this book and would still recommend it.  \n   - I appreciate the exploration of different poly romance configurations and found the characters compelling overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has many strengths, particularly in its thoughtful development of relationships and emotional depth.

            "One notable weakness in the story was the minimal conflict. Issues surfaced but were resolved too quickly, which, while appropriate for a narrative centered on relationships, left me yearning for greater depth. I was particularly disappointed in the handling of Mel and Daniel's friendship. The potential conflict stemming from Mel's disregard for Daniel was conveniently dismissed, undermining the chance for richer character development. This felt like a missed opportunity to explore their dynamics more deeply.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the characters in *Triple Sec* by TJ Alexander. Their dynamics were well-developed, and the story's focus extended beyond the three main characters, incorporating other relevant figures that enriched the narrative. Mel, in particular, resonated with me. As someone new to polyamory, her uncertainty and journey of understanding felt both relatable and inclusive. It was refreshing to see her navigate the complexities of a poly relationship authentically. The book effectively addresses misconceptions about polyamory, presenting the topic in an accessible and relatable manner. Mel's exploration of what a poly relationship entails was particularly impactful for me as a reader."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Triple Sec* is a fun and sweet read that shines in its portrayal of a polyamorous relationship and its inclusive approach to representation.

Their dynamics were well-rounded, and I appreciated how the story not only focused on the three main characters but also included glimpses of other relevant characters that helped piece the story together.  \n  - Mel's character, in particular, stood out to me. As someone new to polyamory, her uncertainty and journey of understanding felt very relatable and inclusive. It was refreshing to see her navigate the complexities of a poly relationship in a way that felt authentic.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  - One major aspect I found lacking was the minimal conflict throughout the story. Any issues that arose were resolved quickly, which, while fitting for a book focused on showcasing the relationship, left me wanting more depth.  \n  - Specifically, I disliked how Mel and Daniel's friendship was handled. There seemed to be conflict building due to Mel ignoring Daniel, but it was brushed off as if the previous tension didn’t matter. This felt like a missed opportunity for deeper character exploration.  \n\n- **Inclusivity and Representation:**  \n  - The book does an excellent job of addressing the ignorance surrounding polyamory and presenting it in a way that feels accessible and relatable. Mel's journey of understanding what a poly relationship is and how it works was particularly impactful for me as a reader.  \n\n- **Engaging Elements and Missed Opportunities:**  \n  - Mel's bartending skills added fun and unique moments to the story, especially with the creation of interesting drinks. I would have loved to see some recipes included—it felt like a missed opportunity to make the story even more interactive.  \n  - While Mel wasn’t a perfect character, her conflicts were resolved too simply, which made her growth feel a bit rushed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Triple Sec* is a fun and sweet read that shines in its portrayal of a polyamorous relationship and its inclusive approach to representation.

The couple dates separately, and their attractions and romances develop naturally, avoiding the trope of a married couple seeking a \"third\" for a threesome.  \n\n- **Themes of Love and Communication:**  \n  The book emphasizes overwhelming love, consideration, and communication, not just between romantic partners but also among friends. This aspect of the story is heartwarming and adds depth to the relationships.  \n\n- **Character Development and Individuality:**  \n  The married couple in the story maintains their distinct personalities and shows mutual respect and love for each other. This is a departure from typical romance narratives, where characters often lose their individuality after getting together or focus solely on fixing a troubled marriage.  \n\n- **Tone and Mood:**  \n  The novel is a feel-good romance with low drama, focusing on characters learning to love themselves and others. It strikes a balance between emotional depth and lightheartedness.  \n\n- **Sexual Content:**  \n  The book includes a handful of very explicit (X-rated) sex scenes, spread evenly throughout the story. In between these, there are many more \"closed door\" or G/PG-rated sex scenes or mentions of sex.  \n\n- **Diversity and Representation:**  \n  The story features f/f and f/nb relationships, offering diverse and inclusive representation.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The story is told in close third-person, single POV, which allows for an intimate and focused perspective.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartwarming, feel-good polyamorous romance that stands out for its authentic representation of polyamory, strong themes of love and communication, and well-developed characters who maintain their individuality.

This slow development makes the story feel unengaging. While the drink competition offered an intriguing concept, it ultimately fizzled out, losing its initial excitement. Overall, the premise has promise, but the execution fails to meet expectations.",
            "Mel's character comes across as frustratingly anxious, with reactions that often feel exaggerated and immature for someone in their 30s. Her responses—such as overreacting to Bebe prioritizing her court case, lacking composure when a server misgenders her partner, and breaking down over double-booking—undermine her likability. While there is chemistry between Mel and Bebe, the sudden introduction of Kade seems forced, with no clear reason for Mel’s feelings toward him beyond fulfilling the polyamorous premise. This creates a dynamic among the three characters that lacks depth and excitement."

The story took too long to get to the poly aspect, with Mel dating Bebe alone for 75% of the book and only including Kade in the last 25%. This pacing made the story feel slow and unengaging.  \n\n- **Poly Representation:**  \n  The poly aspect felt clinical and underwhelming. It didn’t feel authentic or compelling, especially compared to other poly romances I’ve read, like *Pucking Wild*. Mel’s sudden feelings for Kade seemed forced, as if it was only included to make the romance poly. It would have been more believable if Bebe had been poly and Mel was dating her alone.  \n\n- **Character Development (Mel):**  \n  Mel was frustrating and overly anxious. Her reactions to situations felt exaggerated and immature, especially for someone in their 30s. For example, her overreaction to Bebe prioritizing her court case, her lack of grace when a server misgendered her partner, and her breakdown over double-booking herself were all unnecessary and made her hard to root for.  \n\n- **Chemistry and Relationships:**  \n  The chemistry between Mel and Bebe was present, but the sudden inclusion of Kade felt unnatural. There was no clear reason for Mel to develop feelings for Kade other than to fulfill the poly premise. The dynamic between the three characters lacked depth and excitement.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The drink competition aspect was an interesting concept but ultimately fell flat. It started with potential but became boring as the story progressed. The premise of the book was cool, but the execution didn’t live up to expectations.  \n\n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  Nothing about the book excited me or made me want to keep reading. While the premise had potential, the story failed to deliver on its promises.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was underwhelming and didn’t meet my expectations.

The relationships are well-crafted, especially the friendship between Mel and Daniel; his unwavering support helps Mel become a better friend in return. The bond between Mel and Bebe is utterly endearing, with Bebe expertly encouraging Mel to pursue her dreams. Mel and Kade share excellent chemistry, and their transformation from a rocky beginning to improved communication and closeness is beautifully depicted. While Kade and Bebe’s interactions are less frequent, they add a delightful touch. Though Mel occasionally frustrated me with her self-sabotage, she demonstrated significant growth by the end.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Interest and Expectations:**  \n  I watched an interview where T. J. Alexander and a couple of other authors were promoting their latest books, and I instantly put *Triple Sec* on my TBR! I wasn’t expecting more than one romance within this book, as Alexander pitched it as \"three love stories for the price of one.\"  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  In short: I flipping loved this book! It’s a non-traditional love story that’s hip, swanky, and dripping with easy charm.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Surprises:**  \n  Told in three tantalizing parts, I was repeatedly and happily surprised. The structure kept me engaged, and I even found myself wanting to craft my own drinks while reading!  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Mel, Bebe, and Kade are written so well, each being undeniably unique. The true distinctions between the three characters made it impossible to confuse them. The single point of view further streamlined the romance, making it easy to follow.  \n\n- **Authenticity and Relatability:**  \n  The characters had very commonplace habits, which brought them to life and made them feel real and relatable.  \n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Elements:**  \n  The steam was the maraschino cherry on top—initially present, then off-page to create further relationship intimacy. This balance worked perfectly for the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The settings, including speakeasies and Banff, added a rich layer to the story, enhancing its charm and appeal.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n  It was Alexander’s personality (rather than the book’s premise) that really had me wanting to read *Triple Sec*. Their humorous and loving writing style resonated with me, and I will be seeking out Alexander’s backlist for more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Triple Sec* is a delightful, non-traditional love story with well-crafted characters, a surprising narrative structure, and a charming atmosphere. T. J. Alexander’s writing style is engaging and humorous, making this a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Style and Uniqueness:**  \n  I really like this author and appreciate the diverse stories they are putting out there. Romance novels are so over-saturated with M/F pairings, and they all tend to blend together. This author’s books stand out as more unique.  \n\n- **Plot and Focus:**  \n  In *Triple Sec*, however, I needed a bit more. There was endless discussion about alcohol and food, which felt excessive and detracted from the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The lack of meaningful character development was a letdown. I wish more effort had been put into fleshing out the characters’ personalities rather than focusing on the food they were eating. I could have fallen in love with each of these characters if they had been more fully realized.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Expectations:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I’ll definitely continue to pick up more books from this author. I’m hopeful that I’ll find a 4/5 star book in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the author’s unique approach to romance and their diverse storytelling, *Triple Sec* fell short for me due to its excessive focus on food and alcohol and its lack of meaningful character development. I remain optimistic about the author’s future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars"

            "The author skillfully integrates inclusivity in a natural way, avoiding a heavy-handed approach. Characters do not constantly define their sexualities or dwell on them throughout the story. This is a notable improvement from the author's previous work, *Chef’s Kiss*, which I felt lacked effective representation. Each character captured my affection for distinct reasons, mirroring Mel's connections in the book. The multiple romance storylines enabled me to engage with several characters, making the book's length feel justified. However, I would have appreciated more focus on Jackson.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Uniqueness:**  \n  The plot was unique compared to any romance book I had ever read. A queer polyamorous romance was a refreshing and intriguing concept.  \n\n- **Inclusivity and Representation:**  \n  Alexander does a great job of weaving in inclusivity without it feeling heavy-handed. Characters don’t feel the need to constantly identify their sexualities or spend the whole book thinking about them. This was a significant improvement from their last book, *Chef’s Kiss*, which I felt did a poor job with representation.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Polyamory:**  \n  The book effectively shows how different polyamorous relationships can look and how they can be healthy rather than toxic. It was refreshing to see this perspective portrayed so thoughtfully.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I fell in love with each character for different reasons, which I suppose Mel in the book did too. The multiple romance storylines allowed me to connect with more than one character, making the length of the book justifiable. However, I would have loved to see more of Jackson.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was fairly well done and engaging, though I could predict the ending from a ways away. At times, the writing felt a little cheesy, with phrases like “poly-telepathy” or awkward lines that didn’t feel natural for human dialogue.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  Normally, I find romance books to be overly long and drawn out, but this one felt quick and engaging, especially with the dual romance storylines.  \n\n- **Cameos and Easter Eggs:**  \n  I loved the cameo by Ray—it was a nice touch!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a solid and enjoyable read. The unique plot, improved representation, and thoughtful portrayal of polyamory made it stand out. While the writing had some cheesy moments and the ending was predictable, the characters and pacing kept me engaged.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5 ⭐️  \n\nThank you to Atria Books and NetGalley for providing me with the eARC in exchange for an honest review."

The characters were flawed and trying their best, which added depth and relatability to the story.  \n\n- **Future Expectations:**  \n  I'll be looking forward to reading whatever TJ Alexander comes out with next.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to Atria Books for providing an ARC through NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Triple Sec* by TJ Alexander delivered a compelling mix of competition, romance, and sensory-rich descriptions, with well-crafted characters and a satisfying level of spice.

            "This story struggles with balance, as Mel's relationships with Bebe and Kade come across as rushed and underdeveloped. The abrupt conclusion that brings all three characters together leaves readers feeling unsatisfied due to insufficient buildup. Despite its snowy setting, the novel has the charm of a fun polyamorous romance suitable for a beach read. It follows Mel, a butch bartender navigating life post-divorce, who encounters Bebe, a flirtatious stranger with a nonbinary partner, Kade. While the premise is engaging, Mel's lack of awareness regarding polyamory in a queer-friendly environment like NYC feels unrealistic.",
            "In this story, Mel stands out as a relatable service worker navigating the affluent, liberal world of Bebe and Kade. The couple, a stereotypical duo in search of a third partner, presents Kade as an aloof, introverted artist with distinct autistic traits. However, the dynamics between Mel and Kade come across as underdeveloped, making their connection feel rushed and unconvincing.",
            "The novel attempts to tackle class differences through Mel's discomfort in a wealthy environment but ultimately fails to engage with these tensions meaningfully. It incorporates liberal therapy jargon and delivers preachy commentary on gender presentation, which can feel forced at times. However, the representation of nonbinary identities, especially in Kade's character, is commendable for its rarity and nuance, even as it reinforces certain stereotypes. While the book explores significant themes like polyamory, class disparity, and nonbinary identities, its execution often comes off as didactic rather than organic. It raises thought-provoking points about the queer community's treatment of nonbinary individuals, particularly those who reject traditional feminine identities or dysphoria narratives."

While it offers some rare and valuable representation of nonbinary identities, its heavy-handed social commentary and rushed relationships detract from the overall experience. It’s a decent read for those seeking a quick, fun romance, but it falls short of delivering a fully satisfying narrative.",

The book skillfully portrays the dynamics of the polycule, steering clear of misused terms like harem romance. It also thoughtfully addresses non-binary representation, highlighting Kade's experiences with misgendering and Mel's supportive response. The exploration of polyamory is nuanced and realistic, effectively dispelling common misconceptions while offering a tender depiction of polyamorous relationships."

The payoff of seeing three very different individuals connect, fall in love, and make space for each other is absolutely worth it. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a nuanced and heartfelt romance.",

This was my first time reading their work, and I was thoroughly impressed. I’ll definitely be reading more of their books in the future.  \n\n- **Exploration of Relationships and Self-Discovery:**  \n  The book delves into Mel’s journey as she explores her expectations of relationships, love, partnership, and her own self-imposed limitations. It was my first time reading a poly romance, and I found the exploration of these themes to be both engaging and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Representation of Non-Binary Identity:**  \n  This was also my first time reading a non-binary AMAB (assigned male at birth) character. Kade’s identity was handled with nuance, care, and respect, which is often lacking in portrayals of non-binary characters. Their experience felt authentic and meaningful, going beyond a superficial pronoun change. TJ Alexander clearly understands that a non-binary identity is much more than just slapping a \"they/them\" on someone.  \n\n- **Character Development and Potential for Future Stories:**  \n  I would love to read more about Mel, Bebe, and Kade. While *Triple Sec* provided a great introduction to these characters, I feel like we only scratched the surface of getting to know them. They clearly have more love to give—both to each other and to readers—and I hope they return in future stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful surprise, offering a fresh perspective on relationships, identity, and self-discovery.

Rather than stemming from misunderstandings, their issues arise from genuine collaboration as they work together to find solutions.",

The portrayal of the polyamorous dynamic between Mel, Bebe, and Kade is exceptionally well-crafted. The development of Kade and Mel's connection is particularly engaging, as their contrasting personalities reveal surprising similarities.",

The polyamorous relationship between Mel, Bebe, and Kade was written incredibly well.  \n\n- **Communication and Conflict Resolution:**  \n  It was refreshing to read about a poly relationship where the miscommunication trope doesn't pop up. The three of them are incredibly good at communicating (minus a little blip here and there), and it makes the problems that arise in the book feel more meaningful when they're not based on miscommunication. Instead, they're all working together to find a solution.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Growth:**  \n  The buildup with Kade and Mel getting to know each other was really interesting to read because their personalities are so different, yet shockingly similar.  \n\n- **Author's Writing Style and Consistency:**  \n  This is the second book I've read by TJ Alexander, and it definitely won't be the last.

            "The story lacked conflict, rendering it somewhat unrealistic. It seems improbable that a newcomer to polyamory would experience no jealousy, internal struggles, or concerns about coming out. Additionally, every minor conflict was resolved by the following chapter, diminishing the overall excitement of the narrative.",

It was refreshing to see three distinct relationships evolve rather than a typical \"unicorn\" scenario. The characters communicated well and showed politeness and understanding, but this lack of tension made the narrative less engaging. Additionally, the significant financial disparity between the characters was left unexplored, which felt like a missed opportunity for deeper storytelling.",

Poly romance books can often focus on the ~taboo~, but *Triple Sec* felt so much more authentic. It was like, “hey we’re just three people navigating this big weird world and we just all happen to like each other.”  \n\n- **Character Development (Mel):**  \n  Mel was a bit frustrating at times, but I feel like it was almost intentional. She seemed to deliberately misunderstand what a poly relationship would (or could) look like when she first started dating Bebe. However, as the relationship(s) progressed, so did Mel’s understanding. I think Mel had to be a little frustrating at first so that she could grow and develop as a partner.  \n\n- **Character Appeal (Bebe and Kade):**  \n  In the end, I was in love with Mel, Bebe, and Kade (but especially Kade, my sweet stoic artist).  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I LOVED this book.

            "The story fell short in terms of tension and conflict. While the avoidance of a clichéd third-act breakup was a welcome change, the overall narrative felt simplistic and dismissible, lacking the complexity and challenges inherent in real-life relationships, particularly polyamorous ones. Certain scenes, such as the one featuring Mel’s ex-wife, seemed unnecessary, as they did not meaningfully advance the plot or contribute to character development.",
            "The characters, particularly Mel, Bebe, and Kade, felt somewhat one-dimensional. Their personalities were largely defined by their sexuality and romantic interactions, lacking deeper exploration of their backgrounds, families, and careers. Bebe emerged as the most relatable character, thanks to her genuine spirit, humor, and warmth; her interactions with Mel and Kade were engaging. In contrast, Kade came off as overly serious and detached, primarily focused on art, making it harder to connect with them. The relationship between Kade and Mel felt rushed and lacked adequate buildup or chemistry.\n\nMel herself was rather average—not particularly compelling, but not uninteresting either. The portrayal of polyamory was a refreshing and educational aspect, presenting a genuine and normalized perspective. The emphasis on communication, boundary-setting, and understanding each other's feelings was well-executed. While the dynamic between the three characters was intriguing, I wished for more scenes that showcased their interactions as a trio to better illustrate their balance and connection. The chemistry between Bebe and Mel was evident, but the connection between Kade and Mel felt forced and lacking depth. \n\nHowever, the romantic and intimate scenes were well-crafted, brimming with chemistry, especially during moments involving all three characters. The high “spice” level added to the overall enjoyment of the story.",

            "The plot is minimalistic, allowing a deeper exploration of the evolving romantic, sexual, and platonic relationships among the characters. It follows the protagonist's transformation from a divorcée who is wary of love to a joyful participant in a polyamorous relationship. Key moments include her encounters with a female attorney and her wife, the bar's acquisition by a conglomerate, a mixology contest, a vacation to Banff, and the development of various relationships. The epilogue ties up the story with satisfying resolutions for all characters. While the forced proximity trope of a multi-day blizzard in a Canadian cabin feels somewhat contrived and occurs about eight hours into the audiobook, the pacing still prioritizes relationship dynamics over a complex plot.",
            "The protagonist's journey is at the heart of the story, as she evolves from discomfort with casual dating to a more accepting view of love and polyamory. However, the primary nonbinary character feels underdeveloped; their strong attraction to the protagonist comes across as sudden and inadequately justified. Additionally, the roommate's disclosure of being polyamorous seems coincidental, serving more as a plot device than a genuine part of the protagonist's growth.",
            "The author shines in crafting mixology scenes, vividly capturing the sights, smells, and tastes of the drinks. However, general physical descriptions are limited and tend to be repetitive, often relying on phrases like \"honey hair.\" The nonbinary character is given minimal physical details—curly red hair and androgynous clothing—making their subsequent misgendering feel jarring and unaddressed."

            "The cocktail competition and extensive cocktail descriptions didn't engage me, likely due to my limited knowledge of alcohol. Mel's indecision about mixing drinks, despite being portrayed as a talented mixologist, slowed the plot and diminished the tension I expected. While I appreciated the emphasis on LGBTQ+ joy, the absence of obstacles or substantial conflict left the story feeling flat. The almost break-up felt contrived, adding little to the overall tension.",

The discussions about different lifestyle and relationship choices were insightful and engaging. I also loved the positive ending, which celebrated LGBTQ+ joy rather than focusing on trauma. Overall, this book serves as a gentle introduction for anyone interested in exploring polyamorous fiction.",

Ottoman book feels like a love letter to New York state, a place I’ve never been but feel fond of when reading his books.  \n  - *You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty* by Akwaeke Emezi: On the bland-to-edgy scale, *Triple Sec* is solidly at the \"bland\" end, while this book is at the \"edgy\" end. Both books share similar plot points and taboo romances, but *You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty* executes it in a much more interesting way.  \n  - *Sing Anyway* by Anita Kelly: The characters in *Sing Anyway* are capital F Fat, and I love them for it. In contrast, the author of *Triple Sec* seems to avoid directly describing Bebe as fat, using phrases like \"otherworldly hips,\" which felt othering to me.\n\n- **Romance and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  My biggest problem with *Triple Sec* is that I didn’t care about the romance, which is a key aspect of a romance novel. Unfortunately, this lack of emotional connection made the book fall flat for me.\n\n- **Memorability and Execution:**  \n  I finished *Triple Sec* yesterday, and it was totally unmemorable. The execution of the story and characters didn’t leave a lasting impression on me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Triple Sec* was a disappointing read for me. While I recognize that my dislike for contemporary fiction may have played a role, the book failed to engage me emotionally, and its execution felt bland compared to other works in the genre. I would recommend exploring the alternative books I mentioned instead.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The book presents a commendable representation of diverse characters and sexualities, including the non-binary character Kade, prompting me to recognize the gap in my own reading and the need for more inclusive stories. Throughout the narrative, Mel experiences significant self-reflection and growth as she navigates her thoughts on love, relationships, and her romantic history, especially regarding her ex. She also confronts and improves her relationship with her best friend and roommate. Additionally, Mel pursues her artistic aspirations and dreams of opening a cocktail lounge. Her dynamic with Bebe feels lively and authentic, whereas her connection with Kade lacks development. Mel's surprise at Kade's revelation of feelings feels unearned, as there was little foreshadowing of her interest. Furthermore, some relationship conflicts are resolved too conveniently, lacking depth and follow-up.",

The cocktail competition element is also engaging, though the ending feels predictable.\n\n- **Criticism from Other Reviewers:**\n   - Some reviewers feel that the characters are archetypes for their sexualities, lacking depth and complexity. They also find the world and problems too simplistic, with not enough conflict or tension. Some describe the book as instructional or didactic, particularly in its portrayal of polyamory.

            "I consistently admire this author's writing for its authentic representation of queer characters, avoiding attempts to cater to a straight, cis, or monogamous audience. The book steers clear of the typical romance novel tropes, which I truly appreciated. Instead, it carves its own path with a soft, steady, and sincere narrative that remains accessible to readers unfamiliar with polyamory. Mel, often out of her depth, navigates these relationships without requiring prior knowledge from the reader. This makes the book an excellent recommendation for anyone seeking a thoughtful portrayal of a functioning polyamorous relationship grounded in trust and communication."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Writing Style and Approach:**\n   - I consistently love TJ Alexander's writing because it doesn't try to make queer characters' thoughts, lifestyles, or life choices broadly palatable to a straight, cis, or monogamous audience.\n   - The book ignores the typical 'romancing the beat' structures common in romance novels, which I appreciated. It does its own thing and does it well.\n\n- **Representation of Polyamory:**\n   - The book does an excellent job of depicting how the protagonist, Mel, navigates being polyamorous. It explores her expectations based on monogamous relationships, her questions, slip-ups, mistakes, and discoveries.\n   - Unlike many books billed as poly/why-choose, this one falls neatly into the \"actually poly\" category, which I found refreshing and accurate.\n\n- **Focus on Relationships vs. Spice:**\n   - While there are spicy moments, the focus is on the relationships rather than the \"zesty possibilities\" of having multiple partners.\n   - The conflict is realistic, with Mel panicking at times, but there's no huge third-act breakup or grand gesture, making the story plausible and relatable.\n\n- **Portrayal of the Food Service Industry:**\n   - Alexander's depiction of the food service industry is spot-on and relatable. Mel's manager is so accurately infuriating that I wanted to \"yeet him straight into the sun\" because I've worked for someone like him.\n\n- **Accessibility and Tone:**\n   - The book is soft, steady, and sincere, making it accessible even to readers unfamiliar with polyamory. Mel is often out of her depth, so no prior knowledge is expected.\n   - It’s a great recommendation for anyone looking for a decent depiction of a functioning poly relationship based on trust and communication.\n\n- **Easter Eggs and Cameos:**\n   - I loved the little cameo from Ray, one of the stars of *Chef's Kiss*! It was a delightful touch for fans of Alexander's previous work.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTriple Sec is a heartfelt, authentic, and refreshing take on polyamory and relationships, grounded in trust and communication. TJ Alexander's writing shines by breaking away from traditional romance structures and offering a story that feels real and relatable. The accurate portrayal of the food service industry adds an extra layer of authenticity, and the cameo from *Chef's Kiss* is a treat for fans.

            "This story features deeply flawed yet relatable characters that I thoroughly enjoyed. Mel, a jaded, divorced bartender, has lost faith in love, while Bebe, happily married to Kade, provides Mel with a chance to explore a new connection. Kade, who is neurodiverse, adds a unique layer to their relationships, which are portrayed with remarkable depth. Each dynamic—between Mel and Bebe, Mel and Kade, and Kade and Bebe—feels distinct and well-developed.\n\nThe author skillfully develops each relationship while emphasizing open communication. For instance, when Bebe invites Mel on a date, Kade is present to ensure transparency and consent. The evolution of Mel and Bebe's relationship from casual to emotionally profound feels organic and compelling. Similarly, Mel and Kade's bond, while different, is equally authentic.\n\nThe moment when all three characters come together as a trio, while maintaining their individual connections, is beautifully executed. The representation of a woman-woman-nonbinary relationship feels fresh and genuine. Kade's neurodiversity is portrayed with care and realism, resonating deeply with me as someone who identifies as neurodiverse.

However, TJ Alexander manages to pull it off exceptionally well.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters are flawed and human, which I love to see. Mel is a jaded, divorced bartender who doesn’t believe in love anymore. Bebe is happily married to Kade but offers Mel a unique opportunity to explore a connection. Kade is neurodiverse, and their approach to relationships is distinct and realistic.\n   - The depth of all three characters and their relationships is incredible.

It felt natural and not forced, which is rare in polyamorous romances. After reading a book with poor communication, this was a breath of fresh air.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - This is one of the best traditionally published polyamorous romances I’ve read. It’s chaotic in the best way—queer, heartfelt, and full of flawed but real characters.\n   - I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a romance that’s both chaotic and deeply satisfying. It’s gay as hell and an absolute joy to read.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTJ Alexander’s novel is a masterfully crafted polyamorous romance that excels in character development, relationship dynamics, and authentic representation.

            "The story follows Mel, a passionate cocktail enthusiast, as she navigates her career and a complicated romantic relationship with Bebe and Kade. The plot is engaging, particularly with Mel's journey toward her dream of owning a bar. However, the middle section feels somewhat disjointed and less developed, suggesting that the narrative might have been better suited as a trilogy instead of a single book.",
            "The author aptly describes the book as “3 romances for the price of one,” and this captures its essence well. The relationships are intricate and demand thoughtful exploration, which diverges from typical romance narratives. While this approach is refreshing, it occasionally affects the story’s cohesion. I enjoyed the book overall, but I didn’t feel a strong connection to the characters or a sense of extraordinary chemistry between them. While I was invested in their relationships, it lacked the butterflies factor for me, leading to my 3.5 rating.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Exploration of Polyamory/Open Relationships:**\n   - This was my first foray into fiction that focused heavily on open relationship/polyamory dynamics. I don’t know much about the rules of ethical non-monogamy or the lifestyle, so I can’t speak to the accuracy or ethics portrayed in the book. However, I found the exploration of these dynamics interesting and engaging.\n\n- **Character Connection and Development:**\n   - I enjoyed reading the book but didn’t feel overly connected to the characters or blown away by their connections. While I bought into their relationships, it wasn’t a butterflies-level romance for me, which is why I rated it a 3.5 rather than higher.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**\n   - The story follows Mel, a passionate cocktail enthusiast, as she navigates her career and a complex romantic situation with Bebe and Kade. The plot was intriguing, especially with the added layer of Mel’s journey toward her dream of owning a bar. However, the middle part of the book felt a bit disconnected and not as fleshed out. It almost felt like this could have been a series of three books rather than one.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics and Relationships:**\n   - The author billed the book as “3 romances for the price of one,” which felt accurate. The relationships were complex and required careful exploration, which made the story deviate from the standard romance timeline. While this was refreshing, it also made certain parts feel less cohesive.\n\n- **Author’s Skill and Future Potential:**\n   - Alexander did a good job of keeping me invested in the story and curious about the outcomes. I’m excited to see what they write next, as they show promise in crafting engaging narratives.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this was an enjoyable read that introduced me to the complexities of polyamory and open relationships. While I didn’t feel deeply connected to the characters, the plot was engaging, and the author’s storytelling kept me interested. The book had some pacing issues in the middle, but it was a solid effort that left me curious about the author’s future works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3.5 (rounded up to 4)."

            "The characters in this story are largely one-dimensional, defined more by their careers than by personal depth. Mel, the main character, is theoretically likable but ultimately comes across as annoying, especially in moments like eating a taco with a fork. Although she shows growth by the end, it remains challenging to connect with her. In contrast, the secondary character, Daniel, emerges as a standout favorite, eclipsing the main characters. \n\nChemistry among the characters is noticeably lacking until the very end. The first two spicy scenes feel cringy and disjointed, with Mel's behavior particularly off-putting. However, the final spicy scene is a significant improvement, showcasing genuine chemistry. \n\n*Potential Spoiler Alert*: The second spicy scene feels forced, lacking any prior indication of Mel's crush on the non-binary character, which makes it appear sudden and unexpected. *End Spoiler* \n\nAdditionally, the absence of main characters who are people of color is disappointing. While one character is of Italian descent, this does not fulfill the need for diverse representation. The class disparity between Mel, Bebe, and Kade is awkwardly addressed, with missed opportunities for deeper discussions arising from Mel's occasional jokes about the topic. Overall, the story leaves much to be desired in character development and thematic depth.",
            "The first half of the book was slow and unengaging, nearly leading me to abandon it. However, the last 15% proved to be the strongest part, redeeming the earlier shortcomings and ultimately enhancing the overall experience."

        "conclusion": "While *Triple Sec* has its merits as a lighthearted queer romance centered on polyamory with some spicy scenes, it fell short in character development, chemistry, and representation. The lack of POC main characters and awkward handling of class disparity were notable drawbacks. However, the later chapters redeemed the book, making it worth finishing despite the initial struggles.",

            "I was captivated by each of the three characters for distinct reasons, both individually and in their interactions. Mel, the passionate bartender, views mixology as her calling, a thrilling escape from her jaded experience of love following her divorce. Her life shifts dramatically when Bebe enters, their instant chemistry igniting new possibilities. However, Mel's hopes are dashed when Bebe's wife, Kade, unexpectedly appears. Rather than retreating, Mel seizes the opportunity to build a friendship and accepts their invitation for brunch. To my surprise, Bebe proposes a polyamorous relationship, initially asking Mel to be her girlfriend, with Kade eventually joining in. Each character experiences significant growth through their evolving connections, making their journey compelling and relatable.",
            "This book provided me with valuable insights into the polyamorous lifestyle that I hadn’t fully grasped before. I now understand that honesty and open communication play crucial roles, supported by mutual agreements and regular check-ins among all parties. The characters—Mel, Bebe, and her wife Kade—establish clear rules for their relationship that are frequently revisited and adapted as their dynamics evolve. Beyond just depicting polyamory, the narrative also delves into themes of gender fluidity, radical acceptance, and the societal norms surrounding monogamy and heterosexuality. Mel's journey challenges her previous notions of love and relationships, expanding her understanding to a much broader perspective.",

I thoroughly enjoyed this F/F/NB romance book.\n\n- **Educational Value:**  \n  I feel like I learned a lot about the poly lifestyle I wasn't aware of before reading this book. I now realize that there is more honesty and open communication involved than I had previously thought, complete with mutual written agreements and frequent check-ins between all parties concerned. Rules for the relationship are written out ahead of time and are frequently updated and changed as the situation evolves and grows between the main characters, Mel, Bebe, and her wife Kade.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I found myself drawn to each of these three characters for different reasons, both individually and while they are together. Mel is passionate about her job as a bartender. It's not just about a bar job for her: mixology is her passion, what makes her soul feel alive. She is divorced and a bit jaded in love. When Bebe walks into her life, all of that changes as their connection is instant, the chemistry between them palpable. Then, Bebe's wife Kade walks into the bar, and Mel's hopes are dashed. Still, she sees this as an opportunity to make friends and takes them up on their brunch offer. Imagine Mel's surprise when Bebe asks her to join their poly relationship. At first, Bebe asks Mel to be her girlfriend. Eventually, over time, Kade joins in the mix. I found myself drawn to these characters as each of them grows during their time together in their own way.\n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**  \n  The book explores more than just what a poly relationship is like. It explores the notion of gender fluidity, radical acceptance, and monogamy and heterosexuality as the \"standard.\" Mel challenges her definition of \"love\" and what a \"relationship\" is, finding it much broader than she initially thought.\n\n- **Writing Style and Enjoyment:**  \n  The steam in this book is sooooo delicious! I laughed quite a bit at the banter between these three characters as well. Overall, a well-written, thoughtful, sexy, boozy delight!\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley, TJ Alexander, Atria Books, and Atria/Emily Bestler Books for the complimentary ARC of this book. All opinions are my own. I was not compensated for this review.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Triple Sec\" by TJ Alexander is a well-written, thoughtful, and sexy exploration of polyamory, gender fluidity, and radical acceptance. The characters are compelling, the chemistry is palpable, and the book offers both entertainment and educational value. It’s a delightful read that challenges societal norms and broadens the definition of love and relationships.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars!"

            "The story is enjoyable, though the ending felt somewhat lacking. I'm not sure what was missing, perhaps because I've recently encountered many \"secretly meaningful\" romances.

As Mel forms connections with Bebe, a charming customer in an open marriage, and Kade, she begins to realize that love can be more fulfilling and multifaceted than she previously thought. The subplot of a cocktail competition ties seamlessly into Mel's dream of owning her own bar, adding excitement to the narrative.

            "The characters in this story are truly captivating. Mel serves as the anchor, offering her perspective as she navigates the aftermath of a tough divorce and reenters the dating scene. I particularly appreciated her journey toward understanding polyamory; she starts with little knowledge, needing her best friend to explain it, and gradually explores it first with Bebe and later with both Bebe and her partner, Kade. Initially, I feared Bebe and Kade might lack depth, but my concerns quickly dissipated. Bebe's outgoing and endearing nature shines through immediately, while Kade, who is more reserved, takes a bit longer to warm up to Mel. As Mel learns more about Kade, he too opens up, enriching their evolving dynamic. I loved witnessing their growth as a polycule, including the ongoing development of their “Guidelines for Poly Living,” complete with revisions and addendums.",
            "This is a beautifully crafted book that I highly recommend to readers seeking a softer yet still steamy, queer-affirming story.",
            "Having enjoyed the author's previous works, I was eager to see their next offering. The announcement of *Triple Sec* as a polyamorous romcom piqued my interest. While I wouldn't call it as \"groundbreaking\" as the editor suggests in the introductory letter of the ARC—having encountered similar premises in self-published books—it's still refreshing to see this perspective embraced by traditional publishing, especially from a relatively new author in the industry."

        "conclusion": "*Triple Sec* is a heartfelt, well-crafted polyamorous romcom that balances emotional depth with steamy moments. The characters are richly developed, and the exploration of polyamory is handled with maturity and care. It’s a great addition to the author’s body of work and a delightful read for fans of queer romance.",

While this isn’t necessarily as “groundbreaking” as the editor claims in the introductory letter included with the ARC (I’ve read self-published books with a similar premise), it is a cool thing to see from traditional publishing, especially from an author who hasn’t been in the industry all that long.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are absolutely wonderful. Mel anchors the story as the POV character, and I love how she starts off the book having just gone through a tough divorce and is navigating the dating world again. I particularly enjoyed seeing how she opened up to the idea of polyamory as the story went on, starting off not really understanding it, with her best friend even having to explain it to her, and then navigating it for the first time, first with just Bebe, and then with Bebe and her partner, Kade.  \n\n- **Secondary Characters:**  \n  While I was worried the other two would be less defined, making it harder to empathize with them, I did not have to worry. Bebe was instantly endearing, being very outgoing and sweet, while Kade took time to get to know, in part because Mel didn’t start off dating them, but also because Kade is more reserved. As Mel got to know Kade, they opened up too.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  I really liked seeing how the three of them evolved as a polycule over time, including the constant evolution of their personal “Guidelines for Poly Living,” with notations of the many revisions and addendums.  \n\n- **Handling of Polyamory:**  \n  While I don’t know a ton about polyamory (and don’t assume this reflects the experience of all polyamorous people), I love that they handled each step maturely and with great communication.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Appeal:**  \n  This is such a beautiful book, and I’d recommend it to readers looking for a softer, yet still fairly steamy, queer-affirming read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Triple Sec* is a heartfelt, well-crafted polyamorous romcom that balances emotional depth with steamy moments. The characters are richly developed, and the exploration of polyamory is handled with maturity and care.

            "Bebe possesses an otherworldly quality, marked by a polished demeanor and impeccable style that lend her an almost elder-like wisdom. However, her characterization feels at odds with her purported age (in her 30s), making her resemble a 50-year-old mentor guiding Mel through a romantic journey. This dynamic results in a lack of the tension and chemistry I anticipated, leaving the romantic scenes feeling underwhelming.\n\nIn contrast, Kade, Bebe's nonbinary wife, shines as a standout character thanks to vivid descriptions, realistic flaws, and a self-deprecating humor that make them relatable. Kade’s increased presence in the second half of the book introduces depth and conflict, enhancing the overall narrative. Their style, dialogue, and occasional missteps contribute to their authenticity, making Kade my favorite character.\n\nUltimately, the romantic tension between Mel and Bebe didn’t resonate as strongly as I had hoped, which affected my enjoyment of the more intimate scenes.

However, when a snowstorm traps them together on a ski trip in Banff without Bebe, their situation prompts a shift in dynamics. This forced proximity allows for better communication and the development of their relationship. The chemistry between the characters is well-crafted, and the pacing is excellent, making the progression of their relationships feel natural. The balance of emotional and romantic tension is particularly noteworthy, enhancing the overall experience.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Trope Uniqueness:**  \n   - The polyamorous trope in this book is refreshingly unique, featuring an FFNB (female, female, non-binary) dynamic instead of the more common MMF, MFM, or MFF configurations.  \n   - The setup is intriguing, with a married couple (F/NB) in an open relationship, and the addition of a new girlfriend creating a poly threesome. The tension between the characters, especially Mel and Kade, adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Mel, a bartender, is instantly attracted to Bebe but discovers Bebe is in a relationship with Kade, her non-binary spouse.  \n   - Kade convinces Bebe to bring Mel into their open relationship, but Mel and Kade initially have little interaction, and Mel feels Kade doesn’t like her.  \n   - A ski trip to Banff, where Mel and Kade are snowed in together without Bebe, becomes a turning point. Their forced proximity leads to better communication and a shift in their dynamic.  \n\n- **Setting and Realism:**  \n   - The Banff setting is vividly described and feels authentic, especially to readers familiar with the area.  \n   - The storm and power outage during the ski trip serve as a realistic and effective plot device to bring Mel and Kade closer.  \n\n- **Chemistry and Pacing:**  \n   - The chemistry between the characters is well-developed, and the story’s pacing is excellent.  \n   - The progression of the relationships feels natural, and the emotional and romantic tension is balanced perfectly.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n   - The book handles queer and non-binary representation beautifully, with Mel defending Kade’s pronouns even before they become friends.  \n   - The themes of communication, openness, and navigating complex relationships are explored thoughtfully.  \n\n- **Spice and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - The romantic and spicy scenes are well-written, though I wished for a few more intimate moments.  \n   - The emotional depth of the story, particularly the evolving relationships, is a standout feature.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is another excellent release from TJ Alexander, rivaling *Port Stephen* as one of my favorites.

They express outwardly what many of us only feel internally, representing the essence of living an authentic life.\n   - Kade’s character is both inspiring and relatable, making them a highlight of the story.\n\n- **Handling of Gender Identity:**\n   - A particularly impactful scene involves Kade being misgendered repeatedly in an airport lounge, culminating in a confrontation where Mel defends Kade.\n   - The bartender’s ignorant comment (“I thought only women can be non-binary”) is both painfully realistic and absurd, capturing the bizarre and often hurtful interactions non-binary individuals face.\n   - This scene was deeply resonant for me, as it reflects the challenges and microaggressions that come with navigating gender identity in a cisnormative world.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI highly recommend this book for its readability, relevance, and depth. It balances serious themes with an overall fun and engaging narrative. This is the second book I’ve read by this author, and I would definitely read more.

Additionally, the conclusions about relationships became repetitive, as they were repeatedly “proven” through various scenarios, offering little opportunity for readers to form their own insights.",

            "This captivating polyamorous romance was my first in the genre, and it serves as a valuable resource for questioning queer individuals seeking to understand their identities and the nature of relationships within queer culture. The book thoughtfully addresses complex topics such as pronouns, sexuality, and labels, and I felt a sense of safety as a bisexual woman while reading it. The end-game relationship acts as a beautiful blueprint for queer connections. Its poignant message—that one need not conform to conventional expectations in relationships, particularly within the LGBTQIA+ community—resonates deeply and is both relatable and uplifting."

Overall, the story’s pacing is engaging, maintaining enough tension and development to keep me invested. The main plot centers on a drink-making competition and Mel's aspiration to own her own bar. The bar, Terror & Virtue, serves as a crucial meeting point for the characters and significantly influences the narrative. While the plot takes a backseat to the relationships, it provides a solid foundation for character interactions.",

The initial tension and awkwardness between Mel and Kade, stemming from their contrasting senses of humor, adds depth to their relationship. Mel's struggle with polyamory and her feelings of insecurity compared to Kade and Bebe—who are already in an established relationship and come from a different socioeconomic background—creates relatable conflict. Their relationship develops gradually at first, hindered by Kade’s lack of expressiveness, but once they connect, it accelerates quickly. The adjustments to their relationship guidelines and the focus on communication are particularly well-executed. Moreover, Mel’s growth throughout the story allows her to develop a deeper understanding of her roommate and friend, subverting the common trope of friendships deteriorating because of romantic entanglements.",

The relationships between Mel, Bebe, and Kade are thoughtfully developed, with each given individual attention. I appreciated how the narrative explored Mel's dynamics with Bebe and Kade separately, allowing for a deeper understanding of each character. However, Kade felt slightly underdeveloped compared to Bebe, and I craved more insight into his past and artistic pursuits. Daniel, Mel's best friend, added depth through conflicts and resolutions. Nevertheless, the story noticeably lacks family and side characters—while Bebe and Kade host a brunch early on, those characters do not reappear, which felt like a missed opportunity. The absence of family or found family dynamics for the main characters left some emotional depth unexplored.",

            "This story centers on Bebe and Kade, an open couple who permit each other to explore relationships outside their marriage. Mel, initially dating Bebe, adds a fresh twist to the narrative, as many poly romances typically involve established couples welcoming a third partner. I appreciated the emphasis on mature communication and authentic relationship-building, which felt both refreshing and realistic compared to the often contrived dynamics in other romance novels.\n\nI was particularly drawn to Mel's passion for her career and her creativity in crafting unique cocktails. Her concoctions, like the apple butter bourbon with maple syrup and cinnamon, sounded so enticing that I was tempted to try them, despite my usual aversion to bourbon. This entertaining rom-com is infused with queer joy, making it a delightful pick for Pride reads. Its distinctive approach to polyamory truly sets it apart from others in the genre.",

The focus on open, mature communication and building actual relationships was one of my favorite aspects. The way the characters handled the complexities of their dynamic felt refreshing and realistic, unlike other triads in romance novels that often feel fictional.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I especially loved Mel’s passion for her career and her creativity in crafting new drinks. Her concoctions, like the apple butter bourbon with maple syrup and cinnamon, sounded so delicious that I wanted to try them, even though I don’t usually like bourbon.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTriple Sec is a standout poly romance that offers a fresh, realistic take on open relationships and emphasizes healthy communication. It’s an entertaining and insightful read, with well-developed characters and a unique focus on queer joy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Complicating matters is Bebe's marriage to Kade, an artist, as they navigate a polyamorous relationship. This dynamic becomes more intricate when Mel develops feelings for both.",

I would have read this queer triad romance even if it HADN'T been from an author I already trust.\n\n- **Unique Gender Arrangement:**  \n  The gender arrangement of this trio surprised me—definitely one I hadn't read before.\n\n- **Tone and Conflict:**  \n  Like their other books, this is a feel-good time, with just the right amount of understated conflict.\n\n- **Plot Setup and Premise:**  \n  The setup is that Mel, a bartender still getting over her divorce, is hit on by Bebe, a hot attorney. However, Bebe is married to Kade, an artist. The twist? Bebe and Kade are polyamorous and in an open relationship, which complicates things when Mel starts catching feelings for both of them.\n\n- **Character Development and Perspective:**  \n  The book is told entirely from Mel's perspective, and it packs a lot in. We see her navigate romances with Bebe and Kade individually, then witness the three coming together. Meanwhile, Mel juggles her bestie-ship with her coworker/roommate and her journey to compete in a cocktail competition.\n\n- **Pacing and Depth:**  \n  While all the storylines gel together well, the downside is that we don’t get to luxuriate in any one of them. This is a small quibble, though.\n\n- **Representation of Polyamory:**  \n  I loved the portrayal of a polyamorous relationship. True to Alexander's style, it’s low-drama and low-conflict, offering something close to the ideal.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation:**  \n  I’m definitely looking forward to Alexander's next book. They keep it very creative and deliver a happily-ever-after (HEA) for queer readers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a feel-good, low-drama exploration of a unique queer triad romance, told from the perspective of a relatable protagonist juggling love, friendship, and personal growth.

Alexander novel I've read, and I'm absolutely blown away! *TRIPLE SEC* is a fun, sexy romance novel with a compelling and lovable queer cast, and it definitely earns all five stars I'm giving it. If you like polyamory, queer romance, or mixology, do yourself a favor and pre-order this book!\n\n- **Representation of Polyamory:**  \n  This is one of very few polyamorous novels I've read that feels like it's written FOR polyamorous people, and not primarily a curious monogamous audience. Alexander touches on a lot of the key \"poly\" topics—for example, the characters write out the agreements for their relationships, discuss jealousy, and use terms like \"metamour\" with ease. I think Alexander strikes a good balance between showing characters communicating and having heavy/less \"sexy\" conversations (since real-life non-monogamy requires a LOT of that) and letting the characters just enjoy their fun new relationships.\n\n- **Mixology and Bartending:**  \n  I don't know very much about bartending or the beverage world, so I can't speak to any accuracy in that way, but it was still very interesting to read about, and I left the novel with a new appreciation for mixology. (Tip your bartenders!!!)\n\n- **Representation of Queerness and Transness:**  \n  I love how transness, queerness, and sexuality were represented in this novel. I think Kade's genderqueerness was handled with a lot of care and thought (which makes sense from what I know about Alexander's other books). I also LOVED the conversations about topping/bottoming and what each character's preferences were, almost even more than the actual sex scenes themselves—although those were of course great, too! ;)\n\n- **Author's Writing Style:**  \n  Alexander's writing style is engaging and thoughtful, balancing heavy topics with lighthearted moments. The characters feel authentic, and their relationships are portrayed with depth and care.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*TRIPLE SEC* is a standout polyamorous romance novel that feels authentic, inclusive, and fun. T.J. Alexander has crafted a story that not only entertains but also thoughtfully represents queer and polyamorous experiences.

As a former bartender, I can attest that we absolutely take pride in our work, regardless of the setting.  \n\n- **Themes and Broader Appeal:**  \n  - We need more depictions of non-traditional romances. As Mel learned, there are many people whose romantic relationships don't fit the traditional monogamous, til-death-do-us-part mold.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed this book!

This was a refreshing departure from one-dimensional characters often seen in romance novels.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  - The book had a clear plot and a compelling story to tell, which kept me engaged throughout.  \n  - The balance between the romance and the characters’ individual lives made the story feel rich and well-rounded.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTriple Sec is a beautifully written, intentional, and heartwarming novel that explores love, identity, and relationships with depth and care. TJ’s storytelling and character development are exceptional, and this book has solidified my love for their work. I would eagerly read anything they write in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated the book's structure, divided into three parts that mirror the evolution of the relationship. The narrative effectively employs tropes such as grumpy x sunshine, forced proximity, opposites attract, and the journey from strangers to friends to lovers, adding depth and variety. Themes of healing, forgiveness, and the sensitive portrayal of trauma were handled with care, which I found particularly commendable.",
            "In *Triple Sec*, the author excels at character development, creating a cast with strong chemistry and depth. Mel is a confident, sarcastic, and creative spirit (those drink recipes are a must!), while BeBe is vivacious and sensual. Kade, introspective and artistic, brings a thoughtful perspective to the group. This was my first experience with a non-binary main character, and I quickly grew to love them; beneath their tough exterior lies a surprising romantic side. \n\nThe novel beautifully navigates themes of self-discovery and the evolution of a polyamorous relationship. The open communication among the characters, even when challenging, is a refreshing portrayal of relationships, capturing not just the honeymoon phase but also the complexities of love. The dynamic between BeBe, Kade, and Mel is healthy and devoid of toxicity, making it a pleasure to read.",

            "I appreciate how Mel navigates her complex relationships with Kade and Bebe. While the development of both relationships feels rushed within a single book, Mel’s emotional journey is relatable as she tries to keep them separate out of fear of asking for too much. Despite the unrealistic setting, her struggle to manage these dynamics comes across as genuine. However, some character aspects lack believability. For instance, Bebe’s habit of \"controlling the situation\" and intervening in issues that aren’t hers comes off as more annoying than charming. It’s hard to believe that strangers in New York would welcome her unsolicited input in their problems.",

While I recognize that polyamory may be unfamiliar to some, I expected a story that would resonate with those already comfortable in queer narratives. Instead, the writing felt overly focused on being politically correct, attempting to educate the reader at every turn. This approach detracted from its authenticity and made it seem like it was pandering to an audience unlikely to engage with the book in the first place."

            "This novel makes significant strides for the LGBTQIA+ community by featuring nonbinary main characters and a polyamorous relationship, a rarity in traditionally published works. The author brilliantly illustrates what a polyamorous relationship can look like, enhancing queer representation. The three main characters—Mel, Bebe, and Kade—are well-developed, each with unique and engaging personalities. The supporting cast adds depth to the narrative, enriching the overall story. \n\nThe transition from three separate relationships to a cohesive polyamorous dynamic among the trio is skillfully executed. However, the focus occasionally shifts too heavily toward explaining polyamory, sidelining the emotional development of their connections. Mel’s internal monologue often revolves around the logistics of a poly lifestyle, which detracts from the exploration of her growing feelings for Bebe and Kade. Overall, the novel offers a fresh and meaningful perspective on polyamorous relationships while also highlighting the challenges of emotional engagement within them.",
            "The story would have improved with greater emphasis on the emotional tension and character development between Mel and Bebe, as well as Mel and Kade. The transition from Mel and Bebe's relationship to the inclusion of Kade felt somewhat underdeveloped in terms of emotional progression."

However, I found the main character, Mel, difficult to relate to, despite my familiarity with the drink service industry and the poly dating scene.

            "The book left me wanting more, particularly in terms of relationship development. The subplot involving Bebe convincing Mel to enter a cocktail competition felt distracting and diminished the focus on their relationship. Additionally, the rushed ending made the competition seem insignificant to the overall narrative.",

However, I wished for more individual development for Kade and Mel, as well as a deeper exploration of the three of them navigating their unique relationship together.",

Each character is distinct: Mel, a talented bartender navigating life after divorce, is on a journey of self-discovery, both personally and professionally.

Going in blind added so many unexpected plot twists that wouldn’t have been as surprising if I had read the blurb beforehand. This made the story way more fun for me.  \n\n- **Romance Novel Tropes:**  \n  I appreciated how cozy this romance novel felt. I dislike the third-act breakup trope that’s common in many romance novels because it often makes me question whether the characters should stay together. This book avoided that entirely, which I loved. It didn’t leave me feeling grossed out by a questionable reconciliation.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I wanted a little more depth from the main characters. While everyone had their moment to discuss past traumas, it wasn’t enough to fully solidify their personalities and backstories for me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt a bit uneven at times. Time would skip ahead weeks, slow down for a day or two, then jump forward again by a month or more. While all the big relationship moments were included, the back-and-forth timing made the flow feel rushed and inconsistent.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed this cozy romance novel, especially because it avoided the overused third-act breakup trope. However, I wished for more character depth and a smoother pacing structure.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded up to 4)."

It was great to watch her grow, become more comfortable, and understand poly relationships and the boundaries that come with them.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The relationships were interesting. All three people at the heart of the relationship are so different, but I feel that only two of them had the right amount of depth. It would have been nice to have one other person further expanded on.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  I wasn’t really enjoying where the book was going around the 50% mark, but then I hit 60% and was 100% all in again.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Uniqueness:**  \n  I enjoyed this! It was a unique read for me, and something I probably wouldn’t have thought to reach for in the past. Stepping out of that comfort zone can lead you to amazing stories, and I think people should do it more often.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  All in all, this was sweet and sexy, but I could have used a smidge more depth to certain characters!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a refreshing and unique read that explored polyamory in a thoughtful way, though some characters could have been more developed. Despite a slight dip in engagement midway, the story picked up and became thoroughly enjoyable. It’s a sweet and sexy novel that encourages readers to step out of their comfort zones.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐️"

The character development was very good, with each individual's personality and role clearly displayed.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Characters and Themes:**  \n  I didn't appreciate the author portraying the older white men as all being misogynistic or jealous of Bebe's lesbian/poly identity (the latter seemed incredibly cliche). The author's approach came off as judgmental and closed-minded, especially with so much more awareness in today's world and especially in a city like New York. If the author's goal was to create more unity, awareness, and open-mindedness, she could have created \"older white males\" who were supportive or who just didn't care (which is how virtually all older white people I know respond - \"it's not my business\"). The ageism, with skin color thrown in, was just distasteful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was an easy and light read with strong character development, the portrayal of older white men as uniformly misogynistic and judgmental detracted from the story. The author's approach felt cliched and closed-minded, which lowered my overall enjoyment and rating of the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2-2.5 out of 5."

Mel's reflections on her new connections felt genuine, capturing the complex thoughts people have when exploring new dynamics. The meaningful dialogues addressed conflicts and concerns, making me wish for partners who could communicate that effectively. I appreciated the depth of the characters, though I noticed that Daniel's role diminished as the story progressed. Initially a main character, he faded into the background as Bebe and Kade took center stage. While this shift reflects real-life dynamics, I found myself wanting more focus on his relationship with Mel, especially since he seemed so significant to her. For example, I was surprised he didn’t attend the competition at the end, despite his support for Mel throughout. Overall, the book is an excellent representation of queer love and polyamorous relationships, and I especially enjoyed the inclusion of poly and nonbinary characters, which felt refreshing and inclusive.",

I absolutely loved seeing poly and nonbinary characters and storylines, which felt refreshing and inclusive.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Desires:**  \n  The story left me emotionally invested and even craving a Paloma! It’s a book I would highly recommend to anyone who loves love stories, especially those centered on queer and polyamorous relationships.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“Triple Sec” is a beautifully written novel that excels in portraying realistic conversations and relationships, with a strong emphasis on queer and polyamorous love. While I wished for more focus on Daniel’s role in the latter half, the book’s inclusivity and emotional depth make it a highly recommended read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While I generally enjoy \"one true love\" stories, this narrative falters due to its characters' pervasive savior complex. Each scene features a main character swooping in to \"fix\" someone else's problem—whether it’s a girl uncomfortable on a date, an overwhelmed bartender, or two guys arguing. This repetitive rescue routine feels unrealistic and detracts from the story's authenticity. The rich lawyer's patronizing role in \"looking out for women\" and the bartender's support for his working-class peers come off as contrived and disingenuous, ultimately undermining the characters' depth.",

While the polyamorous romance was intriguing, it was somewhat overshadowed by miscommunication, which took center stage instead of remaining a subplot.

It had a lot of unabashed personality, which made it incredibly enjoyable.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Contrary to some other reviews, I actually loved each character dearly and appreciated how distinct each of their personalities were, rather than all blending into each other.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  While the book may not have been *perfect* and could have delved even deeper into the nuanced dynamics of gender, sexuality, and polyamory, it was still palatable for readers who may not already have an established understanding of those topics. At the same time, it was fun for readers who are already familiar with these themes.\n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  As someone who loves reading queer romances, this book was a delight. It was also my first time reading a polyamorous love story, which added a fresh and exciting layer to the narrative.\n\n- **Unique Elements:**  \n  The addition of sexy, delicious cocktails was a fun and unique touch that added to the overall charm of the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was everything I needed—fun, engaging, and full of personality. While it could have explored certain themes more deeply, it was still a delightful read that I highly recommend, especially for fans of queer and polyamorous romances.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐️ (rounded up)"

The polyamorous relationship among them is treated with care and nuance, with palpable romantic tension and authentic dynamics that captivate. This thoughtful exploration of unconventional relationships is a refreshing change in the romance genre.",

The three leads—Mel, Bebe, and Kade—are all distinct, fully realized individuals who feel like real people you could meet in everyday life. It’s rare to find a romance with even two well-developed leads, so having three is a testament to Alexander’s skill.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The polyamorous relationship between Mel, Bebe, and Kade is handled with care and nuance. The romantic tension is palpable, and the dynamics between the characters feel authentic and compelling. It’s refreshing to see a romance that explores unconventional relationships so thoughtfully.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The story is well-paced, with a balance of romantic tension, humor, and emotional depth. Alexander’s signature witty prose shines throughout, making the book both entertaining and heartfelt.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  *Triple Sec* is a near-perfect rom-com that delivers not just one, but three love stories in one. It’s a delightful read that showcases Alexander’s talent for crafting engaging characters and relationships.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Triple Sec* exceeded my expectations, offering a heartfelt and witty exploration of love, relationships, and personal growth.

It was a beautiful portrayal of how honesty and open communication can strengthen any relationship.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters—Mel, Bebe, and Kade—were incredibly lovable and well-developed. Their personalities and interactions made the story engaging and heartfelt.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  I enjoyed how the bartending competition was used as a plot device to move the story forward. It added an interesting layer to the narrative and kept the pacing dynamic.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book, especially since I was initially hesitant to read it. It exceeded my expectations and left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a refreshing and heartwarming exploration of polyamory, emphasizing the importance of respect, honesty, and communication in relationships.

Part 1 felt the longest, and I wish there had been more focus on Mel and Kade's interactions, as well as their dynamic as a trio.",

Kade emerged as my favorite character; I always gravitate toward nonbinary or trans characters. Each of the three characters brought distinct personalities to the story, which I really appreciated. I especially enjoyed Mel's cocktail-making and the competition she entered.",

As she navigates her feelings for Bebe and Kade—who are already a couple—Mel gradually opens herself to the possibility of love again. Each relationship unfolds in a distinctive manner, adding depth and charm to the narrative. Overall, I found the story both delightful and captivating.",

Bebe and Kade serve as intriguing love interests, and their dynamic as a married couple adds complexity to the polyamorous relationship. The single point of view—Mel’s—effectively keeps the focus on her emotional journey and growth. I appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary representation, and the portrayal of the poly relationship is both thoughtful and central to the narrative.",

The mixology elements provide a fun and unique twist, even if not all the drinks suit my palate. The book maintains a light, enjoyable, and spicy tone throughout. Additionally, the “snowed in” trope creates a cozy and romantic ambiance that enriches the story."

As someone with 11 years of experience in the industry, seeing it portrayed so authentically was both refreshing and emotionally impactful.  \n\n- **Character Choices and Relatability:**  \n  Some of the main character’s choices felt a bit odd, but as someone who isn’t polyamorous, it’s hard to say whether those choices were unrealistic or not.

There wasn't too much or too little of anything, which made it a satisfying read.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  I appreciate authors who make an effort to include better representation of queer types of love that are outside the \"norm.\" Alexander did a great job keeping that part fun and respectful throughout the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each of the main characters had distinctive voices, which is always good. They also had clear goals, boundaries, and personalities, making them feel well-rounded and relatable.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Part of me expected a bigger or more climactic scene with her best friend, so when that blew over pretty quickly, I was slightly let down. While there were good conversations between the main characters, I would have liked to see more depth in her relationship with her best friend as well.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a clever and balanced novel with strong character development and thoughtful representation of queer love.

While it was intended to be positive, the constant references to her size were unnecessary and stood out in a way that wouldn’t happen with a skinny character.  \n\n- **Narrative Perspective:**  \n  - I really liked Bebe and would have preferred the book to be written from her perspective, as I think it would have made the story more engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was a light and enjoyable read, but it fell short in terms of character development and sensitivity in representation. While the spice scenes were fun, they were too few, and the story would have been stronger if told from Bebe’s perspective.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Bebe is married but in an open relationship, and the narrative explores how an open relationship develops between Mel, Bebe, and Kade.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I felt like I didn’t get to know the characters deeply enough.

These elements added a unique and refreshing dynamic to the story.\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:** While I had fun reading the book, the ending felt rushed. The final chapter included fast forwards to a future where the protagonist, Mel, has everything she needs, but the lack of a clear explanation for how she achieved such a significant turnaround left me unsatisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I enjoyed the book for its themes and representation, but the abrupt and unexplained ending detracted from my overall experience. It was a fun read, but the rushed conclusion left me wanting more clarity and development.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5 stars."

The first half was stronger, but the second half left me wanting more coherence and authenticity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  - The premise of a polyamorous relationship (F/F/NB) immediately intrigued me.  \n  - The idea of a quirky romcom set in the glamorous world of high-end cocktail bars was fresh and sizzling.  \n  - The unique concept of found family and LGBTQ+ representation was appealing.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  - I absolutely loved the cocktail bar setting; it made me want to sit in the sun with a cocktail.  \n  - The NYC setting added a vibrant and glamorous backdrop to the story.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The characters were unique and vibrant, and I appreciated their growth throughout the story.  \n  - However, I struggled to connect with any of the three main characters and didn’t feel a spark toward them.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  - While the romcom elements were fun, the romance between the characters didn’t work for me.  \n  - I appreciated the author’s effort in portraying a polyamorous relationship, but it didn’t resonate emotionally.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  - The book was lighthearted yet deep, balancing humor with meaningful themes.  \n  - Despite the fun tone, the story didn’t fully meet my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I was initially excited about the book’s unique premise, vibrant setting, and quirky characters, I ultimately struggled to connect with the story and its romance. The cocktail bar setting and LGBTQ+ representation were highlights, but the emotional spark I hoped for was missing. Despite this, I still appreciate the author’s effort and would recommend it to others who enjoy quirky romcoms with diverse representation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5 stars)"

            "This story features a wonderful cast of diverse queer characters, including Bebe, Mel, and Kade. Kade, a genderqueer character, is intentionally reserved, and their gender presentation is thoughtfully understated, enhancing the book’s strong representation of genderqueerness. The unfolding relationship between Mel, Bebe, and Kade feels natural and engaging, with Kade's addition adding depth to the dynamic. However, the characters, especially Bebe, come across as somewhat idealized, lacking deep flaws or significant struggles. The absence of insecurities, jealousies, or challenges typical of complex multi-partner relationships gives the narrative an overly idealized quality at times. The sex scenes are hot but do not overshadow the story, achieving a harmonious balance between romance and intimacy.",
            "The book cleverly engages with the trope that polyamory is primarily for the affluent and attractive, potentially as a satire, adding depth to the narrative. Additionally, the recurring theme of cocktails and mixology, accompanied by vivid descriptions of the bar scene, leaves me craving craft cocktails.",
            "This story offers a low-angst experience where conflicts are swiftly resolved through healthy communication, creating a sense of comfort akin to a warm hug. Its overall tone is healing and soothing, devoid of high-stakes drama, resulting in a romantic narrative that feels like a delightful marshmallow treat."

The mixology details and genderqueer representation are standout elements, making it an enjoyable read for those seeking a light, feel-good story.",

Alexander has a wonderful way of telling stories that are both empathetic and educational.  \n   - The novel masterfully balances humor, banter, and spice while delivering the tropes and happily-ever-after (HEA) that define the romance genre.  \n\n- **Relatability and Character Development:**  \n   - As a ciswoman in a heterosexual monogamous marriage, I found the subject of polyamory challenging to relate to initially.  \n   - The main character, Mel, is a down-on-her-luck bartender who experiences anxiety and discomfort as she navigates a polyamorous relationship with Bebe and Kade.  \n   - Mel’s journey of opening herself up to the relationship, her fears of “getting it wrong,” and her evolving feelings for both Bebe and Kade made her relatable and allowed me to grow alongside her.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The story begins with Mel meeting Bebe at work and being instantly attracted, only to discover Bebe is married to Kade.  \n   - The novel explores themes of consent, communication, and the complexities of polyamory in a way that is immersive and enjoyable.  \n   - It effectively portrays Mel’s emotional growth and the development of her relationships with Bebe and Kade.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - I found *Triple Sec* to be an immersive and enjoyable romance that kept me invested in the characters.  \n   - I highly recommend it for its ability to stretch readers’ thinking while delivering a satisfying romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Triple Sec* by T.J. Alexander is a beautifully written romance that explores polyamory with empathy, humor, and depth. It offers relatable characters, a compelling plot, and a satisfying HEA, making it a highly recommended read for anyone looking to broaden their understanding of queerness and relationships.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I struggled to understand why Mel couldn't have feelings for Bebe. If you’re dating someone, why would you do so without genuine feelings? The notion that dating doesn't imply affection, simply because someone is married, felt confusing. While the story might be attempting to address the complexities of such relationships, that message got somewhat lost. Bebe's decision to bring her wife along to ask Mel out seemed unnecessary; there are simpler ways to indicate her wife’s approval, like a casual introduction, rather than requiring a relationship contract before they even start dating. This made the reading experience somewhat stressful. On a personal note, as someone often described as having blank facial features and dry humor—with people mistakenly believing I dislike them when I’m actually cheerful—I was pleasantly surprised to see a little of myself represented in this book.",

If you're curious about exploring a poly romance, this is an excellent starting point.

Each character is distinct, with their own arcs that never feel rushed; every individual feels significant to the narrative. \n\nThe immediate chemistry between Bebe and Mel highlights a stark contrast to the dynamic between Mel and Kade. I was initially frustrated with Mel and Kade's relationship, as it seemed disrespectful.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  - I really loved the different representation in this book. The range of identities and types of love were just beautiful.  \n  - The author showed multiple dynamics, all equally important and different, highlighting how love can manifest uniquely for anyone.  \n  - The book felt fulfilling, with every detail thoughtfully provided for the caring reader.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Mel was an interesting main character. At first, she comes off as insecure and unwilling to love, but her growth was compelling.  \n  - I loved Kade the most, and getting to see everyone more deeply—especially them—was a welcome development.  \n  - All the characters were distinct, with their own personal development and spotlight. Nothing felt rushed, and every person in the book felt important.  \n\n- **Relationships and Chemistry:**  \n  - Bebe and Mel had chemistry immediately, which contrasted with Mel and Kade’s dynamic.  \n  - At first, I was upset at Mel and Kade’s relationship, as it felt disrespectful, but it’s important to remember Mel is new to the poly world and makes beginner mistakes. When they finally come together, it felt worth the heartache.  \n  - The sex scenes weren’t overdone; they showed different styles of love and gave a glimpse into each couple’s chemistry.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  - All the bases the book set up were covered: Bebe and Kade’s relationship with Mel, her relationship with Daniel, the gotcha moment with Mel’s ex, the competition, her bar, and her getting her own space.  \n  - Everything was consensual and communicated, making the story feel authentic and satisfying.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  - I was so invested that I pulled an all-nighter to finish the book.  \n  - I don’t think I could say enough about how fulfilling this was for me.  \n  - I want fully immersed in these characters now and hope to find more queer and poly stories like this.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an immensely satisfying read, with beautiful representation, well-developed characters, and thoughtfully explored relationships. The plot was detailed and engaging, and the emotional payoff was worth every moment. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in queer and poly stories, and I’m eager to read more from TJ Alexander.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating, likely 5/5."
