            "The pacing of the story was sluggish, bogged down by repetitive dialogue and a lack of action or meaningful development. The cliffhanger ending revealed it to be part of a four-book series of short novellas, which felt like a contrived attempt to prolong the narrative.",
            "The MMC comes across as a sleazy, pervy old man, and the unnecessary flashbacks to his past sexual encounters do little to enhance his character or the story. Meanwhile, the FMC lacks any genuine attraction to the MMC, resulting in a dynamic that feels unconvincing and unengaging.",
            "The writing style is quite poor, especially in the FMC's internal monologue, which comes across as unnatural and overly explanatory (e.g., \"Where is my phone?\" and \"I did not blindfold myself. Where am I? I'm not afraid.\"). Additionally, the dialogue between the MMC and FMC in the woods stretches on for 40 pages, focusing too much on the details of captivity rather than advancing the plot or building tension.",
            "The story presents a captor/captive romance that starts off intriguing but ultimately feels strange and uneventful. The significant age gap between the female main character (26) and the male main character (50) adds to the overall discomfort. Additionally, the premise of the FMC being offered as collateral for her father's debt is both bizarre and poorly executed."
