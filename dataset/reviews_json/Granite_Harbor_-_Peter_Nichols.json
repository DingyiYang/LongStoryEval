            "As the story unfolds in the small coastal town of Granite Harbor, Maine, the identity of the killer becomes apparent early on, diminishing the suspense. The plot centers around the brutal murder of a local teenager at “The Settlement,” the town's historic archaeological site. The victim’s body is discovered hanging from a handmade wooden structure, with a gruesome clue left inside the corpse, which has been sliced open. The investigation is led by Alex Brangwen, the town's sole detective, who, after a failed writing career, must navigate the case with his limited skills. He relies on his writer's imagination to explore every possibility, no matter how strange. The tension escalates as the victim was a friend of Alex's daughter.",
            "I found the chapters featuring Alex's active investigation to be particularly enjoyable. His character and investigative approach were both engaging and compelling."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This novel has an intriguing premise and a compelling protagonist in Alex Brangwen, but its impact was lessened for me due to the synopsis spoiling a key plot point, the predictable resolution, and the inclusion of unnecessary animal harm. While I enjoyed the investigative aspects of the story, these issues held it back from being a higher-rated read for me.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Synopsis and Spoilers:**  \n   - I highly suggest skipping the official synopsis for this novel, as it reveals a major plot point that doesn’t occur until nearly the three-quarter mark. Knowing this detail in advance diminished the story’s impact for me.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story is set in Granite Harbor, Maine, where a local teenager is brutally murdered at “The Settlement,” the town’s historic archaeological site. The victim’s body is hung from a handmade wooden structure, with a gruesome clue left inside the corpse, which has been sliced open.  \n   - The murder investigation is led by Alex Brangwen, the town’s sole detective, who is newly trained after a failed career as a novelist. His rudimentary detective skills force him to rely on his writer’s imagination to consider all possibilities, no matter how unusual.  \n   - Adding to the tension, the victim was a friend of Alex’s daughter.  \n\n- **Character Development and Investigation:**  \n   - I enjoyed the chapters where Alex was actively investigating the case. His character and the way he approached the investigation were engaging.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n   - As the story introduced the residents of the small coastal town, it became obvious to me who the guilty party was, which reduced the suspense.  \n\n- **Content Warnings (Animal Harm):**  \n   - The novel includes gratuitous animal harm, which I found unnecessary. A dog dies in an accidental death, which does contribute to the plot, but the detailed descriptions of the deaths of fish, toads, and coyotes felt excessive and unrelated to advancing the story.  \n   - I recommend skipping Chapter 34 if you are sensitive to animal abuse.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - While this isn’t a bad story, the combination of the synopsis spoiling a major plot point, the predictability of the murderer, and the gratuitous animal harm made it a 3-star read for me.  \n   - If you go into the book blind (without reading the synopsis) and aren’t bothered by animal deaths, you might enjoy it more than I did.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel has an intriguing premise and a compelling protagonist in Alex Brangwen, but its impact was lessened for me due to the synopsis spoiling a key plot point, the predictable resolution, and the inclusion of unnecessary animal harm. While I enjoyed the investigative aspects of the story, these issues held it back from being a higher-rated read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 3 stars.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to Celadon Books for the gifted copy provided through NetGalley. It was my pleasure to offer a candid review."

            "The narrative alternates between the perspectives of Alex and Isabel, interspersed with chapters that delve into the killer's mysterious past.

Although the killer's identity isn’t entirely unpredictable, the suspenseful buildup and unexpected twists kept me thoroughly captivated.

The emergence of a second murder heightens the urgency and complexity of the plot. Overall, the tale is dark, gritty, and immersive, featuring a thrilling buildup and surprising turns.",
            "The characters, particularly Detective Alex Branwen and Isabel Dorr, are well-developed and multi-dimensional, even those who are less likeable. The story skillfully depicts the dynamics of a small-town community and the intricate relationships between adults and teenagers. The impact of crime on these connections serves as a central theme, adding significant depth to the narrative.",

            "I wasn’t fully engaged with this book until around the 40% mark, when we began to explore the killer’s modus operandi. Although it was a slow burn—typically not my favorite style—the intriguing plot kept my interest, even if it didn’t completely captivate me.",
            "The story is mainly told through the lens of the lead detective and author, Alex, though there are occasional chapters from other characters' perspectives. I found it challenging to keep track of these characters, even by the end. Some, like the typical teenagers Ethan and Shane, were too similar and frequently confused me, while others, such as Morgana, came across as disconnected and unrelatable.",

Some were too similar (e.g., typical teenagers like Ethan and Shane, whom I kept confusing), while others, like Morgana, felt disconnected and unrelatable.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - I wasn’t really too invested in this book until about 40% in, where we start to dive into the killer’s MO.  \n   - It was a slow burn, which typically isn’t my favorite, but the plot was interesting enough, though it didn’t blow me away.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Authors:**  \n   - This book is comparable to SA Cosby’s work in terms of the atmospheric small-town murder setting.  \n   - However, I felt more connected to SA’s writing style, though this might just be due to the setting.  \n\n- **Setting and Personal Connection:**  \n   - As someone from New England, I don’t always love books set there because I have my own preconceived notions or connections to places like Maine (where this book takes place).  \n\n- **Content Warnings and Reader Sensitivity:**  \n   - The book depicts animal abuse, specifically in Chapter 34. While I didn’t find it so bad that I had to stop reading, many reviewers mentioned skipping this chapter due to its graphic nature.  \n   - However, Chapter 34 is crucial to understanding the killer’s mindset and the plot’s development. Skipping it might make the book less enjoyable or harder to grasp.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n   - This book will take the right reader to truly enjoy it. The best audience would likely be someone who doesn’t read a lot of thrillers, appreciates a slow atmospheric burn, and can tolerate some level of animal abuse.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has an intriguing plot and a strong atmospheric setting, but its slow pacing and some character-related challenges made it less engaging for me. While it didn’t fully captivate me, it has its merits and will likely appeal to readers who enjoy slow-burn thrillers and can handle sensitive content like animal abuse.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

For instance, Alex’s daughter needing to be buckled and unbuckled until fifth grade seems implausible; most children master this skill much earlier. Additionally, the teenagers are overly moody and withdrawn, lacking the nuance and complexity I’ve observed in real-life teens.

The story follows Alex Brangwen, a failed novelist turned detective, as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young man from his daughter's friend group.

I would have preferred if her insights were portrayed as a mother’s intuition, which would have felt more believable.  \n\n- **Plot Connections and Resolution:**  \n   - I was disappointed by the lack of a deeper connection between the killer and his most recent victims. Other than casually knowing them, the link felt weak compared to the earlier victims, where the killer was “righting a wrong” in his eyes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is a standout in the serial killer genre, with a gripping premise, a uniquely crafted antagonist, and a compelling narrative. However, certain elements, like Isabel’s visions and the killer’s connection to his victims, could have been more developed. Despite these flaws, it’s a memorable read that kept me hooked.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- I wish I could give it a 3.5 out of 5. It’s hands down my favorite genre, and this book had many strengths, but a few areas left me wanting more."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Originality and Execution:**  \n   - Peter Nichols did his best with a familiar thriller concept, which often involves some level of absurdity. The execution balanced between being silly and chilling, though it leaned more toward the former at times.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Nichols aimed for strong character development, and while the characters felt a bit overbaked, they added depth beyond a typical serial killer story. Some backstories were compelling, while others fell flat.  \n   - The killer’s backstory was interesting but evoked sympathy for a character I didn’t want to feel sympathy for.  \n\n- **Plot and Suspense:**  \n   - The suspense was built effectively, especially with the killer’s backstory. However, the plot felt predictable, with only two outlier characters, one of whom was a red herring.  \n   - The puzzle was too simple, and I found it easy to piece together.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The killer was incredibly creepy, and the details of the first murder were haunting. However, the story veered into cheesier territory toward the end, making it harder to fully buy into the killer’s motives.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The novel had its strong points, and I wouldn’t discourage others from reading it. While it didn’t blow me away, it was a decent read with moments worth savoring.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis thriller had its strengths, particularly in character development and suspense-building, but it also suffered from predictability and a somewhat cheesy tone toward the end. While it didn’t fully captivate me, it was a solid effort with moments that stood out.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I appreciated the exploration of the Granite Harbor community, delving into their struggles, secrets, and history.

The third-person, multi-perspective storytelling was engaging, though the sheer number of characters occasionally felt overwhelming.",

However, the multitude of side characters—teens, Settlement employees, and townsfolk—creates confusion, despite the author's attempts to clarify points of view at the beginning of each chapter. The killer's backstory is both disturbing and intriguing; while I didn't feel sympathy for him, his descent into madness was unsettling.",

The audiobook narration enhances the experience, making it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley, Celadon Books, and Macmillan Audio for the complimentary copies to read and review."

Alex, a frustrated novelist turned town cop, grapples with his first murder investigation while juggling personal challenges—his ex-wife, an overzealous FBI presence, and his daughter, a potential target. While the plot effectively conveys suspense, it feels formulaic and lacks originality, echoing familiar tropes found in many thrillers.",

Supporting characters, including broken mothers, anxious townsfolk, and an irritating yet brave ex-wife, are vividly and authentically brought to life.",

            "The novel is burdened by an overwhelming number of subplots and random elements. It features a novelist-turned-detective, a divorced ex-wife with a complex backstory, a former teacher now working as a museum actor, a missing husband, and multiple perspectives from various townspeople. Additionally, it touches on themes of incest, abuse, and a father-son relationship with a groundskeeper, alongside a bizarre subplot involving frogs and rituals. The female protagonist's sudden psychic abilities feel unexplained and out of place. Overall, the excessive content detracts from the narrative, making it feel cluttered and unfocused.",
            "The characters are deeply flawed and unlikable. The male protagonist, a divorced novelist turned detective, grapples with his failures, while his ex-wife neglects their child. The female protagonist, a former teacher who homeschools her son, is often absent from home, and her husband has mysteriously vanished. The inclusion of the killer's perspective without revealing their identity adds to the overall confusion.",

However, once I got further into the story, it became one that I didn’t want to put down. The tension and suspense built steadily, especially with the introduction of a serial killer and the subsequent murders.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The story follows both the teens and the adults, with a lot of focus on parent/child relationships, which are often complicated. While this didn’t always make the characters likable at every moment, I could empathize with their anxiety and fear, which heightened the emotional stakes. Alex, the town’s sole detective and a single father, was particularly compelling as he balanced investigating the crime with protecting his own daughter. Isabel, another single mother, also added depth to the narrative as she became entangled in the investigation.  \n\n- **Narrative Perspective and Mystery:**  \n  The author did an excellent job of letting us into the killer’s head in certain sections, providing insight into their motivations and the bizarre elements of the crimes. This kept me intrigued and guessing, as the identity of the culprit was revealed slowly through clues and information.  \n\n- **Content and Tone:**  \n  This book is on the gory side, and I wouldn’t recommend reading it over food (I made that mistake one lunchtime). However, the darker tone and graphic details added to the intensity of the story and made the stakes feel real.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed *Granite Harbor*. The coastal setting, complex characters, and well-crafted mystery kept me engaged, even if it took some time to fully immerse myself in the story. The exploration of parent/child relationships and the psychological depth of the killer added layers to the narrative, making it a gripping read despite its darker elements.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I understand why it was included, but it didn't need to be so detailed. Personally, I’m fine with the torturing and killing of humans in stories, but I strongly dislike harm to animals.  \n\n- **Character Development and Subplots:**  \n   - The character development and subplots throughout the book made for an incredibly rich read. The depth of the characters and their relationships was a standout feature.  \n\n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n   - It wasn’t too difficult to figure out who the murderer was and who the distraction was. However, this predictability was more than compensated for by the strong character and relationship building.  \n\n- **Potential for a Sequel:**  \n   - I would easily follow these characters into another book, with or without the thriller aspect. That said, I would prefer the thriller element to remain part of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a highly enjoyable read, despite my discomfort with the detailed animal abuse.

This confusion stemmed from the multiple points of view (POVs) and the third-person narrative style. I wasn’t entirely sure who the main character was until I fixated on Alex, as the story bounces around a lot.  \n\n- **Character Connections:**  \n  The small-town setting meant that everyone had connections to each other, which made the multiple POVs even more confusing at times, especially when I hadn’t yet locked down all the names.  \n\n- **Pacing and Understanding:**  \n  Around halfway through, the story started to make more sense, particularly when we got the killer’s POV. However, I didn’t realize it was his POV at first because of the third-person narration, and it initially felt out of left field.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I think the writing itself was good, and the author did a solid job crafting the story.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  If you’re someone who enjoys character-driven thrillers and can follow many POVs, you may like this book. It just wasn’t a hit for me, and that’s okay!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its strengths, particularly in its writing style and eventual clarity, the multiple POVs and third-person narrative made it challenging for me to fully connect with the story.

            "The story interweaves multiple narratives, including the enigmatic past of an unknown boy who transforms into a killer. I found the killer's evolution particularly compelling, providing a fascinating psychological perspective. The unique signature of the crime enhanced the overall mystery. However, the introduction of a certain character midway through felt more like a plot device than a natural progression. Granite Harbor leans more towards a slow-burn small-town crime drama than a traditional whodunit, given that there is only one plausible suspect. Nevertheless, it remains a gritty and engaging page-turner.",

The relationships between Alex and his daughter Sophie, and Isabel and her son Ethan are relatable. However, I found it difficult to connect deeply with any of the characters, and some of their actions felt implausible. I was also disappointed by the conclusion of Alex’s story arc; his lingering self-doubt about the investigation felt unresolved.",

While I appreciated certain aspects, such as the setting and the exploration of the \"how\" and \"why,\" the unrealistic elements, poor police procedural details, and disappointing ending brought my rating down. It’s a book that won’t appeal to everyone due to its heavy themes and triggers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars."

While the killer’s perspective is compelling and the detective’s personal stakes add depth, the portrayal of some characters feels clichéd. The novel will appeal to readers who enjoy bloody, weird, and suspenseful thrillers, though the graphic violence may not be for everyone.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This gripping murder mystery revolves around a serial killer with compelling motives and a distinctive method of killing. Set in the small town of Granite Harbor, Maine, the story opens with the murder of a high school student, sending shockwaves through the close-knit community. The narrative alternates between Alex, the local detective, and Isabel, a single mother linked to the case, as they collaborate to unmask the killer before more lives are at stake. \n\nBeginning from the killer's perspective instantly sparks intrigue and unease. The discovery of the victim's body, coupled with the mysterious circumstances of the death, drives the plot forward, making it hard to put the book down. Although some plot elements are predictable, the revelations are skillfully executed and satisfying. The author adeptly intertwines the serial killer's backstory throughout the narrative, enriching the overall lore. The use of dramatic irony and cleverly placed red herrings—characters mirroring the killer's traits—skillfully maintain suspense, even if the killer’s identity becomes somewhat apparent.",
            "Alex and Isabel are intricately developed characters with authentic relationships with their children, Ethan and Sophie. Their protective instincts and efforts to safeguard their kids add depth to the narrative. The serial killer, known as the boy, is given a nuanced backstory that clarifies his motives and actions. His past, particularly his relationship with his mentor, adds layers of complexity to his character. The author effectively employs dramatic irony, allowing readers to understand more about the killer than the detective, which significantly heightens tension and engagement.",
            "The small-town setting of Granite Harbor infuses the story with intimacy and tension, making the crime feel deeply personal and impactful. The town's rich history and the close-knit community amplify both the stakes and the sense of urgency.",
            "The novel delves into themes of parental love, community, and the psychological effects of trauma. The relationships between parents and children are both wholesome and realistic, lending emotional depth to the narrative. In stark contrast to the close-knit, peaceful town, the serial killer's twisted logic and the brutal nature of the murders create a chilling tension that permeates the story."

        "conclusion": "Granite Harbor is a compelling and well-crafted murder mystery that combines a small-town setting with a unique and chilling serial killer. The detailed backstory of the killer, the realistic character relationships, and the effective use of dramatic irony make this novel a standout in the thriller genre. Despite some predictable elements, the story remains engaging and surprising, leaving a lasting impression. This book is highly recommended for fans of crime fiction, serial killer narratives, and well-executed mysteries.",

            "This story presents a dark and disturbing narrative about a serial killer preying on teen boys in a small Maine town. However, the graphic depictions of animal cruelty and child abuse often feel excessive and unnecessary. Inconsistent pacing, marked by filler scenes and backstories, detracts from the central plot. Additionally, the present/flashback structure, especially involving Alex and his daughter, hampers the story's momentum.",
            "The characters in the story come across as underdeveloped and often lack credibility. Alex, the police detective, appears incompetent and lacks the fundamental skills expected of his role. Side characters, like Morgana, are both obnoxious and forgettable. While the killer's motivations and backstory are believable, they ultimately feel underwhelming. The teenage characters are largely unlikable, with Sophie’s ungrateful behavior being particularly frustrating.",

            "The pacing of the mystery thriller is engaging, featuring moments of misdirection and investigative advancement. However, much of the narrative revolves around a character who is ultimately not the killer, which can feel misleading when the true culprit is finally revealed. Set in the small Maine town of Granite Harbor, the story integrates a unique historical backdrop linked to America's early settlement, along with a living history site near an archaeological dig. This setting introduces a cast of quirky characters connected by small-town ties, enriching the narrative. Central to the plot is Detective Alex Brangwen, a British ex-pat turned American investigator, as he delves into the eerie murder of a teenage boy, which is notably linked to a frog.",
            "The story's emotional resonance stems from its teenage victims and potential targets, drawing readers into their plight. Detective Brangwen grapples with ethical dilemmas, particularly involving his relationship with the son of one of the targets and his daughter's unwitting involvement; however, these complexities are not thoroughly examined. The killer's backstory unfolds through skillfully crafted flashbacks, tracing the character’s transformation from a troubled youth to a hardened criminal, all while keeping the killer's identity a mystery until the final moments.",
            "The story weaves in themes of witchcraft and traditional Native lore, though these elements often feel awkwardly balanced and lack deeper exploration. While these cultural aspects are not disrespectful, they serve primarily as quirky additions to the narrative rather than fully developed themes.",
            "The novel masterfully maintains suspense through a gripping, ticking-clock atmosphere, keeping the killer's next target shrouded in mystery. The reveal of the killer is executed brilliantly, with their identity remaining elusive until the very end. Flashbacks are skillfully utilized, offering valuable insights into the killer’s motivations without prematurely disclosing their identity."

        "conclusion": "Granite Harbor is a compelling mystery thriller with a unique setting and well-executed suspense. While it has some minor flaws, such as underdeveloped cultural elements and a misleading focus on a non-killer character, the novel’s strengths—particularly its flashbacks, suspenseful reveal, and quirky small-town atmosphere—make it a worthwhile read for fans of creepy New England murder mysteries.",

The gripping story features a shocking crime scene where a toad emerges from a victim's body, adding an intriguing layer of mystery. The narrative unfolds across two timelines: one detailing the investigation and the other exploring the backstories of various characters, including the killer's life and motivations. The author skillfully maintains suspense by concealing the killer's identity until the end, referring to him simply as \"the boy\" or \"Mister.\"",

The supporting characters, including his ex-wife Morgana and various townspeople, are flawed yet relatable, each possessing redeeming qualities. However, Morgana's harsh demeanor sets her apart as unlikable, creating a notable contrast with the other characters.",

This is followed by another murder, heightening the tension and raising fears for the safety of the children. Initially, the plot appears to offer a compelling police procedural; however, it soon veers into horror as the murderer’s backstory unfolds, which feels disconnected from the established setting and characters. The introduction of supernatural elements violates Rule Two of The Detection Club, which prohibits such agencies, undermining the straightforward police work that could have effectively solved the case. Additionally, the limited number of suspects leads to a resolution that comes too quickly, diminishing suspense and challenge for the reader.

He is portrayed as a decent detective and a good father.  \n   - Isabel, a former teacher recovering from alcoholism, works at The Settlement and is a well-developed character with depth.  \n   - The relationships between the characters, such as Alex and Sophie, Isabel and her son Ethan, and the friendships among the teenagers, are multi-layered and engaging.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n   - The story begins with a grotesque murder of a high school student, a close friend of Isabel’s son Ethan. This is followed by another murder, escalating the tension and fear that the children might be next.  \n   - The mystery initially promises a compelling police procedural, but the plot takes a turn into horror with the murderer’s backstory, which feels out of sync with the setting and characters.  \n   - The inclusion of supernatural elements violates Rule Two of The Detection Club, which states that supernatural agencies are ruled out. This detracts from the old-fashioned police work that could have solved the mystery on its own.  \n\n- **Pacing and Suspense:**  \n   - The limited number of possible suspects makes the mystery solvable too quickly, reducing the suspense and challenge for the reader.  \n   - The shift from a grounded police procedural to a horror-like backstory disrupts the pacing and feels like a betrayal of the story’s initial promise.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre Consistency:**  \n   - The novel starts as a well-crafted mystery with a strong sense of place and character, but the introduction of horrific elements clashes with the tone and genre expectations.  \n   - The horror elements feel unnecessary and detract from what could have been a great mystery.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGranite Harbor excels in its vivid setting, rich character development, and initial promise as a police procedural. However, the introduction of a horrific backstory and supernatural elements disrupts the tone and genre consistency, making the story feel disjointed and betraying its potential. While the setting and characters are compelling, the plot’s shift into horror and the limited suspense due to a small suspect pool ultimately detract from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The main plot appears disjointed and lacks depth, feeling as if it were conjured from nowhere. Its sparse and clumsy writing fails to inspire curiosity about the outcome, while excessive, irrelevant details drown the narrative without enhancing the story.",

            "The publisher's warning about animal cruelty in Chapter 34 only scratches the surface, as the book also addresses mistreatment of frogs and irresponsible pet ownership. Misogyny permeates the narrative, evident in every description of women and their children’s actions. Additionally, themes of chauvinism, unresolved childhood issues, and illiteracy are recurrent throughout the story."

For example:  \n     - Witchcraft is inaccurately portrayed, conflating it with Wicca and ignoring the fact that men can also be witches.  \n     - The depiction of toads surviving inside the human body is biologically inaccurate.  \n     - The fictional species \"Uncles of Heaven\" is incorrectly presented as real, when it is part of Vietnamese folklore.  \n   - The rituals described are neither scary nor original, lacking any connection to real witchcraft and coming across as cruel and nonsensical.  \n\n- **Content Warnings and Themes:**  \n   - The publisher warns of animal cruelty in Chapter 34, but the book contains much more, including the mistreatment of frogs and irresponsible pet ownership.  \n   - The book is saturated with misogyny, evident in every description of women and their children’s behavior.  \n   - Themes of chauvinism, unresolved school complexes, and illiteracy are pervasive throughout the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - There is no suspense, horror, or empathy evoked for any of the characters.  \n   - The characters and their actions feel disconnected and unrelatable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a poorly executed attempt at horror, marred by inaccurate research, incoherent storytelling, and offensive themes.

The extensive cast of characters brings their own backstories, requiring time for the reader to become familiar with each one.",

The reveal of the killer was not particularly surprising, and the focus on their background story felt excessive.

            "The story centers on the murder of a teenage boy found dead in a small Maine town, with a toad placed in a hole cut into his stomach. This chilling crime echoes an unsolved case from 16 years prior, prompting Alex, an unexpected investigator from England, to uncover what revived the killer. As a second teenage boy is found with a similar fate, Alex recognizes he is facing a serial killer and must act swiftly to protect additional victims, including his own teenage daughter. While the plot is engaging, it lacks the twists I typically seek in a mystery/thriller. Furthermore, the introduction of a supernatural element, namely clairvoyant visions, felt like a deus ex machina and detracted from my enjoyment, as I prefer crime-solving to rely on realistic methods. However, the pacing remains strong, maintaining a steady rhythm throughout, resulting in a 4/5 rating.",
            "The characters were well-developed, earning a 4/5 rating. Alex stood out as an intriguing protagonist, although his background as a detective felt somewhat implausible.",
            "The novel is expertly crafted and immerses the reader, highlighting the author's storytelling prowess. While some elements, such as Alex's journey into policing, require a suspension of disbelief, the engaging writing keeps the reader captivated.",

I favor mysteries that focus on logical crime-solving and offer unexpected surprises. While I wouldn’t reread this book, I would recommend it to fans of similar genres. I’m also interested in reading more by this author, as I found their storytelling compelling.",

This murder mirrors one from 16 years ago, prompting Alex, an unlikely police detective originally from England, to investigate what reactivated the killer. When a second teenage boy is killed similarly, Alex realizes he’s dealing with a serial killer and must act quickly to prevent more deaths, including that of his own teenage daughter. While the plot was engaging, it lacked twists, which I typically enjoy in a mystery/thriller. Additionally, the inclusion of a supernatural element (clairvoyant visions) felt like a deus ex machina and detracted from my enjoyment, as I prefer crime-solving to rely on realistic methods.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The novel was well-written and immersive, showcasing the author’s skill as a storyteller. Despite some suspension of disbelief required (e.g., Alex’s path to policing felt unrealistic), the writing kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were well-developed, earning a 4/5 rating. Alex, in particular, was an intriguing protagonist, though his background as a detective felt a bit implausible.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was strong, maintaining a steady rhythm throughout the story and earning a 4/5 rating.  \n\n- **Enjoyment:**  \n  While I enjoyed the book overall, the supernatural element and lack of twists lowered my enjoyment to a 3/5. I prefer mysteries that surprise me and rely on logical crime-solving rather than supernatural interventions.  \n\n- **Book Cover:**  \n  The cover was visually appealing and fitting for the genre, earning a 4/5 rating.  \n\n- **Series or Standalone:**  \n  This is a standalone novel, which I appreciated as it provided a complete story without the need for sequels.  \n\n- **Genre and Target Audience:**  \n  The book is a mystery/thriller aimed at adult readers. Fans of series like Detective Kay Hunter, Havens Rock, and JD Robb’s In Death series might enjoy this.  \n\n- **Re-readability and Recommendation:**  \n  I wouldn’t reread this book, but I would recommend it to fans of the aforementioned series. I would also read other works by this author, as I found their storytelling compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a well-written and immersive mystery/thriller with strong pacing and engaging characters.

Transitions between characters can be jarring; for instance, the narrative shifts abruptly from Alex, the detective investigating the murder, to Isabel, the mother of one of the children, then to an ambiguous character who might play a role or serve as a red herring, and finally to the unidentified murderer, whose perspective is presented in the past tense.

            "The story follows small-town detective Alex as he confronts his first major case in an otherwise peaceful community. Teenagers are being murdered, and the similarities in the crimes indicate a serial killer at work. The final quarter of the book is especially intense, leaving me on the edge of my seat.",
            "Alex is a refreshing protagonist who stands out in the detective genre. Unlike many detectives who exude expertise, he openly acknowledges that he became an officer after his failed writing career and a promotion in an uneventful small town. His frequent lack of confidence and reliance on knowledge from TV and books make him feel realistic and relatable.",

The POV shifts aren't clearly indicated at the start of chapters, and some characters' perspectives are introduced only briefly and never revisited.",

            "The story follows Alex, a British detective in a small Maine town, as he investigates the murder of a teenager. The case takes a twist when the FBI connects it to a nearly 20-year-old crime. While the plot is intriguing, it occasionally suffers from inconsistent detail—sometimes overly elaborate and other times lacking depth.  ",
            "The only character I found engaging was Alex—a divorced dad, former author, and detective who feels overwhelmed by his case. Unfortunately, the other characters are unlikable and poorly developed, leaving me unable to connect with them. They were so off-putting that I had little interest in reading more about their lives.",
            "While many reviews labeled the book as excessively gruesome, I found it within my tolerance, having read authors like Karin Slaughter and Gillian Flynn. However, the writing style was inconsistent; some sections were over-detailed, while others felt rushed and lacked depth. This uneven pacing made it challenging to remain fully engaged with the story."

However, the inconsistent writing style, unlikable supporting characters, and uneven pacing detract from the experience.

The killer’s POV is both fascinating and twisted, heightening the urgency and tension in the plot.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity and Pacing:**  \n  - The book features a lot of characters, but this didn’t detract from my enjoyment. I was able to follow along without confusion, and the complexity of the plot kept me guessing until the very end. I was unable to predict the identity of the serial killer, which added to the suspense.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  - This is a gripping adult suspense crime thriller with graphic and disturbing elements. It’s a nail-biting read that I would recommend to fans of small-town crime thrillers. However, readers should research trigger warnings before diving in.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Granite Harbor\" by Peter Nichols is a well-crafted and immersive suspense thriller that excels in its setting, character development, and narrative structure. The authentic portrayal of small-town Maine, combined with the chilling perspective of a serial killer, makes for a compelling and unpredictable read.

A serial killer loose in a small Maine town? The premise sounded right up my alley, but the story unfolded a lot differently than what I was expecting.  \n\n- **Plot and Focus:**  \n  The heart of the story left me a little disappointed. While the murders were grisly and sick—almost *Silence of the Lambs* level of sickness with the toads and secretions—the novel didn’t delve deeply enough into the mind of the killer or what made them tick. Instead, the story focused more on the secondary characters and the people affected by the murders, which took away from the plot and the gory scenes.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The local policeman, Alex, is an Englishman who still feels like a stranger in Maine. He’s uncomfortable in his role as a cop, having always wanted to be a writer, but his writing career fizzled out after his first book. His personal life is also strained, with a failed marriage and a distant relationship with his daughter, Sophie.  \n\n- **Mystery and Resolution:**  \n  Contrary to what others may think, I thought several characters could have been the murderer, and the actual reveal felt underwhelming. For me, the murders and solving the crime seemed like an afterthought rather than the main focus of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Granite Harbor* had a promising premise and some chilling moments, the story’s focus on secondary characters and lack of depth in exploring the killer’s psyche left me wanting more. The resolution of the mystery felt less impactful than I had hoped, making the overall experience somewhat disappointing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The concept of people getting high on frogs (or toads) was particularly memorable, even if it was gross and unnecessary.  \n   - Despite its flaws, the book will stick with me for a long time because of how chaotic and disjointed it felt.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The story felt unnecessarily drawn out and could have been condensed into a short story. There were too many irrelevant details and characters that didn’t add value to the plot.  \n   - The narrative was all over the place, like trying to solve a 25-piece puzzle with pieces from other puzzles.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The mother of one of the victims was portrayed as unlikable, despite being hailed as a hero by the town. This inconsistency made her character hard to connect with.  \n   - The serial killer was framed sympathetically, which felt inappropriate given the nature of his crimes.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n   - The detective’s role was underwhelming, as they didn’t actually solve the case. The real hero of the story became apparent early on, which diminished the suspense.  \n   - The story lacked focus and coherence, making it difficult to fully engage with the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was undeniably memorable due to its absurd premise and chaotic storytelling, it suffered from poor pacing, unlikeable characters, and a lack of focus.

            "The book caught my attention with its intriguing blurb, but some aspects felt underdeveloped. I expected a deeper connection between the murders and the town's history, along with more motivation behind the killer's actions. The anticipated gruesomeness didn't materialize, which was disappointing. However, the exploration of the killer's psyche and the mythology influencing him was captivating. Alex's journey through his first murder case kept me engaged, though the sudden visions ultimately had minimal impact on the outcome. The introduction of numerous characters created a pool of suspects, adding a layer of intrigue.",

The depth of the characters, including the protagonist Alex, is limited, as we only receive basic background information typical of a first book in a series. It would be great to see some of these characters, particularly Alex, revisited in future installments as they take on more cases."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  - The book sounded intriguing based on the blurb, but some parts felt underdeveloped.  \n  - I expected the murders to have a stronger connection to the town's history and wished for more motivation behind them.  \n  - The gruesomeness I anticipated didn’t materialize, which was a bit disappointing.  \n  - The exploration of the killer's mind and the mythology driving his actions was very interesting.  \n  - Alex's journey through his first murder case kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Many characters were introduced early on, making it hard to determine who would be important to the story.  \n  - The characters, including the main character Alex, lacked depth. Mostly, we got basic background information typical of a first-in-series book.  \n  - I wouldn’t mind seeing some characters revisited in future books, especially Alex working on more cases.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The visions felt sudden and, ultimately, had minimal impact on the final outcome.  \n  - The introduction of numerous characters created a pool of possible suspects, which added some intrigue.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential:**  \n  - It was a fair book, and I’d be open to reading more by the author.  \n  - There were aspects I wished had been more developed, which held it back from being a higher-rated read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had intriguing elements, such as the killer's psychology and Alex's first case, it fell short in areas like character depth, plot development, and the integration of certain elements like the visions. It was a decent read, but I felt it had the potential to be more compelling with further refinement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- I’m wavering between 3 and 4 stars."

Detective Alex Brangwen, a single father tackling his first murder case, and Isabel, a single mother who works at the Settlement with a personal connection to the victim, become increasingly intertwined. When another teenager is murdered in a similar manner, the stakes rise as both fear for their children's safety.

Young boys are being targeted, and the ritualistic or cult-like display of their bodies added a layer of horror. The killer’s backstory is revealed slowly, and it’s unsettling.

They are realistic and multifaceted, and I enjoyed learning about their connections to each other and the town.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The inclusion of POV chapters from the murderer added to the creepiness in a good way, though I personally found these chapters a bit too dark and disturbing for my taste.  \n\n- **Author and Overall Experience:**  \n  This was my first time reading Peter Nichols, and I would definitely read more of his work.

The mystery element fell flat; I suspected the killer early on, thanks in part to a random character's POV chapter around the 17th chapter.

While I read nearly 200 pages in one day to finish it, it didn’t feel as thrilling as other mystery/thrillers I’ve read. The pacing and suspense didn’t quite meet my expectations.\n\n- **Predictability and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery element fell flat for me because I was able to guess the killer very early on. This was largely due to a random character’s POV chapter early in the book (around chapter 17 of 68), which felt like the story was spoon-feeding me clues to remember a specific \"odd\" character. As a result, the mystery aspect didn’t feel compelling, and the motive also became clear too soon.\n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  The resolution felt rushed, and the remaining 75% of the book dragged as it seemed like the characters were just catching up to what I already knew. By the final few chapters, I was ready to move on to something else, as the story had lost its momentum for me.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, it wasn’t a bad read. I didn’t have much else to complain about, but it didn’t leave a lasting impression either. It was a decent book, but not one I’d consider particularly memorable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was an okay read, but it lacked the thrill and unpredictability I look for in a mystery/thriller.

            "Isabel's role in the case was not well-explained and felt unrealistic within the plot.

However, some scenes are dark and disturbing, so readers should be prepared for that.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  The book has been compared to *Mare of Easttown*, so if you liked that show, you may enjoy this book. I’d also pick up another book by Peter Nichols, such as his bestseller *The Rocks*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Granite Harbor* is a gripping and suspenseful novel with well-developed characters and tense, descriptive scenes. While some moments are dark and disturbing, the story kept me engaged until the very end. Fans of *Mare of Easttown* or Peter Nichols’ other works will likely enjoy this book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars.  \n\n*Copy was gifted by Celadon Books in exchange for my honest review. @CeladonBooks #CeladonReads #GraniteHarbor*"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story revolves around a serial killer targeting a teen friend group in Granite Harbor, a small town where not much usually happens. The lives of parents and teens intersect, especially since the father of one girl is the cop on the case and has dated the mom of another teen. While the premise is intriguing, the pacing felt subtle for a serial killer-based thriller. I didn’t feel the immediate urgency or race to uncover the killer, which made it less of a page-turner for me. I could put it down and pick it back up without feeling compelled to keep reading.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The main male character is British, but the audio narrator didn’t use a consistent accent (or hardly one at all), which was distracting and threw me off. The characters, including the parents and teens, were well-developed, and their intersecting lives added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The novel is generally well-written, and the author does a good job of building tension and creating a sense of dread as the parents fear their child could be the next victim. However, the subtlety of the storytelling didn’t fully align with the expectations of a thriller, making it less gripping than I had hoped.  \n\n- **Engagement and Emotional Impact:**  \n  While I wanted to know who the killer was, I wasn’t “dying” (pun intended) to find out. The story held my interest enough to finish, but it lacked the intense emotional pull or urgency that I typically associate with thrillers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGranite Harbor is a well-written novel with an intriguing premise and well-developed characters. However, its subtle pacing and lack of urgency made it less gripping than expected for a thriller. While I wanted to know the outcome, it didn’t fully captivate me as a page-turner.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

The killer’s backstory stood out as the most compelling element, but the mystery itself was too predictable. Simplifying the narrative and focusing on fewer, more impactful characters and scenes could have made this a much stronger book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Additionally, the killer was fairly obvious early on, and I wish there had been a few more viable options to choose from to maintain suspense.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book should definitely come with trigger warnings, as it includes child sexual abuse and one of the most graphic, lengthy descriptions of animal cruelty I've ever read.  \n\n- **Ending and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story was creepy, and the ending was satisfying, which contributed to a solid reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its strengths, such as its engaging pacing, creepy atmosphere, and satisfying ending, it was marred by plot holes, predictable elements, and disturbing content. Overall, it was a decent read but not without its flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for my honest review."

            "Set in the quiet coastal town of Granite Harbor, Maine, the novel explores the chilling aftermath of a local teenager's brutal murder, which rattles the community. The story centers on Alex Brangwen, the town’s only detective, as he grapples with his first murder case while navigating his responsibilities as a single father and struggling writer. The investigation takes on a personal dimension for Alex when he learns that the victim was friends with his daughter, Sophie. Isabel, a single mother and former teacher, becomes involved in the case since her son was the victim's best friend. Tension mounts with the discovery of another body, intensifying fears for their children's safety. While the pacing is steady, the conclusion is somewhat predictable, hampered by clues that lead too easily to the killer’s identity. Additionally, some plot elements, particularly the motivation behind the murders, remain unclear and underexplained.",

This made it difficult for me to stay engaged initially. However, the pacing improved significantly halfway through, and the story became much more gripping.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book dedicates a substantial portion of its early pages to developing the characters. While this is important, I personally prefer a balance between character development, action, and story progression.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is beautifully crafted, as described by the blurb on the cover. It effectively conveys the dark, unsettling, and grisly tone of the story.  \n\n- **Engagement and Appeal:**  \n  The second half of the book was far more engaging and compelling than the first half. I wish the entire novel had maintained the same level of appeal as the latter portion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a dark and unsettling novel with beautiful writing. While the first half struggled with pacing and focus, the second half delivered a gripping and engaging experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nRounded up from 3.5."

            "The author appears overly fixated on crafting an unconventional narrative, which detracts from the overall quality of the story. While the murders are distinctive, the excessive emphasis on gruesome torture methods overshadows the essential appeal of a mystery or thriller: engaging readers in solving the crime.

Nonetheless, it’s a satisfying read, and I’m eager to explore more works by the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars."

The middle of the book picked up significantly, which made the story more engaging and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There are a lot of characters, and I appreciated that the book took the time to develop each one without making it feel tedious.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I ended up being okay with the narrator, though I wasn’t a fan of all the voices he chose for some characters. For example, the main police detective is supposed to be from England, but the narrator didn’t use a convincing British accent.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this audiobook despite its slow start and some issues with the narration. The well-developed characters and engaging plot made it a worthwhile listen.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

However, the narrative kept jumping away to random characters who were less developed and not interesting, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  One scene in particular was truly head-scratching and disturbing. It included a graphic description of two children engaging in sexual acts, with the older child being the abuser. This left me questioning the purpose and necessity of including such a scene.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some strengths, such as its prose and the development of the detective character, the meandering plot structure, underdeveloped side characters, and a particularly disturbing scene made it a challenging and unsatisfying read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The setting is a small town in Maine, which adds an intriguing backdrop to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  While the story is engaging, it feels like it falls slightly short of being a four-star read, leaning more toward three and a half stars.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The tiny town in Maine serves as an effective and atmospheric setting, contributing to the overall tone of the story.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I received an advanced review copy (ARC) of *Granite Harbor* from #NetGalley and #CeladonBooks in exchange for an honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Granite Harbor* is a solid read with an interesting premise and a well-crafted setting. While it didn’t fully captivate me, it’s a decent story that kept me engaged.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars."

            "I appreciated the alternating timelines and perspectives, particularly the chapters exploring the killer’s childhood. These flashbacks were captivating and provided crucial insight into the making of the serial killer. The pacing was excellent—I finished the book in just two days. However, the resolution of the case was disappointing; the introduction of clairvoyance felt like an easy way out and undermined the otherwise strong narrative. The bizarre, ritualistic murders in the present were fascinating, with their connection to the killer's past revealed gradually and satisfactorily. Unfortunately, I predicted the killer's identity early on, which lessened the suspense. I would have preferred a longer period of uncertainty.",

I finished it within 2 days and enjoyed being immersed in the small-town setting of Maine as the community tried to identify the serial killer.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The nature of the serial killer's killings was gruesome and gave me horror vibes, which added to the dark and intense atmosphere of the story.  \n\n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n  My main complaint is that the plot was too predictable. There were really only ever two suspects, and I easily guessed the killer within the first third of the book. I wish the author had made it more challenging to figure out the killer.  \n\n- **Character Development and POVs:**  \n  The story alternated between multiple POVs and included many characters, but I never got confused. It was very easy to follow along. I particularly enjoyed the occasional switches to the serial killer’s childhood, which provided fascinating insights into their background.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I ended up developing empathy for the killer due to their trauma and dysfunctional family, which added depth to the story and made the character more complex.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a dark thriller/mystery that is quick and engaging, with a strong sense of atmosphere and well-developed characters. While the plot was somewhat predictable, the emotional depth and immersive setting made it a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I wished for a stronger connection to the characters and a more vivid portrayal of the community, the book still provided an engaging and immersive reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n   - I really enjoyed the mystery aspect of the story. The detective, who never expected to become a detective or live in Maine, was an intriguing character.  \n\n- **Characterization (Teens):**  \n   - The author writes \"good\" teens very well. They are portrayed as having friends, wanting to have fun outside of parental approval, and aspiring to be something someday.  \n   - The teens care about their friends and family, even as they struggle with parents, grief, and the desire to help their parents despite finding them frustrating at times.  \n\n- **Content Warnings (Abuse and Gore):**  \n   - I skipped a full chapter (Chapter 34) and other passages due to detailed animal abuse and other forms of abuse.  \n   - The publisher and other readers warned about these sections, and I chose to skip them rather than DNF the book. I don’t feel I missed anything crucial by doing so.  \n   - The abuse and gore are very detailed, so readers should tread carefully or skip these parts if they are sensitive to such content.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n   - The author’s ability to create compelling characters, especially the teens and the novelist-turned-detective, makes me want to read more of their work.  \n\n- **Reader’s Dilemma:**  \n   - While I enjoyed the characters and the story, I hesitate to read more by this author because I prefer to read a book in its entirety without feeling the need to skip sections due to extreme content.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Granite Harbor* by Peter Nichols is a compelling mystery with well-written characters, particularly the teens and the detective. However, the detailed depictions of abuse and gore, especially animal abuse, may be distressing for some readers. While I appreciated the story and characters, the need to skip certain sections due to extreme content makes me hesitant to explore more of the author’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Alex, a divorced detective, relocates to Granite Harbor out of necessity rather than desire. The plot centers on his first case: the suspicious death of a local teenager. The townspeople are eager for him to find the killer quickly, and we follow Alex as he sifts through evidence, interrogates suspects, and narrows down his target.",

While the story may feel a bit predictable at times, the balanced cast of characters and excellent audiobook narration make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
