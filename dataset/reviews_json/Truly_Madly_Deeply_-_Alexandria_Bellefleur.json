The latter half is a steamy escapade, filled with well-written sexual tension and enjoyable scenes. Colin, with his thick thighs and short shorts, adds a refreshing detail to the story. Initially, I thought he was super tall, but at 5'8\", he shares my height, which makes Truly seem quite short. It's nice to see a middle-height hero for a change. I also appreciated that both characters have living parents, even if Colin's are less than ideal. Truly's parents reminded me of Bitsy Von Muffling and Bobby Fine from *Sex and the City*, with their musical-themed rooms and witty banter. I need someone to discuss this with!",

It doesn’t do justice to the story or the characters.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The two main characters are incredibly bantery, funny, and sweet, but also filthy and dirty. Their chemistry is electric, and their interactions are a highlight of the book.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Content:**  \n  The latter half of the book is a ~fuck fest~, and it’s steamy!

Her performance made the filthy banter and dialogue even more enjoyable.  \n\n- **Parental Characters:**  \n  I loved that both characters have alive parents, even if Colin’s parents are shitty. Truly’s parents reminded me of Bitsy Von Muffling and Bobby Fine from *Sex and the City* (musical composer-themed rooms, their jokes, the bits).

The heroine embodies a classic \"black cat\" persona—sharp-witted and fiercely independent—while the hero is the quintessential \"golden retriever,\" sweet and utterly charming. Their chemistry leaps from the page, particularly during their spirited arguments, which unveil sides of themselves they wouldn’t show to anyone else. This is a classic \"he falls first\" romance; the hero pursues the heroine with relentless determination, a dynamic I thoroughly enjoyed.

I have zero regrets—the series was adorable. However, this book surpassed all my expectations and became my absolute favorite.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The story revolves around a romance writer and a divorce lawyer who meet on a podcast to discuss opposing views on love. The romance writer, Truly, is reeling from a recent heartbreak and takes things personally, while the divorce lawyer, Colin, unintentionally insults her by dismissing her perspective. This setup was just the beginning, and the story only got better from there.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I fell in love with both Truly and Colin, as well as the supporting cast (except Truly’s ex). Truly felt incredibly real to me—her reactions, though not always ideal, were 100% believable, and I understood her motivations even when I wanted to yell at her. Colin complemented her perfectly, and I couldn’t help but picture him as Steve from *Stranger Things* (no regrets there).  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Chemistry:**  \n  The book delivered the perfect mix of jittery butterflies and sizzling chemistry as Truly and Colin slowly realized their feelings for each other. The spicy scenes were off-the-charts hot, and Bellefleur captured the emotions of new love flawlessly—the butterflies, the worry, the over-analysis of every text and conversation.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Realism:**  \n  The story had a perfect blend of emotions, capturing the essence of something new and exciting. Bellefleur’s writing made it impossible not to root for Truly and Colin.  \n\n- **Overall Impact and Recommendation:**  \n  I can’t wait for the rest of the world to read and love this book as much as I do. I don’t know how Bellefleur will top this, but it’s a story I’ll recommend for a long time to come.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a standout in Bellefleur’s work, combining a compelling premise, well-developed characters, sizzling chemistry, and emotional depth. It’s a story that captures the essence of new love and leaves you rooting for the characters from start to finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Best friend Lulu serves as a fantastic sounding board, though her absence in the latter half of the story is felt. Colin is an appealing character—handsome, accepting of boundaries, devoted to his quirky sister, and articulate in expressing his feelings. Overall, this story combines humor and romance in a delightful way.",

Their dynamic was fun, unique, and refreshing.",

His bold, romantic declarations, such as “I’ll be so fucking good for you, Truly,” and “You could spit on me, and I’d say thank you,” were unforgettable. Truly herself was relatable, especially in her stubbornness to accept Collin’s love. Her challenges with her parents and her journey of self-discovery added significant depth to her character.",

Colin's character brought a sweet, caring, and vulnerable presence that was a refreshing change from typical male leads in similar stories. The family dynamics, particularly the tension between Colin and his twin Caleb, added an intriguing layer to the narrative. The development of Truly and Colin's relationship—from initial animosity to flirtation, texting, and ultimately love—was beautifully depicted. Their texting exchanges were particularly engaging, infusing excitement and humor into their romance. The lakehouse trip marked a pivotal moment that solidified their bond, especially when Truly met Colin's family.",

            "While I enjoyed the book, I wish the podcast played a larger role in the narrative. I found the discussions between Truly and Colin about their differing perspectives on relationships engaging. Their first attempt at podcasting was entertaining, even with its chaotic outcome, and I would have loved to see more of that dynamic.",
            "I adored both Truly and Colin's characters. Truly is a lovable yet sensitive control freak, grappling with self-doubt that's entirely relatable. Colin, on the other hand, is a delightful presence, embodying the \"he falls first\" trope beautifully. His certainty that Truly is the one for him, coupled with his understanding of her struggles, adds depth to their connection. I especially appreciated Truly's awkwardness in responding to Colin's advances and her sensitivity— I can relate to feeling uncomfortable with the classic ponytail-pulling flirtation. \n\nTheir banter is fantastic and becomes a charming highlight of the story. Despite their rocky start—so bad it seemed unrealistic for Truly to eventually warm to Colin—the \"he falls first and harder\" trope is executed wonderfully. The couple dynamic thrives on their playful bickering, which enhances their chemistry. Additionally, the representation of a bisexual female main character is refreshing and skillfully portrayed, making this story even more engaging.",

He was so sure that Truly was the one for him but also understanding of all that she was going through.  \n  - I like how Truly is awkward in reacting to Colin's advances and is quite sensitive. I relate to her not taking the \"pony tail pulling\" style of flirting well.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  - Their banter together was amazing. Though they don’t get off on the best foot, the initial interaction was so bad that it was unreasonable for Truly to slowly begin to see Colin in a different light.  \n  - The \"he falls first and harder\" trope was executed well, and their bickering and banter added a lot of charm to their relationship.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  - I overall liked the message in this book about love and family.

I would’ve liked to see more of Truly and Colin discussing their different perspectives on relationships. Their first time doing it was fun to read, even with how bad it went, but I wanted more of that.  \n\n- **Writing Style and References:**  \n  - My biggest yet pettiest complaint is all the Taylor Swift references. There are four that I counted, and after the first one, the rest made me roll my eyes. I don’t like obsessive pop culture references in books in general, and this many about one artist was annoying.  \n\n- **Tropes and Representation:**  \n  - Tropes included: \"He falls first and harder,\" bisexual couple, and bickering and banter galore.  \n  - The representation of a bisexual female main character was refreshing and well-executed.  \n\n- **Horn Level:**  \n  - The horn level was 4/5 🌶️, which added a nice touch to the romance without overwhelming the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI truly loved this book!

Her books sparkle with sharp banter, beautiful prose, relatable but unique characters, and delicious, lip-biting sexual tension.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Written in Truly’s POV, the reader relies on witty dialogue and meaningful interactions between the pair to further the romance and gain insight into Colin’s feelings. I always finish Alexandria’s books feeling like I know the characters inside and out. I want to know all the small details—their eccentricities, likes, dislikes—without being explicitly told.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Chemistry:**  \n  Truly hates how attracted she is to Colin, and Colin is willing to take anything she will give him. She calls him a menace (a favorite micro-trope of mine), and he likes her better rude.

            "While the majority of the book is engaging and well-paced, the ending feels somewhat unbalanced. The final scene emphasizing Colin’s worship of Truly overshadows the sweetness of their relationship. A blend of bickering and camaraderie would have strengthened the conclusion.",
            "Truly is a captivating protagonist—a historical bisexual romance novelist whose faith in everlasting love is tested by her fiancé’s infidelity and her parents’ separation after 33 years. Her analogy of bisexuality, comparing it to visiting an airport without exploring the destination, is both insightful and relatable. Colin, a divorce and family law attorney, is equally well-developed—supportive, confident, persistent, humorous, patient, and generous. His ability to validate Truly’s experiences and emotions makes him a standout character. The electric romantic tension between Truly and Colin is fueled by their contrasting beliefs about love and their undeniable chemistry. As their relationship evolves through the podcast series, one character's realistic views on love challenge the other's ideals. A particularly charming moment occurs when Truly's parents meet Colin, adding depth to their relationship.",
            "The novel thoughtfully delves into themes of love, trust, and self-discovery. Truly’s bisexuality is depicted with nuance and authenticity, while Colin’s understanding and validation of her identity stand out as key elements of the story. Additionally, the playful pop culture references, such as Truly’s name inspired by *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang*, enhance the narrative.",
            "The banter between Truly and Colin is top-notch—the best I've encountered this year. Their witty repartee had me giggling, kicking my feet, and eagerly anticipating each exchange. The flirty bickering and Broadway references add an extra charm to their interactions."

The final \"smoosh scene\" leaned too heavily into Colin’s worship of Truly, which detracted from the sweetness and balance of their relationship. A mix of bickering and unity would have made the conclusion stronger.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout for its sharp banter, well-developed characters, and thoughtful exploration of love and identity.

I had high expectations, especially regarding the level of spiciness, and I can confidently say that all my expectations were met.  \n\n- **Representation and Characters:**  \n  - As a bi woman, I was very much in love with these two bi characters.

Their chemistry and dynamic were fantastic, and I especially loved that *he* was the brat in the relationship.  \n\n- **Subplot (Parents' Conflict):**  \n  I *HATED* the subplot about her parents. It felt like a stupid reason to generate conflict, especially since she’s a grown woman, not a 16-year-old. Not a single person pointed out her selfishness, and her bad decision was ultimately rewarded. She never learned that love exists regardless of her parents' feelings for each other. Instead, the ending reinforced her flawed belief that she can only love because her parents are back together. This subplot was poorly handled and only deserved 2 stars.  \n\n- **Ending and Pacing:**  \n  The ending left me frustrated. Her love confession should have been the *pre-ending*, not the final resolution.

            "Truly’s parents are quirky and endearing, embodying a love for show-business and show-tunes. Their storyline regarding separation is well-handled, though their responses to Truly’s feelings could be more sensitive. In contrast, Colin’s family is toxic; his brother, who married Colin’s ex, and his parents, who side with him, create significant tension. Truly and Colin serve as compelling opposites: she is a hopeful romance novelist, while he is a cynical divorce lawyer. Their character evolution subverts expectations as they transition from initial animosity to a deep connection. Truly’s insecurity in relationships is relatable, and Colin’s profound affection for her feels genuine. Their romance develops gradually—not quite a slow burn, but not instant either—adding depth to their relationship. The complexity of their growing bond is beautifully complicated by external challenges, moving beyond mere flirting or physical attraction.",

The story offers a welcome departure from the typical alpha, possessive male archetypes often found in romance novels. However, I felt that some characters, particularly Colin's sister Caitlin, were introduced early on but not fully developed or revisited later. I would have liked to see more exploration of her podcast storyline.",

The exchanges—text messages and emails—between the characters are masterfully crafted, capturing their captivating obsession with one another. I found myself highlighting numerous quotes and passages to preserve the emotions and clever dialogue, such as: \n  - \"Want me to talk about my PPO, baby? I could tell you about my deductible?\"  \n  - \"Come on, wreck me. I dare you.\"  \n  - \"You saw me on Saturday.\" \"Yeah, and I missed you as soon as I walked out your front door.

I am devastated that I have to wait until April to hold a physical copy.  \n\n- **Main Characters (Truly and Colin):**  \n  - **Truly:**  \n    - Truly is an angel, and I love her deeply. I connected with her on a personal level, which was almost terrifying. Her drive to help her parents was emotional and realistic, making my heart hurt. Her slow but meaningful growth was satisfying, and I love characters with development. She’s funny, witty, and her banter with Colin was immaculate. Their chemistry was undeniable from their first interaction.  \n  - **Colin:**  \n    - Colin is making his way to the top tier of book boyfriends. His \"until my jaw locks\" statement made me gasp. He’s funny, supportive, and sweet, and I wish he weren’t fictional. He matched Truly’s banter perfectly and somehow made it hot. Normally, I find certain aspects of romance novels cringey, but I loved everything about their relationship here. His constant reminder of being a family lawyer (just own it, bro, you’re a divorce attorney) added humor.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  - All the side characters (except Colin’s family) were fun, real, and well-developed. Lulu was a standout; I highlighted so many of her lines because she was hilarious. Caitlin was great, but I wish she had been more involved—she kind of disappeared after a while. Truly’s parents were frustrating at times but still had their own growth and contributed to the plot.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - This book is truly one of my favorites of the year, even though it doesn’t come out until next year. I fear the person I will become when I finally get to hold this book in my hands.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book left a lasting impression on me from the very beginning. The characters, especially Truly and Colin, were incredibly well-written and relatable, with fantastic chemistry and growth. The side characters added depth and humor, making the story even more enjoyable.

            "The steamy scenes in this story are fiery and messy, vividly portraying adult intimacy. The connection between Colin, a lawyer, and Truly, a writer, thrives on their witty banter, showcasing their verbal prowess. This queer narrative thoughtfully examines the distinction between attraction and action, set against the backdrop of both characters’ complicated family dynamics. Colin hails from a toxic family, while Truly's parents are in the midst of a trial separation, providing a poignant contrast that enriches the plot. Truly, a complex romance writer with firm beliefs, finds herself vulnerable upon meeting Colin. Ironically, while Colin is a cynical divorce lawyer, he becomes more open to the idea of a relationship than Truly is. Their dynamic suggests that Colin will serve as an anchor, while Truly’s tendency to overthink keeps her in a whirlwind of uncertainty.",
            "The book brims with humor, clever wordplay, and show tunes, yet you don’t need to grasp every reference to fully enjoy the experience. The writing is both witty and engaging, drawing readers into its vibrant world.",
            "The novel delves into the complexities of life and relationships, illustrating that not everything can be neatly resolved. It presents a thought-provoking argument that we can maintain optimism and offer support in our relationships, even when we haven't completely addressed our own issues.",

It’s joyful and silly, yet also insightful and thoughtful.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  Truly is a complicated romance writer who holds tightly to her beliefs but is in a vulnerable spot when she meets Colin. Colin, a cynical divorce lawyer, ironically becomes more open to exploring a relationship with Truly than she is with him. Their dynamic suggests Colin will be the anchor while Truly overthinks and swishes about.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  The steamy scenes are fiery, messy, and delicious, portraying intimacy between grownups. Their connection is built through banter, as both are skilled with words—Colin as a lawyer and Truly as a writer.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel explores the messiness of life and relationships, showing that not everything can be tied up neatly. It’s an insightful argument that we can be optimistic and supportive in relationships without having all our own issues resolved.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  The story is queer, with a thoughtful exploration of attraction and action being two different things.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  Both characters come from complicated family situations. Colin’s family is toxic, while Truly’s parents, who are her blueprint for relationships, are trial-separating. These dynamics add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book is filled with jokes, winks, show tunes, and puns, but you don’t need to understand all of them to be immersed in the world. The writing is witty and engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis romcom is a rare mix of joy, silliness, and insight. It’s a delightful exploration of messy, grown-up relationships, with fiery chemistry and thoughtful themes.

            "While some of Truly's behavior felt a bit juvenile, I found that to be a minor issue. I was disappointed when she orchestrated a \"Parent Trap\" scenario with her parents; their relationship is their own, and I felt she was too intelligent to not recognize that. I also disliked her ex and questioned her judgment in being with someone so clearly toxic. It made me wonder if she was truly ready for a healthy relationship after such a negative experience. \n\nHowever, there is a standout scene where Truly and Colin discuss sexual identities, reminiscent of the iconic moment in *Schitt's Creek* when David expresses his preference for the wine, not the label. Both Truly and Colin identify as bisexual, which is significant given that the book and their relationship often present as straight. Bi erasure is a real issue, and it's important that we acknowledge it in both literature and our lives."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Truly, Madly, Deeply is a standout romance novel that combines heart, heat, and well-developed characters. While it has some minor flaws, such as Truly's occasional juvenile behavior, the book excels in its portrayal of a nuanced enemies-to-lovers relationship, steamy and well-placed sex scenes, and important representation of bisexuality. Colin is a particularly compelling love interest, and the novel overall is a must-read for fans of romance enthusiasts and those who enjoy heartfelt, engaging stories.",

Swoony, emotional, steamy (my lord, was it every steamy). Just wonderful.\"\n   - \"I love all Alexandria Bellefleur’s books but this one may be my new favourite.\"\n\n- **Enemies-to-Lovers Trope:**\n   - \"I don’t love the enemies-to-lovers trope. Too often I find that the characters clearly hate each other or the 'hate' is something stupid or non-existent.\"\n   - \"What I like about P&P is that Elizabeth and Darcy get off on the wrong foot but they are, after a time, willing to concede that they were too proud and prejudiced and finally see the other as a romantic prospect.\"\n   - \"I found the same happened in this book. Truly and Colin didn’t really hate each other (even though she tells her mom she absolutely does). They just get off on the wrong foot and then needle each other at subsequent meetings.\"\n   - \"After *gasp* communicating with each other, they realize assumptions were made and maybe, just maybe, they might be good together.\"\n\n- **Character Development and Behavior:**\n   - \"Some of Truly’s behaviour was a little juvenile and hard to get past but that’s getting a little nitpicky.\"\n   - \"I wish she hadn’t pulled a Parent Trap on her parents (it’s their relationship and has nothing to do with her and I felt she was too smart to not understand that).\"\n   - \"I hated her ex and that she thought it was OK to be with just a trash human.\"\n   - \"I don’t know if she really would have been ready to move on to an emotionally healthy relationship when she had just been in a toxic one.\"\n\n- **Love Interest (Colin):**\n   - \"Colin? Yeah, that man is my new book boyfriend. He was smart, sweet, caring, and funny, among other attributes.\"\n   - \"He also really, truly cared about Truly.\"\n   - \"Bellefleur took it to another level and it was extremely attractive.\"\n\n- **Steaminess and Sex Scenes:**\n   - \"This book was steamy. Folks, this is so beyond NSFW that it can’t even see work in the rearview mirror.\"\n   - \"The sex scenes weren’t overly numerous nor were they gratuitous. They were well placed and made a whole lot of sense from a plot perspective.\"\n   - \"They were very well done and very hot.\"\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**\n   - \"There’s also an excellent scene when Truly and Colin are discussing sexual identities that reminded me a lot of the Schitt’s Creek scene when David says he likes the wine but not the label.\"\n   - \"Like Bellefleur herself, both Truly and Colin are bi which I think is a pretty important thing to state when the book and their relationship is straight presenting.\"\n   - \"Bi erasure is real and we don’t need that in the world or our romance novels.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTruly, Madly, Deeply is a standout romance novel that combines heart, heat, and well-developed characters.

This explicit representation and dialogue left me misty-eyed and deeply grateful to the author, Bellefleur.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The third act involves adult parent trap shenanigans that are best enjoyed with comedy goggles. Taking it too seriously might require a breather, as even Colin does.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a delightful and sexy rom-com with strong character dynamics, meaningful representation, and a perfect blend of humor and romance. While Colin's lack of development might be a minor drawback, Truly's growth and the affirming themes make this a standout read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed Truly and Colin's story. Their relationship was refreshingly low on drama and rich in witty banter. From their first interaction, I was captivated by their dynamic and reluctant to return to reality. I never doubted that they were meant for each other. Colin exemplifies the ideal supportive boyfriend, and I could have easily read another 200 pages of him showering Truly with all the green flags of a healthy relationship.",

            "This romance is a delightful read, offering a comforting embrace.

I never once doubted that they were each other's person.  \n\n- **Character Development (Colin):**  \n  Colin could easily be the model for what a supportive, all-in boyfriend should look like.

I definitely wanted more of her in the story. Colin and Truly had fantastic chemistry from the start, and their tension was perfectly executed.

It was witty, engaging, and utterly delightful.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  - The spicy romance was perfectly executed, with a mix of tropes like “he falls first” and “enemies to lovers” that kept me hooked.  \n  - The LGBTQIA+ representation was a wonderful addition, making the story feel inclusive and relatable.  \n\n- **Plot and Side Plots:**  \n  - The side plots involving characters of varying ages added layers to the story, making it enjoyable for a wide range of readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book completely blew me away.

This aspect resonated deeply with me, as if the author had been reading my diary. The female main character's journey is compelling; her six-year relationship with a less-than-ideal man ends without any real sadness, which I found relatable. Her growth as she learns to embrace her bisexual identity is beautifully depicted. Colin, the male lead, is perfection—patient, kind, and forgiving. He wholeheartedly validates her identity and supports her through emotional challenges, particularly during her parents' temporary separation. Colin strikes a balance between being supportive and giving her space, which enhances their heartwarming relationship. He reignites her belief in happily-ever-afters, and their connection feels both genuine and deeply emotional."

While this was kind of fun, it also felt a little cringy at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book surprised me in the best way. It delivered a satisfying mix of romance, angst, and spice, with a standout male lead who carried the story. While the female lead could have been more complex, the emotional depth and lack of a third-act breakup made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars"

He was persistent yet patient, and his charm was undeniable. Although Truly sometimes felt younger than her 27 years—largely due to her struggle with her parents’ separation—her prickly nature added depth to her character. Colin adored her feistiness, making him the ultimate cinnamon roll."

Colin was an absolute simp for Truly, to the point where he would literally devour her or die trying. He was persistent but patient and really charming.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Truly didn’t always feel her age (27), but I think that’s mainly because her conflict was with her parents’ separation, and she handled it like an actual children’s movie. However, I liked that she was prickly, and Colin loved her bitchiness. He was an absolute cinnamon roll.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The spice was surprisingly spicy! Very descriptive. It used my ick word once (“juices” 😭), but I can overlook it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel delivered strong character chemistry, engaging character dynamics, and surprisingly spicy moments. While Truly’s maturity level occasionally felt inconsistent, her prickly personality and Colin’s charm made for a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 (rounded up)."

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the dynamic between Truly and Colin! The pairing of a romance author and a divorce attorney initially seemed unlikely, but once they navigated their differences, they complemented each other beautifully. I absolutely loved subby Colin, who is eager to please Truly throughout the story. Truly is a complex and relatable character, embodying both strength and vulnerability. While she offers keen insights into her parents' relationship, some of her reactions to their separation felt a bit off to me. Nonetheless, I found her understandable, especially as an only child who was kept in the dark about her parents' issues until their split. As for Colin, he’s perfect—no notes, though I wouldn’t mind seeing him in more short shorts!",

Their interactions were engaging and added a lot of charm to the story.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  Personally, the spice level was a bit higher than I typically prefer. However, the overall quality of the book made it easy to overlook this minor preference.  \n\n- **Engagement and Immersion:**  \n  The story was so well-written and captivating that I didn’t feel like I was reading—it completely drew me in.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I’m grateful to the publisher and NetGalley for providing an advance copy of *Truly, Madly, Deeply*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the slightly higher spice level than I usually enjoy, *Truly, Madly, Deeply* was an incredibly engaging and well-crafted romance. The banter between the main characters was a standout feature, making the book a delightful read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Banter between Truly and Colin: 10/10"

I was so engrossed that I couldn't put it down. The banter between Truly and Colin was exceptional—worthy of a literary award. I found myself laughing, blushing, and squealing with delight throughout."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Subplots:**  \n  - I enjoyed the book somewhat less on my reread because the subplots lost their novelty and felt like they took away from the main characters' time.  \n  - While I appreciated the story overall, I could’ve gone without the subplots—I just wanted more focus on Colin and Truly.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Colin is potentially the new love of my life. His personality, especially when he started speaking in showtunes, was so endearing that it brought me to tears.  \n  - Truly and Colin’s dynamic is captivating and should be everyone’s business. Their romance, banter, and chemistry are highlights of the book.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing is beautiful, immersive, and emotionally resonant. I found myself grinning and kicking my feet while reading.  \n  - The epilogue, written from Colin’s perspective, was an incredible touch that left me emotional and satisfied.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The book made me cry copiously, multiple times, which speaks to its emotional depth and connection.  \n  - There’s a particular scene (⬇️) that I would reread the entire book for—it’s pure literature.  \n\n- **Replay Value:**  \n  - I already wanted to reread the book just hours after finishing it to relive the romance, writing, and characters.  \n  - I would happily reread this book every two months just to experience the magic of Colin and Truly’s story again.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a beautiful, perfect, and wonderful book that left me emotionally moved and deeply invested in the characters. While the subplots detracted from my enjoyment slightly, the romance, writing, and character dynamics more than made up for it. Colin and Truly’s story is unforgettable, and I’ll undoubtedly return to it again and again.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific numerical rating was mentioned in the review.)"

            "Truly and Colin share a believable chemistry and engaging banter that makes their relationship enjoyable to follow. Their romance evolves naturally, though it hinges on a few coincidences and humorous technological mishaps involving Truly. The story is told exclusively from Truly’s perspective, adding depth to her character as she navigates personal struggles and her evolving feelings about love. In contrast, Colin feels somewhat one-dimensional, as his perspective is not explored, making him appear as a straightforward, smitten character without much internal conflict. The Parent Trap subplot adds a fun dynamic to the narrative, while supporting characters like Colin’s sister Caitlin and Truly’s best friend Lulu are well-developed, leaving room for potential future stories.",
            "The book successfully captures a lively, steamy rom-com tone, consistent with the author's previous works. The humor and wit in the dialogue, particularly Truly's sarcastic remarks, elevate the reading experience.",
            "The novel intricately explores the complexities of love through Truly, a romance author confronting her own disillusionment following personal betrayals. It also features a straight-presenting relationship between two queer characters, adding a distinctive layer to the narrative."

It made me think she needed therapy rather than pursuing this plan.  \n  - The heroine catches her fiancé cheating right at the start of the book, which sets the stage for the story.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  - I really liked the hero and the main characters (MCs) when they were together. They had some great banter-filled scenes that I enjoyed.  \n  - The hero falls first (in an instalove style) and has to pursue her intensely before she agrees to be with him.  \n  - Both MCs are bisexual, and there are no other love interests for either of them.  \n  - There’s no OM/OW drama or scenes, and no cheating occurs between the MCs.  \n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Scenes:**  \n  - The sex scenes were not my personal preference. There are quite a few of them, and they involve role reversal and some physical (borderline violent) actions from the heroine toward the hero. It just wasn’t for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the story was enjoyable with strong character dynamics and banter between the MCs.

The couple is incredibly sweet, with the male lead, Colin, embodying a golden retriever charm while also being undeniably attractive during the intimate scenes. Their chemistry truly stands out. However, my main concern is Truly, the female lead, whose excessive investment in her parents' marriage feels unhealthy. At 27, her meddling often comes off as bratty, particularly with her immature stunt involving the lakehouse. Additionally, she allows her parents' separation to overly influence her own life choices.",

            "Colin is utterly dreamy—I'm completely obsessed. He’s kind, selfless, funny, and a bit stubborn, making him the perfect match for someone like me who struggles with anxiety. I truly love him. Then there's Truly, named after Truly Scrumptious, whose theater-loving parents added a delightful layer to the story. I resonated with her struggles stemming from her parents’ separation; having experienced something similar, I appreciate how it can skew one’s perspective on life. I always enjoy seeing this theme explored in romance novels, especially when the character is a romance author herself. While I've encountered this concept before, it never fails to captivate me, and this book was no exception. The standout feature, without a doubt, was the banter—some of the best I've ever read. It left me genuinely amazed. The chemistry between Colin and Truly was simply off the charts.",

I love him.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Spice Scenes:**  \n   - The only issue I had with this book was the writing style got a little millennial cringe sometimes—not all the time.  \n   - While I thoroughly enjoyed some of the spice scenes, there were some I enjoyed less than others, so they just didn’t quite all hit.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - This book was so cute!! I was drawn in by the man who looks suspiciously like Steve Harrington on the cover, and I’m so glad I judged this book by its cover because it was such a fun read.  \n   - It was an amazing read, and I’m really glad I read it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful and refreshing romance novel with excellent banter, relatable characters, and a unique exploration of family dynamics. While the writing style occasionally felt cringe-worthy and some spice scenes didn’t fully land, these minor issues didn’t detract from the overall enjoyment. It’s a fun, heartfelt read that I highly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Colin's devotion was a standout for me—his heartfelt pleas had me hooked, and I relished every moment of his simping. The dynamic between Truly and Colin perfectly captured the essence of opposites attract, evolving from hate to friendship to romance, with a touch of gentle femdom that made their relationship incredibly engaging.\n\nHowever, I found Truly's parents to be a significant drawback. Their Parent Trap-style storyline felt unnecessary and detracted from the main plot. Their overly theatrical, showtune-like dialogue was off-putting and made me question why so much time was devoted to them instead of focusing on Colin and Truly's relationship.

The inclusion of Truly and Colin’s parents provides meaningful insight into their personalities, which I appreciated.\n\nThe spice in this book is exceptional.

The buildup to their romantic connection is engaging, though the steamy scenes arrive later than anticipated. A quirky moment involving musical quotes at Truly's parents' house feels somewhat out of place and overly whimsical, which may not resonate with all readers, though it could charm some.",

Truly, a romance author grappling with personal turmoil, is a multi-faceted character that adds depth to the story. Their relationship begins on shaky ground due to misunderstandings and Truly's emotional struggles, but their chemistry and witty banter ultimately emerge. The book is commendable for its representation of disaster bisexuals and its exploration of complex queer characters.

While Truly is likable, she often appears naive, particularly regarding her parents' relationship and her understanding of love. Some of her actions seem immature; however, her character arc reaches a satisfying resolution by the end. The romantic tension between the characters is excellent, and the intimate scenes are well-crafted—balanced and not overdone. It's refreshing to see both characters as queer, though I wish their identities had been explored in greater depth. Initially, I mistakenly thought the male lead was trans, which added an interesting layer that wasn't the case.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Dynamics and Dialogue:**  \n  The banter between the two main characters, Truly (a Romance author) and Colin (a divorce attorney), is some of the best I’ve read. Their verbal sparring is witty and had me in stitches more than once. Their initial clash on a podcast, where they answer relationship questions, sets the stage for their dynamic—Truly as a romantic and Colin as a cynic.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationship Progression:**  \n  The story effectively portrays their transition from enemies to friends to lovers. Once they are together, we learn more about Colin’s family, who are portrayed as horrible people, and Truly’s attempt to “Parent Trap” her separating parents back together.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the relationship development is engaging, the plot feels somewhat lacking after the main characters get together. Aside from the subplots involving Colin’s family and Truly’s parents, nothing particularly notable happens.  \n\n- **Intimate Scenes:**  \n  The intimate scenes, while well-written, start to dominate the story a bit too much for my taste, which detracts from the overall balance of the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel excels in character dynamics and witty dialogue, with a satisfying progression from enemies to lovers. However, the plot loses momentum after the main characters get together, and the overemphasis on intimate scenes slightly diminishes the story’s appeal.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (out of 5)."

I wish Truly's identity as a queer romance author had been explored more deeply, as it felt underdeveloped. The romance between Colin and Truly was cute, and I appreciated the bi representation; however, I felt that Colin deserved better. I loved how the book delved into each character's family dynamics and showcased their support for one another through their struggles.",

            "This book lacks a clear plot. Unlike the author's other works, which have a distinct direction, this one feels more like a collection of vibes than a story with purpose.",
            "Colin and Truly have a wonderful dynamic that I truly enjoyed. Colin was my favorite character; I wish I could find a man like him—he's the epitome of a Ken. Truly, on the other hand, was quite dramatic, which I found a bit excessive, especially regarding her parents' breakup, considering her age. She definitely embodied typical Pisces energy, which isn't my favorite. However, I appreciated the bisexual representation in the book. Overall, I wish the best for Colin and Truly."

I loved the concept of the podcast featuring two perspectives on various questions, but I would have liked to see more content and discussions surrounding it.",
            "I was impressed by Colin's determination to pursue Truly, especially since she had just emerged from a long-term relationship and had given him several reasons to back off. Truly's efforts to reconcile her parents were admirable, though I found her attempts somewhat naive. Nevertheless, they highlighted her deep care for them. I loved her initial perception of her parents; the enduring love between them, even after many years, was refreshing. Lulu was a standout character—her vibrant energy was captivating, and I would love to see more of her. The writing left me wanting individual stories for each of the side characters, particularly Caitlin. A perspective from Colin would also be fascinating, exploring his bisexuality, his family dynamics, and their impact on him.",

Truly’s persistence with her parents was admirable, though I found her efforts to get them back together a bit childish. Still, it showed how much she cared for them.

Alexandria’s writing made me want a book about each of the side characters, and I hope we get that. If there’s a storyline about Caitlin, I’d love to read her story. A Colin perspective would also be amazing, diving deeper into his bisexuality, his relationship with his family, and how that affected him.  \n\n- **Plot Elements and Missed Opportunities:**  \n  I loved the concept of the podcast with the two perspectives on questions, but I wish there had been more content and conversations around it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a cute and enjoyable story with well-developed characters and a steady pace.

I think it will mean a great deal to other bisexual and/or queer readers.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  The “Parent Trap” part of the plot irritated me because Truly’s approach to the situation felt immature.

The banter between Truly and Colin is delightful, with Colin's charm and eloquence making their interactions both engaging and enjoyable.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  - The story begins with romance author Truly encountering her fiancé, whom she’s on a break with, with another woman. She then steps onto the set of a podcast to give relationship advice, where she meets Colin, a charming family (divorce) attorney who challenges her beliefs about love. As their relationship develops, they both come to realize that love and relationships can be defined differently for everyone, and what matters most is how they define it for themselves.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  - The bi-representation in the book is exceptional. Both Truly and Colin identify as bisexual, but they have very different experiences with the term. The book addresses bi-phobia and bi-erasure in the media, as well as the complexities of being in a heteronormative-presenting relationship. These conversations are refreshing and not often explored in books.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Dialogue:**  \n  - The banter between Truly and Colin is amazing. Colin’s charm and way with words truly jump off the page, making their interactions engaging and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - While Truly and Colin are well-developed overall, Truly’s behavior in the \"Parent Trap\" aspect of the story comes off as a bit immature and hard to believe, given her age. However, this is a minor gripe and doesn’t detract significantly from the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book pleasantly surprised me with its heartfelt exploration of love, relationships, and bisexual representation. The dynamic between Truly and Colin is captivating, and their conversations about identity and love are refreshing and meaningful. Despite a minor issue with Truly’s maturity in one aspect of the plot, the story is well worth reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance was expertly paced, developing gradually with a spark from the start, yet avoiding hasty declarations of love. This approach made the relationship feel both realistic and satisfying.",
            "The side characters, especially Lulu, enriched the story significantly. Lulu was a loyal and supportive friend to Truly, always prioritizing her best interests. Their friendship was a standout aspect of the book, adding a layer of positivity to the narrative. The chemistry and banter between the two main characters were exceptionally well-crafted, making their interactions feel natural and engaging. The male love interest was one of the best I've encountered in recent romance novels—genuinely sweet and deeply caring for the female lead. My only critique is that some dialogue made the characters seem younger than their stated ages. While this minor issue didn't greatly diminish my enjoyment, it prevented the book from being a five-star read for me.",

Her books are always well-written, full of fun references, and a good time.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  I love the characters she creates and the dynamics between them. The frenemies-to-lovers trope, with the male main character (mmc) being absolutely head over heels for the female main character (fmc), was particularly enjoyable.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  *Truly, Madly, Deeply* reminded me why I’m a hopeless romantic. I laughed and teared up while reading this book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Momentum:**  \n  I sped through the first half of the book, but towards the later end, I started losing a little momentum. However, it was still very worth finishing.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The book includes queer representation and fun Broadway references, which added to its charm.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAlexandria Bellefleur delivers another heartfelt and entertaining novel with *Truly, Madly, Deeply*. While the pacing slowed slightly towards the end, the emotional depth, engaging characters, and delightful tropes made it a memorable read.

However, by the end, I came to understand and appreciate its role in the overall narrative. While it felt awkward at times, the fallout from the parent trapping created compelling conflict.\n\n- **Character Dynamics (Rivalry and Romance):**  \n  In the first half, I was primarily focused on the rivalry and the characters' chemistry, which was undeniably engaging.

Colin, on the other hand, starts off on shaky ground with Truly but redeems himself significantly, earning a second chance.  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around love, second chances, and the challenges of maintaining faith in romance. While the overall plot resonated with me, I found the \"Parent Trap\" scene somewhat out of place, as it felt too juvenile for Truly's age.  \n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The book’s tone and style were engaging and aligned well with my preferences, making it an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful read, with strong character development and themes of love and redemption.

            "I'm so over it. I'm tired of Justin's indecisiveness and the emotional turmoil he brings. Despite my efforts in the relationship, I was met with the bare minimum, making his character feel frustrating and underdeveloped. While I believe in love, no one deserves to be tethered to someone who isn't right for them or treats them poorly. The book effectively explores the idea that love should be fulfilling and reciprocal, highlighting the importance of being with someone who truly values and respects you. The author's intent to inspire hope in readers about finding genuine love is clear and resonates deeply.",
            "While my friends dreamed of Prince Charming, I longed for someone who would look at me the way my dad looked at my mom—someone who would love me as he loved her. This story prompted me to reflect on my own ideals of love, shaped by my parents' relationship, and how they differ from societal expectations.",
            "For the first time, she felt a sense of curiosity about what would happen next, rather than the urge to close the book or skip ahead. The story captivated me, keeping me engaged and eager to read on without peeking at future pages."

He sees her for who she truly is, even when she struggles with self-doubt and the idea of lasting love. Their chemistry is palpable; Colin is eager to please, and Truly finally feels liberated to express herself in the bedroom without fear of judgment.

            "This book provided exactly what I was looking for: a charming romance with just the right amount of spice. The female main character, a romance writer, added a delightful and relatable touch to the story. However, I would have liked to see the podcast element woven more into the plot, perhaps with Colin’s sister discovering their relationship at some point.",
            "Colin's steadfast admiration for Truly was a highlight of the story. The hate-to-love trope was skillfully executed, adding both tension and depth to their relationship. The witty banter between characters was engaging and enjoyable, while the representation of queer identities—featuring a bisexual female main character and male main character—added a refreshing and meaningful layer to the narrative.",

While I would have liked to see more integration of the podcast element, the story as a whole was thoroughly enjoyable. Colin and Truly’s relationship, filled with witty banter and mutual admiration, made this a memorable read.",

            "This contemporary romance cleverly weaves together reverse grumpy/sunshine and enemies-to-lovers tropes. The story follows Colin, a skeptical family lawyer, and Truly, an optimistic romance author. Their relationship takes off after a heated exchange on a podcast, revealing that they may have more in common than they initially thought. The plot is both humorous and engaging, highlighted by one of the best meet-cutes I've encountered in a long time.",
            "Colin embodies the ideal book boyfriend—intelligent, kind, and thoughtful, he treats his partner like royalty. His Bridgerton-esque charm, complete with sharp suits and glasses, enhances his allure. The author, known for her hilarious romantic flair and vibrant personality, creates a character who occasionally comes across as manipulative and immature for her 27 years. However, she is well-developed and thoughtfully crafted. Both characters identify as queer (bisexual/queer), and the narrative addresses the complexities of being bisexual while primarily engaged in heterosexual relationships, tackling issues like imposter syndrome and identity. This exploration adds depth and diversity to their story.",
            "The writing is engaging and expertly crafted. The author demonstrates mastery in her research, creating a polished story that authentically represents diverse demographics, sexualities, and personalities. The opening chapter captivated me from the very first sentence, and the pacing throughout the narrative felt just right—never rushed or under-edited."

The author’s attention to detail and ability to balance humor, emotion, and realism make this book a standout. While Truly’s occasional immaturity was a minor drawback, the overall story is a joy to read.",

The plot revolves around Colin, a family lawyer who doesn’t believe in love, and Truly, a romance author who believes love is the best thing. Their relationship develops after a blow-up on a podcast, leading them to realize they’re not as different as they seem. The plot is funny, engaging, and features one of the best meet-cutes I’ve read in a long time.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Colin: He’s the definition of a book boyfriend—smart, kind, thoughtful, and loves treating his partner like royalty. His Bridgerton-esque charm (suits and glasses) adds to his appeal.  \n  - Truly: A laugh-out-loud romance author with a huge personality and a lot of sass. While I found her manipulative at times and occasionally immature for a 27-year-old, she is a well-written and thought-out character.  \n  - Both characters are queer (bisexual/queer), and the author explores the challenges of being bi while only being in relationships with the opposite gender, addressing imposter syndrome and identity. This adds depth and diversity to their characters.  \n\n- **Relationships (Romantic, Familial, and Friendships):**  \n  The romantic relationship between Colin and Truly is beautifully written, and their chemistry is undeniable. Their familial relationships and friendships are also well-developed, making the story feel rich and authentic. I felt emotionally connected to the characters, experiencing their anger, laughter, and blushing moments alongside them.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Craftsmanship:**  \n  The writing is engaging, interesting, and well-executed. The author is a master of her craft, taking time to research and create a story that feels polished and representative of multiple demographics, sexualities, and personalities. The opening chapter hooked me from the first sentence, and the pacing never felt rushed or under-edited.  \n\n- **Sex Scenes:**  \n  The sex scenes are well-written, realistic, and not hyperbolic. They add to the story without feeling gratuitous.  \n\n- **Additional Highlights:**  \n  The Taylor Swift references were a delightful bonus!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Truly, Madly, Deeply* is a well-crafted contemporary romance with engaging characters, a compelling plot, and thoughtful representation. The author’s attention to detail and ability to balance humor, emotion, and realism make this book a standout.

Instead of using traditional pet names, nicknames, and phrases, Ms. Bellefleur employed conversational language that made the story feel like a chat with a close friend. This approach made the narrative more engaging and the characters more lovable and memorable.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The book is a feel-good romance novel with a simple, lighthearted plot. Not much happens in terms of a complex storyline, and it is heavy on smut scenes. While I enjoyed the book, I wasn’t particularly eager to find out what happens next. However, I recognize that this is often the point of romance novels—they focus on creating a pleasant, enjoyable reading experience rather than intricate plot development.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters were endearing and well-crafted, making them easy to connect with. The conversational writing style contributed significantly to their charm and relatability.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n   - The cover is absolutely stunning and deserves 6/5 stars. I loved it so much that I would frame it for my book room wall if I could!  \n\n- **Inconsistencies:**  \n   - The only issue I had with the book was the inconsistency with Truly's last name. In the synopsis and the first chapter, she is introduced as Truly Livingston, but later in the story, she introduces herself as Truly St. James and maintains this name throughout the rest of the book. I’m unsure if this was an oversight or if there was a reason for the change that I missed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable, light, and fluffy read, perfect for anyone looking for a feel-good romance novel with a focus on smut. The conversational writing style and lovable characters made the story engaging, though the plot was simple and not particularly suspenseful. Despite the minor inconsistency with Truly's last name, I would recommend this book to romantic readers, especially those who enjoy lighthearted, smut-heavy stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Cover Design: 6/5 stars  \n- Overall Enjoyment: Positive, though no specific numerical rating provided.  \n\nSpecial thanks to HarperCollins and Goodreads for the ARC copy of this novel in exchange for my honest opinion!"

Colin's strained relationship with his family resonated with me, capturing his frustration authentically. Truly's attempt to reunite her separating parents through a parent trap-style scheme adds an interesting layer to her character. While Colin is portrayed as mature, sweet, and the ideal partner, Truly often comes off as immature and childish. However, I sympathized with her, as it seemed her previous relationship had drained her, and she was finally rediscovering joy.

As a bi woman, I often struggle to connect with such characters, possibly because I critique them too harshly. However, I found myself connecting more to Colin than to Truly, which was fine with me.  \n\n- **Character Development and Backstories:**  \n  - The main characters don’t have overly tragic backstories, which was refreshing.

            "The book features a charming and relatable storyline, filled with moments that resonated with my own experiences of crushes. However, the subplot involving Truly's attempts to reunite her parents felt frustrating and immature for a 27-year-old character, which was a significant drawback for me.",
            "Truly and Colin made a fantastic pair. Truly's best friend, Lulu, was a hilarious, supportive, and strong presence in her life. Colin, a charming and considerate partner, consistently went the extra mile to make Truly happy, even calling her mother for a special soup recipe when she fell ill. In contrast, Truly's ex, Justin, came across as a pathetic character with flimsy excuses for his infidelity. While Colin's sister, Caitlin, was likable, the rest of his family left much to be desired. Truly's parents were well-meaning, but their frequent use of musical theatre lyrics in conversation became increasingly grating.",
            "The book features fun Taylor Swift references that will delight Swifties. However, while Truly's parents' use of musical theatre lyrics is a creative touch, it ultimately becomes repetitive and grating."

While the parent trap subplot was frustrating and felt out of place, the book was still an enjoyable read. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet romance with a unique twist.",

Their dynamic is refreshingly unique: Colin, the cinnamon roll hero, is nurturing and submissive, while Truly takes a more dominant role, allowing both characters to thrive in their relationship.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Characters and Dynamics:**  \n  - The heroine, Truly, is a romance novelist who has had her faith in love shaken by a broken engagement and her parents' trial separation.  \n  - The hero, Colin, is a family lawyer with a messy love life backstory and toxic family dynamics.  \n  - Their dynamic is unique: Colin is a cinnamon roll hero who is submissive and loves taking care of Truly, while Truly is a bit dominant, and they both thrive in this dynamic.  \n  - The dislike-to-friends-to-lovers trope is well-executed, and there’s no third-act breakup, which is refreshing.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story begins with Truly discovering her ex cheating on her during a \"break,\" setting the stage for her emotional journey.  \n  - The plot revolves around Truly and Colin meeting on a podcast hosted by Colin’s sister, where they initially clash but eventually develop a strong connection.  \n  - The pacing is generally good, but the ending feels slightly rushed, and the epilogue, while nice, feels unnecessary.  \n\n- **Chemistry and Romance:**  \n  - The chemistry and heat between Truly and Colin are off the charts, making their love story believable and engaging.  \n  - Their relationship develops respectfully and organically, with plenty of text exchanges that add a charming epistolary element to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  - The novel explores themes of messy family dynamics, the complexities of love, and rebuilding faith in relationships.  \n  - Truly’s struggles with her parents’ separation and her own broken engagement add emotional depth to her character.  \n  - Colin’s realism as a divorce lawyer contrasts nicely with Truly’s romanticism, creating a compelling dynamic.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Format:**  \n  - The inclusion of text exchanges is a highlight, adding a unique and enjoyable layer to the storytelling.  \n  - The writing is engaging, though the ending could have been more fleshed out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a delightful romance novel with well-developed characters, sizzling chemistry, and a refreshing take on the friends-to-lovers trope. While the ending felt a bit rushed and the epilogue unnecessary, the story’s emotional depth and unique dynamics make it a compelling read. I’m eager to explore more of Bellefleur’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The protagonist, a bestselling romance author, comes across as surprisingly delusional and naive about love, which undermines the credibility of her profession. Her juvenile reaction to her parents' separation felt unnecessary and detracted from the story. Additionally, her fascination with Colin's moles struck me as odd; it's not a trait I find appealing, so I was puzzled by its frequent mention. I'm also growing weary of male characters in romances being portrayed with perfect bodies and dimples—this cliché is becoming tiresome. \n\nWhile I can see why some might view Colin as overly perfect, I appreciated his honesty about his feelings and his refusal to play games. His willingness to be a bit submissive added heat to some of the sex scenes. However, Truly's insufferable nature made it difficult to understand what Colin saw in her.",
            "While I found the book enjoyable, it lacks the lasting impact that would make it memorable. As an avid reader, only the truly exceptional stories stand out to me, and this one didn’t quite reach that level. However, it did maintain my interest throughout, so I would be open to exploring more works by this author in the future."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the book kept my interest until the end, it fell short in several areas, particularly in LGBTQ+ representation and character development. Truly’s naivety and juvenile reactions were frustrating, and Colin, though refreshingly honest, felt overly perfect. The story was enjoyable but not memorable enough to stand out among other books I’ve read.",

It’s not something I’d consider a turn-on, so I don’t understand why it was mentioned so much.  \n\n- **Character Development (Colin):**  \n   - I’m getting sick of male characters in romances having perfect bodies and dimples. The last thing has especially become way too cliché.  \n   - I can understand why people found Colin to be too perfect.  \n   - It was nice to see a male character that was honest about his feelings and didn’t play games.  \n   - Because he wasn’t afraid to be a bit submissive, I found some of the sex scenes hot.  \n   - It could be hard to understand what he saw in Truly because of how insufferable she could be.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Memorability:**  \n   - It was an enjoyable enough read, but not one I am likely to remember well in the future.  \n   - I read a lot of books, so only the exceptional ones stick out in my mind. This did not fall into that category.  \n   - Since it was able to keep my interest throughout, I wouldn’t be opposed to checking out this author again.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book kept my interest until the end, it fell short in several areas, particularly in LGBTQ+ representation and character development. Truly’s naivety and juvenile reactions were frustrating, and Colin, though refreshingly honest, felt overly perfect.

Their relationship evolves from animosity to friendship and potential love, making for a compelling and well-paced journey.",

His casual demeanor and ample free time seem inconsistent with the demands of a legal career, and the absence of an explanation for his professional lifestyle undermines his authenticity.

The focus on the characters' relationships felt balanced.  \n  - The epilogue was adorable, though the ending felt slightly unrealistic.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The writing was enjoyable, with fun references and a lighthearted tone.  \n  - The book was a fast and fun read, pulling me out of my reading slump.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  - The romance was filled with clichés, but I embraced them fully and enjoyed the ride.  \n  - The sex scenes were well-balanced—just the right level of spice without overwhelming the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful, fast-paced read that I thoroughly enjoyed.

The banter is a 10/10.  \n\n- **Side Characters and Subplots:**  \n  I loved the side characters and the side plots. They added depth and richness to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n  The writing was atmospheric in a way I don’t often feel in romance novels.

The conversations about feeling \"bi\" enough and bi erasure were meaningful and well-handled.  \n\n- **Spicy Scenes (Frequency and Style):**  \n  The way the spicy scenes were written, their frequency, and their length in the last 50% of the book were a drawback for me. The scenes leaned heavily into certain preferences that felt unexpected and out of left field. For example, the dynamics shifted dramatically—from her dominating him in one scene to him ordering her around in another. Additionally, the multiple sex scenes in public spaces or with other people in the house were not to my taste.  \n\n- **Pacing and Balance:**  \n  Near the end, there was a stretch where a long spicy scene (34 minutes in the audiobook) was followed by a very short chapter (4 pages or 2 minutes in the audiobook), then another long spicy scene (28 minutes in the audiobook), and yet another spicy scene shortly after. This imbalance disrupted the flow and left me wanting more of the plot and character development I had enjoyed earlier.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excelled in character chemistry, banter, side characters, and atmospheric writing, the frequency, length, and style of the spicy scenes in the latter half of the book detracted from my overall enjoyment.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Chemistry and Development:**\n   - The chemistry between Truly and Colin is intense, marked by flirty bickering and sexual innuendo, making their interactions hot and engaging.\n   - Colin’s kindness, devotion, and protectiveness towards Truly, as well as her ability to both challenge and defend him, elevate their love story and make it feel special.\n\n- **Romance Dynamics:**\n   - The story is a slow-burn, enemies-to-lovers romance featuring two bisexual characters, which adds depth and representation to the narrative.\n   - There’s a meaningful discussion about Truly’s identity, where she questions whether she can legitimately call herself bisexual if she’s never acted on her attraction to women.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**\n   - The overuse of song titles and lyrics in serious conversations between Truly and her musical theater-loving parents starts off cute but eventually feels absurd and detracts from the story.\n   - The repeated mention of Colin’s moles (six times) becomes an unnecessary distraction and slightly annoying.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - Despite the minor flaws, the book is a very sweet and enjoyable read, with steamy and raw sex scenes that add to the romance.\n   - I would definitely recommend it to fans of queer romance, especially those who appreciate slow-burn, enemies-to-lovers dynamics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Truly, Madly, Deeply* is a heartfelt and steamy queer romance with well-developed characters and a compelling enemies-to-lovers dynamic. While the overuse of song lyrics and repetitive details like Colin’s moles slightly detract from the experience, the story’s charm, chemistry, and representation make it a worthwhile read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- The review implies a rating slightly below 5 stars due to the mentioned flaws, though no explicit score is provided."

I loved every text message and verbal sparring match between them.  \n  - Truly's journey of maturity and Colin's journey of self-acceptance were incredibly sweet and relatable.  \n  - The bi wife/husband energy between the characters added depth and authenticity to their relationship.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  - The story begins with Truly catching her fiancé cheating, which sets the stage for her initial resistance to Colin.  \n  - Despite Truly's misgivings, Colin convinces her to give the podcast (and him) a second chance, creating a compelling enemies-to-lovers dynamic.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  - The Seattle setting was well-written and added a vivid backdrop to the story.  \n  - I wish there was more development of the side characters to fully round out the main characters and enhance the world-building.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  - The author’s belief in true, everlasting love shines through the narrative.  \n  - The banter between the characters is some of the best ever written, making their interactions a highlight of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful blend of humor, romance, and personal growth, with exceptional banter and relatable character arcs. While I would have liked more development of the side characters, the Seattle setting and the journey of the main characters made this a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Colin follows her, motivated by a desire to support his sister, which paves the way for more playful exchanges and shared moments. The story unfolds as a low-stakes, cozy romance, making it a potential comfort read. However, it lacks the gripping tension that would make it truly addictive, making it easy to set aside and lose focus on other distractions.",

There's something special about a man crafted by a woman. He seemed almost too good for Truly, but hey, he knows what he wants, and he can do no wrong. Truly reminded me of my younger self—a hopeless romantic, though I've since become more realistic. However, her fixation on mending her parents' relationship was cringeworthy.

It’s a quick, fun read, perfect for anyone looking to dive into a summer romance.\n\n- **Characterization (Colin):**  \n  Colin was the saving grace of this book. I could only picture him as Steve Harrington, and honestly, that’s not a bad thing. There’s truly nothing better than a man written by a woman. He was almost too good for Truly, but hey, he likes what he likes, and the man can do no wrong.\n\n- **Characterization (Truly):**  \n  Truly reminded me of my younger self—a hopeless romantic, though I’m a bit more realistic now. However, her obsession with trying to fix her parents’ relationship was cringe-worthy. During pivotal moments, like characters confessing their love, her focus on her parents felt out of place and frustrating.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The book is a sexy, flirty romance that I absolutely ate up. It’s lighthearted and enjoyable, though I found myself overthinking it at times instead of just taking it for what it is—a fun, romantic story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some frustrations with Truly’s character, I enjoyed the book overall. It’s a solid 4-star read, maybe 3.5 if I think about it too hard. It’s perfect for anyone looking for a quick, entertaining romance.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a quick, engaging, and fun summer romance with a standout male lead in Colin.

It felt like a warm embrace for all the doubts I had about my bisexuality, and I truly appreciate this aspect of the story. I highly recommend it for this reason.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The way Colin treated Truly from the beginning was absolutely perfect. If I don’t have a relationship like that, I don’t want anything at all. Additionally, I found it incredibly hot that Truly was the dominant one in their dynamic—sorry not sorry!  \n\n- **Romantic and Emotional Moments:**  \n  The spicy scenes were a solid 10/10; I have no complaints. One particular moment stood out to me: when Colin said, “Me? I happen to be wildly in love with you. Isn’t it obvious? You fucking own me, Truly,” with such raw emotion. It was so cute and heartfelt.  \n\n- **Character Development and Flaws:**  \n  Truly’s involvement in her parents’ relationship felt a bit childish to me. While I understand it was meant to add depth to the story, her meddling came across as immature, even if her intentions were to see her parents happy.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  Colin’s family, with the exception of Caitie, was absolutely terrible. They can all go to hell.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a deeply validating and enjoyable read, especially for its representation of bisexuality and the dynamic between Colin and Truly. While some aspects of Truly’s character and Colin’s family were less appealing, the romantic moments and spicy scenes more than made up for it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spicy scenes: 10/10  \n- Overall enjoyment: Highly recommended!"

I loved how Colin fell for Truly first and did so wholeheartedly; he was both charming and delightfully audacious. Colin's family drama was complex and often frustrating, but Truly's family annoyed me even more. Their habit of communicating in musical theatre song titles in certain rooms felt cringeworthy and undermined any sympathy I might have had for their relationship struggles.",

The bitchy banter between them was fantastic, and I loved how Colin fell first and fell hard. He was utterly charming and, at times, delightfully filthy.  \n\n- **Romantic and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The spice in this book was fantastic, and it’s probably the spiciest of Bellefleur’s books. I appreciated how they communicated, both in their relationship and in general. Their interactions were so engaging that I could have read so much more about them.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Enjoyment:**  \n  The book was easy to read and a delight overall. I particularly enjoyed the humor, especially the insult “sentient jar of mayo,” which I’ll definitely be keeping for future use.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics and Subplots:**  \n  Colin’s family drama was multi-layered, and the way they treated him was infuriating. However, Truly’s family irritated me the most. Their gimmick of speaking in musical theatre song titles in certain rooms of the house felt cringey and detracted from any sympathy I might have had for their relationship issues.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful read, with fantastic chemistry between the main characters, engaging banter, and plenty of spice.

From the cover to the storyline, this could easily have been a cis book.  \n\n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  The FMC has unrealistic expectations of relationships, largely influenced by her parents' relationship. Her worldview is shaken when her parents reveal a significant truth about their relationship, leaving her unsure of what to believe. She is determined to stay single, which creates tension in her dynamic with the MMC.  \n\n- **Character Development (MMC):**  \n  The MMC is cynical about love due to his profession as a family attorney, where he often sees relationships at their worst. Despite his skepticism, he is committed to helping the FMC see the possibilities in relationships and challenges her resolve to remain single.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The book focuses heavily on the FMC’s struggles with her parents' relationship and her own views on love.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Representation of Bisexuality:**  \n  - The book features some of my favorite bisexuality representation.  \n  - It emphasizes that bi women in straight-passing relationships are still bi, and bi people who have never dated a member of the same gender are still bi.  \n  - A character in the book articulates this well: \"There’s no such thing as being queer enough. Action and attraction are two different things. You could go the rest of your life never dating a woman and it wouldn’t change a thing. If anything, I think you’re the perfect person to talk about bi-erasure in media because you spent the last six years in a straight-presenting relationship that was queer because you’re queer. And the gender of your partner? Doesn’t change that.”  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  - While this is not my favorite of Bellefleur's books, I appreciate its strong points, particularly its representation of bisexuality.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThough this novel isn’t my top pick from Bellefleur, it stands out for its thoughtful and affirming portrayal of bisexuality, challenging stereotypes and addressing bi-erasure in a meaningful way.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I love how nearly all her characters are queer.  \n  - The sentiment behind bi erasure was poignant and thoughtful.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Dynamics:**  \n  - This book was also one of the spiciest I’ve read by this author, exploring some kinks.  \n  - The coupling was a slow burn, which I found delicious—nothing physical happens in the first 50% of the book; just playful, witty banter.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Tropes:**  \n  - The lack of a third act breakup is refreshing, and I fully appreciated the switch-up.  \n  - There is a serious uncoupling, but it’s not with the main characters (MCs).  \n\n- **Character Development and Side Characters:**  \n  - My only negative is I wish we got more from the sister. I would have loved to see her reaction to Truly and Colin dating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is a standout for its queer representation, thoughtful exploration of bi erasure, and well-executed slow-burn romance with spicy elements. The witty banter and refreshing avoidance of a third-act breakup between the MCs added to its appeal. However, I felt the sister’s character could have been more developed, particularly in her reaction to the central romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The musical theater elements added charm, and the exploration of bierasure and biphobia was deeply appreciated.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated that the tension remained high even after the characters got together, which is often lost in stories filled with teasing and banter. The inclusion of a few spicy scenes added to the appeal, and I found their chemistry compelling. It was heartwarming to see them support each other through challenging moments.",
            "I enjoyed the banter between Truly and Colin, which hinted at a classic 'enemies to lovers' dynamic. However, their mutual attraction developed too quickly for the trope to resonate effectively. Colin was a standout 10/10 book boyfriend, while Truly occasionally frustrated me with her childishness and stubbornness. Although I understood her motivations, she never seemed to learn from her mistakes. That said, I appreciated her sass and how well she matched Colin's humor. I also loved the bi representation from both characters, as they shared their experiences of coming out, facing judgment, and navigating their internal struggles.",

However, the mutual attraction and feelings came too fast for the trope to work effectively. Colin was a 10/10 book boyfriend. Truly, on the other hand, irked me a bit; she seemed childish at times and stubborn, but not enough to ruin the book. I can see why she acted the way she did, but she never seemed to learn from her actions. That said, I did like her sass and how she matched Colin's humor and banter.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  I loved the bi representation from both characters and how they each shared their experiences with what it was like to come out, dealing with judgment from others, and their internal struggles.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Development:**  \n  I was happy the tension didn’t die down after they got together, as it often can when characters tease and banter a lot in the buildup. There were a handful of spicy scenes, if that’s your thing. I think they worked well together, and seeing them stick by each other during difficult situations was sweet.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  Overall, I would recommend this book!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book lived up to my high expectations as a fan of the author. While the 'enemies to lovers' trope felt rushed, the chemistry between Truly and Colin, their banter, and the bi representation made it an enjoyable read. Despite Truly’s occasional childishness, her sass and the emotional depth of the story kept me engaged.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 ⭐️ (rounded up)  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nBig thanks to NetGalley & Avon and Harper Voyager for the ARC in exchange for my honest review!"

Their primary relationship dynamics were a highlight of the story and contributed positively to my overall experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I initially considered a 3.5 rating due to the FMC's immaturity, I ultimately settled on a 4 because of Colin's charm, the enjoyable banter, and the strong relationship dynamics between the main characters.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - The audiobook narrator did an exceptional job bringing the story to life, especially with the steamy dialogue. It’s not suitable for public listening but in the best way possible.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The book doesn’t have much of a plot, but the vibes are excellent. It starts with a dramatic scene where Truly catches her fiancé cheating, setting the tone for the story.  \n   - The pacing is engaging, with instant tension between Truly and Colin during their first meeting at a podcast recording.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Truly and Colin are both well-developed characters with valid reasons for being cynical about love. Their journey to build trust, especially Truly’s, feels authentic and relatable.  \n   - Truly’s decision to parent-trap her parents is cringey but consistent with her character, showcasing her imperfections and making her more realistic.  \n\n- **Representation and Queerness:**  \n   - The representation of bisexuality in an M/F couple is handled beautifully. Truly and Colin validate each other’s queerness and bond over their shared experiences of bi-erasure.  \n\n- **Point of View (POV):**  \n   - The story is primarily told from Truly’s POV, which works well to emphasize her struggles with trust and love. However, it’s surprising that Colin’s POV is limited to just the final chapter, as Bellefleur’s other books typically feature dual POVs.  \n\n- **Career Representation:**  \n   - The portrayal of Truly’s and Colin’s careers (romance author and family lawyer, respectively) is well-executed. Their passion for their work is discussed without unnecessary scenes of them actually working, which is a refreshing choice.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a standout in Bellefleur’s works, with excellent character dynamics, steamy moments, and thoughtful representation of bisexuality. While the plot is minimal, the emotional depth and character-driven narrative make it a compelling read. The audiobook narration adds an extra layer of enjoyment, though it’s best enjoyed in private.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review, but the tone is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a high rating."

At 27, her immaturity, whining, and self-centeredness made her inability to handle the situation like an adult frustrating and unjustifiable. She idealized her parents' relationship without considering the reasons for their divorce, focusing solely on her own feelings.

Her counterpart, Colin, a patient and generous family lawyer, complements her well. Both characters are strong-willed and stubborn, creating a dynamic balance between them.

While her trilogy is still my favorite overall, I've really liked her standalones as well.  \n\n- **Premise and Bookish Appeal:**  \n  This one in particular drew my eye because of the obvious bookish aspect of the premise.  \n\n- **Romance Development and Character Dynamics:**  \n  I really enjoyed how the romance developed in this one; I'm a big fan of when characters have fun banter even if it comes with some rivalry/antagonism. The dynamic between the two characters was fun and entertaining, and it made them falling in love interesting to read.  \n\n- **Character Support and Growth:**  \n  I love how the MC stood up for the LI (also, what the fuck was up with his family??) when he didn't have the support he deserved. I also think the LI was a great contrast to the MC by giving her tough love when needed. Their relationship just worked so well!  \n\n- **Exploration of Queer Identity in Relationships:**  \n  I appreciated having a book delve into what it means to be queer within a straight-passing relationship; both characters deserved better than their exes!  \n\n- **Pacing and Emotional Connection:**  \n  I did feel like some parts of the story moved too fast, and I wanted more time as a reader to feel the characters connect.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I'm a big fan of this author and can't wait to see what more they release. While the pacing could have been slower to allow for deeper emotional connection, the romance, character dynamics, and exploration of queer identity made this an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Truly Livingston, a romance author whose faith in true love is tested when her fiancé cheats and her parents separate. Initially, she views Colin, a cynical divorce lawyer, as merely an adversary, but their relationship gradually deepens. The narrative delves into themes of love, trust, and personal growth.",
            "**Colin:** I absolutely loved Colin! He was a charming and balanced male lead, serving as the perfect counterpoint to Truly and adding depth to the story. \n\n**Truly:** At times, Truly felt a bit excessive. Some of her actions came off as immature and annoying, yet her flaws made her relatable. Her behavior is well-explained by her parents’ influence, which adds complexity to her character. \n\n**Supporting Characters:** Truly’s parents enrich the narrative, shedding light on her personality. The book touches on bisexuality, but this aspect feels underdeveloped. While it accurately portrays two bisexual individuals in a straight-passing relationship, the representation is limited to a few brief conversations. As a straight woman, I recognize I may not be the best judge of this topic, but it didn’t diminish my overall enjoyment of the book.",

Colin, a cynical defense attorney, sharply contrasts with Truly, a historical romance writer who believes in love. Their witty banter is delightful, and while Colin is infatuated with Truly from the start, she takes a bit longer to catch on. The evolution of their relationship is both engaging and fun, with flirty and entertaining texts that reveal their true feelings. A standout element is Colin's admiration for Truly, even when she’s rude or mean to him—his devotion is endearing and makes him a top-tier book boyfriend.

If you like stories where women take charge and the male lead is a \"munch\" (submissive), this book is for you!  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was a bit inconsistent at times, feeling \"meh\" in certain parts. However, the audiobook narrator did a great job of bringing the story to life and making it more engaging.  \n\n- **Plot and Subplots:**  \n  While the romance was enjoyable, I didn’t care much for the side plots surrounding it. They felt unnecessary and detracted from the main story, which was a bit of a shame.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a quick read with interesting themes and enjoyable romantic dynamics. However, the FMC’s immaturity and the less engaging side plots kept me from fully loving it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75⭐️"

While it contains the essential elements of a romantic narrative, they fail to blend cohesively, resulting in a disjointed plot. Although there are playful and spicy moments—some so vivid they evoke adult film narration—the overall execution ultimately disappoints.",

Colin, a divorce attorney, and Truly, an author of queer Regency romance novels, share a dynamic that evolves from conflict to camaraderie, enriching their relationship.

A standout moment is when a character quips, “One of these days,” she said, catching her breath, “we’re going to have sex in an actual bed,” which adds a delightful touch.

I wanted more exploration of this aspect.  \n   - **Truly's Writing and Inspiration:** Truly mentions on the podcast that her parents’ marriage inspired her to become a romance writer. When her parents separate, this connection is never explored further, even though it could have added depth to her character and work. While it’s briefly touched on in an edit letter, no one in her life seems to address how this personal upheaval impacts her writing.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - I enjoyed Alexandria Bellefleur’s writing style, particularly the initial spark of feisty attraction in the first 30 pages. However, as the story progressed, the romance felt overly obsessive on the male character’s part, which detracted from my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Scenes:**  \n   - The sex scenes, such as the fingering in the lake or the porch scene, were not to my taste. They felt awkward and didn’t enhance the story for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate Alexandria Bellefleur’s writing and enjoyed the initial setup of the story, this novel didn’t fully meet my expectations. Several intriguing plot points were introduced but left underdeveloped, and the romance became too obsessive for my liking. Additionally, the intimate scenes didn’t resonate with me. Overall, it had potential but fell short in execution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

I really wanted to love this story, especially because Colin was so focused on Trudy’s pleasure, and the subtle hints of kink and power play added an intriguing layer.

However, the spicy scenes and dirty talk felt cringeworthy to me, which is a matter of personal taste, as I tend to be particular about such scenes.

It would have been more believable for Colin to struggle with relationship insecurities given his background.",

The reasoning behind it didn’t feel strong enough to me.  \n  - It honestly would have made more sense for Colin to have relationship insecurities given his personal history.  \n\n- **Subplot and Maturity:**  \n  - The side story of Trudy’s parents on a trial separation and her trying to parent-trap them was so silly. The way it was done made Trudy come across as really immature.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Tone:**  \n  - There were some really good bits and even a few parts that made me laugh out loud.

I do want these characters but with a slightly different, less silly plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its enjoyable moments, including a fun bisexual couple dynamic and some laugh-out-loud scenes, it fell short for me due to cringy spice scenes, repetitive character motivations, and an immature subplot. It’s a decent, easy romance read but could have been stronger with a more refined plot and character development.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 3.5/5"

            "The book primarily focuses on Truly and her family. Although her relationship with the MMC (whose name I’ve already forgotten) is central to the story, it mainly serves as a means for her to navigate her family issues. Unfortunately, we don’t get to know the MMC beyond his role as a perfect, sexy cinnamon roll.",
            "This book is steeped in chronically online Gen Z memes, which can be exhausting. It often feels like a compilation of every meme, joke, and line from my Twitter and Instagram feeds over the past two years. Even the main character's parents sound like they’ve spent too much time on TikTok. However, this issue becomes easier to overlook after the 55% mark, when the story begins to explore deeper themes beyond the surface-level banter.",
            "I downloaded this book because the male lead on the cover resembled an illustrated Steve Harrington. The spice was quite enjoyable, and the sexy banter added to the fun. However, the story felt more like women's fiction centered on Truly than a traditional romance. The resolution seemed rushed and overly neat, as if the narrative lost momentum and wrapped everything up off-page."

The story provided only the bare bones, and I needed more depth.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  - The dirty talk and banter in the book were fantastic and highly enjoyable.  \n  - I read the entire book in less than 24 hours, which shows how much fun I had while reading.  \n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n  - While I enjoyed the book, I believe Alexandra Bellefleur is capable of delivering even stronger work than this.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was an entertaining and quick read, thanks to its engaging romantic elements and witty banter. However, it fell short in terms of character development and narrative perspective, leaving me wanting more depth and insight into the characters. Despite these shortcomings, I still had a great time reading it and believe the author has the potential to do even better.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, its pacing issues, forced conflicts, and lack of emotional depth kept it from being a standout read for me. While it’s entertaining and has a feel-good vibe, it didn’t fully engage me, making it a book I wouldn’t revisit. If you enjoy light romance with a touch of drama, you might enjoy it more than I did.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review. 😊"

            "The story centers on Truly, a successful romance novelist struggling with her own love life, and Colin, a divorce lawyer with a pragmatic view of relationships. Their contrasting perspectives—Truly's belief in fairytale romance versus Colin's realism—create natural tension and chemistry. The transition from adversaries to lovers feels organic and engaging. I particularly appreciated Colin's character; he is respectful, gives Truly the space she needs, and is a generous partner. Their dynamic is well-balanced, with Truly equally admiring and caring for Colin, making their relationship compelling.",
            "Truly's naivety and idealization of her parents' love story often felt juvenile, particularly her belief that their relationship is perfect simply because she has never witnessed them fight. This perspective made her seem younger than her 27 years. I would have preferred the story to delve deeper into the conflict between Truly and Colin's differing views on romance, rather than focusing on her parents' relationship drama. Additionally, the parents' Broadway song title game was distracting, especially during serious moments like their separation announcement. Although it was a minor aspect of the book, it left a negative impression.",
            "The banter and flirtation between Truly and Colin were brilliantly crafted, keeping me thoroughly engaged. The author's writing continues to impress, and I appreciate the increasing spice in their books.",
            "She is my go-to romance author, and I’ll read anything she writes. Although I typically don’t enjoy m/f romance, her previous book, *Hang the Moon*, won me over. I was excited to dive into this new title, despite my skepticism about the cover choice featuring Steve Harrington's face for the male love interest."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this novel was a delightful read with well-developed characters, engaging dialogue, and a natural progression from tension to romance. While some aspects of Truly's character and the parents' subplot could have been improved, the book was still a strong addition to the author's repertoire. I highly recommend it to fans of her work and look forward to her future projects.",

Despite not being a fan of m/f romance generally, her previous book, *Hang the Moon*, won me over. I was eager to dive into this new title, even though I was skeptical about the cover choice (using Steve Harrington's face for the male love interest).\n\n- **Plot and Characters:**\n   - The story follows Truly, a successful romance novelist who is down on her luck romantically, and Colin, a divorce lawyer with a realistic view of love. Their differing worldviews (Truly believes in fairytale romance, while Colin is more pragmatic) create natural tension and sparks. The progression from adversaries to lovers felt organic and engaging.\n   - I particularly loved Colin's character—he is respectful, gives Truly space, and is a generous partner. The dynamic between them is balanced, with Truly admiring and caring for Colin just as much as he does for her, which makes their relationship compelling.\n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**\n   - The banter and flirtation between Truly and Colin were exceptionally well-written and kept me riveted. Bellefleur's writing continues to impress, and her books are getting spicier, which I appreciate.\n\n- **Character Development and Nuance:**\n   - Truly's naivety and idealization of her parents' love story sometimes felt juvenile, especially her belief that their love is perfect because she's never seen them fight. This made her seem younger than her 27 years. I wished the story had focused more on the conflict between Truly and Colin's opposing views of romance rather than the parents' relationship drama.\n   - The parents' Broadway song title \"game\" was annoying, especially during serious conversations like announcing their separation. While it was a minor part of the book, it left a negative impression.\n\n- **Overall Satisfaction:**\n   - Despite some minor flaws, this was a satisfying addition to Bellefleur's body of work. I remain a devoted fan and look forward to her next book.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this novel was a delightful read with well-developed characters, engaging dialogue, and a natural progression from tension to romance.

He was a great communicator and emotionally intelligent, especially given his complicated family dynamics.  \n   - Truly’s character had some likable aspects, such as being a queer historical romance author (a rare representation).  \n   - The premise of Truly (a hopeless romantic) and Colin (a realist) offering relationship advice on a podcast was engaging.  \n   - LGBTQIA+ representation by an own voices author was appreciated.  \n   - The spice level was excellent and surprisingly high for a traditionally published romance.  \n   - The cover design was stunning.  \n\n- **Weaknesses:**  \n   - The “hate to love” trope felt underdeveloped. Truly’s reaction to a single immature interaction with Colin was exaggerated, making her hostility seem unrealistic.  \n   - The conflict surrounding Truly’s parents’ marriage was frustrating and poorly handled. Her meddling and lack of remorse felt immature and unrealistic.  \n   - The resolution of the parents’ marriage conflict was too convenient and lacked depth, leaving unanswered questions about what truly changed their minds.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Author Potential:**  \n   - Despite the issues, the author’s writing style and ability to create romantic chemistry were strong.  \n   - I would read more books by Alexandria Bellefleur in the future but will be more cautious about tropes and reviews beforehand.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n   - Homophobia, biphobia/bi-erasure, infidelity (not between the main characters), toxic relationships, and complicated family dynamics.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some strong elements, such as the chemistry between the main characters and the LGBTQIA+ representation, it fell short in executing the “hate to love” trope and resolving the parents’ marriage conflict in a satisfying way.

            "Colin McCrory shines as a male lead, embodying yearning, earnestness, devotion, and care—he ranks among my top 10 male leads of the year. In contrast, Truly often comes across as childish and frustrating, particularly in her disregard for her parents' boundaries and her black-and-white view of love. However, her journey toward allowing herself to love and be loved is redeeming. Colin’s patience and insight into her insecurities are commendable. The book effectively explores how love evolves and adapts, emphasizing that sometimes love alone isn't enough to sustain a relationship—a perspective I appreciated. Unfortunately, Truly’s rigid view of love limited her character development, and the contrast between her idealized perception of her parents' marriage and the reality of relationships was a missed opportunity for deeper exploration. Additionally, Caitlin and Lulu's abrupt disappearance halfway through the story felt jarring, especially since Lulu played a crucial role in encouraging Truly to open up to Colin."

        "conclusion": "While the book had many strengths, including a compelling male lead, steamy scenes, and humor, it was let down by Truly’s immaturity and the unsatisfying resolution of her parents’ reconciliation subplot. The narrative could have delved deeper into themes of love and relationships, but it ultimately felt like a missed opportunity. Despite these flaws, the book was enjoyable and had moments of brilliance.",

Her inability to respect her parents' boundaries and her black-and-white view of love were off-putting.  \n   - Despite her flaws, Truly’s growth in allowing herself to be loved and to love in return was redeeming. Colin’s patience and ability to see through her insecurities were commendable.  \n\n- **Parental Reconciliation Subplot:**  \n   - The decision to reconcile Truly’s parents at the end felt like a cop-out and undermined the potential for Truly to learn important lessons about love and relationships.  \n   - The subplot overshadowed Colin and Truly’s relationship at times, taking up too much narrative space.  \n   - Truly’s lack of accountability for meddling in her parents’ relationship was disappointing, and the reconciliation absolved her of any growth or reflection.  \n\n- **Themes of Love and Relationships:**  \n   - The book explores the idea that love evolves and adapts, and that sometimes love isn’t enough to sustain a relationship—a perspective I appreciated.  \n   - Truly’s inability to see love in shades of gray (instead of black and white) was a missed opportunity for deeper character development.  \n   - The contrast between Truly’s idealized view of her parents’ marriage and the reality of relationships could have been a powerful theme but was underutilized.  \n\n- **Side Characters (Caitlin and Lulu):**  \n   - Caitlin and Lulu disappeared halfway through the book, which felt abrupt, especially given Lulu’s role in encouraging Truly to give Colin a chance.  \n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Scenes:**  \n   - The intimate scenes between Colin and Truly were well-written and engaging—Colin excels at dirty talk.  \n   - The book had a lot of humor, and I found myself laughing frequently.  \n\n- **Romantic Influences and References:**  \n   - The book included nods to notable rom-coms, which added a layer of charm, though it’s unclear if these were intentional or simply a reflection of the author’s love for the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had many strengths, including a compelling male lead, steamy scenes, and humor, it was let down by Truly’s immaturity and the unsatisfying resolution of her parents’ reconciliation subplot.

            "In this story, the protagonist Truly is 27, yet her behavior often suggests a much younger age, creating a disconnect with her stated life experience. The repeated emphasis on her adulthood—such as paying bills and living independently—feels forced, as if she is still trying to prove her maturity. This inconsistency is reminiscent of another series where the lead character's actions don't align with her age. Although Truly frequently describes herself as a mess, her demeanor and actions indicate she is quite put together, which undermines her credibility as a character."

        "conclusion": "While the novel succeeds in delivering an entertaining romance with strong chemistry between the leads, it falls short in areas like character authenticity, depth of personal struggles, and meaningful representation.

This disconnect feels out of touch and undermines her credibility as a character.  \n\n- **Exploration of Personal Struggles and Trauma:**  \n   - The emotional dichotomy between the two romantic leads, particularly Colin’s background of borderline abuse, isn’t explored deeply enough. The impact of his upbringing doesn’t feel adequately conveyed.  \n   - The mention of Adderall and Colin’s potential ADHD struggles is introduced but not developed, making it feel like an afterthought rather than a meaningful part of his character.  \n\n- **Representation (Bi-Representation and LGBTQ+ Themes):**  \n   - The bi-representation feels superficial, with only a brief mention of bi-erasure and no meaningful exploration of Truly’s bisexuality.  \n   - Truly’s attraction to women is only stated, never shown, which makes the representation feel tokenistic and included solely for marketing purposes.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Strengths:**  \n   - Despite the criticisms, the story is entertaining and delivers the expected chemistry and romance typical of the genre.  \n   - The issues raised are relatively minor in the grand scheme of the novel, and the overall experience was enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel succeeds in delivering an entertaining romance with strong chemistry between the leads, it falls short in areas like character authenticity, depth of personal struggles, and meaningful representation.

The pacing is off, with the breakup attempt occurring at 96%, making it feel rushed and poorly timed. Additionally, the resolution of Truly’s parents not splitting up feels like a cop-out; it would have been more impactful to witness Truly's growth and maturity through the challenges of their divorce.",

While Truly's reasoning—that she wanted her parents together rather than happy—was insightful, it was also frustrating. By Chapter 16, Truly's behavior toward Colin became jarring; she was cold and dismissive when he asked her to be his girlfriend, and her insistence on the parent trap despite Lulu's warnings highlighted her immaturity and selfishness. In Chapter 20, her constant back-and-forth between breaking up with Colin and professing her love was infuriating.

However, Truly’s immaturity, the unrealistic pacing, and the lack of meaningful growth or resolution left me disappointed. While Colin and Lulu were highlights, Truly’s character and the overall execution of the story fell short.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 2 stars for Truly, 5 stars for the flirting and banter… so 3 stars overall."

            "In this story, Truly and Colin meet while recording a love advice podcast. Their on-air argument leaves Truly wishing to never see Colin again. However, his charm lingers in her thoughts. When Colin seeks her out to persuade her to return to the podcast, she reluctantly agrees.",
            "What didn't resonate with me was Truly's character. At 27, she comes across as incredibly immature, which made it hard for me to connect with her. The story begins with her fiancé of six years cheating on her, providing a valid reason for her initial reluctance to pursue a relationship with Colin. However, she clings to this excuse throughout the book, which quickly becomes tiresome. Despite this, the rom-com features quirky side characters, plenty of steam, and a charming male lead, making it a quick and enjoyable read for most romance fans. The flirty banter between Colin and Truly is delightful, and I particularly enjoyed their text exchanges and the moments they shared while getting to know each other in the first half of the story.",

Unfortunately, I didn’t love this one as much as I loved her other novels.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  Truly and Colin meet while recording a podcast where they give people love advice. They get into an argument on air, and Truly hopes to never see Colin again. But Colin is so cute, and she can’t stop thinking about him…so when he comes looking for her to beg her to go back on the podcast, she begrudgingly accepts.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Banter:**  \n  The banter between Colin and Truly is flirty and cute. I loved their text exchanges and the moments they spent together in the first half of the book getting to know each other.  \n\n- **Romantic and Spicy Elements:**  \n  The spice is very spicy, and there’s lots of it! While I enjoyed all the flirting, I still didn’t feel enough tension between Truly and Colin. I needed just a little more character development and a little less spice.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The discussion surrounding bi-erasure is important and educational.  \n\n- **Character Development (Truly):**  \n  What didn’t work for me here was Truly. She’s incredibly immature for 27, and I had a difficult time getting past that. The book opens with her fiancé of six years cheating on her, so she has reasons to be guarded and unwilling to jump into a relationship with Colin AT FIRST. But she continues to use that excuse throughout the book, and it gets very old very quickly.  \n\n- **Subplot (Parent Trap Scenario):**  \n  There’s also the “parent trap” scenario where Truly tries to trick her parents into getting back together, and that also feels very out of place and immature.  \n\n- **Side Characters and Overall Tone:**  \n  With quirky side characters, lots of steam, and a sweet and handsome MC, this rom-com is a quick, fun read that most romance lovers will enjoy.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  I’m looking forward to Bellefleur’s next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Truly, Madly, Deeply* has its charming moments, including flirty banter, spicy scenes, and important representation, it falls short in character development and tension.

The summary suggested a focus on the characters learning to host a podcast together, which could have provided insight into their worldviews and careers. Instead, the story shifted to Truly attempting to reunite her separating parents, a direction I found unappealing. The podcast element, rich with potential, was abandoned in favor of the parent trap storyline, leaving me frustrated.",

The male love interest is particularly well-developed, and I quickly developed a crush on him. I appreciated the early dynamics between the characters, and the decision to keep the cast small helped maintain clarity, avoiding the complications often found in romance novels. However, in the latter half, the dynamic between Truly and Colin shifted. Truly's tsundere traits seemed to regress rather than evolve, and by the end of the parent trap storyline, it felt like she hadn’t learned much.",

            "In \"Truly, Madly, Deeply,\" the story centers on Truly, a romance novelist, and Colin, a divorce attorney, who initially clash on a relationship podcast but gradually develop undeniable chemistry. However, Truly's quest to reunite her estranged parents feels immature for her age and detracts from the main romance, making the narrative seem unrealistic. The swift transition from animosity to love between Truly and Colin is also hard to believe. I found myself wishing for more resolution regarding side plots, particularly Colin's family issues and the potential for deeper involvement from characters like Lulu. Despite these shortcomings, the book concludes on a charming note. Overall, while \"Truly, Madly, Deeply\" is an enjoyable read, it suffers from pacing issues, with some sections feeling rushed or underdeveloped.",
            "Truly and Colin's chemistry is evident from the beginning, and the portrayal of bisexuality enriches the narrative. Truly's Instagram blunders are both cringeworthy and amusing, making her a relatable and enjoyable character. However, Colin's unresolved feelings about his brother dating his ex and Truly's intense reactions to her parents' separation come across as overly dramatic.",

In contrast, Truly felt a bit too needy for my taste. The standout character, however, was Truly’s friend Lulu—hilarious, quirky, and feisty. One of the funniest scenes was when Lulu playfully challenged Colin at Truly’s workplace.",

They had good back-and-forth moments and some funny interactions.  \n   - I preferred Colin over Truly; he was confident, cocky, and direct, which I loved. Truly, on the other hand, came across as too needy for my taste.  \n   - The standout character was Truly’s friend Lulu. She was hilarious, quirky, and feisty. One of the best scenes was when Lulu put Colin through the wringer at Truly’s workplace—it was quite funny.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n   - The ending felt rushed. There was a lot of buildup, but once the characters hooked up, the book ended abruptly within about 10-15 pages. It left me wondering if anything else was going to happen.  \n\n- **Inclusivity and Authenticity:**  \n   - I disliked how the author seemed to force inclusivity into the story. While I understand the intent to make everyone feel represented, it came across as obvious and not genuine. It felt like the author was overthinking to appease everyone, which detracted from the authenticity of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was just okay.

The initial setup is engaging, and the connection between Truly and Colin is well-developed. However, the plot loses steam when Truly concocts a parent trap scheme to reunite her parents after their separation. This subplot feels forced and detracts from the central romance. The resolution of her parents' relationship is abrupt and unconvincing, lacking a clear rationale that undermines the story's emotional depth.

The chemistry between Truly and Colin is a standout aspect of the book, featuring engaging and spicy moments that enhance their romance.

While I appreciate flawed protagonists, Truly came across as self-absorbed, lacking any significant growth or epiphany. She wasn't portrayed as a terrible person, but certainly not a commendable one either.

            "The pacing of the story was slow, and the numerous coincidences—such as both main characters arriving in the same lake town simultaneously—felt contrived. These moments could have been better developed.",
            "The characters were charming, but the female main character, Truly, often came across as immature for her 27 years. Her antics, such as attempting to parent-trap her own parents, felt unrealistic and overly dramatic. Meanwhile, the male main character, Colin, was almost too perfect, bordering on unbelievable; his flawlessness made him seem suspicious. The romance was light and enjoyable, making it a great pick-me-up read, and the spice was well-executed. However, the side characters, while fun, were underutilized and often felt like mere plot devices to further the main characters' relationship rather than having their own meaningful arcs."

While it’s entertaining and enjoyable as a mindless read, the unrealistic characterizations of the leads, slow pacing, and underdeveloped supporting characters hold it back from being truly great. It’s a decent palate cleanser for fans of typical romance novels, but it lacks depth and substance.",

Her actions, like parent-trapping her parents, felt unrealistic and overly angsty.  \n   - The MMC, Colin, was portrayed as too perfect, to the point of being unbelievable. His flawlessness made him feel unrealistic, almost suspiciously so.  \n\n- **Romance and Spice:**  \n   - The romance was cute and mindless, making it a perfect pick-me-up read.  \n   - The spice was well-done and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n   - The side characters were fun but underutilized.

These moments felt contrived and could have been set up better.  \n\n- **Missed Opportunities:**  \n   - There were missed opportunities to develop the supporting characters (e.g., Truly’s sex-shop friend and Colin’s sister) and give them more substantial roles.  \n   - The story lacked depth and substance, leaning more toward a light-hearted, Hallmark-esque romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Truly Madly Deeply* is a quick, light-hearted romance with great spice and queer representation.

In an effort to reunite them, she enlists Colin's help to meddle in their relationship.",

            "In this story, the female protagonist, Truly, is a romance author who appears disconnected from reality. Although she is in her late 20s, her reaction to her parents' separation feels immature, as she dismisses relationships entirely, reminiscent of pre-teen behavior and evoking Parent Trap-like antics. This aspect can be quite cringeworthy. On the other hand, the male lead, Colin, is sweet, patient, and attractive—clearly a character crafted by a woman. While his dialogue occasionally veers into the over-the-top, this is somewhat expected in a fictional narrative.",

She’s in her late 20s but reacts to her parents’ separation in a way that felt overly immature. Her decision to write off relationships because of her parents’ situation came across as pre-teen behavior, especially with the Parent Trap-like antics. It was kind of cringe.  \n\n- **Character Development (MMC - Colin):**  \n  The male main character, Colin, was sweet, patient, and attractive—very much written by a woman.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - The main characters are sparky together and have good chemistry.  \n  - Truly, the protagonist, is portrayed as immature, which is central to the plot.  \n  - Truly's dad seems to be a fictionalized version of Stanley Tucci, which feels intentional but may not resonate with all readers.  \n\n- **Plot and Realism:**  \n  - The story revolves around Truly's unrealistic and cartoonish plan to reunite her separated parents, modeled after *The Parent Trap*.  \n  - The execution of the plan feels deeply unrealistic, yet it somehow works within the narrative.  \n  - The recurring gimmick of characters quoting lines from musicals in every conversation feels excessive and overdone.  \n\n- **Character Development and Themes:**  \n  - The separation and reconciliation of Truly's parents present a missed opportunity for her to mature and define her own understanding of successful relationships.  \n  - The story lacks deeper exploration of personal growth or meaningful themes, focusing more on surface-level antics.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - The novel is solid and fun, providing an entertaining way to pass the time.  \n  - While enjoyable, it doesn’t stand out as a must-read or something I would actively recommend.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is an entertaining and lighthearted read with engaging character dynamics and a quirky, albeit unrealistic, plot. However, it falls short in delivering meaningful character development or thematic depth, making it a fun but forgettable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No explicit rating scores are mentioned in the review."

Truly’s best friend, Lulu, was a hoot and added a lot of charm to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The plot felt a little lacking and was almost too predictable, which took away some of the enjoyment for me.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The book is sexy, witty, and romantic, but it leans very “new age,” which didn’t fully align with my more traditional preferences.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its predictability and new-age tone, it was an enjoyable and fun read overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Truly, Madly, Deeply* is a light, entertaining, and romantic novel with charming characters and witty banter. While the plot was predictable and the tone leaned too modern for my taste, it was still a fun and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The first half of the book is enjoyable, charming, and steamy, but the second half quickly loses its momentum. The subplot involving Truly’s parents feels unrealistic and fails to resonate. Additionally, several plot points—such as Lulu’s disappearance, Truly’s unfinished book, and the podcast with Colin’s sister—remain unresolved, detracting from the overall narrative. While the first half captivates with strong tension and chemistry between the characters, the second half feels disjointed, with key elements and characters like Lulu vanishing without explanation.",

Additionally, the frequent mention of the MMC's \"mole-splattered skin\" struck me as odd and unappealing. The MMC's height of 5'8\" was also a personal red flag, though I recognize this is subjective.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  The novel is very fun and steamy, making it an enjoyable read. The flirting is particularly well-written, especially considering the level of heat the story eventually reaches.  \n\n- **Themes and Motifs:**  \n  The musical theater motif is present throughout the story, but it’s not overly intrusive. While it’s not my personal preference, it doesn’t detract significantly from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The plot is relatively light, with some family drama serving as the primary source of conflict. It’s not overly complex, which keeps the focus on the romance and character interactions.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The main character’s name is somewhat distracting. In dialogue, I often had to remind myself that it was her name and not just the other person emphasizing their words.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a fun and steamy romance novel with well-executed flirting and a light, family-driven plot. While the musical theater motif and the main character’s name were minor distractions, they didn’t significantly detract from my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The mix of tropes added some depth, but the overall pacing made it a challenging read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

The characters' internal struggles and growth felt underdeveloped, which made it hard to connect with their journey.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  There wasn’t really a third act separation and subsequent overcoming of obstacles to come together. The absence of this classic narrative arc left the story feeling incomplete and lacking tension.  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  The combination of weak character development and an unsatisfying plot structure left the book feeling flat. It didn’t deliver the emotional depth or resolution I was hoping for.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential, the lack of strong character development and a compelling plot structure made it fall short of expectations. The story felt flat and failed to engage me emotionally.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I enjoyed the dynamic between Truly and Colin; Colin is one of my favorite fictional male protagonists, and their intimate scenes were incredibly steamy. However, I found Truly's character frustrating. Her choices and emotional immaturity made it hard to root for her. She constantly denied reality, refusing to acknowledge her toxic past relationship, denying her clear attraction to Colin, and repeatedly pushing him away. Additionally, her exaggerated denial about her parents' failing relationship was infuriating. At 27, her behavior made it difficult to trust her as a protagonist, as she should have acted with more maturity.",

She refused to acknowledge that her previous relationship was toxic, denied her feelings for Colin despite obvious attraction, and pushed him away repeatedly.  \n   - She was also in complete denial about her parents’ failing relationship, to an exaggerated degree.  \n   - Her behavior made it difficult to trust her as a protagonist, especially since she’s 27 and should act more maturely.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict Resolution:**  \n   - There were many moments where the truth was blatantly obvious, but Truly refused to acknowledge it until the very end.  \n   - Despite her poor treatment of Colin and her refusal to face reality, everything conveniently works out for her in the end.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Reader Connection:**  \n   - I felt bad for Colin, who was inexplicably head over heels in love with Truly from the start, even though she treated him poorly with little consequence.  \n   - Truly’s actions and choices made it hard for me to connect with her or feel invested in her journey.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the chemistry between Truly and Colin and found their intimate scenes compelling, Truly’s character was deeply frustrating due to her emotional immaturity and constant denial of reality.

Truly and Colin's banter was exceptional and could not have been better.  \n\n- **Characterization (Colin):**  \n  Colin was an outstanding character. He had an infectious energy, was obsessed with his girl, and absolutely rocked.  \n\n- **Subplot (Truly's Parents):**  \n  I wasn’t a fan of the storyline involving Truly's parents.

Despite her flaws, I found myself rooting for her to grow and take charge of her life. In contrast, Colin, a divorce lawyer and co-host of Truly's podcast, embodies sophistication and worldliness, serving as a perfect foil to her childishness.

Despite her flaws, I found myself wanting her to grow up and take responsibility for her life.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Truly and Colin):**  \n  Colin, the divorce lawyer and co-host of Truly's podcast, is a stark contrast to her.

Their dynamic is compelling and adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel explores themes of adulthood, maturity, and relationships through Truly's journey. The inclusion of LGBTQ+ qualifiers is beautifully explained and adds richness to the narrative.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n  - The book did not meet my expectations for the romance genre. I felt the obsession with love only being valid if it lasts forever was not what I look for in romance. Love, to me, is valid and valuable in a wide range of ways, and this book's perspective felt limiting.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  - Despite featuring two queer characters, the book felt deeply rooted in heteronormative attitudes, which I found frustrating and hard to overlook. This was not because it was an m/f romance but due to the underlying attitudes portrayed in the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  - The book's themes and perspectives made it difficult for me to settle into the story. I found myself too upset by its messaging to fully engage with or enjoy the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell short of my expectations, particularly in its portrayal of love and its heteronormative undertones. While it had potential with its queer characters, the overall messaging left me frustrated and unable to connect with the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars, rounded up."

While the idea and plot description intrigued me, the execution fell short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Subplots:**  \n  I had issues with some of the subplots, though I can't delve into specifics without spoiling them. These subplots detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Author's Style and Consistency:**  \n  I’ve noticed a recurring theme with Alexandria Bellefleur's works: I often like the concept or premise more than the actual execution. This pattern holds true for this novel as well.  \n\n- **Final Act:**  \n  Similar to *Count Your Lucky Stars* (a Book of the Week for me), I had issues with the final act of this story. It didn’t fully resonate with me, leaving me somewhat unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While I don’t hate Bellefleur’s books—I keep coming back to them—I never find myself fully loving them. There’s always something that holds me back from being completely immersed or satisfied.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had an engaging premise and characters, but issues with subplots and the final act, along with a recurring pattern of execution falling short of the concept, left me feeling underwhelmed.

However, I did not.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Truly came across as childish and seemed to be doing her best not to be in a relationship with Colin. Colin himself seemed great, as did his sister, but the rest of his family was portrayed as horrible.  \n\n- **Plot and Situational Choices:**  \n  I found it baffling that Colin's wealthy family decided to serve Chipped Beef for a family dinner with guests present. While I personally love Chipped Beef and still enjoy it as an adult, it's widely known as a \"poor people food,\" which made the choice feel out of place and nonsensical. Truly and Colin both hated it, so perhaps it was intended as a way for them to bond over mocking the dish (Shit On a Shingle).  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  Despite some redeeming qualities, I'm not a fan of this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this novel due to my love for Bellefleur's previous work, it fell short for me. The characters, particularly Truly, felt underdeveloped, and certain plot choices, like the Chipped Beef dinner, were jarring and hard to reconcile with the story's context.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The protagonist, Truly, comes across as immature and younger than her stated age of 27. Her idealization of her parents’ marriage and her inability to reflect on her past relationship choices are frustrating. Colin, the male lead, is almost too perfect, resembling a wish-fulfillment character. While he has some depth—such as his ADHD and toxic family background—his flaws and potential for growth are insufficiently explored. \n\nThe lack of diversity in the cast is disappointing; most characters are white, with only a few queer characters beyond Colin and Truly. The book fails to provide meaningful representation of people of color and queer individuals. Additionally, there are problematic elements, such as the use of a racist, colonialist phrase (“the natives are restless”) in the parents’ musical game, which feels unnecessary and insensitive.\n\nTruly’s relationship with Colin feels rushed and lacks depth. She transitions from a six-year relationship with a clearly unsuitable partner directly into a romance with Colin without adequate reflection. The subplot of her parents’ separation is poorly handled, as Truly makes it all about herself and resorts to immature tactics like “parent trapping” instead of respecting their autonomy. Overall, the romance between Truly and Colin feels unbelievable, and even the editor’s note acknowledges this, leaving me skeptical about their future beyond the final page.",
            "The Seattle setting felt underutilized, missing an opportunity to explore Colin and Truly's connection to the city's queer community. Additionally, the story's economics were inconsistent; it was unclear how Truly's theater-working parents could afford a summer house in an upscale area.",

The inconsistent writing style, unengaging dialogue, and poorly executed subplot made it difficult to stay invested. While Colin was a charming character, his lack of relatability and Truly’s odd preoccupations further hindered my enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The book struggled with a lack of genuine conflict, making it hard to stay engaged. The main plot centered on the female main character attempting to reunite her parents, but this felt forced and unrealistic.

The abrupt ending left me feeling unsatisfied, as the absence of a meaningful resolution disconnected me from the narrative.",

            "The book falls short in several areas, particularly with the podcast element, which is only briefly touched upon despite its mention. I anticipated more angst, drama, and tension among the characters, but conflicts were resolved too easily, often through overreactions that led to swift reconciliations.",
            "The male love interest came across as unrealistic and overly perfect, which undermined the romance. I prefer characters with flaws and relatable traits, as perfection can dilute the story's impact. On a positive note, the bi-for-bi representation was a highlight, and the on-page discussion about bi-erasure was excellent. However, the book missed the chance to educate readers about the LGBTQIA+ acronym, particularly the meaning of the \"A\" (asexual, aromantic, agender) versus the problematic use of \"Ally.\" Additionally, the lack of diversity was evident, with no people of color or other queer characters, making the story feel overly white and limited in its inclusivity.",

            "The female main character (FMC) comes across as immature and cringe-worthy for most of the book, making her relationship with the male main character (MMC) feel more suited to middle schoolers, especially without the explicit content. While I found the MMC somewhat dull, I did appreciate his hyper-fixations and the random fun facts he shared during their conversations. Unfortunately, the relationship between the FMC and MMC lacked maturity and depth, making it difficult to take seriously. Additionally, the FMC’s father made an awkward and inappropriate comment about the MMC’s anatomy, which was uncomfortable. The MMC’s father’s portrayal as a bullying lawyer felt like a poorly executed joke and was triggering for me."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the novel fell short for me due to the immature character dynamics, cringe-worthy behavior from the FMC, and the excessive and off-putting focus on bodily fluids in the explicit scenes. While the MMC had some redeeming qualities, the story was marred by uncomfortable moments and poorly executed humor.",

Colin fell head over heels for Truly after only a few months, which didn’t feel believable.  \n   - Truly’s reluctance to date Colin due to not being in the “right headspace” seemed inconsistent, as her hesitation was tied more to her parents’ potential separation than her recent breakup.  \n   - The dynamic between Truly and Colin often felt one-sided, with Colin constantly waiting for her and being overly accommodating while she pushed him away.  \n\n- **Maturity and Tone of the Story:**  \n   - The overall tone and character interactions felt more suited to a young adult novel rather than a story about adults. The conversations and actions lacked maturity, making it hard to connect with the characters.  \n   - The resolution, where Truly’s parents decided not to separate and she ended up with Colin, felt forced and unrealistic. It ignored the natural complexities of relationships and separation.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n   - Compared to the author’s previous book, *Hang the Moon*, this novel fell short.

While the initial setup—Truly's breakup and the podcast's debut—shows promise, it quickly unravels when Truly storms out, feeling personally attacked by Colin's comments. The narrative becomes predictable and lacks the depth initially suggested. The ending is both foreseeable and cringe-worthy, failing to fulfill the potential of the original plot. Ultimately, I found myself longing for the story that was promised, as the actual narrative falls flat and lacks a meaningful resolution.",

Colin, though initially portrayed as perfect and communicative, ultimately feels pushy and dismissive of Truly's boundaries, ignoring her reluctance to date. Both characters lack depth and fail to evolve, resulting in a shallow and unconvincing relationship.",

The novel's attempts at quirkiness and sexual provocation often feel forced, particularly in scenes like the one set in the sex shop and the inappropriate comments from Truly's father, which come across as unnecessary.",

It felt awkward and took me out of the story.  \n\n- **Character Maturity and Decisions:**  \n  Truly felt extremely immature for a 27-year-old. Her inability to handle her parents’ relationship and her tendency to throw tantrums instead of having normal conversations were frustrating. Dragging out and trying to end her relationship with Colin multiple times because of her unresolved issues with her parents felt unnecessary and overdone.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I’m sad about how I felt reading this book.

I ended up skimming large chunks of it because the pacing felt off, and the story didn’t hold my interest consistently.  \n\n- **Use of Tropes:**  \n  The book relied heavily on overused tropes that felt unnecessary and forced. For example, the heroics at a family dinner table, where the MMC confronts his parents, came out of nowhere and lacked proper backstory to make it meaningful. The identical twin rivalry and the sick FMC trope also felt contrived and added little to the overall plot.  \n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n  The inclusion of both characters being bi felt disingenuous, as it didn’t contribute to the storyline or character development. It seemed like the author added it to meet a quota rather than to enrich the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot Cohesion:**  \n  The storyline felt disjointed, with random elements like the MMC’s parents being antagonistic and the twin rivalry thrown in without proper setup or relevance. These additions created unnecessary drama that didn’t enhance the plot.  \n\n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n  As someone who doesn’t typically enjoy contemporary romance, I found this book particularly underwhelming. It lacked the compelling and gripping elements needed to hold my interest, which is why I’m surprised I even finished it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a promising start, it quickly devolved into a series of overused tropes and disjointed plot points that failed to engage me. The unnecessary drama and lack of meaningful character development made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (I finished it, but it didn’t meet my expectations)."

Her insecurities arise from her parents’ separation after 30 years of what seemed like a happy marriage, a backstory that feels unrealistic and poorly explained. Both main characters are bisexual, with the male protagonist resembling Steve from *Stranger Things* on the cover.

The smut scenes are well-written and engaging, featuring unique elements like good boy femme domme dynamics.

The story begins with Truly discovering her boyfriend's infidelity, quickly transitioning to a podcast recording scene. Additionally, the subplot of Truly attempting to reconcile her parents felt messy and left me with an uncomfortable feeling.",
            "In this story, Truly and Colin are both cis, white, and bisexual characters, with Colin also appearing to have ADHD, as he takes Adderall. Notably, the narrative lacks diversity, featuring no characters of color and only a vague suggestion that Caitlin might be queer.\n\nOne standout moment occurs when Truly and Colin discuss their bisexuality and the issue of bi-erasure, which is beautifully executed. However, while Truly and Colin are positioned as antagonists, the narrative seems to force their dislike for one another, resulting in a lack of chemistry that I’ve found in three of the author’s other works. Truly comes off as bratty, while Colin feels overly perfect, lacking any real flaws.\n\nIf it weren't for the final chapter being from Colin's perspective, I would doubt their potential for a lasting relationship. Although he falls first and harder, the connection between them feels unconvincing, relying more on narrative assertion than genuine chemistry. The book does include three instances of public sex and one lengthy in-room scene that will satisfy spice enthusiasts. Overall, the author has a talent for engaging storytelling, but the character dynamics left me wanting more.",

There aren't any other queer characters, either (except it's sort of alluded that Caitlin is queer, but it's a very much 'squint to see' situation).\n   - There is a really fantastic scene where Truly and Colin talk about their bisexuality and bi-erasure that was beautiful. I loved that a lot.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**\n   - The cover art is misleading because there are zero scenes in bookstores.\n   - The book starts off with Truly being cheated on by her loser boyfriend, and then we dive straight into the podcast recording scene.\n   - There's the entire side-plot of Truly trying to get her parents back together that was a whole mess of yikes to me. That just sat really... ickily with me.\n\n- **Character Development and Chemistry:**\n   - Truly and Colin are portrayed to be antagonists, but it feels like the author was trying desperately for them to dislike each other, which fell flat for me.\n   - I didn't feel any of their chemistry, I didn't feel any of the spark I've felt with 3/4 of Bellefleur's other books.\n   - Truly is a brat, and Colin is a Mary Sue. Seriously, the guy has no flaws.\n   - If it wasn't for that end chapter being Colin's POV, I would say with certainty that these characters would not end up together once the book ends. He falls first, and falls harder, but that's it. There's just not a thing there for me to seriously believe they'd work long term except that we're told they would.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**\n   - Bellefleur really knows how to pull a reader in and capture their attention. She knows how to make me gasp, make me laugh, make me cringe, and feel secondhand embarrassment.\n   - There are only so many times one can read about how Truly wanted to map out Colin's moles with her tongue, bite his thighs and the like before it got tedious. It was said so often at one point that I couldn't stop rolling my eyes.\n   - The amount of times that Instagram was referred to in narrative as \"IG\" and then occasionally Instagram was just irksome. There were a few other instances of things where initials were used instead of the full title for things that was so very American that it was off-putting.\n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Content:**\n   - There are three counts of public sex that will drive people wild, and one very long in-room sex scene that will keep \"spice\" lovers happy.\n   - There were some fantastic scenes. Bellefleur really knows how to pull a reader in and capture their attention.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI had higher hopes for this book, but it ultimately let me down. While the writing is excellent and there are some fantastic scenes, the lack of chemistry between the main characters and the problematic side-plot of Truly trying to get her parents back together left me disappointed.

            "The book opens with a familiar scene: Truly catches her long-term boyfriend cheating. However, the main focus quickly shifts to her efforts to reunite her estranged parents. Unfortunately, the romance between Truly and Colin feels more like a subplot, which is disappointing. The pacing is inconsistent, with their transition from hate to love occurring too quickly and unrealistically. The ending is overly perfect, undermining the story's believability. Overall, the narrative reads more like a YA romance than an adult one, featuring immature dialogue and plotlines. The balance between the romance and the parental reconciliation is poorly executed, leaving the story feeling disjointed.",
            "Truly comes across as immature, selfish, and overly romantic, often dismissing opposing views in a condescending manner. Her inability to engage in mature conversations and her manipulative interference in her parents’ relationship feels unrealistic for a 27-year-old. In contrast, Colin is portrayed as excessively perfect—patient, understanding, and unwaveringly in love with Truly, which creates an unbalanced dynamic. His obsession with her is hard to believe, especially given her behavior. While the book initially promised bi representation, this aspect is overshadowed by the main plot and character issues. The themes of love and relationships feel juvenile, more fitting for a YA romance than an adult narrative.",
            "The dialogue often came across as forced and cringe-worthy, heavily leaning into millennial tropes in an attempt to be funny, quirky, and flirtatious. This reliance on humor and banter contributed to the characters' overall immaturity, making it challenging to take them seriously."

The narrator's portrayal of female characters, especially Colin's sister, is unrealistic and grating, with vocal inflections that don't align with their ages or personalities. The protagonist, Truly, displays the emotional maturity of a 12-year-old, naively believing she can manipulate her parents into reconciling by forcing them to spend time together. Her simplistic view of relationships—thinking true love means never arguing—undermines her credibility as an adult ready for a serious relationship. Truly's reaction to Colin during their podcast appearance is immature and disproportionate; she storms out over a minor critique, nearly jeopardizing someone else's career, and needs to be coaxed back like a child.

            "The Parent Trap subplot dominated the book, overshadowing the anticipated banter of the podcast co-hosting premise. As a result, the story felt disjointed and disappointing, especially given my excitement for the podcast dynamic.",
            "Truly is portrayed as delusional, immature, and arrogant, lacking any real growth throughout the story, which ultimately detracted from my enjoyment of the book. A romantic at heart, she clings to a dysfunctional relationship with the man-child Justin, prioritizing her fantasy of a happily ever after over the reality of their situation. Despite being depicted as intelligent and professional, her actions—such as attempting to \"Parent Trap\" her parents—come off as childish and unrealistic. \n\nColin, on the other hand, is a complex character; he oscillates between being rude and bratty and displaying thoughtfulness and insight as a dedicated volunteer. Although he claims to respect Truly’s boundaries after her breakup, his plans for “not date dates” to win her over feel disrespectful and immature, resembling playground antics rather than sincere communication.",

The frequent repetition of words and Truly's peculiar fixation on Colin's \"mole-splattered skin\" detracted from the narrative.

Truly is a young, immature, hopeless romantic, while Colin is an older, realist brat.  \n   - Their banter wasn’t witty or flirty; it sounded like two teenagers and was embarrassing to read.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n   - The Parent Trap subplot took up too much of the book, overshadowing the promised banter-filled podcast co-hosting premise.  \n   - The story felt disjointed and disappointing, especially since I was looking forward to the podcast dynamic.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing was cringey, trying too hard to be young and cool with dated millennial slang, pop culture references, and forced quirkiness (e.g., theatre puns).  \n   - There was constant word repetition, and Truly’s obsession with Colin’s “mole-splattered skin” was weird.  \n   - Truly’s lust-filled, objectifying inner monologue was hard to read.  \n\n- **Positive Elements:**  \n   - Lulu calling out Truly on her BS was a highlight.  \n   - Truly and Colin occasionally had insightful conversations about consent, communication, being bi, and bi erasure, but these moments were too few and far between.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a disappointment.

Truly's personality and actions overshadowed the narrative, making it hard to root for her growth. \n\nColin, on the other hand, felt underdeveloped and seemed designed solely to accommodate Truly's flaws. His overly accepting nature diminished his appeal, and while I might have liked him in a different context, his potential was overshadowed by Truly's dominance.

I was excited to read this novel and really looking forward to it.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - My excitement quickly faded, and I was really getting irritated by the time I reached 82 pages. Normally, when I struggle with a book, I push myself to at least reach 100 pages before DNFing (Did Not Finish). However, I just couldn’t make it to the 100th page in this book—that’s how super irritated I was.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Banter:**  \n   - The bantering was way too long and all over the place. A lot of it didn’t amuse me one bit. For example, the scene where the characters run into each other in an adult shop and start bantering felt forced and unnecessary.  \n\n- **Character Likability:**  \n   - The heroine was really annoying to me. Her behavior and personality were off-putting, and I was over it very quickly.  \n\n- **Impact of the Title:**  \n   - It’s a damn shame that the title almost ruined the song for me, as it initially sparked excitement but ultimately didn’t deliver.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel fell far short of my expectations. The pacing was frustrating, the banter felt excessive and unamusing, and the heroine was unlikable. Despite my initial excitement, I couldn’t bring myself to finish the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a low rating, likely 1 or 2 out of 5."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  The FMC (female main character) is portrayed as extremely immature, especially for someone nearly 30 years old. Her behavior, particularly towards her parents' relationship, comes across as childish and selfish. Her inability to think beyond herself and her lack of understanding of her parents' struggles made her character frustrating and unrelatable.  \n\n- **Parent-Child Dynamics:**  \n  The FMC's reaction to her parents' relationship issues was overly dramatic and self-centered. Her failure to recognize that good parents avoid fighting in front of their children highlights her lack of empathy and emotional maturity. This contrasts sharply with the reviewer's own traumatic childhood, where their parents did not shield them from conflict.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The FMC's behavior evoked strong negative emotions, including anger and frustration, to the point where the reviewer felt compelled to stop reading the book. The character's actions and mindset were so off-putting that they overshadowed any potential enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reviewer found the FMC's immaturity and selfishness unbearable, leading them to stop reading the book by chapter five.

Initially, the FMC appeared to be an influencer discussing love, but this angle was abandoned without any explanation.",

At one point, she even walks away from a professional engagement over a trivial issue. Throughout the story, she fails to acknowledge her own faults, even when confronted, and is overly judgmental about Colin’s career without considering his perspective. In contrast, Colin's patience and demeanor are commendable, earning him the only positive remarks in my review.",
