The extraction of Princess Martha and her children was a standout moment, and I wished the story had followed them and Daisy further, especially to the U.S., to provide closure with Roosevelt.

Her background and determination fascinated me, prompting me to research her further.  \n   - Cleo, Daisy’s invented goddaughter, was initially annoying and unrelatable due to her unwise decisions and privileged attitude. However, she undergoes significant character growth as the story progresses.  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative Focus:**  \n   - The historical details of Cleo’s story in Zakopane, Poland, were interesting, but I found myself less invested in her subplot, particularly the search for Micky. I wanted more focus on Daisy’s story.  \n   - The extraction of Princess Martha and her children was a highlight, and I wished the narrative had followed them and Daisy further, especially to the U.S., to provide closure with Roosevelt.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Detail:**  \n   - The novel effectively captures the historical context of Daisy’s role as the U.S. Minister to Norway during the 1940s, her escape from the Germans, and her efforts to keep Washington informed about the royal family’s whereabouts.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - While the story was compelling overall, the shifting focus between Daisy and Cleo disrupted the pacing for me. I was more engaged with Daisy’s storyline and felt the narrative could have benefited from a tighter focus on her.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Last Light Over Oslo* is a fascinating historical novel that shines a light on Daisy Harriman’s remarkable life and achievements. While Cleo’s subplot added depth, it occasionally detracted from the more engaging aspects of Daisy’s story. The historical details and Daisy’s character were the highlights, leaving me wanting more closure on her journey.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story feels somewhat bland and lacks suspense, making it one of the least gripping WWII fictions I've encountered. It misses the constant threat typical of the genre, with tension points like the disappearance of the secret codebook resolved too quickly, often within just a few pages, which undermines the sense of urgency. The plot meanders as Daisy attends meetings and parties, seemingly unconcerned about the Nazi threat or bombings, while Cleo grapples with her internal struggles. However, the romance is a highlight, featuring a slow build that avoids insta-love and showcases mature interactions between the characters. Their promise to reunite after the war adds depth to their relationship. While the pacing is slow and most conflicts are resolved swiftly, which may not satisfy readers seeking high-stakes drama, the focus on character interactions and personal growth provides some compensation for the lack of tension.",
            "The characters are a standout feature of the story. Petra, though not present often, is a likable character, while Cleo's personal growth through her mistakes adds depth. Additionally, the portrayal of a military gentleman strikes a nice balance, avoiding excessive rigidity.",
            "This story appeals to readers who enjoy historical fiction without an overwhelming feeling of impending doom.",

While the story might be great, it wasn’t the kind of story I was hoping for.  \n\n- **Character Focus and Engagement:**  \n   - I expected Daisy to be the main character, but the story primarily follows Cleo. Cleo was hard to care about at the beginning, as she came across as unlikeable. Additionally, Daisy leaving her dog behind during the evacuation bothered me, and I felt bad for the dog, which made me less inclined to continue reading.  \n\n- **Personal Preference and Disengagement:**  \n   - I was hoping for a story centered around diplomats and political resistance to the Nazis, but the book didn’t align with my expectations. This, combined with my lack of connection to Cleo, led me to DNF the book at 20%.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book might have a compelling story, it didn’t meet my expectations in terms of plot focus or character engagement. The mismatch between what I wanted and what the book delivered, along with my inability to connect with Cleo, led me to stop reading early on.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (The reviewer did not provide a specific rating score.)"

However, this book did not capture my interest in the same way. It felt overly lengthy and reminiscent of \"The Crown.\" While I enjoyed watching \"The Crown,\" I don’t think I would have enjoyed reading it in this format.\n\n- **Setting and Cultural Representation:**  \n  The book is set in Norway, which initially piqued my curiosity. However, I was disappointed that the main characters were American rather than Norwegian. I had hoped for more Norwegian characters to be central to the plot, as this would have added depth and authenticity to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its historical fiction genre and Norwegian setting, it fell short for me due to its length, lack of engaging narrative, and insufficient focus on Norwegian characters. It felt more like a drawn-out version of \"The Crown\" rather than a unique and immersive historical fiction novel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
