While it did, it also didn’t, because it’s a completely different kind of story.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The author painted a beautiful, realistic, and at times, horrible picture of unforgiveness. It’s beautiful because the story is filled with hope, love, and the presence of Jesus. It’s horrible because it’s also filled with hurt and raw humanity.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  Unlike *Mrs. Kip*, which started with laughter and led to a gut-wrenching but hopeful conclusion, this book begins in a dark, ugly place. Despite moments of light, the story continues to delve into the darkness until the light ultimately overpowers it. The last line of the book is particularly powerful and fitting.  \n\n- **Spiritual and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story is deeply faith-building, filled with hope and the transformative power of Jesus.

It feels like a family drama Hallmark movie but with realistic characters, depth, and spiritual meaning. It’s Christian fiction that’s incredibly cozy yet also a bit sad, diving into the complex dynamics of complicated family relationships and adult children dealing with unexpected parental divorce.\n\n- **Pacing and Style:**  \n  Similar to the author’s first book, *Mrs. Kip*, this one is a little slow and more of a meander than a page-turner. However, I’m glad I stuck with it because the slower pace allowed for deeper reflection and emotional engagement.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The intergenerational struggles and family relationships depicted felt realistic and rich. They prodded me to ponder hard but good things, and I cried several times. The characters had depth, and their interactions were meaningful.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book provided so much food for thought, especially regarding how adult children should handle deeply flawed parents. While I didn’t fully agree with where the story landed on this issue, I think it raised excellent questions and was a journey worth taking with the protagonist, Nikki.\n\n- **Cultural and Spiritual Elements:**  \n  The story had a strong spiritual undertone, which added depth and meaning. Additionally, it made me want to explore and make ALL THE GERMAN THINGS, which was a fun cultural touch.\n\n- **Critiques:**  \n  My biggest critique was that I wanted more of Isaac’s character and a clearer, more overt connection between Chris’s past and his current motivations. These elements felt slightly underdeveloped.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book deals with heavy themes, including divorce, infidelity, death, and strained parent relationships, which might be triggering for some readers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I highly recommend this book if you’re looking for Christian fiction that balances coziness with emotional depth. It’s a thoughtful exploration of family dynamics, intergenerational struggles, and spiritual growth, even if it’s not a fast-paced read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 rounded to 5⭐"

            "Nikki spends her summer vacation on her uncle’s farm in rural Missouri, grappling with her parents’ recent divorce and feelings of abandonment from her father. Amidst this emotional turmoil, she also navigates her complicated feelings for her boyfriend, Isaac. Throughout the summer, family members and local residents share their stories, allowing Nikki to explore her heritage and find a sense of healing. However, one aspect of the story felt inconsistent: although Nikki is a high school teacher in her mid-twenties, her thoughts and actions often resembled those of a teenager. This disparity is reinforced by how other characters—her uncle, parents, sister, aunt, church members, and even her boyfriend—treat her. I found myself needing to remind myself that Nikki is, in fact, an adult.",
            "The book explores themes of family, faith, forgiveness, and redemption, enriched by the characters' deep sense of faith. The author notes that “stories are the universal heart language,” illustrating their power to unite what is scattered. Through the stories and her grandmother’s recipes, Nikki uncovers her family history, gaining perspective on her own life. The author beautifully describes cooking as a transformative process: “the taking of opposing raw things and step by step shaping them into something new and unified.” I was captivated by the premise of Nikki Werner learning about her heritage through her grandmother's old recipes. Tucked among handwritten German dishes are words of wisdom and encouragement from Grandma Ann, who lived through and immediately after World War I. As Nikki prepares these meals, she forms a meaningful connection with the women who once toiled in that small kitchen before her."

She discovers her heritage, and the stories provide a healing salve.  \n   - The one thing that bothered me was that while Nikki was a high school teacher, so is at least in her mid-twenties, her character seemed to think and act more like a teenager. And the other characters treated her like one, too. (Her uncle, parents, sister, aunt, church members, even her boyfriend – pretty much everyone). As I was reading, I had to keep reminding myself she was an adult.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n   - The book contains themes of family, faith, forgiveness, and redemption.  \n   - Many of the characters have a sense of faith, which gives the novel an added dimension.  \n   - The author explains how “stories are the universal heart language. They bring together what is scattered.”  \n   - The stories, as well as cooking her grandmother’s recipes, help Nikki to learn her family history, and this education has a way of putting her life into perspective.  \n   - “Cooking has a magic to it. The taking of opposing raw things and step by step shaping them into something new and unified. Discordance is chopped, sautéed, and stirred away, until a melodious creation simmers in the pan.”  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Despite the issue with Nikki’s characterization, overall I enjoyed this heartwarming novel of family and forgiveness.  \n   - If you’re looking for a small-town redemptive story that has a cooking theme combining faith and a bit of romance, this is the book for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis heartwarming novel combines themes of family, faith, forgiveness, and redemption with a unique cooking theme. While the protagonist’s characterization felt inconsistent with her age, the story’s premise, emotional depth, and exploration of heritage make it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Nikki Werner, a 26-year-old school teacher who escapes to her grandparents' farm after her father's unexpected remarriage announcement and her boyfriend's proposal. There, she discovers an old notebook filled with German recipes and wise sayings, hoping to heal her heart. However, the promising concept of inviting townspeople to share their stories over meals, as suggested in the book's premise, falls flat; only two people, besides Uncle Wes, ever join the table, leaving this idea underdeveloped and disconnected from the plot. The narrative drags due to Nikki's excessive avoidance of her pain and trauma, along with a lack of meaningful dialogue from her mentors. The rushed ending introduces sudden resolutions that feel unearned and unrealistic, leaving readers with a sense of whiplash.",
            "Nikki's immaturity undermines her relatability and diminishes the story's emotional depth. While the narrative features several mentors, they fail to engage with Nikki meaningfully or prompt her to confront her pain. Additionally, the romance between Uncle Wes and Joyce is underdeveloped, with unresolved hints of past trauma that leave their relationship feeling unfinished.",
            "The book compellingly addresses the enduring pain of divorce on adult children and underscores the importance of counseling and support. However, its approach to healing seems somewhat transcendental, lacking alignment with faith-based themes, which may leave some readers feeling unsatisfied."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The Divine Proverb of Steusel had significant potential but fell short of expectations. While it effectively portrays the pain of divorce and the need for healing, the plot suffers from underdeveloped relationships, excessive avoidance, and a rushed ending. The book's strengths are overshadowed by its unfulfilled promises and lack of emotional depth.",

She finds an old notebook with German recipes and wise sayings, hoping to heal her heart.  \n   - The concept of inviting townspeople to share their stories over meals, as described in the book's premise, never fully materializes.

            "I appreciated that romance took a backseat in this story, allowing other themes to shine. From the outset, I was drawn into the pain, heartache, and disappointment experienced by the main character, Nikki, and those impacted by her father's poor choices. Wes and Aunt Emma emerged as standout characters, with Aunt Emma being so well-written that I aspire to be like her as I grow older.",
            "The incorporation of authentic German recipes and anecdotes enriched the story, adding a delightful and distinctive layer to the narrative.",

It delves into themes of longing and self-forgiveness, encouraging readers to extend grace to themselves and others. Fans of strong, outspoken older female characters will appreciate the memorable, quotable lines. However, the story loses some momentum in the latter half, and certain phrases (except for the German ones) felt out of place, making it challenging to stay engaged during the final third.",
            "The title, \"Do the Next Thing,\" initially suggested a light-hearted tale about baking and simple pleasures. However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the story delves into much deeper and more emotional themes than I had anticipated."

The similarity of wise, faithful mentors in both novels was my favorite part.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  There is rich, Biblical advice within this story, just as there was in *The Extraordinary Deaths of Mrs. Kip*. The story is thoughtful and laced with wisdom, feeling like candlelight on a winter night. I really appreciated the super strong faith thread.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  *The Divine Proverb of Streusel* started out slowly for my taste. It took me a little while to soak into the characters and their plights. However, the last quarter or so of the book won me over for sure.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Uncle Wes soon won my admiration. Nikki, on the other hand, came across as a little younger than she was supposed to be and didn’t end up being a favorite.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a thoughtful and faith-filled story that, despite a slow start, ultimately delivers a deeply satisfying and wise narrative. Fans of the author’s previous work will appreciate the familiar themes and strong spiritual thread.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Additionally, while the relationship between the main character, Nikki, and her fiancé was present, it wasn’t the central focus, which I appreciated.\n\n- **Portrayal of Faith:**  \n  God is depicted as a benevolent guardian who helps and guides the characters through their hardships without shielding them from challenges. This resonated with me, as it aligns with my understanding of faith—God doesn’t prevent hardships but promises to be with us through them. I appreciated the inclusion of biblical references, such as Hebrews 13:5 and John 16:33, which reinforced this perspective.\n\n- **Character Connection:**  \n  I connected deeply with Nikki, particularly in her desire to reconnect with her family heritage, which mirrored my own experiences (German Lutherans vs. Swiss-German Methodists). Her grit and unwavering faith throughout the story were inspiring and relatable.\n\n- **Memorable Quotes:**  \n  My favorite quote came from Nikki’s grandmother, who, though deceased, had a profound influence on her: “Do the next thing.” This resonated with me, especially when paired with Elisabeth Elliot’s interpretation: “Sometimes life is so hard you can only do the next thing. Whatever that is, just do the next thing. God will meet you there.”\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my usual reservations about Christian fiction, this book captivated me with its unique focus on genealogy, its nuanced portrayal of faith, and its relatable protagonist.
