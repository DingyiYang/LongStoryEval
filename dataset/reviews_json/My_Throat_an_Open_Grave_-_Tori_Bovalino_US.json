However, the story didn’t fully align with the lens or direction I had imagined. While I could see the inspiration in the general plot concept, it didn’t delve as deeply into the horror or metaphorical elements as I had hoped.\n\n- **Folk Horror Elements:**  \n  I enjoyed the folk horror aspects of the story. They added a unique flavor to the narrative and were one of the highlights for me.\n\n- **World-Building (The Wood):**  \n  The characterization of The Wood was well done. While it didn’t feel as expansive as the world in *Labyrinth*, it still felt like a lived-in, populated place. I appreciated getting to know the characters and feeling like they were part of a real community, which made The Wood feel more three-dimensional.\n\n- **Horror vs. Fantasy Tone:**  \n  The story didn’t quite hit the \"horror\" mark for me. It leaned more towards fantasy, and even felt younger than most YA novels. The horror elements were sparse, and the focus remained more on romance and coming-of-age themes rather than survival or terror.\n\n- **Characterization (Leah):**  \n  Leah felt like a thin and indistinct character. Many of her traits were told rather than shown, and she often seemed to lack agency or depth. While I understood the reasoning behind one major plot point involving her, overall, she felt underdeveloped and unremarkable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some enjoyable elements, such as the folk horror and the world-building of The Wood, it didn’t fully deliver on its horror premise or the potential of its *Labyrinth* inspiration.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Comparison to *Labyrinth***  \n   - The premise of \"a girl has to get back a magically stolen baby\" is superficially similar to *Labyrinth*, but the execution is entirely different.  \n   - In *Labyrinth*, the protagonist, Sara, actively chooses to rescue her brother, faces dangers, and outwits opposition. In contrast, Leah is forced into the woods by her mother and pastor, and her experience is more passive and comfortable.  \n   - Leah's journey lacks the peril and active quest elements that define *Labyrinth*. Instead, she lives in relative comfort, broods, and develops a crush on a magical boy.  \n\n- **Genre Expectations (Folk Horror vs. YA Fantasy)**  \n   - The book is marketed as folk horror but fails to deliver on that genre.  \n   - There are no significant horror elements beyond a mildly icky skeleton and some realistic but non-supernatural nastiness related to religion and gender dynamics.  \n   - The story leans more toward YA fantasy with a cottage-core aesthetic, lacking the depth of folklore or mythology.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore**  \n   - The world-building is underdeveloped. There is no explanation for the baby-stealing lineage or the existence of the Lord of the Woods.  \n   - The woods community is depicted as a pleasant, Renn Faire-like encampment with comfortable living conditions, but it’s unclear how such a lifestyle is maintained.  \n\n- **Character Decisions and Logic**  \n   - The decision of all the women to return to Winston, a hostile and ostracizing town, is illogical and frustrating.  \n   - Leah’s choice to take baby Owen back from the woods, where he was happy and cared for, to raise him in a cold, bigoted town, is particularly baffling and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Writing Quality and Themes**  \n   - The writing is decent and very readable.  \n   - The author effectively explores themes of female victimization, helplessness, and rage, which seem to be the core focus of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has readable prose and touches on meaningful themes of female oppression, it falls short in several areas. The comparison to *Labyrinth* is misleading, the genre expectations are unmet, and the world-building and character decisions lack logic. Despite these flaws, the exploration of female rage and victimization adds depth, making it a somewhat worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 stars due to the aforementioned issues."

However, the unexpected romantic subplot between Leah and the Lord of the Woods feels somewhat disappointing, as it diminishes the tension and eerie atmosphere established earlier. While the prose is enjoyable, the focus on a YA audience restricts a deeper exploration of its themes."

While it is atmospheric and enjoyable, its young adult focus limits the depth of its exploration of themes like oppression and fear. The unexpected romantic subplot detracted from the eerie tone, but overall, it remains a compelling and quick read.",

This mismatch in expectations left me disappointed.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Half of the book is spent frolicking through enchanted forests, but the world-building was confusing and didn’t feel cohesive. While the author, Bovalino, is great at describing things, this skill didn’t translate into creating a clear or immersive world.  \n\n- **Tension and Stakes:**  \n  The beginning had some really good tension and scares, which I enjoyed. However, as the story progressed, the stakes and tension faded, leaving me wanting more. There was only one scene towards the end that truly stood out in terms of delivering a scare.  \n\n- **Prose and Descriptions:**  \n  Some of the prose was fantastic, and Bovalino excels at vivid descriptions. Unfortunately, this strength didn’t enhance the overall story, particularly in terms of world-building or maintaining tension.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  The book is compared to Jim Henson’s *Labyrinth*, but it lacked the quirky creatures that made *Labyrinth* so memorable. Because of this comparison, I could only picture the character Tristan as David Bowie, which was distracting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had moments of strong prose and an initially gripping start, it ultimately fell short of my expectations.

The themes of toxicity within the town, Leah's family, and from men in general were compelling and well-executed.  \n\n- **Character Development (Leah):**  \n  Leah was a complex character who displayed significant growth over the course of the novel.

The novel has a distinct identity, which I greatly admire.  \n\n- **Twist and Narrative Complexity:**  \n  My favorite part was the twist in the final chapters, revealing that Owen is actually Leah's son, not her brother. This added layers of complexity to Leah's character and was completely unexpected.  \n\n- **Character Development (Supporting Characters):**  \n  While Leah felt very well-developed, I didn’t feel the same connection or depth with any of the other characters.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore Exploration:**  \n  I would have liked it if Bovalino delved even more into the lore of the Lord or included an epilogue to show how Leah is acclimating to her new life with Tristan in the Woods.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal and Genre Fit:**  \n  Despite some minor shortcomings, *My Throat an Open Grave* is a standout in the young adult genre. It offers a unique plot with important themes that are enjoyable and appropriate for its target audience (and adults too, of course!).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*My Throat an Open Grave* is a compelling and unique novel that blends folklore, gothic elements, and coming-of-age themes.

I particularly enjoyed the writing style.\n\n- **Genre Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The book was marketed as folk horror, but I wouldn’t classify it as such. While it touches on heavy themes, including religion, I found it lacking in true horror elements. The scariest aspects were the portrayal of people and religion, but that’s nothing groundbreaking. Instead, I’d categorize it more as cozy fantasy or cottagecore.\n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The story delves into serious and religious themes, which were thought-provoking but not what I expected from a horror novel. The feminist storyline was a highlight for me and added depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  If you’re looking for genuine folk horror, I’d highly recommend *The Salt Grows Heavy* instead. It not only delivers on the horror front but also ties into some elements of this book’s story in a more compelling way.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the book was cute and enjoyable, my experience might have been better if it hadn’t been mislabeled as folk horror. It’s a decent read, but not what I was anticipating.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a light, lyrical read with a feminist storyline that I appreciated.

The predictable twist and the cozy, misplaced middle section further detracted from the experience. However, I remain optimistic about the author's future works due to her strong plot ideas and pacing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75/5"

            "The fantasy elements in this story are minimal, with only three notable instances that feel underdeveloped, leading to confusion about their significance to the plot. The \"big price\" that the main character pays also falls flat; it centers more on her coping with trauma through song than on any impactful sacrifice, ultimately lacking satisfaction. Additionally, continuity errors and unresolved plot points—such as issues introduced early on that are never revisited—left me with more questions than answers.",
            "Leah, the main character, is the only well-developed character in the story. I empathized with her and wanted to see her triumph over her struggles, but her journey ultimately felt strange and unsatisfying. In contrast, other characters like Tristan, Fletcher, Ruth, Jess, and Maria are flat and one-dimensional, serving more as tools to advance Leah’s narrative than as fully realized individuals.",
            "The examination of purity culture and religion is commendable but could benefit from a more engaging presentation. The writing tends to be repetitive, which stands out due to a lack of compelling elements to distract from it. Additionally, the tone occasionally comes across as overly youthful, potentially alienating readers who prefer more mature young adult narratives.",
            "The book was mis-marketed as closely related to *Labyrinth*, with the only significant connection being the theft of a brother. Instead, it presents itself as a romance and character study set in a parallel timeline commune, rather than a horror or fantasy tale. This marketing discrepancy likely left readers expecting a different genre or tone feeling alienated."

            "The ending is both satisfying and expertly crafted, effectively tying together Leah's journey and her reflections on the flaws of her hometown. It leaves a lasting emotional impact. The narrative follows Leah, who resides in a church-dominated town that subscribes to the belief in a Lord of the Wood who occasionally takes babies. When her younger brother is taken, Leah is sent into the woods as part of a ceremonial tradition, despite the grim reality that no one has ever returned. The plot thickens when she arrives at the Lord's village, a place frozen in time that is self-sufficient yet deeply unsettling in its worship of the Lord. This story reimagines *Labyrinth*, with Leah given a month to create something (she chooses to write a song) in exchange for her brother’s return.",
            "Leah is a captivating protagonist whose growth is evident throughout the story. Her connections with the villagers and the surprisingly laid-back Lord of the Wood enrich her character. Additionally, her reflections on her hometown's oppressive culture add depth to her journey. I also appreciate the book's striking naked hardback design, which enhances its overall appeal.",
            "The town and the Lord's village are vividly portrayed, with the latter's timeless, self-sufficient nature standing out. The stark contrast between the oppressive town and the mysterious, eerie village enriches the story's atmosphere.",
            "The novel thoughtfully explores heavy themes such as religious trauma, slut-shaming, and the oppressive nature of small-town religious communities. These elements add layers of complexity to what initially appears to be a cozy story."

This is NOT a horror story. As someone who is easily scared by horror, I was never concerned, afraid, or anxious about the events in this book.  \n\n- **Characterization and Development:**  \n   - The widely feared “Lord of the Woods” turned out to be a conventionally attractive 17-year-old soft boy who wears rings and a little gold tiara. This portrayal felt unconvincing and undermined the intrigue and mystery of the character.  \n   - The main character’s repeated insistence that she was broken, damaged, dirty, and sinful came across as melodramatic and unconvincing. I wasn’t made to care about her struggles, and her angst felt overdone.  \n\n- **Narrative Execution (Show vs. Tell):**  \n   - The author spent too much time *telling* us the main character was “bad,” “sinful,” and “wicked” without adequately *showing* the consequences of her actions. From what was shown, her actions didn’t seem as severe as they were made out to be.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - I struggled to empathize with the main character’s struggles. Instead of feeling sorry for her, I found myself wanting to tell her to “get a grip.”  \n\n- **Overall Execution and Potential:**  \n   - The story had potential but could have been executed much better.

Despite her decision to homeschool during her junior year, it’s difficult to believe that no one, especially her church community, would catch on to her pregnancy. Furthermore, the idea that Leah could remain undetected for nearly 18 months in such a close-knit environment stretches credibility. The book itself is painfully dull, lacking engaging moments or a compelling narrative drive. Its slow pacing and uninteresting plot make it challenging to stay invested in the story.",

This added a layer of emotional complexity to the narrative.\n\n- **Comparisons and Influences:**  \n  The novel reminded me of *The Labyrinth* and *Lord of the Rings*, likely due to its fantastical elements and the sense of a journey through a mysterious, otherworldly setting.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis dark fairytale is a beautifully written and emotionally resonant story, with an unexpected ending that leaves a lasting impression. Despite predicting some plot points, the immersive atmosphere and thematic depth made it a memorable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot twist is impactful, if somewhat predictable, and enriches both Leah's character and the overall narrative. While the story tackles heavy themes, it does so with sensitivity. Notably, it subverts expectations by revealing that the feared Lord of the Woods and his followers are not the true villains.",
            "Leah is a compelling and complex heroine—broken yet incredibly strong. Feisty and resilient, she defies the oppressive norms of her town. Initially, she serves as an unreliable narrator, with glimpses of her true self revealed gradually. Her profound growth unfolds as she sheds the toxic beliefs instilled in her and discovers her self-worth. The side characters are well-developed and play pivotal roles in Leah's journey. Jess, her best friend, stands out for her unwavering support and acceptance, while Tristain, the Lord of the Woods, adds depth with his wholesome and well-developed romance with Leah.",
            "This gripping and immersive story masterfully blends gothic horror with emotional depth. It deftly balances terror and hope, leading to a satisfying, if not entirely tidy, conclusion.",
            "In the oppressive town of Winston, girls are valued solely for their purity. In stark contrast, the Woods offer a haven for those who struggle to fit into society. The gripping gothic horror atmosphere weaves together elements of fear with glimpses of hope and warmth. The unique magic of the Woods, especially the powers wielded by the Lord of the Woods and his followers, adds to the intrigue. Ultimately, the Woods serve as a refuge and a place of belonging for outcasts.",
            "This story speaks powerfully to women and girls who have faced the stigma of being deemed \"not good enough\" or shamed for defying societal norms. It offers a critical look at religious communities that punish those who dare to break away from expectations. Ultimately, the narrative reveals that the true monsters often lie within our own communities, rather than in the outsiders we are conditioned to fear."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*My Throat an Open Grave* is a powerful and emotionally resonant novel that explores themes of self-worth, oppression, and belonging. The author crafts a compelling protagonist in Leah, supported by a rich cast of characters and a hauntingly beautiful setting. The story’s twists, atmosphere, and writing make it a standout read, particularly for those who have felt marginalized or misunderstood. This is the author’s best work yet, and I eagerly anticipate their future projects.",

However, the novel failed to resonate with me in the way I had hoped. While *Labyrinth* is layered and subtle, this book felt lacking in comparison.  \n   - The Lord of the Wood, a central figure, was not as complex or compelling as Jareth from *Labyrinth*. Jareth had a nuanced villainy and ambiguous motivations, whereas The Lord of the Wood felt underdeveloped and lacked tension.  \n   - The world-building also fell short. *Labyrinth* is filled with diverse creatures and magical elements, but this novel’s world felt sparse and less immersive.  \n\n- **Themes of Oppression and Repression:**  \n   - The book explores themes of oppression, particularly the oppression of women, and how religion and societal expectations enforce strict behavioral norms.  \n   - Leah, the protagonist, is highly aware of her desires and sexuality but is constantly reminded that \"good girls don't want.\" This repression is a central conflict, but it felt overemphasized, with too much time spent on Leah’s internal reflections rather than advancing the plot.  \n\n- **Genre Expectations (Horror vs. Romance):**  \n   - I expected more horror elements, given the premise and the ominous tone of the opening. However, the book leaned heavily into YA romance, which was disappointing for me personally.  \n   - While the writing was beautiful, the story lacked the \"bite\" I was hoping for. The pacing felt slow, especially after Leah’s baby brother is taken, with too much focus on her internal struggles rather than external action or tension.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The prose is undeniably beautiful at times, showcasing the author’s talent for crafting evocative sentences.  \n   - However, the writing alone couldn’t compensate for the lack of plot development and world-building.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *My Throat an Open Grave* has moments of beautiful writing and explores meaningful themes of oppression and repression, it ultimately fell short of my expectations.

            "The story opens with a compelling folk horror atmosphere, depicting a small, impoverished, and devout community adjacent to a dark, foreboding forest ruled by the enigmatic Lord of the Wood. While the initial setup is chilling, the overall scares are somewhat lacking.",
            "This story profoundly resonated with me, particularly in its exploration of reproductive justice and its connections to real-world issues. The twist was fantastic—unexpected yet perfectly executed. While some may find it predictable, I only caught on to the hints halfway through.",
            "I'm excited that this book exists and admire its bold themes and storytelling. I eagerly anticipate exploring more of the author's work in the future.",
            "I was excited to read this book, as I’m becoming a fan of the author. Her previous works, *Not Good for Maidens* and her contribution to *The Gathering Dark*, were both excellent and unique in the YA genre. While the premise initially led me to expect a *Labyrinth*-esque adventure, I was disappointed to find it didn’t quite match that expectation. However, the book's distinct qualities ultimately made that comparison feel unfair. I wouldn’t categorize it as horror, despite its eerie, ghostly elements; it reads more like a dark fairy tale or fantasy with serious themes. At its core, the story serves as a dark, fantastical parable about reproductive justice, set in a community where girls’ choices are stripped away and weaponized against them."

        "conclusion": "This book is a dark, thought-provoking fantasy that defies genre expectations. While it has some pacing and world-building issues, its powerful themes, emotional depth, and satisfying twist make it a standout read. It’s not the *Labyrinth*-inspired horror I expected, but it’s something far more meaningful and impactful.",

            "The story unfolds steadily for the first 35%, but the pacing slows significantly until the 80% mark. The middle section focuses on Leah's daily life as she fulfills her end of a bargain, explores the village within the woods, and unravels a ghost story. While these elements are intriguing, they left me feeling somewhat disconnected due to the lack of significant action.

When Leah's younger brother, Owen, goes missing, she bravely ventures into the woods to strike a deal with the Lord to bring him home.

I loved the lore surrounding the ominous woods, which added a sense of mystery and danger.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The story progresses steadily for about 35% of the book, but after that, not much *really* happens until the 80% mark.

While these events were interesting, I felt slightly disconnected because it seemed like not much was happening.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Romance:**  \n  The one thing that kept me engaged were the little glimpses of a budding romance, which added a layer of intrigue to the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The last 20% was very eventful and fun, with a plot twist I didn’t expect. While the ending was slightly predictable, it was still enjoyable, and I thought things wrapped up perfectly.  \n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  I appreciated the commentary on religion and sexism woven into the story, which added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  Overall, this is a fun Young Adult book that I would recommend if you’re looking for something not too serious.

As she navigates this perilous journey, she uncovers the mysterious murders of women who ventured into the woods before her. The plot is both intriguing and original, with a compelling start that captured my attention. However, the narrative shifts toward romance in the second half, which detracts from the exploration of deeper themes. While there are a couple of twists—one surprising and the other predictable—the ending left me feeling unsatisfied. Leah’s journey and inner awakening felt somewhat diminished by the conclusion, though I won’t reveal specifics. The pacing is strong initially, but the introduction of romantic elements halfway through alters the tone and focus in a way that didn’t resonate with me. Despite these issues, the book remains a quick and enjoyable read.",
            "While some characters, including Leah, occasionally felt one-dimensional, I appreciated her role as the community's black sheep. Her defiance against the town's religious leaders and norms, along with her struggle with religious oppression and emotional trauma, added significant depth to her character.",

However, the tone occasionally felt juvenile, leaning heavily into YA romance tropes, which didn’t fully align with the darker themes of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, including Leah, felt one-dimensional at times. However, I appreciated Leah’s role as the black sheep of her community, defying the town’s religious leaders and norms. Her struggle with religious oppression and emotional trauma was well-portrayed and added depth to her character.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel effectively explores themes of religious oppression and emotional trauma, which I found compelling. However, the potential for deeper exploration of these themes was overshadowed by the romantic subplot, which felt out of place.  \n\n- **Twists and Ending:**  \n  The story included a couple of twists—one that surprised me and another that was predictable. The ending, however, left me unsatisfied. Leah’s journey and inner awakening felt somewhat undermined by how the story concluded, though I won’t spoil the details.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The pacing was strong initially, but the introduction of romance elements halfway through shifted the tone and focus, which didn’t fully resonate with me. Despite this, the book remained a quick and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *My Throat an Open Grave* is an original and engaging story with a compelling start and strong exploration of themes like religious oppression and emotional trauma. However, the shift toward romance and the unsatisfying ending detracted from its potential. While I enjoyed it for the most part, the direction it took wasn’t entirely what I expected.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐⭐⭐ (3/5 stars)  \n**Would I recommend it?** Maybe."

            "The plot is captivating, featuring well-crafted twists and a strong emphasis on its themes. The idea of a cult set in an enchanted forest is both unique and thought-provoking.",
            "In this story, the protagonist Leah is portrayed as vulnerable and easily manipulated into joining a cult, offering a realistic glimpse into how individuals can be drawn into such groups. The love interest, a charismatic cult leader, adds complexity to the narrative with his attractive demeanor. While the character dynamics, including the found family trope, are engaging, they occasionally overshadow the deeper world-building elements.",
            "The world-building in the story is inadequate, leaving many questions unanswered and creating plot holes. Critical elements, such as the significance of the brutally killed deer, the time eddies, and the cult's origins, remain unclear. Additionally, important details about Owen's caretakers and the motivations behind the townspeople's actions are overlooked.",
            "This book skillfully illustrates how individuals are drawn into cults, emphasizing themes of vulnerability, the desire for belonging, and the power of charismatic leadership. It also addresses privilege, particularly through the protagonist's reliance on her attractiveness and the cult leader's charm. The narrative weaves together various genres, including found family, small-town romance, cozy fantasy, and mystery. While it explores purity culture and incorporates elements of horror and thriller, it primarily leans toward cozy and romantic scenes reminiscent of Emily Henry's style."

I couldn’t put it down and stayed up until 1am to finish it. The narrative completely enthralled me, and I was transported into the world of the story. Despite not initially loving the writing style, I became so immersed that I forgot about those details.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The book was moody, gory, shameful, yet delightful in all the right ways. The cult-ish madness of the universe was incredibly well-executed, with just the right amount of detail to make it feel vivid and real.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I felt deeply connected to the main character, Leah, experiencing her hurt and happiness alongside her. While I didn’t always love her, I understood that she was a product of her surroundings, which added depth to her character. Leah represents the pain and shame that many women endure, making her story both relatable and impactful.  \n\n- **Plot and Spoiler-Free Experience:**  \n  I went into this book knowing only the synopsis, and I believe that’s the best way to experience it. The plot is best enjoyed blind, so I won’t reveal any details. However, I highly recommend it for its gripping and immersive storytelling.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  I would advise readers to be mindful of the content warnings before diving into this book, as it deals with intense and potentially triggering themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an unforgettable experience that kept me hooked from start to finish. Its moody atmosphere, well-crafted characters, and immersive narrative made it a standout read. I highly recommend it, especially for those who enjoy dark, thought-provoking stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The ending, while foreshadowed by subtle clues, was still shocking and heartbreaking. Although it felt rushed, it offered a bittersweet resolution that suited the story. From the first chapter, the plot captivated me, drawing me in and making it easy to lose track of time. The narrative was unpredictable, filled with moments that compelled me to read faster to uncover what would happen next. However, the conclusion, while poignant, diminished some of the emotional intensity that characterized much of the book.",

At the story's outset, she is overwhelmed by a heavy burden that threatens to consume her. Her heartbreaking journey is both compelling and poignant. Leah's desperate need for love and appreciation, coupled with her internalized self-reproach, made her a character I rooted for from the very beginning.",

The chilling depiction of a community that would readily sacrifice a young girl to an evil entity is both enraging and unsettling. Leah and the other girls in Winston embody a palpable sense of hopelessness and fury, leaving a profound emotional impact on the reader."

            "The story's magical elements, including the Lord of the Wood, Ruth's memory-taking ability, and the forest's time discrepancies, are captivating but underexplained. While the socio-political themes take center stage, greater clarity on the magical aspects would have enriched the narrative.",
            "The book addresses profound themes like religion, bodily autonomy, misogyny, and sexuality. These topics are woven together in a beautifully magical narrative that blends the fantastical with the protagonist's real-world struggles."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a compelling exploration of important socio-political issues through a magical lens. While I appreciated the themes and Leah’s personal journey, the fast pacing, underdeveloped plot points, and lack of closure for certain aspects left me wanting more. The magical world-building, though fascinating, could have been better explained. Overall, it’s a strong read but falls short of being a perfect 5-star experience.",

For example, Leah spends a month with the Lord of the Wood, but it feels like they only have about six conversations due to the rushed pacing.  \n   - Certain plot points, like Maria's haunting and the mystery surrounding her death, feel underdeveloped until they suddenly escalate at the end.  \n\n- **Character Development and Closure:**  \n   - Leah’s personal journey and her struggles with her body, past, and the influences of her small town are central to the story.  \n   - While the ending provides some resolution for Leah, it feels incomplete, particularly in terms of her closure with the town and her mother.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Internal Monologue:**  \n   - The dialogue can be confusing, as Leah often goes into lengthy internal monologues after a single line of dialogue, making it hard to follow the conversation.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mysteries:**  \n   - The magical elements, such as the Lord of the Wood, Ruth’s ability to take memories, and the time differences in the forest, are intriguing but lack sufficient explanation.  \n   - While the socio-political issues are the main focus, more clarity on the magical aspects would have enhanced the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a compelling exploration of important socio-political issues through a magical lens. While I appreciated the themes and Leah’s personal journey, the fast pacing, underdeveloped plot points, and lack of closure for certain aspects left me wanting more.

I hoped the plot would be as good as the cover, and it did not disappoint. However, I expected it to be much darker than it actually was.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  The book is fast-paced, quick, and easy to read. It has more of a YA feel, which made it accessible and engaging.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The vibe of the story is cult-like, and I was immediately annoyed by how the FMC's town operates. There's a mystery that hangs over the entire plot, which kept me intrigued.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around the question of what the FMC did that was so bad she needed to pay for it. As the plot progresses, the \"other\" village reveals more magical and creepy elements. However, midway through, I found the book to be more charming than scary, which was unexpected given the cover and title.  \n\n- **Romance and Darker Elements:**  \n  Yes, there is romance, but there are also darker themes that emerge, unrelated to the otherworldly beings. Some of these darker elements caught me off guard, while others aligned with my suspicions about who to fear.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style initially felt more juvenile, which I didn’t mind, but it improved progressively as the story unfolded.  \n\n- **Surprises and Revelations:**  \n  There were some revelations that completely surprised me, while others were more predictable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed *My Throat An Open Grave* immensely. It was a quick, engaging read with a mix of charm, mystery, and darker themes. While it wasn’t as dark as I initially expected, the story kept me hooked with its pacing, atmosphere, and unexpected twists.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4⭐️  \n\n**Content Warnings:**  \n⚠️ Kidnapping, murder, animal sacrifice (ish, not really).  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and Page Street Publishing for the gifted e-ARC of this book!"

The Lord of the Wood is another standout character; initially seen as a villain, he reveals a sweet and caring nature, effectively subverting the typical Alpha Male trope.",

The depiction of the church's actions and their repercussions is thought-provoking, emphasizing the perils of blind faith and unchecked power. Additionally, the narrative subtly prompts readers to consider real-world parallels, particularly the lack of a guiding force to intervene in such circumstances.",

The cover alone made me eager to read it. I ended up finishing the book in under 24 hours, which is rare for me, as it’s been a long time since I’ve been so engrossed in a story.  \n\n- **Lore and World-Building:**  \n  The lore behind the story was incredibly compelling. The setting of a small, religious town and the myth of the Lord of the Woods (LoW) were fascinating. Every few years, a child goes missing, and a woman is sent to retrieve the child as a form of penance for her sins. This premise hooked me from the start.  \n\n- **Character Development and Empathy:**  \n  Leah, the main character, was exceptionally well-written. I felt a strong sense of empathy and injustice for her. She didn’t even want a baby brother, yet she was forced to go after him when he was taken by the LoW, turning the entire town against her. Her struggles felt deeply personal and relatable.  \n\n- **Mental Health Representation:**  \n  Leah’s battle with depression and suicidal thoughts was portrayed with exceptional care and realism. The depressive atmosphere was immersive, making the story feel authentic. However, I would recommend reading this book when you’re in a good headspace, as the themes can be heavy.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot and Themes:**  \n  Leah’s relationship with Tristan added depth to the story and felt natural within the narrative. I also appreciated the social justice messages woven into the plot, which added layers of meaning to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*My Throat an Open Grave* is a must-read, even if you’re not typically a fan of horror.

It was super fluffy at the end, but I’m glad my girls got justice. Amen!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is beautifully written and emotionally resonant, though some predictability detracts from the experience. It creates a vivid sense of place and belonging, leaving a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.9/5"

These similarities kept tripping me up.  \n\n- **Promising Elements:**  \n  The title, cover, and description of the book as *Labyrinth* meets folk horror initially gave me confidence that I would find something to enjoy.  \n\n- **Characterization and Plot Execution:**  \n  The Lord of the Wood, instead of being a creepy beast or a charming trickster like Jareth, is portrayed as a melancholic teen who only wants to help Leah retrieve her brother. His \"cult\" members are also depicted as helpful and welcoming, contrasting sharply with the hostile people Leah grew up with.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Pacing:**  \n  I believe the author intended to highlight the town's harsh reaction by sending Leah on a dangerous mission to save her brother, potentially at the cost of her own life. However, the repetitive telling (rather than showing) of Leah being \"bad\" became frustrating and made it hard for me to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  While there were intriguing elements, they weren’t executed strongly enough to hold my interest, leading me to stop reading at page 126.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its promising premise and initial appeal, *My Throat* failed to deliver a compelling narrative or engaging execution. The repetitive narrative style and lack of depth in character development ultimately made it difficult for me to continue reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (No specific rating score mentioned in the review.)"

            "Leah's strained family dynamic is highlighted by her mother's lack of affection and her feelings of displacement caused by her baby brother, Owen. In contrast, Leah's friendship with Jess offers a refreshing solace; Jess sees Leah for who she is beyond her pregnancy and provides her much-needed support. However, the story misses an opportunity for emotional depth, as there is no meaningful confrontation between Leah and her mother, nor does it explore her father's reaction.",

Leah's journey into the forest to negotiate with Tristan, the Lord of the Woods, for her brother Owen's return is both intriguing and engaging, drawing me in from the start.",
            "This book delves into themes of religious authority, prejudice, family trauma, friendship, and bodily autonomy. It reveals how men and religion manipulate the Lord of the Woods to vilify young women and exert control over the community, using scapegoats to preserve their power. The novel critiques societal norms and highlights the alarming ease with which communities perpetuate cruelty and corruption."

            "The story begins with an intriguing premise but quickly becomes convoluted, weaving together multiple themes—religion, labyrinths, and murder mystery—that lack cohesion. While the pacing is quicker than in the author's previous work, *The Devil Makes Three*, the narrative remains disjointed until the conclusion. Although the ending attempts to connect various elements, it feels rushed and leaves many questions unresolved.",
            "Leah Jones is presented as a protagonist burdened by a troubled past that has strained her relationships with both her family and her community. While her internal reflections hint at depth, her character lacks sufficient development to fully convey her motivations and emotions. Similarly, Tristan, the Lord of the Woods, is an intriguing figure, yet his backstory and motivations remain ambiguous for much of the narrative.",
            "The author's strength is in simplicity, yet this narrative is overly complex for that style to truly shine. The story would have been more effective if it had centered on a single theme, such as a labyrinth or paranormal mystery, instead of attempting to blend multiple genres.",
            "The concept of two worlds existing on different planes of time is intriguing but remains underdeveloped. While the forest and its inhabitants, particularly Maria, enrich the narrative, their stories feel incomplete. The rules governing the Lord of the Woods’ realm and the town’s curse are not fully explained, leaving gaps in understanding. The opening sets a creepy tone with the haunted town of Winston, which is plagued by the Lord of the Woods who abducts children. The town's religious zealotry and eerie atmosphere contribute to a sense of foreboding, while the alternate dimension of the Lord of the Woods adds an intriguing layer of mystery and fantasy.",
            "The book strives to merge religious themes, fantasy, and horror, but these elements only come together effectively in the final act. The prominent religious undertones seem misplaced unless they serve a clear purpose, which only becomes apparent at the end. While the darker themes of death, dying, and suicide contribute to an unsettling atmosphere, they remain underexplored."

Throughout her journey, she unravels a generational mystery linked to the woods. I found the story engaging and was kept guessing about the ending, though some readers may have predicted the twists more easily, perhaps due to my inexperience with the genre.

These resonated deeply with me, and I felt connected to Leah’s struggles.  \n   - I appreciated the inclusion of a character with they/them pronouns, which felt natural and not forced. It didn’t come across as a statement or agenda but rather as a realistic representation.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The characters are well-developed, each with distinct personalities. This stood out to me, especially after reading a previous book where characters felt indistinguishable.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and World-Building:**  \n   - The book creates a spooky, atmospheric setting with the woods and the town’s eerie history. However, it didn’t fully deliver on the mythical creatures or intense horror I anticipated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved *My Throat An Open Grave* and would definitely re-read it. While it didn’t fully meet my expectations in terms of labyrinth-like elements or horror, it excelled in character development, thematic depth, and atmospheric storytelling. It made me reflect on my self-worth and how others’ opinions influence me. I highly recommend it to fans of *Labyrinth* or those intrigued by spooky, mysterious woods.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars!"

            "The town's dark secrets resonated deeply, though I must admit I predicted a few of the book's twists.",
            "I found the characters in this story captivating, especially Leah. Her struggle with feelings of inadequacy and failure made her relatable and sympathetic. Tristan was also intriguing and added depth to the narrative, and the chemistry between him and Leah was genuinely engaging.",
            "Finding an author who can replicate Holly Black's unique style and skill in immersing readers in a richly mysterious world is challenging. However, this author has succeeded beautifully.",
            "Although the nature of the Wood and Tristan's commune remains ambiguous, I found it surprisingly easy to accept. The setting is undeniably magical, yet we never receive a clear explanation of its mysteries. Even Tristan acknowledges his uncertainty about his own identity, admitting he knows he isn't human. Typically, this lack of clarity would frustrate me, but in this case, I felt completely at ease with the minimal explanation provided.",
            "I was pleasantly surprised by the themes of religion and societal expectations in this story. Many of us can relate to the feeling of never being good enough or failing to meet the expectations of others, particularly our parents. The author captures this sentiment perfectly through Leah's character.",
            "I was genuinely surprised by how good this story was! It was incredibly engaging, and I found myself unable to put it down. This was a delightful surprise, and I will definitely read it again.",
            "This novel doesn't fit the typical horror mold, despite its description. While it contains elements of gothic horror, it never reaches a truly unsettling level."

        "conclusion": "This novel was a delightful surprise, exceeding my expectations with its engaging plot, relatable characters, and rich atmosphere. While it draws inspiration from *Labyrinth*, it stands on its own with unique twists and themes. The exploration of religion, expectations, and self-worth resonated deeply, and the mysterious world-building was handled masterfully. A captivating story has been crafted that feels both fresh and immersive, earning a high recommendation from me.",

            "Overall, this book feels underdeveloped. While it has the potential to be great, much of the plot is presented directly rather than unfolding through scenes. The important themes of religious trauma and abandonment are touched upon, but they remain superficial. A shift in storytelling mechanics would have greatly enhanced the narrative.",
            "My main issue with this novel is that the characters lack memorability. Leah is passive, with events in her life happening to her rather than being driven by her actions. Tristan, the second most important character, lacks distinct personality traits and fails to undergo any meaningful development, which was disappointing. Leah's character arc is similarly half-hearted and underwhelming. Fletcher exists primarily to cook for Leah and has a romantic subplot that feels irrelevant. After finishing the book, I still struggle to articulate the personalities of any characters beyond a few basic traits. The story would have greatly benefited from more showing and less telling.",
            "I don't believe I was the intended audience for this book, and that's perfectly fine—every book isn't meant for every reader. While I could empathize with the main character's struggles, I found it difficult to fully relate to her experiences. This disconnect made it challenging for me to immerse myself in the story.",
            "The novel lacked suspense, as I was told the stakes were high but never felt them. The narrative primarily told rather than showed, leaving me unconvinced by the characters' emotions, thoughts, and actions. Although it aimed to present a murder mystery, I found myself indifferent to uncovering the truth due to the author's failure to engage my interest. The big reveal was unsatisfying; some elements were predictable while others were completely overlooked. Overall, there was no effective balance between surprise and the process of sleuthing."

            "Leah serves as a solid protagonist, yet her trauma and complexities are not explored in sufficient depth. Overall, the characters tend to be forgettable, and the opportunity to delve into Leah's friendship with her childhood best friend remains largely untapped, which could have added significant depth to the narrative. The romance between Leah and the Lord of the Wood feels predictable and relies heavily on clichés. The instalove dynamic and the portrayal of the Lord as a charming, overly sweet character detract from the story's potential. This shift toward a conventional YA romance undermines the more intriguing themes and mysteries at play.",
            "The writing is strong and well-crafted, yet it leaves me emotionally detached from the characters. Although the prose is impressive, it fails to fully immerse me in the story's emotional depth.",
            "The portrayal of the small town of Winston and its haunting forest evokes a palpable sense of doom. The community's deep-rooted Christian beliefs, particularly its emphasis on purity culture, contribute to an oppressive atmosphere that profoundly influences the narrative. The themes of religious oppression and trauma are compellingly developed and effectively executed.",

The incorporation of folklore and the mystery of the missing girls from Winston enrich the narrative. The significant twist is both impactful and resonates with contemporary societal issues, particularly in the US."

        "conclusion": "This book is an okay read with a compelling setting and important themes, but it falls short in character development and veers into predictable YA romance tropes. The potential for a deeper exploration of trauma, friendship, and mystery is overshadowed by the focus on a conventional love story. Despite its flaws, the themes and atmosphere make it a worthwhile recommendation, especially for readers who enjoy YA romance with a darker edge.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  The description of the small town of Winston and its eerie forest creates a strong sense of doom and gloom. The town's deep commitment to Christian religion, including its purity culture, adds a layer of oppressive atmosphere that shapes the story. The setting and themes of religious oppression and trauma are compelling and well-executed.  \n\n- **Themes and Inspiration:**  \n  The book effectively explores themes of religious oppression, trauma, and the struggles of conforming to a strict belief system. The folklore inspirations and the mystery surrounding the missing girls from Winston are intriguing and add depth to the narrative. The big twist is impactful and relevant to current societal issues, particularly in the US.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Leah is a good protagonist, but her trauma and complexities are not delved into deeply enough. The characters, in general, are mostly forgettable, and the potential for exploring Leah's friendship with her childhood best friend is largely untapped. This could have added significant depth to the story.  \n\n- **Romance and Tropes:**  \n  The romance between Leah and the Lord of the Wood feels predictable and trope-heavy. The instalove dynamic and the portrayal of the Lord of the Wood as a \"pretty boy\" who is \"super nice and sweet\" detract from the story's potential. The shift toward a typical YA romance undermines the more interesting themes and mysteries.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is strong but keeps the reader emotionally detached from the characters. While the prose is well-crafted, it doesn't fully immerse the reader in the emotional depth of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an okay read with a compelling setting and important themes, but it falls short in character development and veers into predictable YA romance tropes. The potential for a deeper exploration of trauma, friendship, and mystery is overshadowed by the focus on a conventional love story. Despite its flaws, the themes and atmosphere make it a worthwhile recommendation, especially for readers who enjoy YA romance with a darker edge.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "This book follows a girl ostracized by her small, religious town as she seeks the Lord of the Wood to retrieve her stolen brother. Instead of encountering an eldritch horror, she meets a teenager and spends a month in the village, tasked with creating a song in exchange for her brother. The ending reveals the fates of the girls who came before her and clarifies why she was cast out and deemed broken. The twist—that the baby is her son, not her brother—along with the murder plot, is well-executed and fits seamlessly into the narrative. While the conclusion, where she seeks revenge for the murdered girls and later decides to return to the village, felt initially underwhelming, it ultimately proved satisfying. The book is a page-turner, with a well-paced plot that kept me engaged throughout. The author skillfully weaves together multiple genres and themes, enriching the story.",
            "The main character and the Lord of the Wood are well-developed, each possessing distinct personalities and dynamics. Background characters like Ruth and Fletcher also contribute depth to the narrative. A standout element is the duality of Tristan and the Lord, who inhabit the same body; the author skillfully emphasizes their differences.",
            "This book offers a keen critique of small, religiously driven East Coast towns, highlighting their use of purity to shame individuals. The portrayal of religion as both a source of comfort and a catalyst for nightmares and loneliness is compelling and nuanced. Additionally, the depiction of how information circulates secretly within the town enhances the story's realism.",
            "The novel skillfully weaves together folklore, religious themes, mystery, horror, and romance into a captivating narrative. While the horror elements, particularly in the later chapters, are effective, they can be unsettling at times, especially with the revelation of the main character as a teen mom and the accompanying sexual undertones."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a compelling and thought-provoking novel that masterfully blends folklore, horror, romance, and social commentary. The well-developed characters, intricate plot twists, and nuanced portrayal of religion and small-town dynamics made it a standout read. While some elements, like the unsettling themes in the later chapters, were unexpected, they added depth to the story. It’s a book I would highly recommend to fans of dark, multi-layered narratives.",

            "Leah’s character is intricately developed, illustrating her as a product of her town’s rigid beliefs and her battle with depression. The author skillfully portrays Leah’s journey toward healing and reclaiming her autonomy. Jess’s supportive role stands in stark contrast to the town’s judgmental attitudes, highlighting the significance of unconditional support. The dynamics between Ruth and Fletcher further emphasize the importance of having a strong support system. While the romance between Tristan and Leah feels somewhat rushed, it enriches the narrative rather than dominating it. Tristan’s accepting nature sharply contrasts with the town’s oppressive ideals, enhancing Leah’s journey.",
            "This book compellingly tackles significant issues, particularly the societal pressures and expectations imposed on women. It critiques the enforcement of purity culture and highlights the lack of autonomy many women experience, mirroring real-world struggles.

I'm not disappointed by this at all, I just think it was described in a different way to how the book felt.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot had depth and a lot of creativeness, and I was not bored once. There were so many twists and turns that kept the story really entertaining. The pace was quite quick, and I don't think it needed to be anything but; nothing was left unanswered. I enjoyed the story a lot.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  I loved the old myth of the Lord of Wood being a terrible entity and it being the lore of the town. You could get a feel for what was going to happen in the first couple of chapters, but I didn't find myself predicting everything that would happen throughout.  \n\n- **Ending and Closure:**  \n  However, I do wish there was an epilogue of some sorts so we could see how Leah's life panned out.  \n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n  The characters in the book were all entertaining to read about, and they all had complex characteristics. The inclusion of a non-binary character was also really cool to have. Leah was a very complex character; the story was told from her POV, and I'm really glad it was. Her journey to self-acceptance and realizing she wasn't a 'bad' girl for the things she wanted was compelling. The struggles she faced in Winston were not her fault but the fault of every person who failed her.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement and Themes:**  \n  The way the people who wronged her were written had me feeling so much anger and hatred for them, as if I was Leah myself. I loved how Tristan accepted her immediately and never made her feel bad for who she was. I really enjoyed watching their romance blossom; I was rooting for them to be endgame 100%.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  There is a very important message lying between the lines of this book. It is well-told and very powerful. It portrays themes like love, grief, anger, and acceptance. It also dabbles into the corruption often seen in churches and the violence typically harbored against women. In my opinion, the author wrote these topics very well with a lot of knowledge, so it didn't feel far-fetched.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Author's Work:**  \n  I highly recommend this to any gothic horror, folk horror, and romantasy lovers. I look forward to reading more of Bovalino's books; I have heard many great things!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations, blending gothic horror with romantasy in a way that was both entertaining and thought-provoking. The plot was engaging, the characters were well-developed, and the themes were handled with care and depth. While I wished for an epilogue, the story left a lasting impression, and I eagerly anticipate more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, he feels somewhat bland next to the playful, dramatic, and queer energy of Jareth from *Labyrinth*. While Tristan is supportive and their relationship is sweet, it lacks the flair that Jareth brings. On a positive note, there is a spicy scene that pushes boundaries for YA, which I found impressive.",

        "conclusion": "While the book diverges significantly from the Labyrinth comparison it initially invites, it offers a unique emotional and mental health journey. The stakes could have been higher, and the horror elements could have been scarier, but the commentary on church culture and the relatable protagonist make it a worthwhile read. The relationship between the protagonist and Tristan is sweet, though it lacks the dramatic flair of Jareth. Overall, it’s a mixed experience, leaving me torn between 3 and 4 stars.",

However, I felt the story could have been more developed.  \n\n- **Ambiguity of the Group/Cult:**  \n   - It’s unclear whether the group in the story is a cult or just a bunch of cottagecore people living in cabins in the woods.  \n   - The message of joining a cult as a solution to a shitty, slut-shamey small town feels problematic, especially for a teenage audience.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n   - For a horror book, it could have been much scarier.  \n\n- **Narration and Commentary:**  \n   - I loved the narration and commentary on church \"good girl\" culture. As someone who grew up in a tiny, conservative church, I deeply related to the protagonist's inner struggles, fears, and anger.  \n\n- **Characterization of Tristan (Jareth-like character):**  \n   - Tristan is the protagonist's age, which is a nice touch, but he becomes a bit bland compared to the playful, dramatic, and queer energy of Jareth from \"Labyrinth.\"  \n   - He is supportive and treats her well, and their relationship is sweet, but it lacks the flair of Jareth.  \n   - There is a spicy scene that pushed boundaries for YA, which I found impressive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book diverges significantly from the \"Labyrinth\" comparison it initially invites, it offers a unique emotional and mental health journey. The stakes could have been higher, and the horror elements could have been scarier, but the commentary on church culture and the relatable protagonist make it a worthwhile read. The relationship between the protagonist and Tristan is sweet, though it lacks the dramatic flair of Jareth. Overall, it’s a mixed experience, leaving me torn between 3 and 4 stars.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 3 to 4 stars."

I didn't anticipate the twist involving Owen until about two-thirds in, showcasing the author's talent for crafting unexpected surprises.",
            "Leah's growth is the heart of the story, and her character arc is well-developed. In contrast, Tristian's arc is flatter, yet he serves effectively as a sweet, tender romantic counterbalance to the heavier themes. If his role is primarily to look good, that's perfectly fine—this book is aimed at a female audience, and he fulfills his part admirably. I truly enjoyed the romance; it was sweet and tender, providing a lovely balance to the more serious elements of the narrative.",

It offers a heartwrenching exploration of religious trauma, searing commentary on reproductive rights, and a female-centric narrative about self-loathing, unlearning self-hatred, and rediscovering love.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Bovalino's writing is absolutely gorgeous. I rarely annotate books, but there were plenty of lines in this one that I dog-eared to revisit later.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The pacing in the middle felt a bit slow. The plotline about discovering what really happened to Maria should have been introduced sooner and given more emphasis to build tension. However, the final third of the book was explosive and made up for the slower middle.\n\n- **Twists and Surprises:**  \n  I didn’t guess the Owen twist until about two-thirds of the way through, which was a testament to the author’s skill in crafting surprises.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Leah’s growth was far more important to the story, and her character arc was well-developed. Tristian’s arc was flatter, but his role as a sweet, tender romantic counterbalance to the heavier themes worked well. If he was just there to \"look pretty,\" that was fine—this was a book for the girls, and he played his part.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  I really loved the romance. It was sweet, tender, and provided a nice counterbalance to the book’s heavier themes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is an empowering and heartwrenching YA horror novel that balances timely themes with beautiful writing and a compelling narrative.

It was so captivating that I didn’t want to read anything else afterward, which is a rare feeling for me. I devoured it but also wished it could last forever.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book is a powerful reminder that not all monsters are the ones you thought you knew.

The story will echo within my soul for a long time.  \n\n- **Setting and Relatability:**  \n  The small town of Winston felt like an exaggerated version of my own small town and its beliefs. This made the story hit close to home and gave it a truthful, razor-sharp edge.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Leah’s character is fascinating.

Her journey to recover her brother feels like her only path to redemption—both in the eyes of her mother and the town itself.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The plot twists were unexpected, though I had a slight inkling about one towards the end.

            "I rarely read YA books these days, so I was surprised to discover this one was in that genre after I started it and added it to my Currently Reading list. I also didn’t realize it was inspired by *Labyrinth*. I picked it up because I enjoyed the author’s previous work, *Not Good For Maidens*. This book resonates with young girls—and those who are no longer so young—who have felt inadequate. It speaks to those who were told they needed to be perfect, even when perfection is elusive and unattainable. It addresses the feelings of being tarnished, broken, or unimportant for not meeting societal expectations, and it acknowledges the struggle of simply being human."

I’m not sure if it was the pacing or the point of view (POV), but even though the writing was beautiful and the lore was interesting, I kept waiting for that “aha!” moment.

I was hoping for a stronger focus on horror, but the book didn’t deliver on that expectation.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and POV:**  \n  The first-person POV, being entirely in Leah’s head, was frustrating and exhausting. There were days when I struggled to motivate myself to continue reading. The constant vague allusions to Leah’s “badness” and her past became annoying, as they lacked clarity and depth.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The mystery surrounding the girls disappearing into the forest didn’t feel like it drove the plot. Instead, the story meandered, spending too much time inside Leah’s self-loathing thoughts.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt flat, and I didn’t form an attachment to Leah or Tristan. Tristan, in particular, felt underdeveloped, and I didn’t feel like I got to know him. The romance also felt unconvincing.  \n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  The book’s commentary on purity culture was handled well, but I felt it could have been explored more deeply.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Readability:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book is an easy read, and I think teenagers might connect with it more than I did.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had moments of promise, particularly in its thematic exploration of purity culture, it fell short in terms of horror, character development, and plot execution. The first-person POV and Leah’s repetitive self-loathing made the reading experience tiresome. However, it remains an accessible read, likely more appealing to a younger audience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romantic subplot was charming and enriched the story without overshadowing its main themes. Although the pacing was slower, the plot developed smoothly. I listened to the audiobook in one sitting, so the pacing may feel different when read physically over several days.",
            "The character development and emotional revelations were captivating, especially the protagonist's journey of self-love, acceptance, and redemption. While some of the main character's choices left me confused, I'll refrain from detailing them to avoid spoilers.",
            "The book masterfully crafts a creepy, otherworldly atmosphere through its rich folklore and gothic elements. Its immersive storytelling makes it an ideal read for the autumn and winter months.",
            "I appreciated the folklore elements, but I felt that certain aspects of the lore could have been explored more deeply, as some areas seemed underdeveloped.",
            "I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the subject matter in this book. As a fan of stories set in small religious towns with toxic views on women, I appreciate how these narratives often expose the absurdity of such beliefs while providing empowering moments for female characters. This book excelled in that regard, blending themes of female rage with satisfying \"good for her\" moments.",

However, the *Labyrinth* vibes were only present to a very small degree, with minor similarities. I wouldn’t recommend picking it up solely based on those vibes.  \n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n  What I wasn’t prepared for was the depth of the subject matters explored in this book, which I found to be a positive aspect. I’m a fan of stories that delve into small religious towns with toxic views about women, as these narratives often highlight the absurdity of such beliefs and deliver satisfying moments of female empowerment. This book delivered on those fronts, offering a mix of female rage and “good for her” moments.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The book excelled in creating a creepy, otherworldly atmosphere with its folklore and gothic vibes. The story felt atmospheric and immersive, making it a perfect read for the autumn and winter months.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character growth and emotional revelations were compelling and kept me hooked. The protagonist’s journey of self-love, acceptance, and redemption was particularly impactful.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The romantic subplot was sweet and added a nice layer to the story without overpowering the main themes.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  While the pacing was slower, the plot unfolded nicely. I listened to the audiobook in one sitting, so the pacing might feel different when read physically over several days.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  I enjoyed the folklore elements, but I wish the lore had been explored more in certain areas. Some aspects felt underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Character Choices:**  \n  Some of the main character’s choices didn’t always make sense to me, though I won’t specify to avoid spoilers.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This is a great YA spooky gothic novel, though I wouldn’t personally classify it as horror. It’s more about exploring religious trauma, self-love, and redemption.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  I would recommend checking trigger warnings before reading, as the book deals with heavy themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a compelling YA gothic novel with a strong focus on themes like religious trauma, self-love, and redemption. While it didn’t fully meet my initial *Labyrinth* expectations, it delivered on atmosphere, character growth, and emotional depth. The slower pacing and occasional lack of clarity in the protagonist’s choices were minor drawbacks, but the book is still a great choice for fans of spooky, atmospheric reads.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nCurrently between 3.75 and 4 stars ✨."

The immersive narrative is thought-provoking and leaves a lasting impression long after the final page.",

When Owen is kidnapped, Leah must confront both the Lord and her own inner demons to rescue him.",

It underscores the repeated failures of society in supporting young women, who are both exploited for their sexuality and punished for seeking autonomy over it.

I absolutely loved it.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The writing is beautiful, and although magical realism is not usually my cup of tea, it worked well in this book.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**\n   - The middle of the book was a bit boring, and I saw the plot twist coming from the beginning.\n   - I wished for more details about how the townspeople knew the girls were coming back and why they decided to kill them.\n   - The story focused more on how society treats women's sexuality and the choices available to them regarding their bodies, sexuality, and lives, rather than on the townspeople.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this was a very enjoyable book with beautiful writing and important themes. While the middle section was a bit slow and the plot twist predictable, the romance and the powerful messages about women's autonomy and societal expectations made it a compelling read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.79"

            "The story follows Leah, a girl living in a town dominated by a local church, overshadowed by the enigmatic Lord of the Woods (LoW). The LoW is rumored to abduct babies, and families that offer their children are shunned, seldom returning. When Leah's baby brother, Owen, is taken, she becomes an outcast and ventures into the forest, where she encounters the kind-hearted Tristan and a welcoming community. Leah faces a pivotal choice: sacrifice something to retrieve Owen or remain in the forest. The premise, featuring dark entities in the woods and a cult-like town, is both intriguing and reminiscent of *The Cruel Prince* and *The Replacement*.",
            "Leah's character is intricately developed as her layers are gradually revealed, uncovering an unexpected and troubling truth. Her transformation from an outcast to someone who finds belonging in the forest is compelling. The introduction of Tristan and the forest community enriches her growth and influences her choices.",

However, it doesn’t fully commit to the horror genre. While there are a few gory moments, the story leans more toward young adult fantasy with a touch of mystery. This might mislead readers expecting a full-blown horror experience.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows Leah, the protagonist, who is thrust into the woods by her mother and church pastor to rescue her little brother from the lord of the wood. The premise is adventurous and intriguing, though the pacing occasionally feels slow, as if \"stuck in molasses.\"  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel explores significant themes, which add depth to the narrative. However, the execution of these themes could have been more dynamic to enhance the story’s impact.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Bovalino’s writing is described as charming and clever, showcasing her skill as a storyteller. The whimsical tone adds a unique flavor to the book, even if it doesn’t fully align with the horror expectations.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the book has its merits and offers an enchanting journey through the woods, it didn’t fully captivate me as much as I had hoped. It’s more fantastical than frightful, which might appeal to readers seeking a lighter, mystical adventure.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*My Throat an Open Grave* is a young adult fantasy with a twist of mystery, rather than the horror story it might initially appear to be. Despite its slow pacing and misleading marketing, the book has its charms, thanks to Bovalino’s clever writing and the adventurous premise. It’s a solid read for those who enjoy fantastical journeys, though it may not fully satisfy horror enthusiasts.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars (with a hopeful twinkle!)"

The Lord of the Woods, who I expected to be a terrifying figure, turned out to be gentle and not scary at all.  \n\n- **Character Development (Main Character):**  \n  The main character completely rubbed me the wrong way, and I couldn’t stand her. Her constant inner monologue about how everyone treats her horribly and her intense hatred for her baby brother made her unlikable and hard to empathize with. Her actions, such as attempting to sacrifice her baby brother twice by the time he was two weeks old, felt extreme and unsettling. Her relief at the baby being in the arms of a stranger, to the point of being moved to tears because she didn’t want him back, gave me an “ick” feeling and felt cringe-worthy.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story included a couple of reveals, but they were easy to predict and lacked the intended impact. The direction of the book felt confusing, and I didn’t understand why the author chose to focus on such an unlikable protagonist and her extreme emotions.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  Despite the unsettling cover and creepy title, the story failed to deliver a disturbing or eerie atmosphere.

The ending featured a shocking twist that took me completely by surprise; I had to re-read the chapter revealing a major secret to fully understand its connection to earlier events. I missed the subtle hints the author cleverly woven throughout, though others may catch them!",
            "The protagonist is profoundly influenced by the shame instilled in her by a hyper-religious and superstitious community. I found myself eagerly supporting her decision to leave her town and explore the forest in search of the LoW. Her guilt, combined with the town's superstitions, weaves a compelling sense of mystery and tension throughout the narrative.",

            "The book features a few mild spicy moments, but they are not particularly intense, especially given the characters' youth. Although it is marketed as horror, I found the elements to be quite subdued. Despite trigger warnings for blood, gore, animal death, body horror, and suicidal ideation, the overall impact felt mild. Initially, I believed it was historical fiction set in the 1800s, but it actually takes place in the 21st century."

        "conclusion": "This book blends mild horror, mystery, and emotional depth in a way that kept me engaged from start to finish. The protagonist’s journey, the town’s superstitions, and the shocking twist at the end make it a standout read. While the horror elements are tame, the story’s atmosphere and intrigue more than make up for it.",

Despite trigger warnings for blood, gore, animal death, body horror, and suicidal ideation, the horror elements felt subdued. At first, I thought it was historical fiction set in the 1800s, but it’s actually set in the 21st century.  \n\n- **Main Character and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The protagonist is deeply shaped by shame, stemming from a hyper-religious and superstitious community. I found myself rooting for her to leave her town and venture into the forest to find the LoW. Her guilt and the town’s superstitions create a sense of mystery and tension throughout the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The book kept me questioning the nature of the people living in the Wood, largely due to the protagonist’s perspective and the town’s beliefs. The ending had a massive twist that completely blindsided me—I had to re-read the chapter where a major secret was revealed to fully grasp how it tied into earlier events. (I missed the hints the author sprinkled throughout, but others might catch them!)  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  There are some mild spicy moments, but they’re not extreme, especially since the characters are relatively young.  \n\n- **Re-readability:**  \n  This is a great mystery that I’ll definitely revisit in the future. It’s one of my favorite reads of the year!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book blends mild horror, mystery, and emotional depth in a way that kept me engaged from start to finish.

Her journey of feeling broken, soiled, and wrong, while carrying the weight of her God on her shoulders, is deeply compelling. Her growth and eventual self-discovery, as well as her fight for justice for other girls, are central to the story.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The novel explores profound themes such as religious fanaticism, self-hate, and the journey to overcome societal oppression. It also touches on the idea of finding oneself and creating a path forward despite the weight of one's upbringing.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The Hollow and its inhabitants are described as magical, whimsical, and strange, creating a unique and immersive atmosphere. The blend of romance, folk, and cottage-core elements with a sprinkle of horror adds to the story's charm.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Tori's writing is praised for its beautiful prose and the flow of words.

This has made me even more excited to read her sophomore book, which is still on my TBR.\n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**\n   - The plot follows Leah, who lives in a religious and narrow-minded small town. When her little brother Owen goes missing, she must venture into the creepy woods to bring him back, facing the mysterious Lord of the Wood. While the story is based on *Labyrinth* (though I’m unsure if it’s a book or movie), I didn’t find this knowledge necessary to enjoy the story. The plot was predictable, but this didn’t detract from my enjoyment.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**\n   - The book explores themes of religious trauma and the mistreatment of women in society, particularly in religious small towns. Leah’s journey was heartbreaking, and while I correctly guessed her story early on, it still resonated deeply. However, I wished the book had more depth. There was a lot implied between the lines, and I understood the author’s intent, but I felt these themes could have been discussed more explicitly, especially given it’s a YA novel.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**\n   - The book was less horror-like than I expected based on the synopsis and Bovalino’s debut. While there were a couple of gory scenes, it leaned more toward real-life horror rather than supernatural horror. I think this makes it a great introduction to horror for younger teens.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The book was more romance-heavy than I anticipated, and while I didn’t personally love this aspect, I recognize that I would have enjoyed it more as a teen. The romance was handled well, especially toward the end, but I felt the story might have been stronger without it.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**\n   - Despite not much happening, the book was fast-paced and kept me hooked from the first chapter.

            "The plot progressed at a steady pace, occasionally feeling slow, yet it consistently captured my attention with each twist.",
            "I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of Tristan's character, as I was eager to learn more about his origins and backstory, but these aspects remained vague. In contrast, I found Leah's character to be richly complex, particularly in her evolving feelings toward her brother. Her journey of self-forgiveness and rejection of her town's imposed beliefs was compelling. I especially admired how she ultimately made a choice for her own happiness, rather than allowing her life to be dictated by those who had turned her against herself. While I'm typically not a fan of romance in books, especially heterosexual ones, this story pleasantly surprised me. There were no clichéd damsels in distress or knights in shining armor; instead, the characters felt authentic both individually and in their relationship, which I truly appreciated.",
            "This story is beautifully crafted, blending dark themes with romance and deep emotion.",
            "My favorite aspects of the story are the intricate world-building and the captivating romance, both of which left me in awe.",
            "In her journey, Leah learns what it means to be human from an unexpected source—someone who is not. She navigates a spectrum of emotions: love, hate, sorrow, joy, and everything in between. Throughout the story, she grapples with the pressure to conform to her town's expectations, often dictating her actions based on their notions of right and wrong. At times, she is both selfish and selfless, and the weight of guilt often overwhelms her. Water serves as a powerful symbol in the narrative; at the beginning, Leah submerges herself in search of purity, and by the end, she returns to the river, embracing both her pure and impure sides. This journey allows her to recognize and accept her own humanity.",
            "I rated this a 3.5 because I anticipated a more adventurous narrative, especially given the original concept of *Labyrinth*, which I thought would play a larger role in the story. Unfortunately, aside from Leah's brother being taken, the similarities largely end there. While I didn't dislike the storytelling, I found it underwhelming compared to my expectations."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the book didn't fully meet my expectations in terms of adventure and connection to *Labyrinth*, it was still a beautifully written, emotionally heavy, and romantic story. The world-building and Leah's character development were standout elements, though I wished for more depth in Tristan's backstory. Overall, it was a compelling read that left me reflecting on its themes and symbolism.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Romance:**  \n   - I'm not usually a fan of romance in books, especially hetero books, but this took me wildly by surprise. There were no damsels in distress or knights in shining armor. The characters were both individually themselves and one at the same time, which I loved.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n   - I rated this a 3.5 because I was expecting it to be far more adventurous, given the original concept of the movie *Labyrinth*, which I felt from the blurb was going to be more relevant in the story. However, Leah's brother getting stolen is about where the similarities end. I can't say I disliked the way the story was told, but I was certainly underwhelmed considering what I was expecting.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**  \n   - The plot moved at a steady pace, if not a bit slow at times, but still held my attention with each turn of the plot.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - It was amazingly well-written, dark, romantic, and heavy with emotion.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n   - My favorite part would have to be the world-building and the romance, how detailed and enthralling they were, leaving me wonder-stricken.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I would have loved a deeper dive into Tristan's character, as I was initially excited to delve deeper into who he actually was, his origins, and backstories, but that was all left relatively vague.  \n   - On the contrary, I loved the complexity of Leah's character, the fluidity of her feelings towards her brother. How she learned to forgive herself and reject the idea her town had originally pushed onto her.  \n   - I love that, at the end, we get to see her make a choice based on her own self-interest, for her own happiness, rather than revolving her life around the very people who turned her against herself.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n   - In the process, Leah learns to be human, from of all people, someone who is not. She experiences love, hate, sorrow, joy, and all the nasty bits in between.  \n   - Throughout the story, she constantly feels the need to play the part of the \"good girl,\" dictating her actions based on what her town would deem right or wrong. She is both selfish and selfless at times, and the guilt consumes her.  \n   - I think water is extremely symbolic in this book. At the beginning, she submerges herself to be pure, and at the end, she chooses once more to go back to the river, embracing both the \"pure\" and \"impure\" parts of herself, recognizing her own humanity in the process.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book didn't fully meet my expectations in terms of adventure and connection to *Labyrinth*, it was still a beautifully written, emotionally heavy, and romantic story. The world-building and Leah's character development were standout elements, though I wished for more depth in Tristan's backstory.

            "I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this novel, especially since I typically shy away from smoldering YA romance. The story follows Leah, who offers her brother Owen to the Lord of the Wood (LoW), a feared entity in the woods near her small, religious town. Many young women, children, and babies have vanished into these woods, never to return. When Owen is taken, Leah bravely ventures into the forest to retrieve him, despite the fact that no one has ever succeeded before. The plot kept me thoroughly engaged as Leah navigates the mysteries of the woods, encounters the inhabitants living alongside the LoW, and struggles to discern whom to trust. The tension surrounding the fate of the missing girls and Leah’s own survival had me racing through the pages.",
            "Leah's character is profoundly influenced by the harsh judgments and expectations of her town, where girls are pressured to remain pure and chaste. Her internal conflict between societal pressures and personal desires is effectively depicted, though the relentless focus on being a \"good girl\" can become somewhat irritating. Nonetheless, this emphasis is understandable in light of the oppressive environment she navigates.",
            "The novel masterfully establishes a creepy, atmospheric setting with its depiction of the woods and the enigmatic Lord of the Wood. The small, religious town heightens the tension and sense of foreboding, resulting in a compelling coming-of-age story.",
            "The story delves into themes of societal expectations, purity, and the tension between conformity and individuality. Leah's journey transcends merely rescuing her brother; it involves challenging the truths instilled in her and forging her own path."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Target Audience Misrepresentation:**  \n   - The book was marketed as adult horror fiction, but it is clearly intended for a much younger audience.  \n   - The blurb and reviews misleadingly suggest it is a horror story, which it is not.  \n   - The lack of horror elements and the absence of anything scary make it unsuitable for adult horror fans.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n   - The story lacks meaningful conflict beyond the first chapter.  \n   - The supposed \"cult in the woods\" turns out to be a quaint fairytale village, which undermines any sense of tension or intrigue.  \n   - The plot is predictable, and the ending is obvious, leading to disengagement.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n   - The writing is subpar, even for YA fiction standards.  \n   - Examples include awkward descriptions (e.g., the protagonist's curly hair being compared to Hermione Granger in fanfiction) and lazy character introductions (e.g., a character stating their pronouns in an unnatural way).  \n   - The narrative is filled with \"boring nonsense\" and lacks depth or originality.  \n\n- **Romance and Wish Fulfillment:**  \n   - The romance is lackluster and feels like wish fulfillment rather than a compelling narrative element.  \n   - This aspect contributes to the overall dissatisfaction with the story.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - The book failed to hold my interest, leading me to skim the final chapters.  \n   - Even if I were part of the intended younger audience, I doubt I would have enjoyed it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a disappointment due to its misleading marketing, lack of horror elements, poor writing, and predictable plot. The story fails to engage, and the romance feels shallow and unearned. I would not recommend it, even to younger readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a very low rating (e.g., 1 or 2 out of 10)."

The author demonstrates a strong talent for horror and terror, and I encourage her to explore that genre more deeply in the future.

She hopes to retrieve her brother and bring him back to Winston.  \n  - While in the Wood, she befriends the clan people and starts to fall for the Lord of the Wood.  \n  - The twist that Owen is actually her son, hidden by her parents as her brother, was intriguing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Leah's character has strong \"pick-me\" vibes, which felt a bit outdated. I thought we've moved away from being excited that a man in power picks you as special.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - At the beginning, I found the story cheesy, but I suspended my disbelief and got into it.  \n  - The book has a fun and engaging tone, despite some criticisms.  \n\n- **Appeal to Target Audience:**  \n  - I can see why young adults would be enamored with the plot.  \n\n- **Book Design:**  \n  - The book title and cover are pretty metal, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Value for Money:**  \n  - I'm glad I borrowed it from the library rather than purchasing it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this YA novel offers a fun and engaging Labyrinth-esque adventure with an intriguing twist. While the protagonist's \"pick-me\" vibes felt outdated, the story was enjoyable enough to keep me invested. The book's title and cover design are standout features, though I wouldn't recommend purchasing it outright.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

I bought this novel, along with *Not Good for Maidens* and *The Devil Makes Three*, as part of my quest to read more folk horror to inspire my creative projects.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  I enjoyed the atmosphere Bovalino has built in this novel. The dark forest setting and visceral descriptions were particularly engaging and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  While I enjoyed the book overall, I did find myself skimming through some passages, which affected my engagement with the story at times.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I felt that this novel leans more towards a younger YA audience (or an actual YA audience, depending on your perspective). This might explain some of the stylistic choices that didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Consistency:**  \n  One aspect I didn’t like was how the Lord of the Forest is sometimes abbreviated. This inconsistency pulled me out of the story and disrupted the immersion.  \n\n- **Genre Expectations (Folk Horror):**  \n  While I would recommend this book to someone trying to get into folk horror, I felt the horror elements were somewhat lacking. It leans more into fantasy with a dark, atmospheric setting rather than delivering strong horror vibes.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation and Future Expectations:**  \n  Despite some minor criticisms, I would recommend this book for its dark forest fantasy elements and vivid descriptions. I’m excited to see what Bovalino’s other novels have in store and look forward to exploring more of her work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a compelling dark forest fantasy with strong atmospheric writing, though it may appeal more to a younger YA audience. While the horror elements felt underdeveloped, the visceral descriptions and setting make it a worthwhile read for fans of folk horror and dark fantasy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It’s something you don’t want to miss out on, especially if you love folklore-type stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fantastic read with a well-crafted storyline and strong character development. While the romance subplot didn’t resonate with me, the dark, adventurous tone and folklore-inspired themes made it a highly enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Leah is such a heartbreaking character. I cried several times and had to stop and sit with a sentence for a minute before I could continue.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Surprises:**  \n  The last third takes the book in a direction I was not expecting, and I’m glad I wasn’t prepared for it.

The Lord of the Wood represents the devil, and the people of the woods symbolize non-believers. The non-believers were not as the town had claimed, and life away from faith was depicted as filled with good and kind people.  \n\n- **Representation of Faith and Religion:**  \n  The town represents the people of faith, and the preacher symbolizes God. The townspeople, much like in the real world, rebuked anyone different and twisted the words of God with hate instead of love. The preacher kills anyone who has sinned or \"danced with the devil,\" creating a stark contrast between the two sides.  \n\n- **Realism and Exaggeration:**  \n  While the metaphors are exaggerated, the actions of both sides feel genuine and reflective of real-world dynamics. The author effectively uses these contrasts to highlight deeper truths about faith, judgment, and humanity.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The author crafted a mystical and eerie story, reminiscent of *Labyrinth*, to explore heavy and profound themes. The atmosphere adds depth to the narrative, making the metaphors and messages even more impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a thought-provoking exploration of religious trauma and the dichotomy between faith and non-belief.

If the ending had been more surprising, I likely would have rated the book higher.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn't love the book, I found it enjoyable and appreciated its originality. However, the predictable ending and the slightly dragging pace in the latter half kept it from being a standout read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nIf I hadn't predicted the ending, I probably would have given it another star."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The novel is described as a \"dark yet whimsical tale\" that touches on serious and important topics. It includes elements like ghosts, a small religious town, and a mystical forest, which initially appealed to me. However, it is branded as \"folk horror,\" which I found misleading. While there are dark aspects, trauma, and some gore, the story lacks true horror elements and feels more tame than expected.  \n\n- **Plot and Stakes:**  \n  The plot suffers from a lack of stakes and tension. For most of the story, I struggled to understand the main character's problem or feel any sense of danger. The mystical forest, which could have been a source of suspense, fails to deliver a sense of lurking threat. This made the story feel uneventful and underwhelming.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance in the story felt generic and uninspired. Around a quarter of the way in, I began to perceive the novel as more of a YA romance, and this impression persisted until the end. The romantic elements did not add depth or intrigue to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**  \n  The novel touches on significant themes, but they are not explored deeply enough. I believe the story could have been stronger if these themes had been given more attention and development. Additionally, the branding of the book as \"folk horror\" misrepresents its actual content, which might have contributed to my disappointment.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was a redeeming aspect of the novel. When all the pieces came together, it provided clarity and a sense of resolution that somewhat salvaged the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has intriguing elements like its dark whimsy, mystical setting, and serious themes, it falls short of its potential. The lack of true horror, generic romance, and insufficient exploration of its themes left me wanting more. The ending, however, was satisfying and helped elevate my overall impression of the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 / 5"

            "Set in Winston, Pennsylvania, this story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of several babies, replaced only by bundles of sticks or ice. Rumors suggest the involvement of the enigmatic Lord of the Woods (LotW), and those who seek the missing children never return. Leah Jones, a teenager who is skeptical of the LotW's existence but longs for freedom from babysitting her brother, Owen, finds her wish granted when he vanishes. Driven by guilt, she embarks on a treacherous quest into LotW's territory—a journey notorious for its fatal consequences. While the romance element is present, it feels underdeveloped and lacks the depth necessary to enhance the overall narrative. The pacing is steady, yet the story lacks unexpected twists or surprises, leading to a predictable resolution that diminishes suspense and excitement.",

The pacing was just right, keeping me engaged throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a captivating read with a unique blend of gothic and mysterious elements. The plot was engaging, the characters were interesting (though their youth was a slight adjustment), and the revelations at the end were surprising. It’s a great choice for fans of gothic stories with a touch of fantasy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The novel presents a wholesome yet dark plot centered around the upbringing of right and wrong in a deeply religious setting.  \n   - It explores various beliefs and cults, creating a rich and layered narrative.  \n\n- **Symbolism and Metaphors:**  \n   - The title carries a metaphoric meaning that resonates throughout the story.  \n   - The recurring theme of idolization and fear of drowning is skillfully woven into the narrative. A notable quote captures this: *“It’s so easy to trust a beautiful thing, to let yourself go deeper and deeper until you take a breath and realise all the oxygen has been sucked out and you’re suffocating.”*  \n\n- **Religious and Philosophical Undertones:**  \n   - The novel delves into religious themes, as highlighted by the quote: *“All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good; not even one. Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive. The venom of asps is under their lips… There is no fear of god before their eyes.”*  \n   - These elements add depth and provoke thought about morality and faith.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel masterfully blends a wholesome yet dark narrative with profound religious and philosophical undertones. Its use of symbolism, particularly around drowning and idolization, adds layers of meaning that enhance the story. The exploration of morality, faith, and human nature makes it a compelling and thought-provoking read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Romance:** The romance between the main character and the Lord of the Wood felt rushed and underdeveloped, more like a subplot than a central element. It had potential but didn’t fully deliver.  \n- **Cover Design:** The cover was exceptional and visually appealing.  \n- **Revenge Element:** The revenge aspect at the end was enjoyable and added a satisfying layer to the story.  \n- **Plot Twists:** The reveal of Owen’s true parents was surprising and well-executed, though the heinous treatment of young women by the town was somewhat predictable.  \n- **Character Development (Ghost Maria):** Maria’s story was a standout element, compelling and intriguing, and it kept me engaged throughout the book.  \n- **Character Decisions (Leah):** Leah’s decision to return to the town felt unrealistic and didn’t align with what I would have done in her situation.  \n- **World-Building (Plant Roots):** The concept of plant roots holding memories was magical and one of the most captivating aspects of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was pleasant and had several strong elements, such as Maria’s story and the magical concept of memory-holding roots. However, the rushed romance and Leah’s questionable decision-making held it back from being truly great. The revenge twist and surprising reveals added depth, but some aspects felt underdeveloped or predictable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I was completely obsessed with the tone and the atmosphere while reading.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The ideas presented in the story were mostly quite strong. The plot had a mystery and intrigue that I thoroughly enjoyed. Additionally, the emotional development of the plot was both painful and cathartic.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The major flaw, in my opinion, was the lack of depth in the characters and their chemistry. Everyone outside of Leah felt fairly one-dimensional and bland.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance between Leah and Tristan fell very flat, which was disappointing given the potential of their dynamic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel excels in its writing style, atmosphere, and emotional depth, but it falls short in character development and the execution of the romance subplot.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5 ✩"

However, it turned out to be quite different from what I anticipated. It wasn’t scary horror at all, and it included a romance element that I wasn’t expecting. Additionally, I was surprised to find out it was a Young Adult (YA) novel, which I hadn’t anticipated either.  \n- **Adaptability and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the initial mismatch in expectations, I quickly adjusted my mindset and ended up having a good time with the book. I was able to enjoy it for what it was, even though it wasn’t what I had originally thought it would be.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book didn’t meet my initial expectations of being a scary horror story, I was pleasantly surprised by its unexpected romance and YA elements. Once I adjusted my expectations, I found the book enjoyable and had a good experience reading it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.80/3.90, rounded up to 4."

While it echoes the 80s classic, the story offers a fresh and unique twist that keeps readers engaged.",

The reviewer finds this comparison infuriating and unconvincing, as the antagonist lacks the necessary menace or complexity to justify the trope.\n\n- **Marketing and Expectations:**  \n  The reviewer expresses frustration with the book's marketing, particularly the use of *Labyrinth* as a selling point. The cover art and title are also criticized for misleading readers into expecting a more compelling story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book fails to deliver on its promising premise and marketing, offering a generic and poorly executed YA story with weak character development and an unconvincing romantic subplot.

            "After Leah ventures into the woods to find the missing child, the suspense and mystery quickly dissipate. The revelation that the Lord of the Woods is merely a teenager diminishes the sense of threat, making the plot predictable. The middle of the novel shifts focus to healing self-hatred through romance, which feels disconnected from the initial horror setup. The mystery surrounding the girls who came before Leah fails to maintain the suspense, and the world loses its edge once the woods' threat is removed.",
            "Leah's journey lacks genuine challenges and stakes. Once the Lord of the Woods is revealed to be a sympathetic boy, her success becomes inevitable, diminishing any sense of urgency or tension. The plot twist regarding reproductive rights, though significant, feels tacked on and is introduced only in the final 30 pages, leaving the middle of the novel feeling aimless.",
            "The world of The Lord feels desolate and neglected. Although there are at least a couple dozen characters present, Leah only engages with three, resulting in a lack of scale and depth. What begins as an oppressive and suspenseful atmosphere ultimately diminishes, leaving the environment feeling flat and uninviting.",
            "The first 50 pages of the book were genuinely suspenseful, with the oppressive presence of the Lord of the Woods looming over the town. Leah's self-hatred, guilt, and loss of self-worth contributed to a tragic atmosphere that drew me in. I picked up this book due to my recent fascination with folk horror, ghost stories, and American gothic tales. The cover art and blurb promised a rich folk horror experience, which I eagerly anticipated. Unfortunately, the story shifted into a YA romance, straying from the haunting atmosphere I had hoped for."

I love ghost stories, creepy folk tales, and American gothic horror. The cover art and blurb promised folk horror, which I have an endless hunger for.\n   - However, the book didn’t meet my expectations. It turned into a YA romance rather than maintaining the folk horror atmosphere I was hoping for.\n\n- **Initial Engagement and Suspense:**\n   - The first 50 pages were genuinely suspenseful. The presence of the Lord of the Woods hanging over the town was oppressive, and Leah’s self-hatred, guilt, and loss of self-worth added to the tragic atmosphere.\n   - The initial setup was promising, and I was drawn into the story.\n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**\n   - After Leah goes into the woods to find the child that was taken, the suspense and mystery disappear. The Lord of the Woods is revealed to be just a teenager, which removes the sense of threat and suspense.\n   - The plot becomes predictable, and the middle part of the novel focuses on healing self-hatred through romance, which feels disconnected from the initial horror setup.\n   - The mystery of the girls who came before Leah isn’t enough to sustain the suspense, and the world loses its teeth once the threat of the woods is gone.\n\n- **World-Building and Atmosphere:**\n   - The Lord’s world feels empty and abandoned. Despite there being at least a couple dozen people there, Leah only interacts with three, and there’s no sense of scale or depth to the world.\n   - The atmosphere that was initially oppressive and suspenseful fades, leaving the world feeling flat and unengaging.\n\n- **Character Development and Stakes:**\n   - Leah’s journey lacks real challenges or stakes. Once the Lord of the Woods is revealed to be a sympathetic boy, there’s no question about whether she will succeed, which removes any sense of urgency or tension.\n   - The plot twist about reproductive rights, while important, feels tacked on and only revealed in the last 30 pages, making the middle part of the novel feel aimless.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - If you’re looking for a YA romance that comments on current issues, you might enjoy this book. However, if you’re seeking folk horror, atmosphere, and suspense, this book will likely disappoint.\n   - The book had potential but ultimately fell flat for me, especially as someone who was looking for a strong folk horror experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book started with promise, it failed to deliver on its initial suspense and horror elements, devolving into a predictable YA romance with a lackluster world and stakes. It may appeal to readers looking for a light romance with social commentary, but it falls short for those seeking a gripping folk horror tale.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a rating of around 2.5 to 3 out of 5, given the disappointment with the genre shift and lack of sustained suspense."

It could have been expanded to enhance the narrative tension and character development.\n   - The residents of the wood and the idea of memories as ghosts are intriguing elements that could have been explored more deeply.\n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**\n   - The novel delves into powerful themes such as religious trauma, bodily autonomy, and societal pressures on women, particularly through the lens of faith.\n   - The mix of mythology and Christianity, especially the symbolism of baptism through the river, is well-utilized and adds depth to the story.\n   - The exploration of these themes is timely and heartbreaking, making the narrative resonate on a deeper level.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - The story is a quick read, which works well for its pacing.\n   - Some elements, such as the time difference and certain character arcs, feel rushed or underdeveloped, leaving room for further exploration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this is a compelling and darkly beautiful folk horror tale that effectively explores themes of religious trauma, societal expectations, and bodily autonomy. While certain elements, such as character development and world-building, could have been expanded, the story remains engaging and emotionally impactful. The tender moments between Leah and Tristan, along with the rich thematic exploration, make this a memorable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

The cover, featuring a wide-eyed girl with a bloody handprint over her breasts and surrounded by barely-glimpsed skulls, was incredibly eye-catching and sent a wicked shiver down my spine.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The book is very slow-paced at times, with long stretches where almost nothing seems to happen. Leah, the protagonist, spends a significant portion of the novel on domestic chores and trying to compose a song for the Lord of the Wood. The plot reveals itself in frustratingly small increments, through murky memories, Leah’s tortured imagination, and her visions of suicide.  \n\n- **Characterization and Mystery:**  \n  Leah is a girl burdened by a secret shame, which remains hidden for the majority of the novel. The Lord of the Wood is an enigmatic figure whose cryptic answers often infuriate Leah and left me equally frustrated, wondering what he wasn’t revealing.  \n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel is steeped in water imagery, with descriptions of Leah submerging herself in rivers, lounging in baths, and conversing with waterlogged ghosts. The story delves into themes of patriarchal oppression, spiritual salvation, and bodily purity, as Leah uncovers the truth about the missing girls and their children. The horror of the forest community’s secrets is gradually revealed, culminating in a chilling reminder of the rot that lies beneath the surface of quaint towns.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Resolution:**  \n  Leah’s misery stems from the toxic messages ingrained in her since childhood, and her journey to uncover the truth is both harrowing and compelling. As the forest community rallies around her, the layers of mystery are peeled back, and the horror swells to engulf both Leah and the reader.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s slow pacing and cryptic revelations can be frustrating, the atmospheric writing, strong themes, and eventual emotional payoff make it a compelling read.
