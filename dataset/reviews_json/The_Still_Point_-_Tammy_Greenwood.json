            "I adore the author’s work and have read everything she’s written. A master storyteller, she draws on her experience as the mother of a ballet dancer in this book. While it centers on the world of dance, its themes of competition and the lengths we go for our children resonate with everyone, making it an enjoyable read for all.",
            "In this story, the dancers frequently face both physical and mental breakdowns, teetering on the edge of abuse. I appreciated the strong character development; each dancer is compelling and well-defined, with insightful chapters showcasing their perspectives. The narrative highlights the sacrifices that dancers and mothers make for their craft, making it an emotional and powerful read.",
            "As a child, I danced, but not ballet. I took tap dance lessons—winning a gold medal—and also studied jazz. We performed at care homes, and I was a majorette in parades. However, I don't recall the competitive atmosphere depicted in this book; we danced purely for enjoyment, not for scholarships or professional aspirations. When I discovered boys, I quit dancing, much to my mom's initial disappointment, but she soon accepted it when I joined an ice hockey team and became a power forward.",
            "I found the exploration of ballet both intriguing and informative."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This novel is a deeply emotional and character-driven exploration of the sacrifices made by dancers and their mothers in the pursuit of success. The author's storytelling, rooted in her personal experience, brings authenticity and depth to the narrative. While the story delves into the darker aspects of competition and ambition, it also offers a fascinating insight into the world of ballet. It’s a powerful read that resonates even for those unfamiliar with dance.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Personal Connection and Background:**  \n  I did dance as a kid but not ballet. I tapped danced (even managed to win a gold medal) and took jazz lessons. We used to perform for care homes, and I was a majorette in parades as well. I don't remember the mothers or the other dance kids behaving the way they did in this book. But we danced for fun, not for scholarships or to become professionals. I remember when I discovered boys (or they discovered me), I quit. My mom was disappointed but quickly got over it when I joined an ice hockey team and became a power forward.\n\n- **Author's Expertise and Storytelling:**  \n  I love Tammy Greenwood's books and have read everything she has ever written. She is a master storyteller and tells this one from experience, as her daughter is a ballet dancer. You don't have to be a dancer to enjoy this one because it is basically about competition and the lengths we go through for our kids and to win.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The dancers in this story physically and mentally break down often. It borders on abuse. I loved how character-driven this was, and what a bunch of characters they are. The reader gets to know them well through chapters from each character's point of view. What I really took away from this is what dancers and mothers sacrifice for their craft, and because of that, I found this such an emotional and powerful read.\n\n- **Educational Value and Intrigue:**  \n  I learned a lot about ballet and found it intriguing and interesting as well.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply emotional and character-driven exploration of the sacrifices made by dancers and their mothers in the pursuit of success. Tammy Greenwood's storytelling, rooted in her personal experience, brings authenticity and depth to the narrative. While the story delves into the darker aspects of competition and ambition, it also offers a fascinating insight into the world of ballet.

While there are dance moms, the chaotic drama of the Lifetime TV series is thankfully absent.  \n   - The writing style is mildly reminiscent of Celeste Ng but reminded me more of Liane Moriarty.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - The novel is very character-driven, exploring the complexities of mother-daughter relationships in the high-pressure world of competitive ballet.  \n   - I loved these flawed women and found their struggles relatable and realistic.  \n   - The conflicts were quieter but deeply relatable: one mother deals with grief and financial troubles, another with a distant daughter and a shaky marriage, and another who should be worried about many things.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - Not a lot happens in the book, and the drama is pretty mellow until the end. Even then, I was never truly shocked or scandalized—but that’s okay.  \n   - The quieter conflicts felt realistic and kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Genre and Niche Appeal:**  \n   - I’ll read almost any fictional story set in the ballet world, and after several disappointments, *The Still Point* is officially my favorite in this niche genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Still Point* is a beautifully written, character-driven novel that explores the complexities of mother-daughter relationships within the competitive ballet world.

Eliot poem. This adds depth and a poetic connection to the story.  \n\n- **Author’s Expertise and Authenticity:**  \n   - Tammy Greenwood, a dance mom, demonstrates an in-depth understanding of the pre-professional ballet world, which resonates throughout the novel. Her personal connection to the subject matter enhances the authenticity of the story.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n   - The novel is a domestic drama with a hint of thriller, focusing on competition among three young dancers and their mothers for a full scholarship to the Ballet de Paris Academie. It explores themes of ambition, relationships, and the complexities of the ballet world.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Greenwood avoids stereotypical portrayals of dance moms and daughters, instead creating rich, realistic characters. The interactions and dynamics feel genuine and engaging.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending strikes a perfect balance—neither overly wrapped-up nor too open-ended, leaving readers satisfied.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n   - The book is described as “Dance Moms meets *Little Fires Everywhere*.” Fans of Celeste Ng’s *Little Fires Everywhere* and Megan Abbott’s *You Will Know Me* (which explores similar competitive themes in gymnastics) will likely enjoy this novel.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - As a ballet lover and adult ballet student, I thoroughly enjoyed *The Still Point* and would highly recommend it to fellow ballet enthusiasts.

            "The book failed to deliver the promised backstabbing and high-stakes drama. The ending's revelations were underwhelming, lacking the impact needed to alter character dynamics or incite extreme actions. The tone remained overly civil, with most characters, including the teens, acting reasonably even in the face of dislike. This absence of conflict rendered the story bland and devoid of tension.",

While this approach offers valuable insights into the relationships within and outside the dance studio, most characters, aside from Ever and Josie, come across as rather bland. Josie, the ambitious mother who believes her daughter deserves the best, stands out as the most compelling character. Her perspective, especially her rationalizations for her daughter's sacrifices in ballet, is particularly intriguing. The narrative would have benefited from additional viewpoints from the teens, like Olive or Savvy, to heighten the tension and create a more balanced portrayal of the dynamics at play.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Authenticity of Dance Representation:**\n   - I was thrilled to win this ARC because I grew up dancing and always reach for books about dance. I can be critical when dance is featured in books, as it’s hard to capture the nuances without lived experience. However, knowing Tammy Greenwood is a ballet mom herself made me trust her portrayal, and that trust was well-placed. This is the most accurate depiction of pre-professional dance I’ve ever read. It wasn’t just about naming ballets or steps; it captured the little details like nasty toe pads, custom Yumiko leos, and the iconic pointe shoe poster everyone had as their screensaver. The descriptions of how dance *feels* in the body were so close to my own experiences. Ballet is beautiful and brutal, and Greenwood captured it all with masterful precision.\n\n- **Themes of Desire, Jealousy, and Ambition:**\n   - The book delves into desire, jealousy, and ambition, which are major parts of the dance world. These themes were explored with depth and realism, reflecting the competitive and emotionally charged nature of the industry.\n\n- **Exploration of Consent:**\n   - Consent is a huge issue in dance, and this book addresses it thoughtfully. Bea’s observation that dancers’ success is based on how well they do *what they’re told to do* with their bodies resonated deeply. The book highlights how physical boundaries can become murky in dance, especially with younger authority figures in the industry. I appreciated the discussions of consent, both with the daughters and the moms, and hope more dance books tackle this issue in the future.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters are incredibly well-fleshed out, even the peripheral ones. We get POV chapters from the three moms and the main daughter, Bea, but even the non-POV daughters like Savvy (who is HORRID) have clearly defined personalities. Side characters like Etienne, Lotte, Vivienne, Melissa, Bob, and Owen also felt vibrant and real. The studio felt alive and full of drama, though it was more of a simmer than the explosive drama of *Dance Moms*.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - The short chapters were a strength, each leaving you with a question that kept you reading. The stakes steadily rose, and everything boiled over during Nutcracker hell week (because when else would it all blow up?). While there were no mind-blowing twists, the story felt realistic and kept me fully engaged. I never wanted to put it down and had to resist reading too fast to avoid missing details.\n\n- **Comparisons to *Dance Moms*:**\n   - The blurb compares the book to *Dance Moms*, and while the drama is present, it’s more of a slow burn. Secrets are revealed gradually, and the tension builds naturally. The relationships and dynamics felt authentic, and I couldn’t help but draw parallels to the show (e.g., Ever & Bea as Christi & Chloe, Lindsay & Olive as Kelly & Paige, etc.).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a masterful portrayal of the ballet world, capturing its beauty, brutality, and complexity with precision. The themes of ambition, jealousy, and consent are handled with care, and the characters are vividly drawn. The pacing and structure kept me hooked from start to finish. I adored every word and will definitely be reading more of Tammy Greenwood’s work.

            "The story centers on three women—Ever, Lindsay, and Josie—and their daughters, Bea, Olive, and Savvy, who are students at a local ballet school. The arrival of a French director and cinematographer to film a documentary about the annual Nutcracker performance ignites fierce competition, especially with the enticing prospect of a scholarship to a prestigious French Ballet Academy. The narrative is rich with drama, as each character grapples with significant personal challenges. Told from both the mothers’ and daughters’ perspectives, the story gains depth, though the relentless tension can be exhausting at times. Additionally, the subplot involving Bea’s summer bonfire incident feels overly drawn out and could have been resolved more succinctly.",

This book excels in that area, maintaining a tasteful level of drama, though I felt it could have been a touch more intense. Additionally, it explores profound themes such as death, loss, the transition from childhood to adulthood, love, and retribution, elevating it beyond a simple ballet competition narrative."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Theme and Genre:**  \n  - I love novels that deal with competition, especially those that explore the back-stabbing dynamics among competitors, teachers, and parents. This book fits perfectly into that category and kept the drama in good taste, though it could have been a bit more intense in that regard.  \n  - The novel also delves into deeper themes like death, loss, the transition from childhood to adulthood, love, and retribution, making it more than just a story about a ballet competition.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - While the story can bog down in certain spots, there’s a compelling quality to it that keeps you engaged and eager to see how it ends.  \n  - The inclusion of red herrings and surprises adds an element of mystery, which I found satisfying.  \n\n- **Setting and Authenticity:**  \n  - The book is set in the 1970s, and it’s important to be aware of the cultural and societal differences of that time period.  \n  - The glossary of ballet terms at the back of the book is a helpful addition, especially for readers unfamiliar with ballet terminology.  \n\n- **Recommendations:**  \n  - If you enjoy books about ballet and the behind-the-scenes drama, I recommend *Ballerina: A Novel*, which shares similar themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling read for fans of competitive dramas and ballet-themed stories. While it occasionally slows down, its exploration of complex themes and surprising twists keeps you hooked. The 1970s setting and ballet glossary add depth and authenticity to the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The dynamics between the dancers and their moms felt very real and believable, though maybe just a bit exaggerated. The realistic, emotionally charged depiction of the ballet world was a highlight for me.\n\n- **Writing Style and Prose:**  \n  Tammy Greenwood’s prose and writing style are beautiful. Her storytelling is effortless and captivating, making the book a joy to read.\n\n- **Character Development and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book moves quickly between 6 perspectives, which was slightly overwhelming at first. However, Greenwood moves effortlessly between characters while still developing an individual voice for each woman that truly captures her personality. This structure allowed for new connections between characters that wouldn’t have been possible with a single perspective or longer chapters. I think this is a very difficult thing to do well in a novel, but this was a wonderful example!\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author Appeal:**  \n  I absolutely loved this book and am eager to check out other titles by Tammy Greenwood after enjoying this one so much. The combination of the ballet world’s depiction and Greenwood’s storytelling made it a memorable read.\n\n- **Gratitude for the Giveaway:**  \n  I was thrilled to win a copy of this book through Goodreads giveaways! Thank you to Kensington Books and Goodreads for offering the giveaway.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations with its realistic portrayal of the ballet world, beautiful prose, and skillful handling of multiple perspectives. Tammy Greenwood’s storytelling is both effortless and captivating, making this a standout read.

            "This novel is rich in drama, featuring marital issues, flirtations, and power struggles among the parents. Josie believes she has an edge since Etienne lives in her guesthouse, which heightens the conflict. The surrounding drama involving the dancers and their families is seamlessly woven into the narrative, maintaining engagement. Centered on mothers and one father connected through a ballet conservatory, the story delves into their daughters' intense ballet training, exploring themes of ambition, rivalry, and family dynamics, particularly among the mothers invested in their daughters' success. A key subplot involves the arrival of professional dancer Etienne Bernay, who will direct the winter show and award a scholarship to the top student, amplifying the competition. Despite a large cast, the story is easy to follow, and the pacing keeps readers absorbed. The inclusion of a documentary being filmed adds an intriguing meta-layer to the narrative.",

Meanwhile, Lindsay, mother to Olivia (B’s former best friend), grapples with suspicions of her husband’s infidelity while competing for a scholarship for her own daughter. Unfortunately, B's character lacks depth, marked by unrealistic inner thoughts about Savvy, who also fails to stand out as a compelling figure.",

This authenticity added depth to the novel’s portrayal of the ballet world.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Writing Quality:**\n   - The novel is well-written, with a mix of lovable and unlikable characters.

            "The book's structure, featuring sections titled Acts, Scenes, and Closing Curtain, cleverly aligns with its ballet theme. The narrative unfolds through the alternating perspectives of four characters: Bea, her mother Ever, Lindsay, and Josie. The story opens with immediate suspense, drawing me in from the start; however, the pacing slows significantly by the end of the first third. Thankfully, it picks up again in the second and final thirds. Some unnecessary details and instances of telling rather than showing occasionally disrupt the flow. Additionally, a minor plotline feels unresolved, adding to the confusion. On a positive note, unexpected twists kept me guessing, and I was surprised by how wrong my predictions turned out to be. The ending was well-crafted—messy, semi-open-ended, and fitting for the novel’s tone.",

            "The novel elegantly explores the complex dynamics between mothers and daughters through the lens of ballet. Mothers such as Ever, Lindsay, and Josie are portrayed as tenacious and supportive figures, their hands representing both the physical and emotional labor involved in nurturing their daughters' aspirations. Meanwhile, the daughters—Bea, Olive, and Savvy—navigate the harsh realities of competitive ballet, their struggles often masked by the grace of their performances.",

Beatrice (Bea) was once best friends with Olive, who is now close with Savvy (Savanah). Bea's mother, Ever, a writer and writing teacher, is coping with the loss of her husband, Ethan, from a year ago.

Olive’s mother, Lindsay, works in real estate and battles fluctuating weight, believing it affects her marriage. Unfortunately, some characters, particularly Lindsay, feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. For instance, her lack of understanding about her body is presented in an exaggerated, unrealistic manner.",

            "The story centers on three ballet mothers and their daughters, delving into the tensions and rivalries that arise as they compete for a coveted scholarship at a prestigious Parisian ballet company. The characters are flawed and competitive, which complicates their friendships and leads to rifts fueled by their singular focus on ballet. Some characters, such as Josie and Savvy, lack depth and come across as one-dimensional villains. Olive, one of the main characters, is difficult to relate to, while Bea's motivations and the influence of her grief on her actions could have been explored more thoroughly.",
            "Set against the backdrop of Costa del la Luna, a fire-ravaged region of North America, this book uses the bushfire as a metaphor for the characters' turmoil and competitiveness. While the world-building isn't as expansive as in the author's previous work, *Such A Pretty Girl*, the writing effectively conveys the intensity and pain of ballet, exemplified by lines like, “It was like the exquisite pain of being en pointe, the agony of muscles stretched to their limits.”",

It prompts ballet mothers to reflect on their motivations and assess their resilience in such a competitive environment. While the story is enjoyable, it lacks depth in character development."

While it captures the ephemeral beauty of ballet and uses vivid metaphors, the character development and world-building fall short compared to the author’s previous work. It’s a thought-provoking read for those interested in the ballet world, but it leaves some aspects underdeveloped.",

While the 'snobby rich bully vs. deserving but financially struggling protagonist' trope isn’t particularly fresh, it is executed well enough to maintain engagement. However, I lowered my rating to 4 stars due to several underdeveloped characters, which made it challenging to keep track of their connections.",
            "Bea, the protagonist, is refreshingly flawed, displaying poor behavior at times that adds depth to her character. Her eventual redemption arc further enhances her complexity. Savvy, the mean girl, embodies the snobby rich bully trope, and her storyline feels somewhat clichéd, culminating in a cryptic message about karma. In contrast, Ever shines as a consistently strong character throughout the book, serving as a bright spot in the narrative.",

It’s a compelling read for fans of character-driven stories and those with a connection to dance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It may fade into the background over time, or it could linger in my mind in unexpected ways—only time will tell. *The Still Point* centers on three mothers—Ever, Lindsay, and Josie—of teenage ballerinas at a prestigious conservatory.

Their internal thoughts often contrast with their outward actions, revealing motivations deeply rooted in their personal histories. The challenges they confront seem overwhelming, yet the depth and nuance of the story make it profoundly relatable.",

The portrayal of the dance studio family, Nutcracker season, and the emotional end of this life chapter felt incredibly personal and nostalgic.  \n\n- **Shift in Relatability:**  \n  As the story progressed, it veered into elements I couldn’t relate to, such as the hotshot teacher from Paris, the documentary, and the potential scholarship. While these aspects were engaging, they felt distant from my own experiences.  \n\n- **Narrative Tone and Genre Shifts:**  \n  The story took a turn into soap opera-like drama, which was entertaining but further removed from my reality. Finally, it landed in a place of “hope I can never relate,” which added an intriguing layer of contrast to the earlier personal connections.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Emotional Impact:**  \n  Despite the shifts in relatability and tone, every transition was fun and kept me engaged.

While the idea was good and the author's writing style is strong, the plot didn't fully meet my expectations. I anticipated more dramatic or \"crazy\" actions from the ballet moms, given how intensely involved they can be in their children's careers, but the events felt somewhat \"childish\" instead.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  I appreciated the exploration of mother-daughter relationships, particularly how they varied across different families. The role of fathers and their unique approaches to situations were also well-portrayed and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth:**  \n  The portrayal of grief was handled quite well, with some parts being particularly moving and impactful.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The story maintained my interest throughout and didn’t feel boring, which is a testament to the author's skill with words.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its strengths, such as strong character dynamics and emotional depth, it fell short in delivering the dramatic or intense moments I had hoped for. Overall, it was an engaging read, but I wish it had pushed the boundaries a bit more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
