            "Leonora, the impulsive protagonist, often presents repetitive inner thoughts, leaving her a neutral figure for readers—neither loved nor hated. The story is a coming-of-age narrative focused on her quest for identity, a genre that may not resonate with all readers, yet it is executed reasonably well. However, some female characters are poorly developed in the first half, although a particularly disliked plot point is resolved satisfactorily by the conclusion. The secondary characters lack depth, which diminishes reader investment and enjoyment. Additionally, the romance feels forced and lacks chemistry, with the development of the relationship coming across as unclear and unconvincing.",
            "The story starts off unevenly, with frequent shifts between past and present that disrupt the narrative flow. However, the writing improves significantly in the second half as the story gains momentum. While it shows signs of being a debut, it is still more polished than some popular works, such as *Fourth Wing*.",
            "The book's strongest aspect is its world-building, featuring rich depictions of indigenous myths and daily life, including cultural elements like food. The use of Spanish without automatic translation enhances authenticity. However, while the world is well-developed, the explanations can feel clunky due to awkward transitions.",
            "This novel presents a captivating premise, reimagining Zorro with a fantasy twist set in sixteenth-century Mexico during the Spanish colonization. The story follows Leonora, an 18-year-old noblewoman who can transform into a panther, using her powers to combat colonial injustices."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Sun of Blood and Ruin* is a decent debut novel with a unique premise and strong world-building, making it a refreshing read in the fantasy genre. However, it suffers from typical debut flaws, including uneven writing, underdeveloped secondary characters, and a lackluster romance. Despite these issues, it shows promise, and I am interested in seeing how the story progresses in future works.",

            "The story suffers from a confusing array of names, characters, and ideas, resulting in a lack of coherent narrative. The plot meanders aimlessly, with random characters briefly taking center stage before disappearing. The conflict between the Spanish, Mexicans, and other minorities is muddled, making it difficult to grasp who is fighting whom and why. The introduction of magical elements, such as Pantera's sorcery, feels underdeveloped and only adds to the overall confusion. Rather than being entertaining, the story is frustrating, with exciting events that lack clear purpose or connection to the main narrative. The twists are uninspired and fail to provide meaningful depth. Ultimately, the chaotic structure and incoherence make the book a chore to read.",

The secondary characters are introduced early on but remain underdeveloped, making it difficult to connect with them. While the dialogue is serviceable, it fails to engage, and the relationships between characters feel superficial. The only genuine connection is between Leonora and her lady maid, Ines.",

            "Initially, the first half of the book felt like a standard Chosen One YA novel, complete with a one-dimensional Strong Female Protagonist. I was ready to dismiss it entirely. However, the second half redeemed the story. It transformed into a more mature narrative as Leonora shed her princess-like demeanor, faced genuine life-and-death challenges, and underwent significant character growth by the end.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed how the author integrated Nahua mythology into this alternate historical fantasy. The use of Nahuatl and Spanish added authenticity, and I appreciated that the author trusted readers to engage with these elements without excessive explanation. This aspect was my favorite part of the book.",
            "As someone who appreciates fantasy novels that tackle themes of colonialism, I found this story particularly engaging. Leonora, a mestiza character, skillfully navigates both her worlds, revealing their strengths and flaws. The exploration of social stratification and the governance of New Spain adds depth to the narrative, making it a compelling read.",
            "To fully appreciate this book, a basic understanding of colonialism in Latin America is essential. Without prior knowledge, my enjoyment of the story would likely have diminished.",

Trust me, I've read much worse.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The first half read like a typical Chosen One YA novel with a cardboard Strong Female Protagonist, and I was about to dismiss the entire thing. However, the second half redeemed the book for me. It finally felt like an adult book because Leonora stopped acting like a princess, there were actual life-and-death situations, and Leonora experienced significant character growth by the end.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  I’m probably a bit biased because I enjoy any fantasy novel that explores colonialism. With Leonora being a mestiza character, we get to see her navigate both worlds, showcasing the best and worst of each. The book delves into topics like social stratification and New Spain's style of government, which I found compelling.  \n\n- **Cultural and Historical Depth:**  \n  I loved how the author wove Nahua mythology into this alternate historical fantasy story. The inclusion of Nahuatl and Spanish added authenticity, and I appreciated that the author didn’t hold the reader’s hand when it came to these elements. This was my favorite part of the book.  \n\n- **Reader’s Background and Engagement:**  \n  Reading through the reviews, I feel like some familiarity with the basics of colonialism in Latin America is necessary to fully appreciate this book. If I hadn’t had some prior knowledge, I probably wouldn’t have enjoyed it as much.  \n\n- **Potential for Sequel:**  \n  If the first half hadn’t felt so YA, this could easily have been a 4-star read for me. I might be interested in picking up the sequel when it comes out, but I’ll have to see.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the first half of the book leaned heavily into YA tropes, the second half delivered a more mature and engaging narrative with strong themes of colonialism, cultural identity, and character growth. The inclusion of Nahua mythology and authentic language use added depth, though some prior knowledge of Latin American colonialism may be necessary to fully appreciate the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded up.  \n\nThank you to Harper Voyager and NetGalley for this ARC."

            "Set against the backdrop of sixteenth-century Spain's invasion of Mexico, this novel explores themes of political unrest and oppression. The story centers on Pantera, a secret vigilante, and Lady Leonora, who are two facets of the same person living dual lives. At the heart of the plot is an ancient Nahua prophecy foretelling the world's destruction, which Pantera/Leonora must confront. The opening chapters are engaging, blending action, magic, and poignant moments. However, the pacing is inconsistent, with some chapters dragging while others rush by. The transformation scenes into Leonora’s nagual form are captivating but warrant deeper exploration.",
            "Pantera/Leonora is a multifaceted character navigating the challenges of dual identities as both a vigilante and a noblewoman. While her journey is intriguing, it would benefit from greater depth and personality. The portrayal of Leonora's struggles with her mixed heritage and the societal constraints on women is particularly well-executed.",
            "This novel immerses readers in Nahua mythology and magic, showcasing characters who harness their tonalli (life force) for various powers. Leonora's training with Master Toto offers a deep exploration of the spiritual and philosophical dimensions of Nahua beliefs. The use of Spanish dialects and Nahuatl languages enhances the story's authenticity, although the pacing can be uneven at times.",
            "The novel delves deeply into the theme of hidden identities, with many side characters also concealing their true selves. It powerfully addresses the impacts of colonialism, oppression, and war, while highlighting the constraints faced by women and the rejection of indigenous identity."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Sun of Blood and Ruin by the author is a richly detailed historical fantasy that combines authentic mythology with a compelling dual-life narrative. While the character of Pantera/Leonora is engaging, she could benefit from more depth. The novel excels in its exploration of themes like identity, colonialism, and oppression, and its rich world-building. However, the pacing issues and the underdeveloped transformation scenes slightly detract from the overall experience. Fans of Zorro and historical fantasy will find much to enjoy in this debut.",

It skillfully balances dark subjects with lighter moments, resulting in a layered and immersive narrative. The fierce depiction of women battling patriarchy, along with the focus on powerful friendships and unexpected alliances, adds both depth and emotional resonance to the story."

            "The pacing of the novel was erratic, especially in the first half. The buildup to Leonora and Martín’s wedding was abruptly resolved in just one page, leaving the plot feeling aimless. Transitions between scenes, such as from the wedding to the dungeon, were jarring and poorly executed. The story lacked cohesion, with key events feeling rushed and underdeveloped. Several plot points relied on unrealistic conveniences, like a distant scream that distracts the guards long enough for Leonora to escape unnoticed. Martín’s public confession as a means to avoid the wedding was flawed and inadequately explained. Additionally, Nabarres’ decision not to kill Leonora, despite his obsession with capturing the Pantera, was inconsistent with his character.",
            "Leonora's motivations were inconsistent and overly complex, shifting eleven times throughout the novel without clear justification. Her character arc, especially regarding her relationship with the Pantera alter-ego, was poorly executed. Her sudden fear of dying in battle, followed by a quick reversal, felt unearned and confusing. Key moments of character growth, such as her decision to spare Captain Nabarres, were glossed over, making her development feel abrupt and unconvincing.

Key scenes, like her confrontations with Nabarres and the guards, lose their impact due to excessive exposition.

            "The plot was disjointed and difficult to follow, making it hard to keep track of the events and characters. The pacing felt uneven, particularly toward the end, which led me to skim the last 40% out of disinterest.",
            "Leonora, the protagonist, comes across as one-dimensional, which hinders the reader's ability to connect with her or invest in her journey.",

The disjointed narrative and forced dialogue made it difficult to stay engaged, leading to disappointment despite high initial expectations.",

I loved how the folklore was woven into the story, as it added depth and made an otherwise boring plot more interesting.  \n\n- **Language and Cultural Representation:**  \n  I appreciated the use of Spanish throughout the book, which added authenticity and cultural richness to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Leonora, the protagonist, felt very one-dimensional. Her lack of depth made it hard to connect with her or care about her journey.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was disjointed and hard to follow. I struggled to keep track of what was happening and who was involved in which events. The pacing also felt off, especially toward the end, where I ended up skimming the last 40% because I lost interest.  \n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  The dialogue felt forced and choppy, which made the interactions between characters feel unnatural and less engaging.  \n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**  \n  The theme of colonialism was underdeveloped. While Cortés was portrayed as a villain who brought smallpox, the exploration of this theme felt superficial and lacked depth.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The book was not what I expected. I anticipated a gender-bent tale of Zorro with more sword fighting and action, but the story lacked these elements and fell flat overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Sun of Blood and Ruin* had promising elements, such as its rich Mesoamerican mythology and cultural representation, it ultimately failed to deliver a compelling plot, well-developed characters, or meaningful exploration of its themes. The disjointed narrative and forced dialogue made it difficult to stay engaged, leading to disappointment despite high initial expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars  \n\n*Thank you to NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review.*"

            "The author tries to tackle too many plot points within a limited page count, leading to underdeveloped storylines. The blend of historically inspired anti-colonialist rebellion and indigenous mythology with a generic prophecy and Doomsday theme lacks the depth needed to make either aspect compelling. While the final battle is thrilling and cinematic, the overall plot suffers from rushed resolutions and a lack of depth.",
            "In this story, Leonora, the protagonist, navigates a captivating double life as both a Spanish noblewoman and the shapeshifting resistance fighter known as La Pantera. While side characters like Jerónimo, Lady Amalia, and Martín show promise, their development is insufficient, often occurring off-page and feeling rushed. Additionally, the romance subplot falls flat, lacking the depth and engagement needed to make it compelling.",
            "The writing is overly simplistic, with characters often delivering lengthy monologues about their backstories and motivations at pivotal moments. The novel tends to spoon-feed basic themes, suggesting a lack of trust in the reader's ability to interpret the story.",
            "The novel presents a captivating alternative post-colonial Latin America in the 16th century, enriched by the incorporation of Aztec and Mexican culture. The contrast between Leonora's confined existence in the palace and her sense of freedom in the Mexican jungles adds depth to the narrative.",
            "The novel struggles to satisfy both historical fiction fans and fantasy enthusiasts, as it fails to fully embrace either genre. The reliance on Deus ex machina elements and overpowered characters diminishes the stakes and tension."

        "conclusion": "While *Sun of Blood and Bone* has an original and captivating setting, along with a compelling protagonist, it is hindered by oversimplistic writing, underdeveloped characters, and a rushed, overstuffed plot. The novel attempts to blend historical fiction and fantasy but falls short in delivering a satisfying experience for fans of either genre. Despite its flaws, the story shows potential for growth, earning it a three-star rating, though its current quality leans more toward two stars.",
