        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book aimed to be character-driven, but I found the narrators bland, boring, and unsympathetic. A significant portion of their development was simply told to the reader rather than shown, making it hard to care about any of them. This lack of connection was particularly problematic given the plot's reliance on character engagement.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot involved very little happening on the page, with many events mentioned as occurring off-screen. This structure could have worked if I had been more invested in the characters, but their lack of depth made the story feel unengaging and uncompelling.  \n\n- **Moral Complexity:**  \n  One of the narrators becoming a slave-owner was a major issue for me. The attempt to mitigate this by suggesting she didn’t treat her slaves horrifically did not make the situation any more palatable. This moral ambiguity was handled poorly and left me deeply uncomfortable.  \n\n- **Language and Style:**  \n  The use of random French words in the narrative was a pet peeve. Since all the main characters were already speaking French, this stylistic choice felt unnecessary and irritating, detracting from the overall reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Pelican Girls* was not poorly written, its lack of compelling characters, unengaging plot, and questionable handling of moral issues made it a disappointing read. The stylistic choice of inserting French words further detracted from the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story felt sluggish, with lengthy chapters (350 pages across 12 chapters) that made it difficult to maintain engagement. Frequent shifts in point of view and time jumps disrupted immersion, often pulling me away from a character's storyline just as I was becoming invested. I would have preferred a more focused approach, exploring the daily lives of one or two characters in greater depth rather than a series of major events over the years.",

The younger character begins as a 12-year-old, and even after 15-20 years, the notion of romance with someone known as a child remains unsettling. Additionally, the inclusion of a Native American woman's perspective was intriguing yet underutilized, receiving only a single chapter that squandered the opportunity to delve deeper into her viewpoint, particularly given the historical context.",

These women were held against their will for various reasons, including abortions, orphanhood, and minor offenses like stealing a ribbon. The author skillfully avoids moral relativism and presents the women authentically, without depicting them as unrealistic, 21st-century progressives, thereby preserving historical fidelity.",
            "The novel delves into themes of inequality, societal expectations, and the commodification of women, portrayed as merely vessels for populating the Louisiana Territory. Its historical narrative resonates powerfully with contemporary issues, rendering the story both timely and thought-provoking."

The novel’s themes remain relevant today, making it a compelling read for fans of historical fiction and women's stories.",

It provided interesting learning moments as I researched some of the non-fiction realities mentioned in the story.  \n   - I was unaware of the specific Louisiana history depicted in the book, particularly the French women sent to \"La Louisiana\" to marry and help populate the state, similar to \"les filles du roi\" in Canada.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The characters were interesting and well-crafted, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot had enough twists and turns to keep me engaged and on my toes.  \n   - However, the pacing was uneven at times, with certain sections slowing down and bogging me down. I found myself skimming more than I would have liked in those parts.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I did enjoy the book quite a bit, though not as much as I had hoped and anticipated.  \n   - Despite my minor issues, I am not sorry I read the book until the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis historical fiction novel had many elements I typically love, including well-crafted characters, an engaging plot, and fascinating historical context. However, uneven pacing and a few slow sections slightly diminished my overall enjoyment. While it didn’t fully meet my high expectations, it was still a worthwhile and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating score was mentioned in the review, but the reader initially anticipated a 5-star read."

Having visited several times, I was drawn to the story's exploration of the French settlement and the creation of New Orleans. Growing up in New England and now living in New York, much of the early settler history I learned focused on English settlers, so this book offered a fresh perspective on a lesser-known aspect of American history.  \n\n- **Narrative Perspective:**  \n  I particularly liked how the story was told from the female perspective of the French colony. This added a unique and engaging layer to the narrative. Additionally, I found it interesting that the Ursuline convent played a role in the story, as I had visited its exterior during my travels.  \n\n- **Character Development and Pacing:**  \n  I understand why some reviewers felt the characters were flat and the narrative dragged at times. However, my personal interest in this specific aspect of history kept me engaged throughout the book.  \n\n- **Complementary Reading:**  \n  The book inspired me to revisit a non-fiction book I bought on my last trip to New Orleans, which focuses on the French settlement and creation of the city. I plan to read it soon to pair with this fictional telling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel due to its rich historical context, unique female perspective, and personal connection to New Orleans.

            "The story alternates between character perspectives, which I typically enjoy. However, the significant time jumps—sometimes spanning several years—made it challenging to follow.

This made it hard to follow the story and connect with the characters.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n   - The chapters shifted between character perspectives, which I usually don’t mind, but they also included significant jumps in time—sometimes by several years. This left me reading from a character’s perspective after major life changes (like the death of a husband or children, or moving to a new place), which made the story feel disjointed and hard to follow.  \n\n- **Chapter Length:**  \n   - The chapters were incredibly long, with most being 30+ pages. This is a personal pet peeve of mine and made me less excited to read the book. Combined with the other issues, it created a frustrating reading experience.  \n\n- **Genre and Target Audience:**  \n   - Despite my struggles, I think if the above issues don’t bother you and you’re really into historical fiction, you might have a very different opinion of this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s topic and description initially intrigued me, I found it difficult to engage with due to the complexity of the characters, the disjointed narrative structure, and the excessively long chapters.

            "The first part of the novel, spanning about 150 pages, feels cumbersome due to the numerous character names, whose relevance to the plot is initially unclear. The lack of a character list and glossary for French and nautical terms adds to the challenge, particularly for readers without basic French knowledge. The plot is overly complicated, with time jumps that make it unnecessarily convoluted. \n\nThe middle section covers a decade, detailing the arrival of the ship *Baleine*, various marriages, relocations, and births. While it offers valuable insights into the women's lives, the narrative remains too intricate and could have benefited from a more straightforward chronological approach. \n\nIn contrast, the final part focuses on Pétronille, Geneviève, and their families, delivering a vivid depiction of life in the French colony between 1721 and 1734. The introduction of the indigenous character Uto’wv Eco konesel significantly enhances this section, adding depth and interest to the storyline.",
            "This novel centers on three women—Pétronille, Geneviève, and Charlotte—each grappling with unique backgrounds and challenges as they adapt to life in Louisiana. Geneviève’s vivid memories of her family’s silk farming in Provence enrich her character and lead to a satisfying conclusion. Additionally, the indigenous character Uto’wv Eco konesel adds depth to the narrative, though the back cover's focus on only the three women diminishes her importance.",

However, the absence of a glossary, character list, and additional source references undermines its credibility as a historical work. Additionally, some textual errors indicate potential editing issues, possibly stemming from an over-reliance on autocorrect.",

The lack of supplementary materials like a glossary and character list, as well as some editing issues, detract from its historical authenticity.

The use of alternating perspectives and a chronological narrative immerses readers in the characters' journeys over time, fostering a deep sense of connection and anticipation. The novel skillfully explores the complexities of female solidarity, revealing its beauty and ambiguity.",
            "In the early chapters, the author's writing style comes across as overly embellished, characterized by an excessive use of adjectives and metaphors, such as \"the muses on the ceiling offer themselves laurel crowns and violently red apples\" and \"heat spreads through Paris like water in a sinking ship.\" A more subtle and straightforward approach would have better established the atmosphere. However, this issue improved as the story progressed, with dialogue and action becoming more prominent.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n   - The novel is set in 1720 Paris and Louisiana, depicting the Salpêtrière as a place for women who don’t fit into society, including a psychiatric hospital, prison, and orphanage.  \n   - Louisiana is portrayed as a harsh, swampy environment, hot, humid, and storm-ridden, far from the idealized vision the women had.  \n   - The story provides a vivid social portrait of the time, including the displacement of Indigenous people, the beginnings of the slave trade, and the dependence of women on male settlers.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - The lives of four women—Charlotte, Étiennette, Pétronille, and Geneviève—are explored through individual storylines, each facing varying degrees of fortune or misfortune with their husbands.  \n   - Themes include tender love, infidelity, domestic violence, and abuse, but the central focus is on the friendship and sometimes tender love among the women, which could make their lives easier but often complicates them further.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n   - The author tells the story almost in images, with highly detailed individual scenes but sketchy transitions that made it difficult to follow at times.  \n   - The narrative style felt somewhat disjointed and linguistically awkward at points, which made it challenging to engage with initially.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The novel delves into the tragedies of historical developments, particularly for marginalized groups like Indigenous people, enslaved individuals, and women.  \n   - The interconnected fates of the women, who come from different cultures but share the burden of suffering, left a profound and reflective impression.  \n   - Despite the initial struggle to connect with the narrative, the story gained momentum halfway through, creating a compelling emotional pull.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a richly detailed and complex portrayal of 18th-century life, exploring the intersecting fates of women, Indigenous people, and enslaved individuals. While the narrative style was initially challenging due to its disjointed transitions and linguistic awkwardness, the story ultimately became deeply moving and thought-provoking. It sheds light on the tragedies of historical injustices and the resilience of its characters, leaving a lasting emotional impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Set in 1720 in the French colony of La Louisiane, this novel follows the journey of 90 women selected from the Salpêtrière in Paris to ensure the colony's survival. The story centers on three main characters: Charlotte, an orphan; Geneviève, a convicted abortionist; and Pétronille, a woman from a wealthy family with a facial birthmark. It intricately explores their experiences, from preparation and travel to being married off to strangers and beginning anew in the colony.",

The language used for the girls and women often felt overly objective.  \n   - Grammatically correct but distancing, referring to \"the girl\" as \"it\" created a significant emotional barrier, which I found counterproductive in a character-driven story.  \n   - This linguistic choice made it nearly impossible to form an emotional connection with the characters.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - The book has moments where the interpersonal relationships shine, but overall, I wished for a more dynamic and emotionally engaging narrative.  \n   - The complexity of the women's experiences could have been better captured with a more vivid and heartfelt storytelling approach.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"La Louisiane\" presents an interesting premise with potential, but the execution fell short for me. The slow pace, impersonal storytelling, and distancing language made it difficult to connect with the characters. While there are glimpses of brilliance in the relationships, the overall experience was too sluggish. If I hadn’t read it as an ARC, it likely would have ended up in my DNF (Did Not Finish) pile.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This novel, inspired by true events, follows orphans from a Parisian shelter sent to Louisiana in 1720 to marry settlers. The premise has great potential for a compelling tale of friendship and survival in a challenging world. Unfortunately, the execution falls short. The writing is chaotic and fragmented, resembling a collection of disjointed, out-of-context events that disrupt the narrative flow. Frequent time jumps—almost every chapter—render the story rushed and lacking depth, covering nearly 14 years of the characters' lives without sufficient engagement. A more structured timeline, perhaps focusing on key years like 1720, 1725, and 1730, could have better highlighted the characters' development. While the ending offered a slight redemption, it wasn't enough to significantly enhance my overall impression of the novel.",

The narrative's lack of fluidity hindered my emotional investment in their journeys, which should have been the story's core. The rushed pacing left little room to truly care about their fates.",

Unfortunately, their stories lack depth, making their struggles feel superficial. While the women are portrayed as strong, the narrative emphasizes their subjugation to men in the new world instead of exploring their personal growth or resilience.",

While it had some pacing issues and certain elements felt less believable, it’s a book I would recommend to fans of historical fiction and epics.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

After that, I alternated between reading a chapter in French and then in English, but I eventually switched to reading only in English. The French version was much more beautiful than the English one, but as the story slowed down, the English version felt smoother to read.  \n  The bilingual aspect intrigued me because I had read that Malye wrote the book in French and then worked on the English translation herself. As a French native and English translator, I found it fascinating to compare the differences—a remnant of my university studies in linguistics and literature. Spoiler: the French version is truly more beautiful, and there are significant, almost substantive, differences between the two versions, starting from the very first sentence.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The first part of the book was enjoyable, but the pacing became increasingly slower as the story progressed. This was exacerbated by the frequent shifts between characters. Just as I was fully immersed in one character’s perspective, the narrative would switch to another, making it harder to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Reading Duration and Effort:**  \n  This was a longer book for me (almost twice as long as usual), and I found myself struggling to get through it. It took me nearly two months to finish, which is unusual for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the bilingual aspect of the book was intriguing and the French version was notably more beautiful, the slow pacing and frequent character shifts made the reading experience less enjoyable over time.

            "I was deeply engaged by the stories of Petronille, Genevieve, and Charlotte. Genevieve and Charlotte's authentic attitudes toward their sexualities made their journey toward each other over the years compelling. However, I found the author's choice to depict Genevieve as an enslaver puzzling, as it added little to her character and ultimately diminished my appreciation for her, despite her treating others well. It was refreshing to read a historical WLW (women-loving-women) story with a happy ending. I also enjoyed the chapter on Utu’wv Ecoko’nese, but I wished for more exploration of her life beyond her relationship with a white family. While I understand the book's focus on the French women, I felt she deserved more attention.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the author's immersive portrayal of 1700s Louisiana. The setting felt vibrant and alive, allowing me to experience the towns, villages, and ships alongside the characters. The impressive research behind the book enriched my understanding of this period and the phenomenon that inspired it. I could have easily followed the women’s journeys for several more years. The historical depth truly enhanced the story's value."

The research that went into this book was impressive, and I felt like I could have kept following the women for several more years.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I was very compelled by the stories of Petronille, Genevieve, and Charlotte. Genevieve and Charlotte's respective attitudes towards their sexualities felt very genuine, and I loved watching them make their way to each other over the years. However, I did not understand why the author chose to make Genevieve an enslaver when it contributed nothing to her character. It ruined that particular character for me, even though she \"treated them well.\"  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  It was lovely and refreshing to read a historical WLW (women-loving-women) story with a happy ending. I also enjoyed the chapter about Utu’wv Ecoko’nese, but I would have liked more about her life outside of her relationship to a white family. I know the book was already long and specifically focused on the French women, but it felt like she deserved more time.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Inspiration:**  \n  I’m very glad that I know more about this period and the phenomenon that inspired the book.

            "This story, inspired by true events, follows three young women—Charlotte, Genevieve, and Petronille—who are sent from a prison and mental hospital in Paris to Louisiana as prospective brides. As they forge a friendship, their lives diverge in the French colony, intersecting at various points due to differing circumstances. While the narrative captivated me from the outset, I found the storyline in the French colony somewhat disjointed. This fragmentation made the reading experience more accessible but compromised the overall cohesion of the plot. Although the story remained engaging, the pacing felt uneven after the shift to the French colony, ultimately detracting from the novel's flow.",
            "The three main characters—Charlotte, Genevieve, and Petronille—are richly developed, with their friendship serving as the emotional heart of the story. Their individual journeys and the intersections of their lives foster a sense of connection and continuity, even as their paths ultimately diverge.",
            "The novel offers a compelling historical perspective on the struggles faced by women of limited means in the 18th century. It intricately explores their constrained options—marriage, the convent, or prostitution. Additionally, the narrative delves into the dynamics of the French colony, highlighting interactions with local indigenous tribes and enslaved Black Africans, thereby enriching the historical backdrop."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a worthwhile read, particularly for its historical insights and exploration of the challenges faced by women in the 18th century. Despite some disjointed elements in the storyline, the characters and their intertwined lives kept me invested. The historical context and themes add depth, making it a compelling, if not entirely seamless, narrative.",

While their stories were somewhat similar, the lack of depth in their individual arcs left me feeling detached.  \n\n- **Historical Context:**  \n  I found the historical aspect of the book intriguing, as it introduced me to a period of history I wasn’t previously aware of. This was one of the more engaging elements of the story.  \n\n- **Re-readability:**  \n  Despite the interesting historical context, I wouldn’t read this book again. The confusion caused by the narrative structure and lack of connection to the characters made it a one-time read for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book offered an intriguing glimpse into a lesser-known historical period, the disjointed narrative structure and lack of character development made it difficult to fully engage with the story. The frequent time jumps and shifts between characters further hindered my enjoyment, resulting in a book I wouldn’t revisit.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I knew nothing about this period before reading the book, and it provided an engaging glimpse into that world.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book effectively highlighted the struggles of the first settlers and the harsh realities they faced. It also brought home the moral complexities of their actions, such as raiding and stealing the land of native peoples.  \n\n- **Character Representation:**  \n  I wanted more focus on the indigenous and enslaved people. While their presence was acknowledged, I felt their stories could have been explored in greater depth.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book felt a little long at times, which made certain sections drag.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an interesting read that provided a compelling look into colonial Louisiana. While I wished for more depth in certain areas and found the pacing uneven, the historical context and themes made it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
