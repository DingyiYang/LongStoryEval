Despite these flaws, it was an entertaining read with thought-provoking themes and literary references.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story centers on five teenage girls shipwrecked on a mysterious island, where they confront survival challenges, a lurking predator, and a strange affliction that alters their bodies. The exploration of trauma and its physical manifestations is compelling, though *Wilder Girls* executes it slightly better. The island's transformations and the girls' reluctant acceptance of their new reality serve as a powerful metaphor.",
            "The \"women-supporting-women\" dynamic was a highlight, showcasing well-developed friendships and strong characters. However, the swift progression of these relationships, particularly the integration of a \"regular girl with a troubled past\" into a celebrity circle, felt unrealistic. The insta-love romance and declarations of soul-mate-level connections within days were unconvincing, leaning too heavily into romanticized trauma-bonding. Additionally, the love interest was portrayed as an insufferable, bratty English Rose, complete with an exaggerated posh accent in the audiobook, which came off as cringeworthy.",
            "The author excels in portraying trauma and survival, as demonstrated in her previous works like *If These Wings Could Fly* and *All the Dead Lie Down*. Her characters’ scars and healing processes are depicted with striking realism. The story takes some time to gain momentum, with the first 20% feeling disconnected from the rest of the narrative. However, once the girls arrive on the island, the atmosphere, setting, mystery, and character development create a captivating read. At times, the themes are addressed too overtly, such as the explicit statement, “we’ve all been teenage girls, so we know what it’s like to be prey,” which felt unnecessary given that the backstories effectively conveyed this message."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite its flaws, *Bad Graces* is an enjoyable read, especially for fans of *Wilder Girls* or female-led YA survival horror. The strong female friendships, exploration of trauma, and gripping survival elements make it worth reading, even if the insta-love romance and lack of subtlety in themes were drawbacks.",

The book reminded me more of *Yellow Jackets* meets *Wilder Girls*, with hints of *The Tempest* throughout.\n   - The deliberate comparison to *Wilder Girls* was apt, as *Bad Graces* shares similar elements: a survival story with an all-female cast, strong characters, and great friendships.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The story follows five teenage girls shipwrecked on a mysterious island, facing survival challenges, a mysterious predator, and a strange affliction that changes their bodies.\n   - The exploration of trauma and its physical manifestations was compelling, though *Wilder Girls* handled it slightly better. The island’s transformations and the girls’ reluctant acceptance of them served as a powerful metaphor.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - The “women-supporting-women” dynamic was a strong point, with well-developed friendships and strong characters.\n   - However, the rapid development of friendships, especially the integration of a “regular girl with a bad past” into a celebrity clique, felt unrealistic.\n   - The insta-love romance and soul-mate-level declarations within days were unconvincing and overly romanticized trauma-bonding.\n   - The love interest was insufferable, characterized as a bratty, pretentious English Rose with an over-the-top posh accent in the audiobook, which came off as cringy.\n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**\n   - The author, McCauley, excels at writing trauma and survival, as seen in her previous works like *If These Wings Could Fly* and *All the Dead Lie Down*. Her characters’ scars and healing processes are portrayed realistically.\n   - The story took a while to get started, with the first 20% feeling like a different novel. However, once the girls arrived on the island, the atmosphere, setting, mystery, and character development made it a gripping read.\n   - The lack of subtlety in addressing themes, such as explicitly stating, “we’ve all been teenage girls, so we know what it’s like to be prey,” felt unnecessary. The backstories already conveyed this message effectively.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**\n   - The audiobook narrator’s over-the-top posh accent for the love interest and strange husky voice detracted from the experience, making it feel cringy rather than mysterious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite its flaws, *Bad Graces* is an enjoyable read, especially for fans of *Wilder Girls* or female-led YA survival horror. The strong female friendships, exploration of trauma, and gripping survival elements make it worth reading, even if the insta-love romance and lack of subtlety in themes were drawbacks.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "If the film's plotline had been replaced with a more plausible scenario—such as a wilderness retreat, theater camp, or writing internship—or if the plot holes had been addressed, I would have rated this book a full 5 stars. The story's setup and numerous inconsistencies significantly detracted from my overall enjoyment. For instance, the premise of filming a movie adaptation of *The Tempest* felt implausible, as there was no discussion of character roles or rehearsals before the shipwreck. Furthermore, the presence of four actresses but only one female character in *The Tempest* (Miranda), along with the absence of male actors on the pre-filming bonding cruise, created glaring inconsistencies that were difficult to overlook.",

Although the story presents them as social media influencers passionate about conservation, it's difficult to believe they possess the necessary survival skills, composure, or medical knowledge to navigate life-or-death scenarios effectively. Additionally, the author does not clearly define what a writing internship on a film set involves for the main character, Liv, leaving her role feeling underdeveloped and implausible.",

It was engaging and kept me hooked throughout.  \n\n- **Plot Setup and Logic:**  \n  The setup of the story and the numerous plot holes significantly held the book back from being a 5-star read for me. Specifically, the idea of filming a movie version of *The Tempest* made no sense in the context of the story. There was no discussion about the roles the characters would play or any rehearsal of lines before the shipwreck occurred. Additionally, the fact that there is only one female character in *The Tempest* (Miranda) but four actresses in the story, and no male actors on the pre-filming bonding cruise, created inconsistencies that were hard to overlook.  \n\n- **Character Roles and Development:**  \n  The author failed to clarify what a \"writing internship on a film set\" would entail for the main character, Liv. This lack of detail made her role feel underdeveloped and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Character Realism:**  \n  The portrayal of the characters, particularly the rich celebrities, felt unrealistic. While the story suggests they are social media influencers who love conservation, it’s hard to believe they would possess the survival skills, level-headedness, or medical knowledge required to handle life-or-death situations effectively.  \n\n- **Alternative Plot Suggestions:**  \n  If the film set plotline had been replaced with a more plausible scenario—such as a wilderness retreat, theater camp, or a writing internship—or if the plot holes had been addressed, I would have gladly given this book a full 5 stars.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed the premise and execution of the book, the illogical setup, numerous plot holes, and unrealistic character portrayals prevented it from being a perfect read.

Although the gore is minimal, it is effectively executed and adds to the atmosphere.  \n\n- **Weaknesses (Pacing and Character Dynamics):**  \n  The timeline felt inconsistent, as it often showed sequential full days only to abruptly mention that weeks had passed.

The relationship between the main character and the love interest came across as insta-attraction rather than a deep connection. While the initial chemistry felt surface-level, I’m willing to overlook this given the book’s brevity and YA genre.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Found Family Dynamic:**  \n   - The book brilliantly sets up a found family dynamic, which I found compelling and heartwarming.  \n   - I rooted for Liv from the start, and her backstory made her impossible not to empathize with.  \n\n- **Themes of Trauma and Healing:**  \n   - The novel does an excellent job of discussing trauma and the process of healing from it.  \n   - It recognizes that trauma changes you but also highlights that these changes aren’t always negative—sometimes they represent growth and evolution into what you need to survive.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Development:**  \n   - While I loved all the girls and their relationships, I felt the characters could have had more depth if the book had been slightly longer.  \n   - The side characters, in particular, needed more development and unique voices to make them as distinguishable as Liv.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n   - The pacing could have been better, and the ending felt rushed.  \n   - A longer book might have allowed for a more satisfying resolution.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n   - The relationship between the main character and the love interest felt like insta-attraction rather than deep love.  \n   - The initial attraction seemed surface-level, though I’m more lenient with this given the book’s short length and YA genre.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Authenticity:**  \n   - Some of the dialogue felt unnatural, particularly with British characters and slang, which didn’t always land well.  \n   - A few lines of dialogue felt forced and unnatural, especially for teenage girls.  \n\n- **Narrative Perspective:**  \n   - The story might have benefited from multiple POVs (2 or 3) to give the side characters more depth and distinguishability.  \n   - However, I appreciate that 6 POVs might not have worked in this intimate setting and could have become repetitive.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - I highly recommend this book, especially for fans of *Yellowjackets*, strong female friendships, female resilience, body horror, and island settings.  \n   - The commentary on the experiences of teenage girls trying to survive was exceptionally well-written.  \n   - I’ll definitely read more by this author!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book achieves its goals with a compelling found family dynamic, strong themes of trauma and healing, and well-written commentary on female resilience. While the pacing, character depth, and dialogue could have been improved, the overall story is engaging and impactful. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to fans of similar themes and settings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the book is excellent, keeping me engaged and allowing for a one-sitting read. However, the ending felt rushed after the time jump and lacked the immersion of the earlier sections. The plot strikes a good balance between action, romance, and character development. The magical elements and body mutations are intriguing, introducing a unique horror aspect that kept me turning the pages. I found the portrayal of the monster and the girls' journey to coexist with her particularly compelling.",
            "The characters are well-developed, and I found myself bonding with them as they grew. The relationships, including two sapphic romances, are beautifully portrayed, and I genuinely rooted for the characters. The girls’ bond is central to the story, with their conflicts stemming from hurt rather than malice, adding a layer of authenticity.",

            "The 9-month time jump felt disjointed, interrupting the narrative just as it was gaining momentum. Additionally, the book's brevity limited the development of both the plot and characters, resulting in a rushed execution. The story follows a group of girls who, after embarking on a boat trip to film *The Tempest*, find themselves stranded on a seemingly deserted island after a fierce storm. However, the island harbors strange and supernatural forces that challenge their survival. Overall, the plot is engaging, with the girls facing numerous obstacles. It’s refreshing to see them unite in adversity, supporting one another without the typical cattiness often depicted in stories about female friendships.",

What starts out as what you might think is a \"Valley girls get stranded on an uninhabited island\" situation turns into something more interesting. The Hollywood stars sometimes slip back into their Valley girl brattiness, but it’s part of the charm. It’s an interesting mix of girls with different talents who find solace in each other and bide their time together. They don’t just sit around waiting to be rescued; they go out, explore, and find the monster.  \n\n- **Suspense and Mystery:**  \n  While reading, you keep thinking, \"Why doesn’t the monster attack them? What is so special about these girls that they’re left untouched?\" This keeps up the suspense because the monster might attack at any time.  \n\n- **Twist and Creativity:**  \n  The author brilliantly gives the story a twist by turning all the injuries into strange, mythical mutations under the guise of \"survival of the fittest.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a surprisingly enjoyable read with a mix of charm, suspense, and creativity. The plot keeps you engaged, and the unexpected twists make it stand out.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25 stars"

The addition of a fantasy twist made it stand out and added an interesting layer to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I think the novel could have reached greater heights as an adult horror story, I still found it enjoyable. The blend of survival themes with a fantasy twist, reminiscent of shows like \"The Wilds\" and \"Yellowjackets,\" made for a compelling read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nPotential 5-star read if it were adult horror; enjoyable as is."

Misunderstood is what comes to mind.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  - I enjoyed the relationship development with all the girls, and you could easily see how lifelong friendships would be formed under those circumstances.  \n  - I enjoyed the whisper of romance we got with Liv. They were cute together.  \n\n- **Romantic Content:**  \n  - It was pretty much zero spice. I think we saw one chaste kiss, and that was that.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - I enjoyed the plot and figuring out what was after them and the story behind the island.  \n  - It was a fun and entertaining read that I consumed in one sitting.  \n\n- **Source of the Book:**  \n  - I got this in my Locked Library subscription.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and entertaining read, even though it deviated from my usual romance preferences.
