The idea is always lovely, but usually the central characters end up facing TOO MUCH and don't even end up together.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  BLESS ROSIE SUTHERLAND FOR NOT DOING THIS! Yes, our central characters face a LOT, but thankfully, there is a beautiful happily ever after in the end that makes it all worth it.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I loved the sweet slow burn between Muirin and Jean. The chemistry was SO GOOD, and I was cheering them on the entire way! There were also some incredible side characters (looking at you, Anneke and Laurie) that I grew to love almost as much as Muirin and Jean themselves.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Setting:**  \n  Not only were the characters and their relationships fantastic, but the writing was lovely too! I was able to very clearly visualize the setting, and the little historical tidbits helped me do this wonderfully.  \n\n- **Author's Potential and Future Work:**  \n  I hope Rosie Sutherland continues her writing career because this debut novel was fantastic, and I would 100% read more from her.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sapphic historical fiction novel by Rosie Sutherland exceeded my expectations with its well-developed characters, engaging slow-burn romance, and satisfying happily-ever-after. The writing was vivid and immersive, making the historical setting come alive. I highly recommend this book and look forward to more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book is a slow burn that effectively builds tension and develops its characters. While the prologue may initially feel out of place—especially for those unfamiliar with the original folktale—it ultimately integrates seamlessly into the narrative. The novel is a stunning debut set in a historical period, rich with sapphic longing and a gripping mystery. The story follows Jean, a midwife in 1800s Nova Scotia, who assists a young woman named Muirin during childbirth, only to find herself entangled in a perilous situation involving Muirin’s husband, Tobias. As Jean delves deeper into Tobias’s motives and the “treasure” Muirin claims he stole, the stakes rise. The tension escalates as Jean fights to protect Muirin, the baby, and herself.",
            "Jean is a captivating protagonist—stubborn, loyal, and resolute in her desire to help Muirin, even at great risk. Their relationship evolves organically from friendship to romance, skillfully sidestepping clichés like trauma bonding or adrenaline-fueled connections. Tobias’s unpredictable behavior introduces an intriguing complexity and tension to the narrative. The sapphic romance between Jean and Muirin is beautifully crafted, showcasing breathtaking chemistry and an authentic friends-to-lovers arc. This romance stands out as a major highlight, enriching the emotional depth of the story.",
            "The vivid portrayal of 1800s Nova Scotia enhances the novel's period feel, creating a tense and immersive atmosphere that kept me engaged from start to finish.",

            "This novel draws inspiration from the folktale *The Selkie Wife*, yet it functions independently, allowing readers to enjoy it without prior familiarity with the tale. While the mystery is particularly engaging for those unfamiliar with the original story, even readers who know the folktale will find ample suspense and tension to appreciate."

Tension escalates throughout the narrative, with a palpable sense of impending violence surrounding the characters.",

The evolution of Jean and Muirin's relationship—from trust to friendship and ultimately to love—forms the emotional core of the narrative.",

A missed opportunity for explanation arises when a child requests water-legend stories, a moment that could have naturally introduced the myth.

            "The love story between Jean and Muirin was the standout aspect of the narrative for me. Their beautiful friendship evolves into a deeper bond, and I found their dynamic captivating. The integration of LGBTQ+ elements—featuring both lesbian and gay love—alongside the Selkie Wife tale created a rich tapestry of love and friendship. The story also offers a poignant critique of the misguided belief that confining a woman in a gilded cage is a form of love. I enjoyed Jean as the main character, though her stubbornness and self-sacrificing nature could be overwhelming at times. She embodies someone who initially thinks they prefer solitude but ultimately realizes they thrive in the company of loved ones. Muirin’s inquisitive and joyful personality, along with her contagious happiness when with Jean, added significant charm to the story.",

The coast, the town, and the people all felt vivid and cinematic, reminiscent of the movie *The World to Come* (2020).  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  I really enjoyed Jean as the main character, though her stubbornness and tendency to help others to the point of self-endangerment were a bit overwhelming at times. She struck me as someone who initially believes they prefer solitude but ultimately realizes they thrive in the company of loved ones. Muirin’s personality was inquisitive and lovely, and her gleeful, contagious happiness whenever she was with Jean added so much charm to the story.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  The pining love story between Jean and Muirin was the highlight for me. Their relationship began as a beautiful friendship that gradually deepened into something more, and I couldn’t get enough of their dynamic. The inclusion of LGBTQ+ elements (both lesbian and gay love) alongside the Selkie Wife tale created a beautiful blend of love and friendship.

I loved every second of it and hope for a spin-off or prequel about Buchanan and his wife.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a stunningly atmospheric and heartwarming love story that beautifully blends selkie lore, LGBTQ+ themes, and vivid landscapes. The characters, especially Jean and Muirin, are deeply engaging, and their pining romance is both tender and captivating.

            "Jean, a respected yet reserved midwife, harbors an unspoken attraction to women that allows her to navigate society while simultaneously isolating her in unfair ways. What I appreciated most about Jean’s character is her vibrancy; she is not a stereotypical loner consumed by despair, but rather a funny, intelligent, and self-assured individual. Her quiet life is upended when she encounters Muirin, who arrives at her doorstep ready to give birth. Despite the language barrier, Jean and Muirin forge a profound connection, which is jeopardized by the dark secrets Muirin's husband is hiding.",

The novel blends many genres at once, and you do not need to be familiar with the mythology surrounding Selkies to enjoy this story.\n\n- **Character Development (Jean):**  \n  Jean is a respected midwife who mostly keeps to herself. Her attraction to women is a sort of tacit secret, which allows her to move freely through society but also isolates her in unfair ways. What I most liked about Jean’s character is that she isn’t a loner or someone completely absorbed by melancholy. She’s funny, smart, independent, and self-assured.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is well-paced, and the story is punctuated by many moments of humor and joy. However, I felt the ending was a bit rushed. I would have enjoyed reading Muirin’s perspective throughout, rather than a short summary at the close of the story.\n\n- **Character Dynamics (Jean and Muirin):**  \n  Jean’s quiet life is turned upside down when she discovers Muirin outside her home, ready to give birth. Despite a language barrier, Jean and Muirin develop a beautiful connection that is threatened by the sinister secrets Muirin’s husband is keeping.\n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  I was so immersed in *A Sweet Sting of Salt* that I did not pause my reading to take notes. The story kept me engaged from start to finish.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Sweet Sting of Salt* is a captivating blend of queer romance, historical fiction, and fantastical mystery. Jean’s character is a standout—funny, smart, and self-assured—and her connection with Muirin is beautifully portrayed.

Jean and Laurie’s bond is skillfully depicted, showcasing their understanding of when to push each other and when to hold back. I particularly admired Laurie’s steadfast support for Jean, even in moments of disagreement. Jean's character is compelling; her stubbornness, pride in her work, and desire for independence make her relatable, and even when she falters, I found myself rooting for her. Muirin’s seal-like traits and her gradually blossoming love for Jean are expertly illustrated. Kicker stands out as a hilarious and brilliant side character, playing a crucial role in the story's resolution.",

The inclusion of historical events, such as the burning of the privateer schooner Young Teazer, enriches the narrative. The depiction of queer love during an era of widespread intolerance is both authentic and poignant, particularly with Jean and Laurie surrounded by supportive friends despite societal obstacles.",

This version took a fresh approach to the traditionally disturbing story of the fisherman keeping the selkie woman against her will.  \n\n- **Sapphic Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n   - The sapphic romance was a slow-burn, built on friendship first, which worked well with the story’s gradual unfolding.  \n   - Jean and Laurie’s friendship was beautifully portrayed, with each knowing when to push and when to let things be. I especially loved Laurie’s unwavering support for Jean, even when he didn’t agree with her decisions.  \n\n- **Historical and Cultural Context:**  \n   - The setting of Nova Scotia in the 1800s was immersive and well-crafted.  \n   - The incorporation of historical events, like the burning of the privateer schooner Young Teazer, added depth to the story.  \n   - The portrayal of queer love in a time when it wasn’t widely accepted felt realistic, especially with Jean and Laurie having supportive friends despite societal challenges.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Jean’s character was compelling, with her stubbornness, pride in her work, and desire to make it on her own. Even when she made bad decisions, I found myself rooting for her.  \n   - Muirin’s seal-like traits and the slow growth of her love story with Jean were beautifully written.  \n   - Kicker was a standout side character—hilarious, brilliant, and pivotal in the story’s conclusion.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Resonance:**  \n   - The theme of Jean being adopted into Anneke’s family and her complex relationship with the town felt authentic and emotionally resonant.  \n   - The vixen’s role in the story added a unique layer of symbolism and intrigue.  \n   - The idea of Jean “holding her love in an open hand” was a poignant and memorable take on love and freedom.  \n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**  \n   - The pacing might feel slow for some, but I thought it was perfect for a historical folktale, allowing the story to unfold naturally.  \n   - The author did a fantastic job weaving together past and present threads into a satisfying tapestry.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a fabulous debut novel that masterfully reimagined the selkie folktale with a sapphic romance, rich historical context, and deeply developed characters. The slow-burn romance, immersive setting, and emotional depth made it a standout read. I would highly recommend it to fans of folktales, sapphic romances, historical fiction, and happily-ever-after stories. I look forward to reading more from Sutherland.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars"

            "The writing flows effortlessly, featuring well-structured plotlines and a believable, well-paced romance. It was surprising to discover that the author began with a Tumblr fan base and fanfiction, as the syntax, tone, and pacing do not reflect that background at all.",

It resonated with me on a personal level, particularly as someone who embraced my Scots-Irish heritage and delved into Celtic music during my middle school years."

It centers on Jean, a village midwife with a traumatic past, who becomes involved with Muirin, a mysterious woman who arrives at her door in labor. While the plot will be predictable for those acquainted with the original folktale, the journey remains engaging.

The way Rose Sutherland builds the tension and hostility between Jean and Tobias is absolutely phenomenal, but it also made my stomach hurt.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The relationships between the characters are well-built and oftentimes made me feel like I was sitting around with old friends instead of just reading a book.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Themes:**  \n  The story doesn't shy away from emotion the way some books do, nor does it focus on purely physical aspects of attraction. It's very well-rounded and filled with such a need to love and be loved and to protect those you care about.  \n\n- **Overall Story Quality:**  \n  The story overall is fantastic. I cannot recommend this book enough.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply emotional and well-crafted story that excels in building tension, developing authentic relationships, and exploring themes of love and protection. It left a lasting impression on me, and I highly recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They added depth and emotional resonance to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was just beautifully done, making the story immersive and engaging.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The audiobook was really, really beautiful and enhanced the overall experience of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an incredibly well-written and engaging novel with beautiful characters and relationships. The unique narrative twist of the main character’s unawareness of the genre added an intriguing layer to the story. The audiobook version was particularly stunning, making the experience even more enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Readers familiar with the selkie legend will recognize that Muirin is trapped because Tobias possesses her seal skin. The escalating suspicion and eventual animosity Tobias feels toward Jean heighten the tension. Jean grapples with her feelings for Muirin, Muirin's safety, and her own well-being. The narrative maintains strong momentum, skillfully balancing romance, tension, and folklore. Overall, the story is both serene and suspenseful, offering a captivating reading experience.",

            "Lastly, the tension in this book is masterfully crafted. Throughout the entire third part, I felt a constant pit in my stomach, rooting for the characters and holding my breath with each page turn. It's rare for me to become so fully engaged in a story, as my writer brain is usually on overdrive, but “A Sweet String of Salt” truly captivated me.\n\nThis sapphic retelling of the folktale “The Selkie Wife” follows Jean, a midwife who discovers Muirin, her neighbor Tobias Silber's enigmatic new wife, laboring near the sea. As Jean helps Muirin give birth, she realizes that Muirin doesn’t speak English and displays animalistic traits. Their child inherits these qualities, boasting webbed fingers. Jean finds herself irresistibly drawn to Muirin, but complications arise due to Muirin's marriage to a man fiercely protective of what he believes is his.",
            "I absolutely love this book! While I have a minor issue, it pales in comparison to the overall experience. I was surprised to discover that this is the author's debut, as they have crafted incredible characters and a captivating atmosphere that made me feel immersed in the story. \n\nThe characters are particularly noteworthy; they are incredibly likable. Jean, while endearing, did induce significant anxiety, which I believe was intentional. I felt a deep sympathy for Muirin throughout, and I found myself wanting to punch Tobias more than once! The author excels at bringing these characters to life, and I eagerly anticipate their future works.",
            "The atmosphere in this book is captivating. I could almost feel the wind in my hair, the salt on my eyelashes, and the crunch of snow beneath my feet. It was incredibly evocative, allowing me to vividly imagine the setting.",
            "From a young age, I've always dreamed of being a mermaid, inspired by Ariel and the enchanting tales of my childhood. I often played mermaids in the pool, emulating them so perfectly that the habit has stuck with me; even at 24, I still swim like one. It wasn't until later that I discovered other mythical water creatures like sirens and selkies. I’m drawn to all mythical beings, but stories that incorporate LGBTQ+ themes truly resonate with me. The emotional depth in the relationship between Jean and Muirin is palpable, and I couldn't help but root for their happy ending—they both deserve it after everything they've endured."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Personal Connection and Initial Interest:**\n   - Ever since I was little, I wanted to be a mermaid. Thanks to Ariel and other mythical tales I heard of when I was younger, I was one of those girls that always wanted to play mermaids in the pool. I tried to emulate them in any way I could, so much so that it was engrained into me so much I still swim like one. I’m 24. I, however, didn’t learn about different types of mythical water creatures until I was older. Sirens, selkies, et cetera. Mythical creatures of any kind are right up my alley, but when it’s also gay, it catches my attention.\n\n- **Plot Summary and Premise:**\n   - “A Sweet String of Salt” is a sapphic retelling of a folktale called “The Selkie Wife.” A midwife named Jean finds poor Muirin, the mysterious new wife of her neighbor Tobias Silber, laboring just outside her home near the sea. Upon taking her in to help her give birth, Jean quickly learns that Muirin doesn’t know a word of English and has animalistic tendencies. Even the son she births is animalistic, as he has webbed fingers. Jean finds herself entranced by Muirin, and slowly falls for her. The problem? Muirin’s married to a man that’s willing to fight for what’s “his.”\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - I love this book. There is one thing that I have issue with, but it’s minuscule in comparison. I was surprised to learn that Sutherland is a debut author because she creates amazing characters and atmosphere. I felt like I was in the book the entire time. The first thing I really love are the characters. They’re so likable. Jean did give me massive bouts of anxiety, but that was obviously on purpose. I couldn’t help but feel horrible for Muirin the entire time, and I seriously wanted to sucker punch Tobias on more than one occasion. She does such a good job of breathing life into these characters and I can’t wait to see her do it in her next novels.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**\n   - Second: the atmosphere. I love atmospheric books like this. I feel like I could feel the wind ripple through my hair, the salt in my eyelashes, the snow crunch under my feet. It was incredibly poignant and I didn’t have much trouble imagining what the area looked like.\n\n- **Emotional Engagement and Yearning:**\n   - Third, the yearning. You could feel the love Jean and Muirin had for each other and all I wanted was them to have a happy ending. They both deserve it for what they went through.\n\n- **Tension and Pacing:**\n   - And lastly: the tension. Sutherland is incredibly good at it. I could feel a pit in my stomach almost the entire third part of the book. I was rooting for them the entire time, and it was hard not to hold my breath as I read. It’s hard to get me so engaged because my writer brain is constantly turned on, so when I can just lose myself, I know I’ve come across a good book.\n\n- **Critique:**\n   - The only things I really took issue with was this: the switch in dialect. At first, it felt like the book was trying to emulate 19th century writing (akin to Austen and Brontë), but it switched from phrasing like, “Four and twenty” to using words like “shat.” It took me out ever so slightly because of the shift, but that’s really the only big gripe I have about it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Otherwise, it’s a beautiful story that I have happily preordered to have on my shelf. Thank you, Sutherland, for such a story and I hope to read another book of yours!\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

While the overall pacing is brisk, the romance develops at a more measured pace, reminiscent of a slow burn that may appeal to some readers.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is heartwarming, with a prologue and epilogue, medium pacing, and a single point of view (POV). The dialogue has an old-time-y feel, which adds to the charm of the story.  \n\n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  As a heavy thriller/horror reader, I was initially hesitant about this book, as I don’t typically read fantasy or historical fiction. However, the “danger” element of helping a pregnant woman and the mystery surrounding her husband drew me in. The book isn’t heavily fantasy-based, making it accessible and enjoyable for thriller fans.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The story starts quickly, introducing the pregnant woman by page 14. The pacing is fast overall, though the romance develops at a medium pace, which romance readers might consider a slow burn. The connection between the two women is sweet, wholesome, and well-developed, with some humorous moments sprinkled in.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  All the characters are likable, including the snobby, bitchy woman in the village and the suspicious husband. There are many endearing characters, and the side plots—such as Laurie’s relationship, the rumors about Jean, and the dilemma with Jean and her old best friend Jo—add depth and excitement to the story. Even minor details, like the resolution involving one of the goats, are satisfying.  \n\n- **Engagement and Climax:**  \n  The book kept me engaged from the start, with something always holding my interest. By page 230, the intensity ramped up, and I couldn’t put it down. Page 243 was particularly heartwarming and sweet, delivering a moment I had been hoping for.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book is a fairytale with a dark twist, blending LGBTQ themes, murder, and romance. The author skillfully weaves a story within a story, creating a layered narrative. It explores relationships—both platonic and romantic—and portrays healthy, sweet love in a way that feels genuine and uplifting.  \n\n- **Conclusion and Warnings:**  \n  The story wraps up all its threads neatly, leaving no loose ends. However, readers should be aware of content warnings, including forced marriage, presumed rape, animal death, and relationship abuse.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a heartwarming, engaging read that blends elements of dark fairy tales, mystery, and romance. Despite my usual preference for thrillers and horror, I found myself completely captivated by the story, characters, and themes. It’s a rare favorite for me, and I’m excited to see what Rose Sutherland writes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This novel retells The Selkie Wife, focusing on the abusive dynamics at its core. This perspective creates a gripping plot that held my attention throughout. I found myself passionately rooting for Muirin's escape and empathizing with Jean's desperation to save her, motivated not only by burgeoning romantic feelings but also by a profound sense of solidarity between women.",
            "This novel is deeply character-driven, centering on Jean, a midwife whose perspective guides the narrative. Jean is a compelling character—intelligent, resourceful, independent, and sensitive. Her choices and reactions are profoundly shaped by her life experiences, including the loss of her mother to postpartum depression, ostracism due to her sexuality, and the heartbreak of losing her best friend and first love. The other main characters, Muirin and Tobias, are also well-developed, with rich backstories that inform their actions throughout the story. Each character's decisions and mistakes feel authentic and consistent with their personalities, even as their true motivations unfold later in the narrative.",
            "It's impressive that this is the author's debut novel. The writing is exceptional, featuring a strong narrative voice and a captivating mix of folk tale elements and original storytelling. The book holds its own, appealing even to readers who don't usually favor retellings."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The novel includes depictions of child birth, spousal abuse, stalking, animal cruelty, rape (off screen), postpartum depression (off screen), and suicide (off screen). For those averse to explicit content, there is one fade-to-black sex scene that is well-telegraphed.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The novel is highly character-driven, with Jean, a midwife, serving as the third-person perspective character. Jean is a standout character—smart, resourceful, independent, and sensitive. Her decisions and reactions are deeply influenced by her life circumstances, including losing her mother to postpartum depression, being ostracized for her sexuality, and losing her best friend/first love. The other primary characters, Muirin and Tobias, are equally well-developed, with established pasts that shape their actions throughout the story. All characters make decisions and mistakes that feel natural and consistent with their personalities, even if their true motivations are revealed later in the book.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel is a retelling of \"The Selkie Wife,\" framed to emphasize the abusive nature of the relationship at its core. This approach creates an engaging and taut plot that kept me invested from start to finish. As a reader, I found myself deeply rooting for Muirin to escape her situation and understood Jean's desperation to save her, driven not only by growing romantic feelings but also by a sense of solidarity as one woman helping another.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  It’s hard to believe this is Sutherland’s first novel. The writing is excellent, with a strong narrative voice and a compelling blend of folk tale elements and original storytelling. The book stands on its own merit, even for readers who may not typically gravitate toward retellings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSutherland’s novel is a masterful blend of character-driven storytelling, compelling themes, and a taut, engaging plot. The well-developed characters, particularly Jean, make the story feel authentic and emotionally resonant. I highly recommend this book and would eagerly read more of Sutherland’s work in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this poignant story, we follow Jean, a skilled midwife who lives in isolation, shunned by her community due to a tarnished reputation fueled by her former best friend's gossipy mother. Content in her solitude, Jean finds solace in caring for her home, animals, and land after her father's passing. Her life takes an unexpected turn when her distant neighbor, Tobias, introduces her to his enigmatic new wife, Muirin, who unexpectedly appears in Jean's yard during a storm. Jean assists Muirin in giving birth, sparking a profound connection between them.\n\nThe relationship between Jean and Muirin is beautifully depicted. Both women are at a crossroads—Muirin yearning for her family and a way home, while Jean seeks a sense of belonging. Their love story unfolds with an inevitability that is deeply moving. The intensity of their longing is almost palpable, making it a heart-wrenching read. Jean's love for Muirin is selfless and unwavering; she offers her affection freely, never asking for anything in return.",

It left me feeling as if I were gazing from a porch into the sea, yearning for something just beyond reach.",
            "This book is a gem for fans of queer representation, featuring sapphic main characters Jean and Muirin, along with a diverse cast of side characters, including both achillean and sapphic identities. If you've longed for more queer characters in selkie tales or have a romanticized view of the sea, this book is a perfect fit for you.",

The storytelling is so well-crafted and immersive that it feels like the work of a seasoned author.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  We follow Jean, a talented midwife who is isolated from her townspeople due to her remote location and a terrible reputation perpetuated by her old best friend's gossipy mom. Jean prefers solitude, finding contentment in maintaining her home, tending to her animals, and caring for the land after her father's death. Her nearest neighbor, Tobias, is someone she’s not particularly close with, but their lives intertwine when his mysterious new wife, Muirin, appears in Jean's yard during a storm. Jean helps Muirin give birth, marking the beginning of their profound connection.  \n\n  The relationship between Jean and Muirin is beautifully portrayed. They meet when both are lost—Muirin missing her family and desperate to go home, and Jean longing to find a sense of belonging. Their love story is inevitable and deeply moving. The yearning between them is so palpable that it’s almost painful to read. Jean’s love for Muirin is selfless and unwavering; she holds her love in an open hand, never demanding anything in return.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  This book is a treasure for anyone who loves queer representation. It features sapphic main characters (Jean and Muirin), as well as side achillean and sapphic characters.

It maintains the core moral (don't kidnap people) while shifting the focus to sympathize with the victim rather than the kidnapper. The author's clear intent from the outset is both refreshing and appreciated.

Once the full danger is revealed, the narrative becomes a true page-turner.",

This setting perfectly symbolizes the main character Jean’s loneliness and self-imposed isolation following the heartbreaking consequences of her love for her best friend from her youth.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jean is portrayed as tough, dedicated, and persistent, both in her role as the village midwife and in her determination to rescue Muirin, regardless of the personal cost.

This barrier, however, allows tender feelings to grow between the two women, even as the danger from Muirin’s increasingly desperate and dangerous husband escalates.  \n\n- **Language and Dialogue:**  \n  The rustic lilt and phrasing of the Nova Scotia accent are authentically represented, as are the folksy, superstitious practices tied to the local culture, such as ensuring large hauls of fish, preventing a ship from sinking, or protecting a baby from being replaced with a changeling.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book is more quiet and historical than fantastical, with a literary flavor. It is ultimately a happy-ending historical queer romance, blending emotional depth with a satisfying resolution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a richly developed and satisfying work that combines evocative writing, authentic character development, and a compelling plot.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  - The story is a queer reimagining of the classic folktale *The Selkie Wife*, which immediately drew me in due to my interest in Selkie folklore.  \n  - The plot is captivating, with a mix of mystery, romance, and danger. Jean’s discovery of Muirin and the subsequent unraveling of dark secrets kept me engaged throughout.  \n  - The story is very sad in places, adding emotional depth and complexity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Rose Sutherland has created vibrant and compelling characters. Jean, the protagonist, is relatable and driven by her growing concern and feelings for Muirin.  \n  - Muirin is a fascinating character—her mysterious origins, language barrier, and shifting demeanor around her husband, Tobias, made her intriguing and multi-dimensional.  \n  - Tobias is portrayed ambiguously, leaving me questioning whether he is a villain or simply a man struggling in his marriage.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  - The love story between Jean and Muirin is fraught with obstacles, making it both heart-wrenching and compelling.  \n  - The emotional stakes are high, as Jean’s actions could endanger herself, Muirin, and the baby, adding tension and urgency to their relationship.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  - I loved the ending! It felt satisfying and well-executed, tying up the story’s emotional and narrative threads effectively.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully crafted queer retelling of *The Selkie Wife*, blending folklore, romance, and suspense. Rose Sutherland’s vivid characters and emotionally charged storytelling make it a captivating read. While the story is sad in places, the ending is deeply satisfying, leaving a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This sapphic retelling of *The Selkie Wife* surpassed my expectations. The gripping narrative offers a chilling depiction of domestic abuse through the character of Tobias, whose stalking and possessive behavior are portrayed in a horrifying, unromanticized manner. The pervasive tension and menace throughout the book kept me thoroughly engaged.",
            "I adored Jean, the protagonist. As the island's only midwife, she holds a unique position—respected for her skills yet ostracized due to rumors about her past and her independence. Her determination to help Muirin, despite numerous challenges, makes her a compelling character. Muirin’s journey from an abusive relationship to discovering her voice and agency is equally captivating. The romance between Jean and Muirin is sweet and well-developed; initially, it feels one-sided due to the language barrier, but as Muirin learns English, their connection deepens. Their relationship is tender and heartfelt, though constantly threatened by the danger posed by Tobias.",
            "The author skillfully blends realism with fantastical elements, making Muirin's extraordinary situation feel believable through Jean's grounded perspective. The narrative refrains from over-explaining, allowing readers to piece together the story organically."

Her physical and emotional distance from society plays a major role in the story, and experiencing her life alongside her as a reader made her feel incredibly real and relatable.  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The novel is advertised as a reimagining of *The Selkie Wife*, which I feel detracted from the experience. Knowing the outcome from the start made the beginning of the book drag slightly. It would have been more intriguing to be kept in the dark as a reader, allowing the mystery to unfold naturally.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  While the novel touches on local mythology and folktales, I wish it had delved deeper into these elements. A more thorough exploration of the mythology could have served as a stronger lead-up to the reveal, rather than the shallow mentions we get.  \n\n- **Representation and Personal Connection:**  \n  I’m thrilled to add Jean to my collection of redhead lesbian characters—it’s always wonderful to see representation that resonates personally.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis atmospheric historical fiction novel shines in its vivid portrayal of Jean’s life and the immersive setting. However, the decision to frame it as a reimagining of *The Selkie Wife* lessened the impact of the mystery, and the exploration of local mythology felt underdeveloped. Despite these flaws, Jean’s character and the novel’s atmosphere make it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Jean is a complex character shaped by a painful past, marked by a ruined relationship and the sting of vicious gossip. This history has made her understandably guarded. In contrast, Muirin is laidback and eager to embrace new experiences during her time with Jean. While Tobias, Muirin's husband, initially appears kind, Jean senses an unsettling undercurrent to his demeanor. As his true nature unfolds, it heightens the story's tension. The romance between Jean and Muirin blossoms quickly, yet Jean's emotional journey unfolds more gradually as she confronts her past and the uncertainties surrounding Muirin's situation. Their relationship feels both tender and authentic.",

The prologue's reference to a real historical shipwreck effectively establishes the tone and serves as a catalyst for Jean's character development.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Concept and Premise:**\n   - I was initially intrigued by the idea of a sapphic retelling of *The Selkie Wife*. Having read previous selkie-based romances, I found them lacking in capturing the true essence of the fairy tale, as they were all between male and female characters.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**\n   - The middle of the book felt slow, but I remained engaged due to the compelling characters. The pacing allowed for a gradual exploration of Jean's emotions and Muirin's situation.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - Jean is a prickly character with a well-justified backstory. Her previous relationship was ruined, and she suffered from vicious gossip and slander, which shaped her guarded nature.\n   - Muirin, in contrast, is more laidback, with a zest for life and a desire to experience new things while staying with Jean.\n   - Tobias, Muirin's husband, appears kind on the surface, but Jean senses an underlying unease about him. His true nature is gradually revealed, adding tension to the story.\n\n- **Romance Development:**\n   - The romance between Jean and Muirin develops quickly, but Jean's emotional journey is slower as she grapples with her past hurt and the precariousness of Muirin's situation. Their relationship feels tender and natural.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - The historical setting of Nova Scotia is well-utilized, enhancing the story's mood. The untamed land and harsh winter create a sense of isolation and menace, particularly in Tobias's characterization.\n   - The inclusion of an actual historical ship sinking disaster in the prologue effectively sets the tone for the story and Jean's character development.\n\n- **Integration of Folklore and Mysticism:**\n   - While I’m not deeply familiar with *The Selkie Wife* fairy tale, I appreciated how Sutherland wove elements of the tale into her own narrative. The blend of historical fiction with mysticism and magic kept me engaged, even during slower sections.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - I thoroughly enjoyed *A Sweet Sting of Salt*. The romance between Jean and Muirin felt authentic and compelling, and the story’s blend of historical and mystical elements was captivating.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*A Sweet Sting of Salt* is a beautifully crafted sapphic retelling of *The Selkie Wife*, blending historical fiction with elements of folklore and magic. While the pacing slows in the middle, the well-developed characters, atmospheric setting, and tender romance make it a memorable read. I was fully invested in Jean and Muirin’s story and appreciated the unique take on the selkie myth.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story centers on Jean, a midwife in the quaint seaside village of Barquer’s Bay, who encounters Muirin, a mysterious woman found in her yard. Familiar with the folklore of the Selkie Wife, I was nonetheless eager to see how the narrative would unfold. The plot unfolds at a slow pace, yet it is filled with tension that kept me engaged and curious about what would happen next. However, the ending was somewhat disappointing, as a lengthy explanation from a new character felt like an easy way out, distancing me from the main characters we had come to know. One of the book's strengths lies in the development of Jean and Muirin’s relationship, which flourished despite their language barrier. Thus, having someone else provide the explanation undermined that connection.",
            "Jean, Muirin, Laurie, and Anneke are well-developed characters, each with distinct voices. I found myself particularly rooting for Jean and Muirin. In contrast, Tobias came across as somewhat one-dimensional and cartoonishly villainous; I would have liked to see more nuance in his character and a deeper exploration of his motivations.",

Her expertise and role within the community are well-crafted. The relationship between Jean and Muirin develops gradually, beginning as a friendship and hinting at something deeper. Their connection feels genuine and significant. The theme of found family is prominent, depicted through the small-town community's support for one another, rather than the contemporary portrayal of chosen families.",

The legend adds a unique and atmospheric touch to the setting.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - Jean, the local midwife and a bit of an outcast due to her past \"close friendship\" with another girl, is a compelling protagonist. Her skill as a midwife and her role in the community are well-developed.  \n  - The relationship between Jean and Muirin evolves slowly, starting as a friendship and potentially becoming something more. Their bond feels authentic and meaningful.  \n  - The sense of found family is strong, though it’s portrayed differently than in contemporary settings. Here, it’s more about the small-town community coming together to support one another.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  - The story is quite slow-paced, with the plot picking up significantly only near the end.

The original story felt a bit creepy to me, and this version addresses that while adding new elements that improve the narrative.  \n  - The story has a cozy atmosphere with beautiful descriptions of the setting, though the middle of the book dragged a bit.  \n  - There were tense moments where they were necessary, and the adversary was well-written.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - The queer representation felt natural and fit perfectly into the story.  \n  - The love story between Jean and Muirin was well done, though I would have liked more time with them to deepen their connection.  \n  - One of the side stories had a mystery that seemed obvious, but it didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The middle of the book felt slow at times, which slightly affected the pacing.  \n  - I would have preferred a longer epilogue, as I wanted to see more of the characters and their lives after the main events.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Themes:**  \n  - The book has a cozy, magical atmosphere, making it a perfect lighter read for spring.  \n  - It’s full of longing and magic, with beautiful descriptions that enhance the setting.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Audience:**  \n  - I’d highly recommend this book to anyone looking for sapphic stories, fairytale retellings, or a cozy read.  \n  - It pairs well with a cup of tea, adding to its comforting vibe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a delightful, cozy, and magical retelling of *The Selkie Wife* with strong queer representation and a well-crafted love story.

            "The story unfolds at a slow pace, occasionally causing certain sections to feel prolonged. However, every plot element is essential, even if the pacing could be improved. It begins with Jean, a midwife in an early 1800s seaside town, who encounters a mysterious laboring woman named Muirin. This encounter triggers a series of events that unravels Jean's carefully constructed life. The novel serves as a retelling of the Selkie Wife tale, set against a gothic Nova Scotian backdrop characterized by winter storms, crashing waves, and an ever-present sense of danger. It incorporates key elements of the original tale, including webbed-handed half-selkie babies, handsome male selkies, and the inability to enter salt water without a sealskin.",
            "Jean is a well-crafted protagonist who becomes entangled in the mystery of Muirin and Tobias. Her complex past, including her discovery with another woman, enriches her character. Muirin's initial inability to communicate creates an authentic sense of confusion, steering clear of the usual miscommunication trope. Meanwhile, Tobias emerges as a menacing figure, with his true nature gradually unveiled throughout the narrative.",
            "This novel masterfully intertwines mystery, romance, and gothic elements, vividly portraying the perilous winter coast. It delves into themes of danger, stemming from both the harsh natural environment and the menacing presence of Tobias. In a refreshing twist, the final chapters empower Muirin to share her story in her own voice, subverting the traditional Selkie Wife narrative that often silences the selkie.",
            "The novel is best categorized as historical fiction rather than historical fantasy, as it features minimal magical realism or fantasy elements until the very end. While this distinction may disappoint readers seeking a more fantastical narrative, it did not detract from my enjoyment of the story."
        ],
        "conclusion": "A Sweet Sting of Salt is a well-crafted retelling of the Selkie Wife tale, blending mystery, romance, and gothic elements in a Nova Scotian setting. The novel excels in character development and thematic depth, though its slow pacing may be a drawback for some readers. The lack of prominent fantasy elements positions it more as historical fiction than historical fantasy, which may influence my expectations. Overall, it is a revitalized and thoughtful retelling that offers a fresh perspective on the classic tale.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**\n   - The story begins with Jean, a midwife in an early-1800s seaside town, encountering a mysterious woman in labor named Muirin. This sets off a chain of events that unravels Jean's carefully rebuilt life.\n   - The novel is a retelling of the Selkie Wife tale, set in a Nova Scotian gothic atmosphere with winter storms, crashing waves, and a sense of lurking danger.\n   - The plot integrates many features of the original Selkie Wife tale, such as webbed-handed half-selkie babies, handsome male selkies, and the inability to enter salt water without a sealskin.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Jean is a well-developed protagonist who is drawn into the mystery surrounding Muirin and Tobias. Her past, including being found with another woman, adds depth to her character.\n   - Muirin's inability to communicate initially creates a genuine \"could not communicate\" situation, which adds to the mystery and avoids the typical miscommunication trope.\n   - Tobias is portrayed as a dangerous figure, with his true nature slowly revealed throughout the story.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**\n   - The novel blends mystery, romance, and gothic elements, capturing the dangerous atmosphere of the coast during winter.\n   - The story explores themes of danger, both from the natural environment and from other people, particularly Tobias.\n   - The final chapters allow Muirin to tell her story in her own words, providing a reversal of the typical Selkie Wife narrative where the selkie has no voice.\n\n- **Pacing:**\n   - The story is slow-paced, which can make some sections feel like they drag on longer than necessary.\n   - Despite the slow pacing, all elements of the plot are necessary, though the pacing could have been improved.\n\n- **Genre and Expectations:**\n   - The novel is better thought of as historical fiction rather than historical fantasy, as it lacks significant magical realism or fantasy elements until the very end.\n   - This distinction may be a negative for readers expecting a more fantastical story, but it was not an issue for the reviewer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA Sweet Sting of Salt is a well-crafted retelling of the Selkie Wife tale, blending mystery, romance, and gothic elements in a Nova Scotian setting. The novel excels in character development and thematic depth, though its slow pacing may be a drawback for some readers. The lack of prominent fantasy elements positions it more as historical fiction than historical fantasy, which may influence reader expectations. Overall, it is a revitalized and thoughtful retelling that offers a fresh perspective on the classic tale.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "This novel offers a sapphic twist on selkie folklore, skillfully intertwining romance, tension, and mystery. It begins slowly, immersing readers in Jean's quiet, solitary life, but gains momentum by the middle, culminating in a thrilling climax. However, some scenes feel superfluous, disrupting the pacing at times. While the ending is satisfying, it lacks depth, leaving me eager for a more thorough exploration of the selkie lore and character resolutions. Overall, the beginning effectively establishes Jean's character and her world, while the middle and climax maintain a well-paced escalation of tension. Yet, the conclusion feels rushed and could benefit from a deeper dive into the lore and character arcs.",
            "In this story, Jean, a strong and level-headed midwife with a tragic past, emerges as a relatable and compelling protagonist. Muirin, her fiery and intelligent friend, provides a striking contrast with her subdued demeanor around her husband, Tobias. Initially, Tobias Silber seems grateful and kind, but as the narrative unfolds, his darker nature is revealed. Supporting characters like Anneke and Laurie enrich the small-town setting and deepen Jean's world, adding layers to the overall narrative.",
            "The small-town setting is vividly depicted, enhanced by a diverse cast of characters that enrich the narrative. The seaside backdrop and selkie folklore contribute to a mystical atmosphere, though I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of the folklore itself."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a beautifully written sapphic retelling of selkie folklore, blending romance, mystery, and tension in a small-town setting. While the pacing is uneven at times and the ending could have been more substantial, the strong characters, emotional depth, and atmospheric storytelling make it a captivating read. I particularly enjoyed the dynamic between Jean and Muirin, as well as the gradual unraveling of Tobias's true nature. Despite its minor flaws, it’s a gorgeous and memorable story.",

            "While the story is somewhat predictable, a common trait in folktale retellings, the journey is engaging and skillfully crafted. Knowing the outcome did not detract from my enjoyment of the book.",
            "**Jean (Protagonist):** Plucky, determined, and realistic, Jean's independence oscillates between strength and flaw, yet she remains a sympathetic figure throughout. **Muirin:** A tragic yet resilient character, Muirin's cleverness and wit create memorable moments, particularly in her first scene at the window. **Anneke:** A well-rounded, sharp, and intelligent character, Anneke's Mi'kmaq representation enriches the setting and period. **Laurie:** Sweet and somewhat foolish, Laurie serves as a bright spot in the narrative, despite the potential for tragedy. **Tobias (Antagonist):** Deeply unsettling and horrifyingly real, Tobias is an effective and memorable villain. The romance is tenderly developed, making it a standout element of the story. While the pacing is generally excellent, the climax feels somewhat clumsy and rushed, lacking finesse. This Sapphic retelling of a Celtic folktale fills a gap in the market for high-quality Sapphic stories in preferred genres, and the inclusion of Mi'kmaq characters adds authenticity and depth to the narrative.",
            "The prose in this book is gorgeous, moody, and captivating, drawing readers in with its inviting tone. The author’s background in the Les Mis Tumblr fandom likely honed their writing skills, resulting in high-quality prose. The narrative masterfully captures a classic Gothic mood, set against the backdrop of windswept Nova Scotia, where the vivid atmosphere of wind, snow, and salt spray comes to life."

            "The first 100 pages were challenging to engage with, as Jean's character felt distant and the story conveyed a dreamlike sense of isolation that lingered. While the internal drama could have been more pronounced, Jean's mildness ultimately suited her character.",
            "Initially, I was hesitant about the married girl x single girl dynamic due to its common association with adultery in queer narratives, but I ultimately found it engaging. I loved Laurie and Dal as characters, though Jo's prominence at the beginning felt overwhelming. I wished Jean had moved on from Jo before developing feelings for Muirin, as the buildup to Jo's return felt unresolved. The reveal of Jo and the ensuing drama came too late in the story, around page 150, disrupting the flow of Jean and Muirin's relationship development. Additionally, Jean's outburst regarding the sealskin felt out of character, given her usual kindness, and I would have preferred more buildup to that moment. While Jean's mild personality made it difficult to connect with her at first, she eventually grew on me as a subtle yet compelling character. The intimacy scenes were well-crafted—neither overly tropey nor excessively metaphorical. I was also pleasantly surprised by Kiel, the child character, who was portrayed with depth, a rarity in stories featuring children.",
            "The author's upbeat writing style, evident from their Tumblr, shines throughout the book. Jean's direct communication is both refreshing and skillfully executed.",
            "This charming domestic story beautifully intertwines themes of freedom and belonging. The consistent seal motif is a delightful touch. I found the choice of a midwife as the main character refreshing, as it offers a unique perspective I haven't encountered before. The nuanced portrayal of Jean's church attendance alongside her sexuality was particularly well-executed. I also enjoyed the elements of the ocean, cooking, and the tender relationships between the girls. The selkie family was endearing, and the language barriers added an intriguing layer to the narrative."

His denial of wrongdoing and his descent into chaos as he loses control over Muirin are particularly poignant. The novel juxtaposes his yearning for a fairytale romance grounded in control with the wild, untamed power of the sea and the fishing town backdrop.

Additionally, it offers a subtle critique of the white settler mindset while remaining authentic to its setting.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Themes and Concept:**  \n   - The novel is a sapphic selkie tale, which I find incredibly appealing.  \n   - Sutherland uses the original Selkie Wife tale as a foundation but cleverly positions Jean outside of it, allowing both Jean and Muirin to examine the tale critically and restore agency to Muirin much sooner.  \n\n- **Representation and Historical Context:**  \n   - As a queer historical fantasy, the novel effectively balances historical homophobia and attitudes with a diverse cast of queer characters and supportive individuals.  \n   - It subtly critiques the white settler mindset while maintaining authenticity.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Atmosphere:**  \n   - Jean and Muirin's romance is filled with tense yearning, which aligns beautifully with the descriptions of the weather, locale, and the overarching tension created by Tobias.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Abuse Themes:**  \n   - Tobias's role in the story is compelling, showcasing how control manifests in abusive relationships. His refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing and his spiral as he loses control over Muirin are particularly striking.  \n   - The novel contrasts his desire for a \"fairytale romance\" rooted in control with the natural, uncontrollable power of the sea and the fishing town setting.  \n\n- **Expectations and Satisfaction:**  \n   - The novel met all my expectations, delivering a story I knew I would love.  \n   - While some additional spice would have been welcome, the existing romantic elements fit well with the overall atmosphere.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n   - I am eagerly looking forward to more works from Sutherland.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sapphic selkie tale masterfully blends historical fantasy, queer representation, and themes of agency and control.

            "This book struggles with pacing issues, particularly in the relationship between the two main characters. The beginning moves too quickly, while the middle drags on, largely due to excessive introspection that slows the narrative and nearly makes it tedious. Additionally, the coincidental nature of the finale feels implausible, even for a fantasy rooted in folktale elements. I found the connection between Laurie's and Jean's stories unconvincing, and there were moments when I couldn't help but roll my eyes at how conveniently everything resolves for the characters.",
            "In this story, our heroine Jean is both likable and feisty, yet grounded. While I also appreciated Muirinn, I felt we didn't get to know her as deeply; I struggled to pinpoint her personality. Jean, as the narrator, shines in conveying the events, but the relationship between the two feels rushed. It's not quite instalove, but it comes close, and the pace of their developing interest felt a bit too swift for my liking.",
            "A Sweet Sting of Salt is one of the most beautifully written books I've encountered in a long time. Sutherland expertly crafts stunning sentences, using language creatively without sacrificing accessibility. Given the quality of the writing and the overall feel of the novel, I was surprised to learn that this is her debut."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite some pacing issues, underdeveloped characters, and an overly coincidental finale, *A Sweet Sting of Salt* is a beautifully written debut novel. The lush prose and engaging narrative make it a worthwhile read, and the author's potential is evident. While there are areas for improvement, the book leaves a lasting impression and sets high expectations for the author's future works.",

The tension between Muirin and Tobias, combined with Jean’s determination to help, made for a compelling story. While I wished for more development of certain characters like Dal, the overall narrative was engaging and satisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The third act felt somewhat disjointed, with characters making implausible decisions to advance the plot. For instance, it was hard to believe that Jean would trust Tobias to leave Muriel alone after everything that had happened. Although I was relieved by the ending, it was somewhat amusing how perfectly everything resolved for the characters, which felt at odds with the story's overall tone.

It’s enigmatic, lyrical, and carries a somewhat gothic essence. The setting in Nova Scotia adds to its captivating nature once the story grabs hold of you.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Muirin immediately drew me in and is likely the primary reason I stuck with the story.

In hindsight, I regret this decision as it inadvertently spoiled certain aspects of the story. While some suggest researching the subject beforehand, I personally disagree.  \n\n- **Themes and Content Warnings:**  \n  The novel explores heavy themes, including suicide/death, abusive relationships, marital rape (reference), animal death, pregnancy/childbirth, kidnapping, homophobia, and violence/blood.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Recommendation:**  \n  If you’re a fan of folklore and enjoy picturesque, atmospheric reads, this book is a perfect fit for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a slow start, the novel’s lyrical writing, gothic atmosphere, and compelling characters make it a captivating read.

I appreciated learning about this story and seeing it reimagined through a WLW (women-loving-women) lens.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  While the story was engaging, the middle section dragged significantly and could have benefited from stronger or more developed plot lines to maintain momentum.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the pacing issues, it was a solid read, especially fitting for Pride month, and I enjoyed the unique perspective it offered.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel beautifully explores the Selkie Wife lore through a fresh WLW perspective. While the pacing in the middle could have been tighter, it remains a worthwhile and enjoyable read, particularly for Pride month.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I found myself very immersed in the story. Though I don’t live in Nova Scotia, I have visited Mahone Bay and was fully envisioning the scenes and town in my head as a reference.

The newborn is peculiar, and although Muirin's husband appears ordinary, an unsettling aura surrounds the family. As Jean's bond with Muirin deepens, she grapples with the uncertainty of whether her actions are driven by reality or her growing feelings for Muirin.",

While she expresses concern about settler colonialism, she takes no meaningful action. Additionally, her Indigenous friend and mentor is portrayed similarly to other characters, with only superficial mentions of her skin color and vague references to discrimination. This treatment feels problematic, as it risks normalizing Indigenous communities through a lens of assimilation.",

The cadence of the character voices and the atmospheric narration of the scenes added depth to the experience.\n\n- **Overall Appeal:**  \n  This is an engrossing and captivating read that I would highly recommend to lovers of historical fairy tales.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Sweet Sting of Salt* is a beautifully rendered novel that blends history, magical realism, and sapphic romance into a compelling and thought-provoking story. It defied my initial expectations and left me thoroughly impressed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story unfolds at a slower pace, fitting for the historical fiction genre, but it does experience a noticeable drag around the 45% mark, where the lack of action becomes somewhat tedious. An early time jump, where Muirin spends five days with Jean, feels abrupt and could benefit from additional scenes to create a smoother transition. This novel weaves a selkie/mermaid tale with a sapphic romance set against a darker, melancholic backdrop, which I found particularly appealing. Based on a folktale, I appreciated approaching it without expectations, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the narrative. The plot centers on Jean, a midwife in mid-1800s Nova Scotia, who becomes entwined with Muirin, a mysterious woman with a troubled past. The story thoughtfully explores themes of love, loss, and societal constraints.",

Muirin emerges as a compelling love interest, possessing her own agency despite her passive circumstances. The connection between Jean's past love and loss with Jo deepens the romance with Muirin, lending it authenticity and emotional weight. The novel centers on an LGBT main character and a poignant, pining romance, exploring themes of love, loss, and societal constraints with nuance and sincerity.",

The story unfolds through the perspective of Jean, the village midwife with a troubled past marked by lost love. The plot centers on Jean's encounter with Muirin, a mysterious woman in labor, whom she helps deliver a baby. As the story progresses, Jean discovers that Muirin is married to a reclusive fisherman, and their relationship is fraught with unhappiness. The narrative skillfully weaves together elements of mystery, light suspense, and romance, culminating in a climax that, while predictable, remains satisfying. However, some sections of the plot feel slow, and tightening these moments could enhance the overall pacing and suspense.",

In contrast, Muirin is shrouded in mystery, her true nature revealed only at the end, which adds depth to her character.

Meanwhile, Muirin's husband serves as a dangerous antagonist, heightening tension and propelling the narrative forward.",

            "The story opens with Jean, a midwife, assisting her enigmatic neighbor, Muirin, during childbirth, which draws her deeper into the Silber family's secrets. The narrative unfolds at a deliberate pace, mirroring the slower rhythms of 1800s life, while tension builds around Jean's growing suspicions about Muirin. However, the climax and resolution—particularly the revelations about selkies and Jean's past—feel rushed, undermining the story's believability. While the slow pacing effectively enhances the atmosphere and builds suspense, the abrupt conclusion disrupts the overall flow. Repeated details about seals and the sea enrich the setting and reinforce the themes, though the integration of selkie lore could have been smoother.",
            "Jean is a compassionate and determined protagonist, motivated by her concern for Muirin and her discomfort with Tobias. The tension in the story is heightened by Muirin's mysterious behavior and Tobias's intimidating presence. Side characters, such as Laurie, enrich the narrative with depth and humor, while also exploring themes of queerness, acceptance, and the impact of secrets on relationships.",
            "This story delves into themes of longing for connection—both with others and the sea—through its portrayal of seals, the ocean, and family dynamics. The retelling of *The Selkie Wife* myth is intricately woven into the narrative, with subtle hints about selkies throughout, though the final revelation comes across as abrupt. Jean's tense interactions with Tobias and her repressed history with Jo add emotional depth and suspense to the story."

        "conclusion": "*A Sweet Sting of Salt* is a compelling retelling of *The Selkie Wife* with well-developed characters and a strong sense of atmosphere. The slow buildup of tension and the exploration of themes like connection and secrecy are highlights, but the rushed resolution and uneven pacing detract from the overall experience. Despite these flaws, the novel offers an engaging and thought-provoking read.",

            "The novel concludes on a satisfying note, enhanced by the author's insightful note that adds depth to the narrative. The author reinterprets the original tale, shifting the focus from pity for the fisherman to emphasizing the significance of consent and freedom in love.",
            "Jean, the heroine, is both well-developed and relatable. Her compelling sense of helplessness, paired with her determination to fight for what’s right despite the dangers, resonates deeply. I found myself fully supporting her decisions, experiencing her strength and vulnerability throughout the story.",
            "The original folktale grapples with troubling themes such as kidnapping and sexual violence, which the author addresses in her note. In her reimagining, she transforms it into a queer historical fiction romance, breathing new life into the narrative. The novel highlights the importance of love as a choice, starkly opposing the original's depiction of coerced relationships.",
            "I approached the book expecting a historical fiction/romance, not a fantasy retelling. The surprising reveal near the end caught me off guard, and I wish there had been clearer clues throughout to signal the fantasy elements earlier. While I may have overlooked hints about Muirin’s magical nature, a more explicit indication would have better grounded the story in its fantasy setting from the start."

While the fantasy elements could have been more clearly signaled earlier, the story’s strong character development and thoughtful adaptation of the original folktale make it a satisfying and impactful novel.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Knowledge of the Source Material:**\n   - I think it would have helped to know the folktale *The Selkie Wife* before reading the novel. I missed the bold type in the synopsis and didn’t realize until nearly the end that this was a fantasy retelling.\n   - A quick 3-minute reference to the original tale would have been useful, as I was unaware of the story of selkies—seals who shed their skins to become beautiful women on land.\n\n- **Genre Expectations:**\n   - I went into the book thinking it was a historical fiction/romance novel, not a fantasy retelling. The reveal near the end was surprising, and I wish there had been more obvious clues throughout the text to signal the fantasy elements earlier.\n   - I’m not sure if I missed hints about Muirin’s magical nature, but a clearer indication would have helped ground the story in its fantasy setting sooner.\n\n- **Themes and Adaptation:**\n   - The original folktale involves problematic themes like kidnapping and r*pe, which the author, Rose Sutherland, acknowledges in her note. She reimagines the story as a queer historical fiction romance, giving it new life.\n   - The novel emphasizes that love must be freely given and accepted, contrasting with the original tale’s portrayal of forced relationships.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Jean, the heroine, is well-developed and relatable. Her sense of helplessness and her determination to fight for what’s right, despite the danger, are compelling.\n   - The reader can’t help but agree with Jean’s decisions, feeling her strength and vulnerability throughout the story.\n\n- **Ending and Author’s Note:**\n   - The novel ends satisfyingly, and the author’s note adds depth to the story. Sutherland explains how she reinterpreted the original tale, rejecting the idea of feeling sorry for the fisherman and instead highlighting the importance of consent and freedom in love.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*A Sweet Sting of Salt* is a worthy read, blending historical fiction, romance, and fantasy into a compelling narrative. While the fantasy elements could have been more clearly signaled earlier, the story’s strong character development and thoughtful adaptation of the original folktale make it a satisfying and impactful novel.

            "The story had a few pacing issues that detracted from my enjoyment. Much of the novel felt like a waiting game as Jean hesitated to act while Tobias escalated his threats against her. Additionally, Jean's reaction to seeing Muirin's pelt for the first time felt out of character. It seemed like the author intended this moment to serve as a final conflict before the resolution, but it instead came off as a sudden regression in Jean's character. Given what we knew about her, her cruelty towards something so precious to Muirin felt inconsistent and frustrating. I was also surprised that Jean never connected the dots regarding Muirin's true identity, especially since selkies were known to inhabit the local town. Her failure to recognize the obvious signs felt willful and added to my frustration.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Descriptions:**  \n  The descriptions of the scenery were great, and I think Sutherland did a strong job of creating a vivid atmosphere.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters of all the key players were well-developed. I especially liked Jean's dream sequences, which were a clever way to convey her subconscious feelings without resorting to monologues about her working through complex emotions.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  There were a few points that dragged for me. A lot of the novel felt like a waiting game for Jean to take action while Tobias escalated threats of violence against her.  \n\n- **Plot Logic and Character Decisions:**  \n  I was surprised that Jean never pieced together Muirin's true identity despite the obvious signs. Given that selkies had taken up residence in the local town, it seemed unlikely that Jean wouldn’t have encountered the folklore at some point. Her inability to connect the dots felt willful and frustrating.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  Jean's reaction to seeing Muirin's pelt for the first time felt out of character. It seemed like Sutherland introduced this as a final conflict before the resolution, but it came across as a sudden character regression. Given what we knew about Jean, her cruelty about something so precious to Muirin felt inconsistent and aggravating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this novel for its strong character development and vivid descriptions. However, the pacing lagged at times, and some character decisions, particularly Jean's inability to piece together Muirin's identity and her out-of-character reaction, detracted from the story's cohesion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This retelling of the selkie fairy tale, specifically \"The Selkie Wife,\" introduces readers to the enchanting concept of selkies—seals that can transform into humans. The love story between the selkie and the human is more genuine and thoughtfully crafted than many contemporary romance novels.",
            "I selected this book, along with *Diavola*, for my April Aardvark Book Subscription box, and I was thrilled to find it signed.",
            "This novel beautifully captures a Gothic atmosphere, which I thoroughly enjoyed. As the story unfolds, a palpable sense of dread intensifies. Tobias, the fisherman from the classic fairy tale, emerges as a menacing figure, increasingly threatening to the protagonist, Jean. Her refusal to back down and her bold choices heighten the tension. Set against the backdrop of a cold, dark winter in early 1800s Nova Scotia, the mood is both compelling and immersive. While the novel incorporates many Gothic elements, it lacks some traditional aspects of the genre; nonetheless, it effectively conveys the overall mood.",
            "I appreciated the LGBT twist in this retelling; it added a refreshing layer to the story."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This was a very good read that I thoroughly enjoyed. It combines a unique retelling of a lesser-known fairy tale with a sapphic romance and a Gothic atmosphere. The tension, dread, and well-crafted relationship make it stand out, and I’d highly recommend it to fans of the genre.",

            "While romance is a central theme, it didn't resonate with me on an emotional level. I appreciated the wlw (women-loving-women) reinterpretation of the myth, but the romantic scenes between Jean and Muirin lacked impact. Jean, the protagonist, stood out as an independent and resourceful character, embodying a very human complexity. Muirin's characterization was also strong, particularly her journey to learn to speak and the poignant revelation of her backstory. Surprisingly, Laurie became my favorite character, which is rare for me as I typically don't favor male characters. The portrayal of LGBTQ+ relationships in a historical context was well-executed, especially Jean's past relationship with Jo, which felt authentic and believable.",
            "The writing style was captivating, drawing me in from the start. The author's meticulous attention to detail created an immersive setting. Additionally, the interview and author’s notes at the end provided valuable insight, revealing the intent to emphasize the cruelty of the original myth while subverting its misogynistic undertones.",
            "Set in a charming Scottish seaside village, the story offers an immersive experience. The reinterpretation of the selkie wife legend is captivating, especially since I approached it without prior knowledge of the myth. The book thoughtfully explores the original myth's cruelty while critiquing the normalized misogyny in traditional tales, making for a compelling and well-executed narrative.",
            "This book skillfully critiques the ingrained misogyny in traditional tales without resorting to heavy-handed moralizing. It powerfully conveys Muirin’s despair and Jean’s gradual awakening to the truth. This compelling narrative inspired me to explore more novels that reinterpret classic tales and legends."

            "The story leans towards magical realism, incorporating fantastical elements that serve as intriguing puzzles rather than dominating the narrative. Set over a brief timeframe—excluding the epilogue and flashbacks—it focuses on two main characters, Jean and Muirin. The tension throughout is palpable, creating a sense of worry that feels strikingly authentic.",
            "The LGBT twist introduces a compelling secret for Jean, establishing a parallel between her and Muirin, both harboring hidden truths. The characters are relatable, and the fresh interpretation of the fairy tale through this lens is truly engaging.",
            "The writing is both thoughtful and engaging, making the story a pleasure to read.",
            "Set in late 1800s Nova Scotia, the story subtly explores the lives of women and LGBT individuals of the era. Its unique blend of historical fiction and fairy tale elements evokes a distinct atmosphere, reminiscent of *Lone Women* and *The Warm Hands of Ghosts*, yet maintains a lighter approach to fantasy.",
            "I suggest skipping the Goodreads blurb, as it reveals a major plot twist. It's much more enjoyable to guess and RAFO (Read and Find Out). This adaptation of the fairy tale is unique, and I appreciated the fresh perspective it provided."

The focus on two main characters and the tense, worried atmosphere make the story feel realistic and engaging. The LGBT twist and the secrets surrounding the characters add depth, while the setting provides a unique backdrop.",

It’s more fun to guess and RAFO (Read and Find Out).  \n  - I haven’t read another adaptation of this particular fairy tale, and I really enjoyed the fresh perspective it offered.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a lovely blend of historical fiction and fairy tale, with a relatable interpretation and thoughtful writing.

The concept sent me down a rabbit hole of online research and reading on all things selkie.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is swift and captivating, with just the right amount of detail. I found the book to be a surprisingly good read from start to finish.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship:**  \n  The romantic relationship isn’t heavily emphasized, which I didn’t mind at all. I was more invested in the selkie folklore, the overall drama, and the vivid descriptions of the village and the era. However, readers looking for a strong romantic focus might be disappointed.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The book delivers meaningful messages on queer and women’s rights, tolerance for those different from us, independence, self-reliance, mental health, and healthy relationships. These themes are woven into the story without being heavy-handed. The representation of diverse characters—such as cultural and ethnic minorities, a neurodivergent boy, and the mythical selkies—added depth and interest.  \n\n- **Retelling of Folklore:**  \n  Sutherland’s loose retelling of the selkie folklore was a success. The blend of serious drama and light-hearted magic made the story engaging and memorable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and appreciated the author’s ability to balance folklore, drama, and meaningful themes.

The love story is sweet, and the slow pace and atmosphere are pitch-perfect.  \n\n- **Setting and Descriptions:**  \n  I’m a sucker for Canadians describing the deep impact the natural world has on their protagonists. Jean’s remote cottage and bustling village life felt so real and vivid.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Representation:**  \n  Although the language barrier between Jean and Muirin results in a slightly awkward ‘lore drop’ chapter towards the end, it’s worth it to see a character otherwise made voiceless (both by the language barrier and her material circumstances) make her side of the story perfectly clear.  \n\n- **Themes and Folklore:**  \n  This is a perfect balm to a retelling of the same legend I read several years ago, which sided with the Tobias of its own story. Animal brides, and selkies specifically, are a favourite folk tale of mine, and I was so happy to see one with a queer twist—and multiple queer characters, at that!  \n\n- **Personal Reflection and Humor:**  \n  In conclusion: I am proud to be the number one Tobias hater, and it’s memorialised forever in the author’s note. 🐐🦭🦊🌊  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a beautifully crafted, atmospheric love story with a strong connection to nature and folklore. Its queer twist on the selkie legend, vivid setting, and nuanced character dynamics make it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story is beautifully crafted, featuring immersive language, especially in the portrayal of the Selkie Muirin, which must have been a challenge to develop. The plot unfolds seamlessly, keeping me engaged and eager to discover what happens next.",
            "While the story of a Selkie holds great potential for magic, it leans more towards historical context than embracing the enchanting aspects of Selkie lore. This focus on the historical period feels like a missed opportunity, especially when compared to works like *The Bear and the Nightingale* by Katherine Arden, which skillfully intertwine magic with their narratives.",
            "The portrayal of same-sex attraction in the historical context occasionally felt unrealistic, particularly towards the end. The level of societal acceptance depicted did not align with the historical era, which disrupted my immersion in the story and undermined its realism."

        "conclusion": "While the novel is beautifully written and engaging, its historical realism falters in its portrayal of societal acceptance, and it doesn’t fully explore the magical aspects of its Selkie premise.

            "The story's pacing at the beginning felt slower than I would have liked, impacting my overall engagement. I believe that a deeper exploration of the silkie myth could have enriched the experience for readers unfamiliar with the folklore. Nevertheless, the novel is an urgent and mystical queer love story that delves into the idea of finding a soulmate in unexpected places and the courage needed to pursue one's desires. It weaves in elements of Irish and Scottish folklore, evoking a sense of mystery and nostalgia. Additionally, the portrayal of an idyllic community where same-sex couples can live openly is both refreshing and uplifting.",
            "In this story, I found myself waiting longer than expected to connect with the characters, as the emotional bond developed slowly. The supernatural twist lacked surprise, likely due to the book jacket summary, which diminished its impact. However, the novel deserves praise for presenting a queer love story in a general-audience format, focusing on the narrative rather than the protagonists' sexual orientation. I appreciate the recent trend in literature toward more inclusive storytelling.",
            "The beautifully depicted scenery is a standout feature of the story. The idyllic, accepting community setting adds a unique and appealing dimension to the narrative."

While the pacing and character development could be improved, the novel offers a refreshing take on queer representation and features beautifully described settings. It is a worthwhile read for fans of mythology and inclusive storytelling.",

The struggles they faced in the story’s era added depth and relevance.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend this book to fans of retellings, especially those interested in queer reframings of classic tales.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was an enjoyable and engaging read, blending classic storytelling with modern themes of diversity and representation. While the foreshadowing felt predictable at times, the strong character development and thoughtful pacing made it a worthwhile addition to the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Personal Connection and Themes:**  \n  I’ve been obsessed with selkie myths, particularly sapphic variations, since I was young, and this novel deeply resonated with me. The themes of yearning, the atmospheric setting, and the endearing characters were beautifully woven together.  \n\n- **Character Decisions and Believability:**  \n  I found it difficult to understand a couple of the main character’s decisions. Specifically, her lack of suspicion about Tobias at the beginning felt unrealistic. As a midwife, I expected her to be more cautious about recognizing signs of abuse and less inclined to push a wife back to a husband she seemed afraid of. Additionally, her reaction to finding the seal pelt didn’t align with her cultural awareness of selkie myths. While I understand these choices heightened dramatic tension, they required significant suspension of disbelief, especially when she assumed the worst of the woman she loves.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel captivated me with its themes, atmosphere, and characters, but some character decisions felt inconsistent and required me to overlook certain logical gaps.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5 stars (knocked off one star for the believability issues mentioned)."

            "I have a strong aversion to the fantasy trope where a character remains consistently blindsided and acts without intelligence for no valid reason. While initial confusion is understandable, it becomes frustrating when, after 300 pages, the character still seems incapable of critical thought. It takes an unreasonably long time for them to even suspect what’s happening, and after realizing their poor decisions, they promptly repeat the same mistakes. However, I found myself emotionally attached to Muirin, especially because her broken English added depth and charm to her character."

The story offers a refreshing twist on the selkie myth, which I found unique and interesting.\n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n  The writing was vivid and engaging, allowing me to clearly picture the chilly seaside where most of the book takes place. The atmosphere was well-crafted and immersive.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Tobias was disturbingly realistic in the way he tries to impose his will on the women around him. His portrayal added depth to the narrative and felt authentic.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Resolution:**  \n  The ending felt a little rushed, possibly because Jean’s realization about Muirin was sudden and seemed slightly delayed. Despite this, the overall pacing was enjoyable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a unique and engaging read that I would recommend to anyone looking for a fresh take on the selkie myth. While the ending felt a bit rushed, the vivid writing, immersive atmosphere, and realistic character portrayals made it a memorable experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The concept was intriguing and captivating.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The novel felt a bit long, and the inner dialogue became repetitive at times, which affected the flow.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  At its roots, the story was well-written, with a strong narrative foundation.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were compelling, and I felt very strongly about them, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Themes:**  \n  I found myself conflicted about how women were portrayed as being treated by men with no recourse. While it was frustrating, I reminded myself that this might be the most historically accurate aspect of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its length and repetitive inner dialogue, the novel was well-written with a fascinating concept and deeply engaging characters. The portrayal of gender dynamics, while unsettling, may reflect historical accuracy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The characters quickly won me over. Tobias is expertly crafted; he initially appears to be a great guy and loving husband, yet there's an unsettling hint that something is amiss. His transformation from a seemingly nice man to a true monster is both sinister and realistic, showcasing the author's skillful storytelling. Jean is a strong, diplomatic character who adeptly navigates a man's world, despite her disdain for having to do so. Muirin is portrayed as an intelligent adult, skillfully avoiding the common trope of helplessness due to her language barrier. The love story between Jean and Muirin unfolds sweetly and naturally, evolving from friendship to romance—arguably the best way for a relationship to develop. I never felt uncomfortable with their relationship, especially as it becomes clear that Tobias deserves everything coming to him. Muirin openly expresses her preference for Jean, who treats her with respect and as an equal.",
            "The author excels in storytelling, particularly in the development of Tobias's character and Muirin's chilling reactions that reveal the harshness of her reality. The subtle indicators of a toxic relationship are depicted with realism, making it relatable for anyone familiar with similar situations.",
            "The book explores the status of women in the colonies, highlighting rigid gender roles and the authority men wielded within their families. Men made decisions unilaterally, from naming their children to restricting their wives' social interactions. Tobias's portrayal of sexism is nuanced and realistic, enhancing its seriousness and impact.",

            "The story centers on Jean, a midwife in a small Nova Scotia fishing village, and her connection with Muiren, a pregnant woman she assists during a pivotal time. The exploration of their relationship, Muiren's abusive husband Tobias, and the secret Muiren harbors is both compelling and emotionally resonant. However, the pacing of the narrative often feels slow. A more concise version, around 200-250 pages, with a sharper focus on their central relationship, would have strengthened the overall impact.",
            "Jean is a relatable protagonist with a heartbreaking past, and her growth throughout the story is satisfying. Muiren, a Gaelic-speaking woman trapped in an abusive marriage, is a poignant character, and her dynamic with Jean is the book's highlight. Tobias, Muiren’s husband, is effectively depicted as a harsh, possessive antagonist.",

            "The character-driven plot isn't usually my preference, and while I found it challenging at times, there were moments that fully engaged me and kept me eager to read on. However, the pacing was slow and inconsistent, especially in the middle 50-80%, where the story became repetitive. The cat-and-mouse dynamic between Tobias and Jean, along with Jean's obsessive thoughts about Muirin, felt circular and slowed the narrative. I longed for more subplots or faster-moving elements to sustain the momentum.",
            "Initially, Jean's character voice was strong, but it diminished in the second half as her obsession with Muirin took over, leaving her feeling static and one-dimensional. Laurie emerged as a standout minor character, effectively serving as Jean’s foil, yet his development felt underutilized. I would have appreciated more parallels between his and Jean’s journeys earlier in the story. Additionally, the romantic relationship between Jean and Muirin lacked depth, rushing from attraction to declarations of love without sufficient development.",
            "The writing is atmospheric, wistful, and lonely, evoking a classical tone reminiscent of Jane Austen and Emily Brontë. This style effectively immerses the reader in the story's darker themes. However, the heavy focus on introspection, with minimal dialogue or action, can create an imbalance. Many chapters begin with lengthy musings from Jean's perspective, which, while capturing her loneliness, can make the reading experience feel taxing at times.",
            "The selkie mythology in the story is captivating, but the narrative suffers from insufficient world-building. Additional discussions about the town or deeper lore on selkies could have helped Jean uncover Muirin’s truth more organically. The revelation of Muirin as a selkie feels abrupt, as Jean misses several obvious clues. A more robust mythological foundation would have strengthened the plot. However, the Nova Scotia-inspired town is hauntingly beautiful and vividly portrayed through Jean’s experiences, making the atmospheric setting one of the novel's standout features.",
            "I eagerly anticipated this ARC, especially with the arrival of autumn. The synopsis promised a dark, cozy, atmospheric retelling of “The Selkie Wife.” However, as I was unfamiliar with selkie mythology, I read the first half of the novel without much context. After researching selkies, I discovered the plot trajectory, which ultimately made the story predictable."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a solid debut novel with a beautifully atmospheric setting and a classical writing style. While the character-driven plot and repetitive pacing were not entirely to my taste, the story had moments of engagement and emotional depth. The selkie mythology was intriguing but could have been better integrated into the world-building. Jean’s character started strong but became less dynamic as the story progressed. Despite its flaws, the novel offered a haunting and immersive reading experience.",

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the novel, where the pacing was excellent and the slow buildup kept me engaged as Jean uncovers the unsettling truth. However, the second half falters; the romance feels rushed and awkwardly tacked on, and the prolonged interactions with the villagers disrupt the story's momentum.",
            "As the story progresses past the halfway mark, it veers into a territory where the characters can’t be seen as problematic. The return of the ex to offer her blessing feels overly convenient, and the epilogue, while sweet, borders on saccharine. Overall, the narrative seems to shy away from deeper, more challenging conflicts.",
            "While I understand the author's hesitation in today's publishing climate, where there's pressure to meet specific expectations, I can't help but feel disappointed. Ursula Le Guin once argued that we stifle genre growth by giving out free passes, and this novel seems to have played it safe."

The novel has a very moody, almost folk horror atmosphere that would hit a lot harder in the autumn rather than the middle of summer. The tone doesn’t lend itself well to blue skies and day-drinking margaritas.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  I really loved the first half of the novel. The pacing was great, with a slow buildup as Jean pieces together that something isn’t quite right. However, the plot loses itself a little bit in the second half. The romance feels rushed and awkwardly inserted, and there’s a lot of dawdling with the villagers that slows the momentum.  \n\n- **Character and Conflict Resolution:**  \n  Past the halfway point, things start drifting into \"we can't have our characters being PROBLEMATIC now\" territory. The ex coming back to give her blessing felt too convenient, and the epilogue was so sweet it became saccharine. It felt like the story avoided deeper, more challenging conflicts.  \n\n- **Genre and Creative Integrity:**  \n  Part of me wanted to say that I can’t blame the author for backing down in the current publishing environment, where there’s pressure to cater to certain expectations, like \"handing the gays whatever they want.\" But then I thought about Ursula Le Guin’s perspective on how we can’t grow as a genre if we start handing out free passes. This novel felt like it played it safe, which was disappointing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has a strong start with its moody atmosphere and slow, intriguing buildup, it falters in the second half with rushed romance, convenient resolutions, and a lack of deeper conflict. The tone and themes would have been more impactful in a different season, and the story’s avoidance of complexity left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

It offers a sweet retelling of a well-known folktale, though it could have been more impactful with tighter storytelling and deeper exploration of its characters.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3 ⭐️"

The narrative then shifts to a fairytale-like tone when a mysterious, non-English-speaking woman arrives at Jean's doorstep to give birth, seemingly fleeing her husband.

Jean becomes deeply invested in freeing this woman from her husband’s grasp.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  The atmosphere is one of the strongest elements of the book, evoking a vivid sense of place and mood. At times, it reminded me of *A Frozen River*, creating a compelling and immersive backdrop for the story.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt uneven to me. While the story drew me in initially, I wished the central reveal had occurred earlier, allowing more time to explore the characters’ lives afterward. The epilogue provided answers but felt rushed, leaving me wanting more depth in that final section.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel blends historical fiction with a fairytale-like quality, offering a unique and atmospheric read. While the pacing and rushed epilogue detracted slightly from my enjoyment, the story’s emotional depth and setting were standout elements.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "The book opens with a scene of young Jean witnessing a ship explosion, which feels disconnected from the main narrative. The pacing is generally slow, with considerable time devoted to building up to the central conflict. However, the final ten chapters rush through events, creating a jarring contrast to the earlier, more measured pace. Jean’s curiosity about Muirin’s predicament leads to significant trouble for everyone involved. Muirin’s hesitance to fully explain her situation, even after acquiring some language skills, adds tension but comes off as contrived. Additionally, Tobias’s true nature is revealed late in the story, leaving the conflict feeling rushed and underdeveloped.",
            "Jean is a relatable character, especially in her disdain for others and her determination to restore her reputation. However, Muirin's ability to master tasks in just a week feels unrealistic and detracts from her believability. Anneke emerges as a standout favorite, thanks to her no-nonsense attitude and straightforward demeanor.",
            "The selkie retelling serves as a central theme, yet it feels underdeveloped until the very end. The language barrier between Jean and Muirin is employed as a plot device to prolong the reveal, which can be frustrating. Consequently, the selkie storyline is introduced and explained too late in the book, diminishing its impact and making it feel more like a minor element than a driving force.",
            "The romance in the story feels underdeveloped and unconvincing, particularly given that Muirin is married to Tobias for much of the narrative. Additionally, Jean's infatuation with Muirin progresses too rapidly, resulting in a connection that feels rushed and unnatural."

            "The story begins with a strong pace but soon hits a lull, making it challenging to stay engaged at times. The magical elements are primarily introduced toward the end, and I would have preferred to see them integrated more throughout the narrative. This sapphic reimagining of the selkie wife folktale is set in 1830s Nova Scotia and follows Jean, a 24-year-old midwife and spinster living alone in a remote coastal cottage. When she encounters Muirin, a mysterious woman in labor who speaks no English, they form a deep bond despite the language barrier. Tension mounts as Muirin’s husband, threatened by rumors about Jean, issues an ultimatum to keep the women apart.",
            "Jean is a well-crafted protagonist, though some of her choices, especially in moments of threat, can be frustrating. Muirin's enigmatic nature, amplified by a communication barrier, leaves their connection feeling underdeveloped. However, supporting characters like Anneke and Laurie enrich the narrative and provide enjoyable depth.",
            "The writing is atmospheric and vivid, creating a setting that's easy to visualize. The wintry ambiance makes it an ideal read for the Christmas season. The historical details and small-town relationships enrich the narrative, adding depth to the story.",
            "While the love-at-first-sight dynamic may resonate with some readers, I found myself craving greater depth in Jean and Muirin’s relationship. Nevertheless, the story effectively delves into themes of isolation, societal judgment, and forbidden love."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a well-done retelling of a classic folktale with a sapphic twist. While the atmospheric writing and historical details are strengths, the pacing and character development could have been more consistent. The magical elements felt underutilized until the end, but the story remains a unique and engaging take on a rarely retold tale.",

The discomfort it evokes is unsettling yet ultimately rewarding.",

All thoughts and opinions are entirely my own, and I am writing a voluntary review.\n\n- **Overall Impression and Rating:**\n   - A strong 3.5. This story was very clearly lovingly created.\n\n- **Mythological Basis and Accessibility:**\n   - I knew a little of the myth that it is based on, which is something that I think not too many people these days will actually know without having to look it up first. That's not a bad thing. You can go into this story knowing the basic premise or rules, or you can go in blind, and either way, you're in for a beautiful story.\n\n- **Tension and Pacing:**\n   - The true strength of this story is the tension that Sutherland is able to build throughout. Many of the beats of this tale are obvious, but the journey through them is filled with moments of acute unease. The setting of this story helps tremendously to add to the tension, and Sutherland does an excellent job at setting the stakes and slowly but surely raising the heat. It is at times uncomfortable, but in the best of ways.\n\n- **Romance and Themes:**\n   - The romance at the heart of the story is obvious from the outset, but it does feel earned in the end. It's also important that the story and myth speak to the need for acceptance of others, of autonomy of person, especially women, in a way that is unique (given the circumstances) and how the ideal can turn a good person inside out in order to achieve it, and keep it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a beautifully crafted story that builds tension masterfully and explores themes of acceptance and autonomy, particularly for women. The romance is well-earned, and the mythological basis adds depth, making it accessible whether you're familiar with the myth or not.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3.5/5"

The island’s superstitions and history of honoring certain practices were established early on but seemed to fade as the story progressed. This felt like a missed opportunity to deepen the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  Certain aspects of the plot felt unresolved or underdeveloped.

            "This novel presents a captivating twist on a classic fairy tale, and I found it thoroughly enjoyable, even without prior knowledge of the original story. It centers on Jean, a midwife in a small village who feels like an outcast. Although respected for her skills, she has only her mentor and the mentor's son as friends. The tension escalates when Jean discovers her neighbor Muirin in labor. Muirin and her husband, Tobias, live in seclusion, and communication is difficult due to Muirin's limited English. Growing increasingly suspicious of Tobias, Jean feels compelled to intervene in what she perceives as a dangerous situation, despite the risks involved. The pacing is engaging, with a gradual buildup of suspense that kept me invested throughout.",

Muirin, on the other hand, is both enigmatic and vulnerable, her limited English deepening the mystery of her circumstances. Meanwhile, Tobias serves as a menacing and controlling presence, heightening the tension and conflict throughout the narrative.",

However, the middle section (30-80%) drags, as Jean's thoughts and actions become repetitive, leading me to wonder if the story would advance meaningfully.

However, Jean's unhealthy obsession with Muirin adds depth to her character while also making her actions feel repetitive and occasionally frustrating.",
            "The writing is exquisite, especially in its vivid descriptions of the scenery and atmosphere. The cold, wet winter setting comes to life beautifully. However, the book is more character-driven than plot-driven, which may resonate with some readers but led to pacing issues for me.",

            "The building tension and looming violence captivated me, and the resolution prompted reflection. However, the author's choice to abruptly transform the village into a friendly, charming place felt rushed. Given the village's significant role during the heightened tensions, it would have been intriguing to see the main characters actively shape the narrative, address the suspicious circumstances, and win the villagers over on-screen. Instead, this crucial development is condensed into just two sentences, shifting the focus back to the lovers.",
            "I found their awkward romance enjoyable. An interesting observation is how English-speaking writers often depict language learners using simplistic infinitives to convey their limited understanding, such as \"You give me stick, I go bash monster.\" However, this approach overlooks the frequent grammatical errors learners make as they mimic what they've heard, like saying \"you giving me stick, I going bash the monster.\" In this book, the author creatively chose to employ Yoda's speech patterns to illustrate this concept."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the novel had its engaging moments, particularly with the awkward romance and the tension-filled conflict, the resolution felt rushed and underdeveloped. Additionally, the portrayal of a character learning English through Yoda-like speech patterns was an odd choice that detracted from the realism. Overall, it was a passable read.",

The way the author chose to resolve the situation in the village, with everything suddenly becoming friendly and charming as if by magic, felt a little rushed. Considering how much the opinion of the village mattered during the high tensions, it would have been very interesting to see the main characters carve a narrative, explain away the suspicious circumstances, and win the village over on-screen. Instead, there are only two sentences, and the focus shifts back to the lovers.  \n- **Character Speech Patterns:** Another odd detail: when English-speaking writers depict someone learning the language, they often resort to infinitives to show the character's primitive understanding, e.g., \"You give me stick, I go bash monster.\" What is missed is how often learners misuse grammatical structures, repeating what they've heard and putting together puzzle pieces without understanding the underlying patterns, like \"you giving me stick, I going bash the monster.\" In this book, the author opted to use the speech patterns of Yoda.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its engaging moments, particularly with the awkward romance and the tension-filled conflict, the resolution felt rushed and underdeveloped.

            "The story skillfully employs the selkie myth to delve into themes of solitude, community, and the conflict between societal expectations and natural instincts. However, Muirin's character feels underdeveloped; she primarily serves to advance Jean's journey rather than experience her own growth."

The detailed descriptions of Jean’s daily tasks and the structured lifestyle effectively immerse the reader in the time period. The contrast between societal norms and the wild, untamed nature aligns beautifully with the selkie myth.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The novel falls slightly short in character development, particularly with Muirin.

The historical elements are particularly strong, and with more focus on character depth, future works could be even more compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel is a strong entry into historical fiction, with vivid historical details and a compelling use of the selkie myth.

Their interactions focused on learning to communicate, but not much else happened.  \n- **Climax and Resolution:** The last 20% of the book was really good. It delivered suspense and finally provided the answers to the questions raised at the beginning.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started strong with intriguing mysteries, the middle section felt slow and lacked significant character or relationship development. However, the final portion redeemed the story with suspense and satisfying resolutions.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded down to 3).  \n\n*Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advance copy to read and review.*"

The setting and mood were vividly crafted, making the story immersive.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I loved the characters.

This mix-up affected my initial perception of the book.\n- **Pacing:** While I enjoyed the book overall, there were multiple slow parts that made the reading experience less engaging at times.\n- **Concept:** The concept of the book was interesting and reminded me of another book I’ve read, though I can’t recall the name.

The story lacked a strong climax and felt slow-paced, with excessive focus on descriptions of the weather, snow, seagulls, and Jean’s goats and vixen. The ending was predictable, and the epilogue left me somewhat confused.",
            "In this story, Jean Langille, a respected midwife, grapples with isolation stemming from rumors and personal loss. The heart of the narrative revolves around her relationship with Muirin, a mysterious and heavily pregnant woman. Jean's obsession with rescuing Muirin propels much of the plot. However, I found it challenging to connect with the characters, which hindered my engagement with their journeys.",
            "The book is beautifully written, featuring vivid descriptions of the coastal setting and natural elements. However, the heavy emphasis on scenery and the limited dialogue occasionally render the story stagnant.",
            "This book offers valuable insights into the queer and Mi’kmaq communities of 19th-century Nova Scotia, which I found particularly commendable. While the sapphic romance is a central theme, it is somewhat overshadowed by the slow pacing and underdeveloped characters.",
            "Based on the synopsis, I anticipated a stronger presence of magic and folklore, especially regarding selkies. However, these elements were largely absent until the final chapters, which was disappointing. The story ultimately fell short of my expectations for magical content."

The pacing is slow, often dwelling on Jean's internal struggles and inaction, which can make the narrative feel dull. The central conflict revolves around Jean's attempts to save Muirin from Tobias, but her naivety and lack of preparation render her efforts frustrating to follow. While the stakes are high, the execution of the tension feels repetitive and ultimately ineffective.",

Her introspective nature didn't resonate, making it difficult to stay invested in her journey. The central romance between Jean and Muirin was also disappointing. I typically enjoy sapphic longing, especially when infused with tragedy and angst, but this relationship missed the mark. Muirin's muteness and her husband's neglect introduced an intriguing dynamic, yet the connection between Jean and Muirin felt more mystical than grounded in meaningful dialogue or shared understanding.

Muirin’s inability to speak and her husband’s neglect created an interesting dynamic, but the connection between Jean and Muirin felt more mystical and intuitive rather than grounded in meaningful dialogue or shared understanding.

Initially, I thought I might be overreacting, but the overuse became increasingly irritating.  \n\n- **Plot Convenience:**  \n   - The story relies heavily on unrealistic coincidences, such as Jean being best friends with the only other queer person on the continent and both of them falling in love with selkies.

While there were moments of atmosphere that reminded me of *The Secret Garden*—like the wind-whipped moor and nighttime shrieking—it lacked the depth and intensity I associate with gothic storytelling. It wasn’t scary or immersive in the way I expected.  \n\n- **Romance and Themes:**  \n  At its core, this is a sapphic love story between a captured woman and a traumatized midwife.

However, the romantic relationship between Jean and Muirin feels rushed, with emotions developing unrealistically within a week.

It seemed like a forced decision to drive the plot and add unnecessary drama, which detracted from the believability of her actions.\n\n- **Epilogue and Themes:**  \n  The epilogue came across as overly simplistic and unrealistic. Specific elements, such as a selkie child wanting to domesticate a wild animal, the secondary antagonist being homophobic but not racist, and the entire village accepting the LGBTQ+ characters living in the woods, felt contrived and lacked depth. These choices undermined the story's thematic coherence.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had strengths in its pacing and atmospheric tension, the rushed romantic subplot, inconsistent character decisions, and overly simplistic epilogue ultimately detracted from my enjoyment. These issues led me to round my rating down.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5/5"

While it’s clear what Muirin likes about Jean, the reverse isn’t as evident.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n   - The plot so far (150 pages in) feels repetitive and uneventful.

            "The book centers on a toxic relationship that makes for an excruciating read, particularly from Jean's perspective. It relies on the familiar trope of historical fiction featuring two women in love, marked by constant torment, symbolic rain, and an abusive husband. This approach feels clichéd and uninspired.",
            "I found Jean to be a deeply unlikable character. From the moment she encounters Muirin, her obsession with her is palpable. The narrative attempts to frame this as love, but it reads more like an obsession fueled by curiosity, vengeance, and lust. Muirin had the potential to be an intriguing character, yet she is reduced to a mere prop—an idealized version of the perfect woman for Jean, despite Jean's criticism of Tobias for doing the same. Speaking of Tobias, he serves as a weak villain, lacking the depth and complexity needed to be compelling. The central relationship between Jean and Muirin is problematic; it lacks authenticity, as it is driven by Jean's obsession and Muirin's desire to escape her circumstances. This dynamic feels predictable and one-sided, devoid of any real emotional depth or connection between the characters.",

The late reveal of the selkie element and the author's cautious approach detract from what could have been a more engaging and bold story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."
