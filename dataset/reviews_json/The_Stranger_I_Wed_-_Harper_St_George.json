The connection between the two series is well-executed and adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The novel features an American heiress determined to marry an impoverished lord, but with a twist: both characters have secrets from their pasts that may or may not come to light. They are both politically progressive, agree to a marriage of convenience, and plan to separate after two years. This setup creates a slow-burn romance that builds tension and anticipation.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters, Meg and Leo, are well-developed and distinct. Neither comes from an affluent background, which sets them apart from typical Gilded Age protagonists. Meg is determined and resourceful, while Leo is portrayed as a progressive earl who is willing to compromise his morals for his wife’s reputation. Their emotional growth and evolving relationship are central to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The romance is a slow burn, heightened by the fact that the male protagonist is demi (though not explicitly labeled as such in the book). His initial lack of desire to consummate the marriage adds an interesting layer to their relationship. As they spend more time together, their friendship deepens, leading to the inevitable question: “Is this love?” The payoff, when it comes, is satisfying and well-earned.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The pacing is deliberate, reflecting the slow-burn nature of the romance. While some readers might find it slow, the gradual build-up enhances the emotional payoff. Harper St. George’s writing is engaging and maintains a good balance between character development and plot progression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHarper St. George delivers another compelling historical romance with well-crafted characters, a unique premise, and a satisfying slow-burn romance.

A minor subplot features Cora's secret writing career under a pen name and its effects on her husband's work.

The initial chapters set in Britain, where she embarks on her quest for a husband, are compelling.

The secondary characters, including Cora's sisters, parents, and Leo's family and friends, feel underdeveloped, serving primarily as sources of tension rather than meaningful support. While Cora and Leo share instant chemistry and rapport, their relationship struggles due to Leo's lingering feelings for an ex and Cora's jealousy, which remains unaddressed.

            "The story suffers from a lack of genuine conflict and chemistry between the characters, resulting in an unengaging relationship. Leo's backstory, involving rejection by a girl he loved, is only superficially addressed and never fully explored. Both protagonists appear unmotivated, which makes their reluctance to pursue a deeper relationship feel unconvincing. Although the pacing isn't inherently flawed, it is poorly executed, with repetitive chapters that contribute little to the narrative. The plot drags, and the marriage of convenience fails to generate the anticipated tension or chemistry. Overall, the book feels unnecessarily lengthy, containing at least 100 pages that do not contribute to plot or character development.",
            "Cora and Leo lack depth and chemistry, making their relationship feel forced and unengaging. While Cora starts with a strong personality in the prologue, she quickly devolves into seeking Leo's approval, portraying him as bland and two-dimensional. Although Leo has a significant role in government and a passion for his work, these traits are told rather than demonstrated, rendering him uninteresting. Brief appearances by other characters set up future books but fail to leave a lasting impact. Overall, the emphasis on establishing sequels distracts from the main story and its characters.",

            "I found the premise of *The Stranger I Wed* intriguing, as it follows three sisters of dubious legitimacy who learn that their grandmother has left them a substantial dowry—contingent upon their marriages. Cora, the protagonist, is reluctant to wed but devises a clever plan. The story unfolds in London, where their host organizes a house party to introduce them to eligible bachelors. I particularly enjoyed the charming meet-cute between Cora and Leopold Brendon, Earl of Devonworth, and quickly became engrossed in their evolving romance—or rather, their arrangement.",
            "Cora is a fiercely passionate and intelligent character whose brilliant plans and struggle with uncertainty draw you in. Leopold, equally captivating, is dedicated to parliamentary justice, safeguarding his family, and revitalizing his estate. His progressive mindset complements Cora’s strategic thinking perfectly. Their romance feels authentic, marked by instant chemistry and a slow-burn development that intensifies beautifully. I appreciated the tension, the discoveries along the way, and the gratifying resolution of their relationship.",

I anticipated a historical fiction romance set in the Gilded Age with no explicit content, as historical romances are typically known for being tame.  \n   - The spice was a surprise, especially from Berkley Publishing, and it made me realize I couldn’t listen to the audiobook or read it in public.

To avoid embarrassment for her father’s legitimate family, she decides to marry an Englishman with a title.  \n   - The plot explores the tension between a business-like marriage arrangement and the possibility of genuine love, set against the backdrop of women’s rights movements in England.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Themes:**  \n   - The book delves into the Gilded Age and the societal pressures faced by women, particularly the struggle for property rights and financial independence.  \n   - It highlights the suffragette movement and the broader fight for women’s rights, which adds depth to the story and makes it more than just a romance.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n   - Cora Dove is a strong, independent protagonist who challenges societal norms. Her relationship with Leopold Brendon begins as a transactional arrangement but evolves into something more complex.  \n   - The supporting characters, including Cora’s sisters and their mother, add richness to the narrative and set the stage for future books in the series.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The writing is engaging and immersive, with vivid descriptions that bring the Gilded Age and English society to life.  \n   - The tone balances romance, humor, and historical commentary, making it an enjoyable read despite the unexpected spice.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations with its unexpected spice, compelling plot, and rich historical context.

            "Cora's secrets create significant conflict, particularly when one resurfaces later in the story, compelling Leo to confront the issue. Their relationship transitions from a distant marriage to friendship and ultimately to love, though this evolution feels slow and at times drags. The first half of the book progresses slowly, with their estrangement lingering too long. However, the pace picks up in the latter half when they finally acknowledge their feelings and become openly affectionate. The novel employs a marriage of convenience trope, adding a layer of a fake relationship dynamic through their pre-engagement agreement to present a united front. Cora seeks a noble husband to secure her inheritance, while Leo aims for financial stability to restore his estate and address his brother's gambling debts. Both enter the marriage with no desire for love or romance.",
            "Cora and Leo begin their marriage as polite acquaintances, maintaining a distant, businesslike relationship for the first half of the book. Their dynamic is intriguing yet awkward, as they are clearly attracted to each other but resist acknowledging their feelings. For instance, Cora remains unfazed when she suspects Leo has a mistress, and Leo does not correct her assumptions. While Leo is loyal, dependable, and protective, he guards his heart due to a past betrayal. However, he eventually falls deeply for Cora once he confronts his fears. Cora, strong-willed and passionate about her beliefs, creates tension by deceiving Leo about her family's past—specifically, her mother's theater background and her illegitimate birth. She justifies her lies out of fear that the truth would drive Leo away.",
            "This story effectively highlights the suffrage movement through its heroine, Cora, who is passionately dedicated to the cause. The hero, Leo, is a progressive figure for his era, championing women's rights and advocating for the working class, reflecting his political engagement."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Stranger I Wed* is a solid historical romance with strong themes of social reform and a slow-burn relationship. While the pacing in the first half was sluggish and the character dynamics felt odd at times, the latter half delivered a satisfying emotional payoff. Fans of the author’s previous works will likely enjoy this addition to their universe.",

            "The pacing of the story starts off strong but slows significantly as it progresses, which made it challenging to maintain engagement. Although this may be a subjective experience, it was pronounced enough to diminish overall enjoyment. Certain scenes felt abrupt, with events occurring off-page or being summarized in subsequent chapters rather than being experienced alongside the characters. This narrative choice disrupted immersion and weakened the impact of key moments. The plot centers on Cora Dove and her sisters, whose legitimacy is questioned by society. Their grandmother provides dowries, but their father insists they must find suitable husbands far from New York to access their inheritance. The marriage of convenience trope is uniquely portrayed, as Cora and Leopold enter a pragmatic arrangement that gradually develops into something deeper.",
            "Cora is a bold and opinionated protagonist who has a realistic outlook on love and seeks a respectful suitor. Leopold, the Earl of Devonworth, is a pragmatic member of Parliament determined to pass a Public Health bill. Initially, he aims to marry for political advantage, but he finds himself unexpectedly attracted to Cora. Their chemistry is compelling, and their candid approach to their relationship adds a layer of authenticity."

        "conclusion": "*The Stranger I Wed* offers an engaging take on the marriage of convenience trope, with well-developed characters and a compelling premise. While the chemistry between Cora and Leopold is a highlight, the pacing issues and abrupt scene transitions hindered the overall experience. Despite these flaws, the book is still worth checking out for fans of historical romance.",

His reluctance to fall in love due to past hurt made his eventual love for Cora even more captivating.  \n\n- **Romance and Themes:**  \n  The romance was beautifully written, and I adored how the story explored additional issues beyond just the love story. It added depth and made the book even more engaging.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you’ve never read historical romance before, this might be the perfect book to start with.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful surprise, especially since I’m usually hesitant about historical fiction. The writing, characters, and romance were all top-notch, making it a quick and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Leo, the male lead, holds a title but lacks funds; he must marry an heiress to restore his estates and settle his brother's debts.",

            "The book started slowly, with the beginning feeling somewhat dry. However, the final third was riveting, and I raced through it. The initial character development felt excessive, especially for a series installment. I also wished more loose ends had been tied up, particularly Harry's storyline, where resolving his debt and sending him off to Europe felt inadequate. Additionally, the ominous hints about Lady Sofia ultimately led nowhere.",
            "Initially, I wasn't captivated by Cora, but I appreciated the friendship she developed with Leo. Their initially tense dynamic with Leo's mother eventually gave way to something hopeful, which I found enjoyable. Jenny and Eliza often distracted me; at times, I found them more engaging than Cora. I wish they had waited to join her in Europe. The meet-cute with Leo felt a bit silly, yet I couldn't help envisioning a vintage David Beckham in that role. Despite Cora's early claim that they would divorce after a set time, their gradual romance unfolded naturally.",

I wish they had waited to come to Europe with her.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n   - The meet-cute with Leo was a little silly, though I couldn’t help picturing an old-timey David Beckham in the role.  \n   - Despite Cora’s initial assertion that they would divorce after a sufficient amount of time, their gradual falling for each other felt natural.  \n\n- **Themes and Historical Context:**  \n   - The book incorporates time-period-appropriate issues, such as suffragism and women’s rights for Cora, and the Public Health Act for Leo.  \n\n- **Loose Ends and Resolution:**  \n   - I wish more loose ends had been resolved, such as Harry’s storyline (paying off his debt and shipping him off to Europe seemed ineffective) and the ominous mentions of Lady Sofia that amounted to nothing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a slow start and some unresolved subplots, the last third was engaging and fast-paced. The development of Cora and Leo’s relationship, along with the historical themes, added depth to the story. Despite some distractions from the secondary characters, I’m looking forward to the next books in the series, particularly Jenny and Eliza’s stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

            "I thoroughly enjoyed this first book and eagerly anticipate the continuation of the story, particularly to learn more about Cora’s sisters. I also hope to see familiar faces from previous tales alongside new characters, as I appreciate when authors weave connections between their stories. The marriage of convenience trope is skillfully executed here. From the outset, Cora and Leopold Brendon, the Earl of Devonworth, are transparent about their arrangement. Leopold needs a wealthy wife to support his Public Health bill aimed at providing clean water to the working class. I loved how their relationship evolves from practical beginnings to friendship, attraction, and ultimately, love.",
            "Cora Dove, the female protagonist, is a compelling character facing the challenges of her family's tarnished reputation in New York. Gossip about her and her sisters’ legitimacy has long dogged them, impacting their father's standing. When their ailing grandmother provides dowries, their father agrees to release the funds only if the sisters find suitable husbands—outside of New York. Cora is determined to secure this money for her sisters, even if it requires a marriage of convenience. The chemistry between Cora and Leopold is captivating, with their evolution from strangers to lovers feeling both natural and satisfying. I appreciated their mutual respect and the gradual deepening of their bond."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Cover and Initial Appeal:**  \n  I was drawn to *The Stranger I Wed* by Harper St. George because of its beautiful cover—the dress is so gorgeous, and it screams historical romance!  \n\n- **Readability and Pacing:**  \n  I found the book very easy to read—I devoured it in 2 days, after all. While the concept brimmed with potential, the execution didn't fully capture the complexity and passion I was hoping for. The pacing felt a bit too slow in the middle chapters, and while I enjoyed watching the emotional bond deepen, the romance lacked that special spark to give it that extra oomph.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows newly wealthy American heiress Cora Dove as she ventures to London in search of a husband who will appreciate her independent spirit. She sets her sights on Leopold Brendon, the Earl of Devonworth, who requires a rich wife to support his public health reform campaign. Though neither anticipates finding love, an undeniable attraction grows between them. However, hidden secrets on both sides threaten their burgeoning bond. As their pasts collide, Cora and Leo learn the cost of loving a stranger, even as they discover that kind of love is worth fighting for.  \n\n- **Character Chemistry and Development:**  \n  Cora and Leo had strong chemistry right from the start—it has such a great meet-cute moment. Their attraction was lush, and I was eager to see it develop as the story progressed. They also shared a comfortable rapport and mutual respect that made them likable as a couple. However, their relationship lost some momentum in the middle chapters. I waited with bated breath for them to give in to their passion, but the pacing felt a bit too slow.  \n\n- **Characterization and Depth:**  \n  The characterization in the book fell short of its potential. Leo's passion for public health reform in historical England and Cora's involvement in the suffragette movement provided great foundations. However, these backstories weren't fully integrated into the narrative or their romantic trajectory. Deeper exploration of these themes could have added complexity and heightened the stakes for both characters and their relationship. At times, they came across as somewhat one-dimensional and, frankly, a little boring. I liked them well enough, but they lacked the spark and depth that would make them easy additions to my roster of favorite characters.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Series Potential:**  \n  Though *The Stranger I Wed* didn't fully meet my high expectations, I'm still glad I picked it up. While Cora and Leo's romance wasn't entirely satisfying, the supporting cast of characters left me intrigued to see who the author will explore next. Harper St. George did an excellent job planting seeds about potential future couples, which has me curious to read the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Stranger I Wed* had a promising premise and strong initial chemistry between the leads, the execution fell short in terms of pacing, character depth, and emotional intensity. Despite these shortcomings, the book was an enjoyable read, and the supporting characters have piqued my interest in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story offers a slow-burn romance that may feel leisurely for some readers. While the pacing is intentional and avoids dragging, it could test the patience of those hoping for quicker developments.

            "Both Cora and Leo are well-developed, relatable characters. The story gradually reveals their compatibility, rooted in their shared sense of responsibility for their younger siblings during childhood. While Leo's sense of duty stems from societal expectations, it remains a psychological burden he struggles to acknowledge. In contrast, Cora's need to mature quickly due to her mother's shortcomings adds depth to her character. The marriage-of-convenience trope is skillfully executed, with mutual respect established from the outset. The pronounced pining and emotional connection between Cora and Leo create a satisfying slow-burn romance. This emphasis on emotional intimacy over physical attraction is a refreshing change for readers who prefer a deeper connection in MOC stories.",
            "In *The Stranger I Wed*, the author skillfully enriches their Victorian/Gilded Age setting, addressing significant issues of the era, including women's suffrage and access to clean running water for the working class. Although these themes are partially fictionalized, they underscore the reality that the struggle for basic rights was not isolated and that dissent from the societal norms was present in the past."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Slow Burn:**  \n   - I found it amusing that some readers criticized the book for being a \"slow burn,\" especially since I personally enjoy this style. However, I don’t think the pacing was the real issue. The build-up to the relationship moments felt bland and uninspired.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Cora and Leo felt very one-dimensional and stereotypical for a historical romance. They were nice, but that’s about it. Leo, a politician with beautiful blond hair and a perfect jaw, was just \"ho-hum-whatever,\" and Cora, while a nice feminist who wants to provide for her sisters, lacked depth.  \n\n- **Conflict and Chemistry:**  \n   - The book lacked interesting conflict or engaging, flirtatious scenes that could have made it stand out in the genre. The interactions between the characters felt generic and didn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Readability:**  \n   - Despite its flaws, St. George’s writing is still readable, and I managed to finish the book without much difficulty. There’s something about the author’s style that kept me engaged enough to consider reading the next book in the series.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Expectations:**  \n   - While I gave the book three stars, it’s not my favorite from the author. If the next book follows a similar pattern, I might reconsider continuing with the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had its moments, but it fell short in terms of character depth, conflict, and chemistry. While the writing was readable and kept me engaged, the story lacked the spark needed to make it memorable. I’m open to trying the next book, but my expectations are tempered.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars  \n\n**Disclosure:**  \nI received a free ARC copy of this book. All thoughts are my own."

            "The plot presented significant potential but ultimately fell flat. The conflict was lackluster and resolved too hastily. For instance, when Cora discovers Leo's blackmail concerning the women's property act, the resolution feels rushed. The attempted kidnapping and the immediate arrest of the assailants occur in quick succession, and Cora brushes off Leo's vote as inconsequential. Introducing the blackmail revelation earlier—ideally a day or two before the kidnapping—would have added necessary emotional depth and tension.",
            "The romantic tension in the story was engaging, but Leo's behavior was frustrating. He led Cora on, only to insult her by claiming their relationship was impossible, which made me want to smack him. Their intellectual chemistry was evident, and their initial banter—such as the argument over the soccer pitch boundary lines—was enjoyable. However, their verbal sparring fizzled out too quickly, which was disappointing. While I appreciated their partnership, Cora's contributions to Leo's speech felt underwhelming. Her advice to include personal stories was repeatedly cited as a reason for Leo's feelings, but it lacked the depth needed to justify his affection.",

Many significant events are crammed into the final 10% of the book, which could have been more effectively spread out to sustain interest.

The plot centers on Cora, the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy New York family, and her two sisters, Jenny and Eliza.

However, as the title suggests, the two main characters are complete strangers who carry traumas from their past, making them wary of falling in love. I found it more realistic that they didn’t immediately fall into bed and instead took time to get to know each other.  \n\n- **Character Motivations:**  \n  I initially thought Leo’s reluctance was a bit lame, but once his backstory was revealed, it made sense for his character and personality.  \n\n- **Series Connection and Standalone Potential:**  \n  Although this is a new series with new characters, it was nice to see the Crenshaw sisters and Camille make an appearance. Their inclusion was subtle enough that this book can still be read as a standalone while connecting the two series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I’m glad to be back on the Harper St. George fan train.

While they are separate series, they are interconnected as the Gilded Age characters are side characters. You do not have to have read the first series in order to enjoy this one.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  Cora Dove is the illegitimate child of a wealthy New Yorker, Charlie Hathaway. In order to receive the inheritance left to her by her paternal grandmother, Mr. Hathaway decides that Cora must be married but not to anyone from anywhere he might have acquaintances. So Cora decides to find herself an aristocratic husband and thus begins her journey to England. Leopold Brendon, Earl of Devonworth, is in need of funds to restore his family home and save his younger brother from debt. When he meets Cora at a house party, he proposes marriage, but Cora has some stipulations of her own.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Themes:**  \n  The story includes a little Victorian-era politics through side stories of women’s rights (the Married Women’s Property Act) and the development of the Public Health/Water Act, which adds depth and engagement to the historical romance.  \n\n- **Tropes and Appeal:**  \n  This book is perfect for readers who enjoy:  \n  - Marriage of convenience / forced proximity  \n  - Secrets  \n  - Slow burn  \n  - \"She falls first, he falls harder\" dynamics  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Books:**  \n  I already can’t wait for the next book!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is an engaging historical romance with a compelling plot, well-developed characters, and rich historical context.

Cora and Devonworth enter into the arrangement for practical reasons: Cora gains access to her inheritance, while Devonworth secures funds for his estate. The story is set in a Victorian historical context with political undertones, adding depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both Cora and Devonworth are well-developed characters. They share progressive values and a strong sense of family, which helps them bond. Their initial intention to guard themselves emotionally is gradually overshadowed by their growing attraction and connection.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension:**  \n  The romantic tension between the characters is palpable and well-written. Despite their initial agreement to keep things purely practical, their fascination with each other grows, as highlighted by Devonworth's internal thoughts: “All he could see was the rosebud shape of her mouth. Her lips were parted and he wanted to taste them. He wanted to dip his tongue into her and learn the feel of her. It didn’t make any sense. They had already discussed how things would be between them. There was no reason for him to have this fascination with her.”  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  The book serves as a strong introduction to a spinoff series, effectively setting up the next installment, which will focus on Cora’s sister.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a well-crafted historical romance with engaging characters, a compelling premise, and strong romantic tension.

The repetitive nature of the plot and the unrealistic resolution of key relationship dynamics left me feeling unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their slow-burn romance allows them to take their time getting to know one another.

Cora travels to London to find titled husbands for herself and her sisters. \n\nLeopold Brendon, the Earl of Devonworth, is in dire need of money to save his estate and settle his brother's debts, all while navigating opposition to a Public Health bill he is championing. Marrying a wealthy heiress could resolve his financial woes, leading Cora and Leo to enter into a marriage of convenience. However, neither anticipates the deep feelings that will develop or the secrets they will uncover along the way."

There were also some funny moments, like Cora not remembering Leo’s first name correctly right after their wedding!  \n\n- **Themes and Passions:**  \n  Both characters are passionate about their respective causes, and I loved how they supported each other.

The ending felt rushed, and some promising plot points were resolved way too fast.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I’m looking forward to the next one in the series.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thanks to Netgalley, the publisher, and the author for the ARC to review. All opinions are my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a strong premise and well-developed characters, the pacing was uneven, with too much happening too quickly at the end. Despite this, I’m excited to see where the series goes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"
