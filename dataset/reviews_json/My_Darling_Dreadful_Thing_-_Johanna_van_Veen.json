            "The story takes a dramatic turn when Agnes purchases Roos from her mother during a séance. As Roos and Ruth settle into the Rozentuin, they confront the mysterious illness afflicting Willemijn and the manor's eerie atmosphere. The relationship between Roos and Agnes blossoms into a tender yet doomed sapphic love story as they unravel the sinister secrets of the Rozentuin.",
            "This novel draws clear inspiration from Edgar Allan Poe, especially his work *The Fall of the House of Usher*. The author skillfully weaves together the macabre, supernatural, and tragically beautiful, evoking a gothic atmosphere reminiscent of Poe’s haunting narratives. The Knoop siblings, Thomas and Willemijn, share a disturbingly dependent relationship that hints at incestuous undertones. Thomas’ wife, Agnes, is repulsed by their bond yet remains trapped by her attachment to the manor and lack of alternatives. Meanwhile, Roos Beckman, a spiritual medium, is exploited by her mother for financial gain. Though her spirit companion, Ruth, assists her during séances, Roos lives in isolation, malnourished and controlled, with little hope for independence.",

            "This book delves into themes of claustrophobia, isolation, death, decay, myth, and madness. The deteriorating Rozentuin manor serves as a poignant symbol of the Knoop bloodline's decline, enhancing the story's gothic atmosphere.",
            "The novel masterfully blends horror with tragic beauty, especially in its depiction of Roos and Agnes' love. It explores the intricate dynamics of love, fear, and mortality, leaving a lasting emotional impression on the reader."

The novel’s exploration of dark themes, complex character dynamics, and lyrical writing style creates a haunting and unforgettable reading experience. The sapphic love story between Roos and Agnes is both tender and doomed, adding a layer of emotional depth to the macabre narrative.

This was an extraordinarily creepy book with excellent gothic elements and a unique plotline.  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n  I didn’t read the synopsis before starting, so I had no idea what the book was about; I only knew I loved the cover and found it so irresistible that I had to have it. The story is a great mix of supernatural suspense and a Sapphic love story. I really enjoyed the different elements the author used, like excerpts from Roos’s psychologist appointments, which added depth to the narrative. I would recommend going in blind, as it made the story that much more interesting to me as I watched the truth of everything slowly unravel.  \n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  Being the audiophile that I am, I listened to the audiobook, and I loved it! Jess Nesling did a wonderful job; she fully embodied the characters and the book as a whole. I was super impressed.  \n\n- **Content Warnings and Reader Sensitivity:**  \n  There are definitely some triggers lurking in here, so I would recommend checking out StoryGraph prior to reading. I can be a squeamish reader, and while there was some gore, it wasn’t anything that made me set down my food. That is me personally, though, so some people might find it better not to eat while reading this. 😉  \n\n- **Genre and Freshness:**  \n  *My Darling Dreadful Thing* is a fresh addition to the horror genre, and I loved every minute of it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel by Johanna van Veen is a standout in the horror genre, blending gothic elements, supernatural suspense, and a Sapphic love story into a uniquely compelling narrative. The audiobook performance by Jess Nesling is exceptional, and while the book contains some intense moments, it’s a gripping and fresh read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This narrative style diminishes suspense regarding the outcome, as the book reveals early on what will happen, shifting the focus to how it unfolds. The doctor's notes offer a secondary, non-supernatural perspective on the events, prompting questions about the true nature of what occurred, although this rational explanation becomes increasingly flawed as the story progresses.",

The narration is very atmospheric and melancholic, perfect for a gothic tale. It combines classic gothic elements with an interesting perspective of skepticism, making it a great piece of gothic fiction.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  The story is told from the perspective of Roos, recounting the events that lead to a death to Dr. Montague, interspersed with the Doctor's notes and conversations with Roos. This style of narration eliminates much of the suspense about what will happen, as the book makes it clear early on, but focuses on the build-up to the \"how.\" The doctor's notes also provide a secondary, non-supernatural explanation of the events, leaving the reader wondering what really took place (though the \"rational\" explanation ends up with more holes towards the end).  \n\n- **Character Development and Themes:**  \n  All the significant characters are explored through the lens of how abuse and trauma irrevocably affect people. Each character is flawed, and the book deals with many difficult topics (content warnings are worth noting). However, I felt these topics were handled with the sensitivity and care they required. Loneliness and isolation play a big role, serving as the core of Roos as a character and the love story at the heart of the book.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  If I had to describe this book, I would call it a mix between *Bly Manor* and *Crimson Peak* (both pieces of media I adore). If you are a fan of stories like these, I highly recommend picking this up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *My Darling Dreadful Thing* is a compelling gothic novel that explores the effects of abuse and trauma while weaving in classic gothic elements. Its atmospheric narration, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes make it a standout read for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

            "The book employs a split-narrative structure that alternates between Roos’s first-person perspective and interviews with a doctor assessing her competency to stand trial for murder. This balanced approach enhances the storytelling, allowing each section to enrich the other and provide essential context. Readers are encouraged to question the reality of the supernatural and medical elements at play, echoing themes from *The Turn of the Screw*, which is frequently referenced throughout the novel.\n\nThe story opens with Roos, who performs fake séances under the oppressive eye of her abusive mother, accompanied by her spirit companion, Ruth. During one séance, Agnes Knoop, a widow of Indonesian descent, connects with Roos, which leads to a transformative relationship when Agnes purchases Roos's freedom. As Roos moves into Agnes’s estate, both women grapple with their traumas, their experiences with spiritual companions (Agnes has her own spirit named Peter), and their deepening love for each other.",
            "The depth and attention devoted to the main characters and their relationships—be it familial, romantic, or self-reflective—are outstanding. These characters are complex and flawed, yet they remain relatable and endearing.",
            "The book captivated me from the very first page, and I finished it in just one day. I couldn’t resist returning to its pages, finding it impossible to put down.",
            "The book expertly blends various forms of horror, especially psychological horror, crafting a delightfully eerie atmosphere."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a captivating and expertly crafted story with rich character development, a well-balanced narrative structure, and a hauntingly atmospheric tone. The split-narrative adds depth and intrigue, allowing readers to interpret the story in multiple ways. The psychological horror elements are particularly well-executed, making this a memorable and engaging read. I would eagerly read more from this author in the future.",

I kept coming back to it, unable to put it down.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  - The book includes content warnings at the beginning, which are important to note. These include child abuse, sexual assault, spousal abuse, self-harm, child loss, homosexuality as mental illness (historically appropriate), and incest.  \n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  - The story begins with Roos, who has a spirit companion named Ruth and conducts fake seances under her abusive mother. Agnes Knoop, a widow of Indonesian descent, attends one of these seances and forms a connection with Roos. This connection evolves into a relationship after Agnes buys Roos’s freedom, and Roos moves into Agnes’s estate. Both characters are bound by their traumas, their experiences with spiritual companions (Agnes has one named Peter), and their love for each other.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  - The book uses a split-narrative structure, alternating between Roos’s first-person perspective and interviews between a doctor and Roos. These interviews are later revealed to determine Roos’s competency to stand trial for murder. The split-narrative is expertly balanced, with each section complementing the other and providing necessary information to understand the full story. This structure allows readers to decide whether the supernatural or medical elements (or a mix of both) are “true,” reminiscent of *The Turn of the Screw*, which is referenced throughout the novel.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - The depth and care given to the primary characters and their relationships—whether familial, romantic, or self—are exceptional. The characters are complicated and messy yet remain likable and sympathetic.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  - The book effectively balances different forms of horror, particularly psychological horror, creating a deliciously spooky atmosphere.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating and expertly crafted story with rich character development, a well-balanced narrative structure, and a hauntingly atmospheric tone. The split-narrative adds depth and intrigue, allowing readers to interpret the story in multiple ways. The psychological horror elements are particularly well-executed, making this a memorable and engaging read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Originality and Freshness:**  \n  I love Gothic stories, but I’ve been struggling to find any that feel fresh and new. Most tend to have the same qualities—hidden secrets, someone ill, a creepy house, some sort of haunting, etc. However, *My Darling Dreadful Thing* kept me intrigued throughout.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  What helped make this book stand out was the way it was written like a thriller, with a narrative that looks back in hindsight. The prose is interspersed with conversations with the doctor, which added an intriguing layer to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  After reading a few negative reviews, I will say DO NOT pick this up if you can’t handle a slow burn. This is a slow book, and you might get bored if you’re expecting a lot of action. It’s more about the unravelling of secrets and the deepening bond between Roos and Agnes.  \n\n- **Plot Elements and Ambiguity:**  \n  One thing I was confused about was the men’s footsteps Roos would hear at night, along with the men’s cologne. I thought something was going to come of that, but nothing did. Perhaps it was her subconscious playing tricks on her, making her jealousy of Thomas manifest as a physical haunting?  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  All in all, it’s a great book—beautiful and heartbreaking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*My Darling Dreadful Thing* is a fresh take on Gothic storytelling, blending thriller-like writing with a slow-burn narrative that focuses on secrets and relationships. While some elements, like the unexplained footsteps and cologne, left me puzzled, the emotional depth and originality of the story made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The relationship between Roos and Ruth is both fascinating and complex. Ruth is the sole person who enables Roos to survive, yet their love is marked by possessiveness and destruction. Ultimately, this dynamic takes a heavy toll on Roos, even if Ruth's intentions were not entirely malicious. It's heartbreaking to see how few genuinely good people Roos has in her life. Despite the sadness of the ending, I appreciate the hopeful tone, particularly regarding Agnes. Roos finally finds safety and security, allowing her to thrive independently without relying on others.",

The story left me questioning the reliability of the main character and whether the ghosts were real or merely manifestations of her trauma and illness.",

While Ruth was the only person that allowed Roos to survive as long as she did, their love was quite possessive and destructive.  \n   - In the end, it cost Roos too much, even if indirectly the intentions were still there.  \n\n- **Character Development and Ending:**  \n   - It's so sad how few good people Roos had in her life.  \n   - Despite the sadness of the ending, I love how hopeful it is, not just regarding Agnes but because Roos is finally safe, secure, and able to survive on her own without having to rely on others completely.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis gothic novel masterfully balances beauty and despair, creating a hauntingly ambiguous world and complex relationships.

While the romance didn’t fully convince me, the themes of possession, the blend of spooky and sweet tones, and the unique story structure made it a compelling and satisfying read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nLoved it.

Agnes, a wealthy and isolated widow with her own spirit companion, adds further complexity to the story and enriches her interactions with Roos.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The novel centers on Roos, a young woman coerced into participating in semi-fraudulent séances by her “Mama.” Roos has the unique ability to see the dead, specifically the spirit of Ruth, who possesses her body and lends authenticity to the séances.\n   - The story takes a turn when Roos is taken under the care of Agnes, a wealthy but ostracized widow who also has a spirit companion. The narrative explores their intertwined lives and the mysterious events that unfold.\n\n- **Literary Influences and References:**\n   - The novel is heavily influenced by classic gothic texts, with direct references to Henry James’s *The Turn of the Screw*. Agnes names her spirit companion Peter Quint, after the menacing figure in James’s work, drawing parallels between Roos and the governess and raising questions about Roos’s reliability.\n   - Subtler references to Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s *The Yellow Wallpaper* enhance the theme of isolation, with the wallpaper leaving stains on clothing and hands, reminiscent of Gilman’s “smooches.”\n   - The relationship between Willemijn and Thomas seems inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s *The Fall of the House of Usher*, adding another layer of gothic intrigue.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**\n   - The novel alternates between Roos’s first-person narrative and the clinical notes of a psychologist, Dr. Montague, who assesses Roos’s ability to stand trial after a mysterious and fatal event at Agnes’s house.\n   - This dual narrative structure serves to heighten suspense by hinting at the fatal events before they are fully revealed, though it doesn’t add significant new information beyond what is present in Roos’s account.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Roos is a complex protagonist, tethered to the spirit of Ruth and navigating her relationships with both her “Mama” and Agnes. Her reliability as a narrator is called into question, especially after an unexplained death.\n   - Agnes is portrayed as a wealthy, isolated widow with her own spirit companion, adding depth to her character and her interactions with Roos.\n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**\n   - The novel reworks classic gothic themes, such as isolation, possession, and the supernatural, into a fresh and compelling narrative.\n   - The atmosphere is richly gothic, with elements of suspense and mystery that keep readers engaged.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nJohanna van Veen’s *My Darling Dreadful Thing* is a remarkable reimagining of classic gothic literature, blending familiar themes with new twists. The novel’s layered narrative structure and rich literary references create a suspenseful and atmospheric read, though the dual narration adds more novelty than depth. Overall, it’s a compelling addition to the gothic genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The character of Roos, occasionally possessed by Ruth, effectively explores the consequences of both embracing and resisting possession. The narrative prompts reflection on Roos's sanity and the judgments of those around her, while emphasizing the significance of awareness and choice in how we allow ourselves to be influenced.",

The book examines how our culture, genetics, and external influences shape our identities, prompting reflection on the question: Who are we without these influences? What remains when we strip away these possessive elements? It challenges readers to recognize and take responsibility for the traits within us—both positive, like compassion and love, and negative, like racism and misogyny. The exploration of these possessive elements is both terrifying and empowering, raising the question of whether we will passively accept these influences or actively choose who we want to be. Ultimately, the book suggests that true freedom comes at a cost, requiring us to confront and take responsibility for the parts of ourselves we may not like or understand."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - Gothic, ghosts, spirits, and sapphic true love.  \n  - The story features a secret connection, a dead husband, and a malevolent sister-in-law.  \n  - The setting is a beautiful manor, and the book has a gorgeous cover.  \n  - The inclusion of consumption (tuberculosis) and its historical association with beauty adds to the gothic atmosphere.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  - The story is told from two perspectives: the main narrative and case notes from a doctor interviewing Roos after she is committed for murder.  \n  - This dual structure adds suspense, as the reader knows something will go wrong but isn’t sure what.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  - Roos and Ruth share a borderline obsessive, tragic, and deeply compelling relationship.  \n  - Ruth’s ability to take control of Roos and grant her supernatural abilities is a highlight.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Creepiness:**  \n  - The creepy saint statues moving closer to the house are a standout, chilling element.  \n  - The gothic vibes are strong, and the 1950s Netherlands setting feels interchangeable with Victorian England, enhancing the timeless, eerie tone.  \n\n- **Critiques:**  \n  - The audiobook format made it slightly confusing to distinguish between Roos and Ruth due to their similar names.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply atmospheric and suspenseful gothic tale with a tragic sapphic romance at its core. The dual narrative structure, chilling elements like the saint statues, and the exploration of themes like consumption and obsession make it a standout. While the audiobook format caused minor confusion with character names, the story’s strengths far outweigh this small drawback.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars, rounded up."

            "In *My Darling Dreadful Thing*, both female main characters grapple with mental illness and trauma, leading to behaviors that may be difficult for others to understand. As someone diagnosed with schizophrenia, I found the portrayal of mental health in this story to be refreshingly compassionate and accurate, especially compared to the common trope of depicting schizophrenic individuals as violent. While Roos's condition may blend elements of schizophrenia with paranormal aspects—particularly evident in the latter part of the story involving the furniture—I appreciated the opportunity to connect with the characters on a personal level.",
            "This book effectively captures the imperfections of its characters, reminding readers that no one is flawless. It's important for readers to recognize that, like the characters, they too are imperfect, and not everything in life should be romanticized.",
            "I tend to enjoy queer horror, and this book certainly delves into challenging themes that may not resonate with all readers. Many negative reviews seem to center on these topics. However, I see it more as a romance infused with elements of horror, rather than a horror novel with a touch of romance.",

This book covers a lot of difficult topics that aren't for everyone, and it seems many negative reviews focus on these topics. However, I would view it more as a romance book with a dash of horrific aspects rather than a horror novel with some romance.  \n\n- **Characterization and Representation:**  \n  Both female main characters (FMCs) are mentally ill and traumatized. Their brains don't function like those of neurotypical individuals, so they behave in ways others might not understand. As someone diagnosed with schizophrenia, I found the portrayal of mental illness in *My Darling Dreadful Thing* to be more compassionate and accurate than most depictions, which often portray schizophrenic people as violent serial killers. While Roos's condition may or may not be schizophrenia (I felt it was a mix of paranormal elements and schizophrenia, especially towards the end with the furniture), it was comforting to read and relate to the characters in some way.  \n\n- **Realism and Imperfection:**  \n  People are not perfect creatures, and this is definitely reflected in the characters of this book. I think most readers need to understand that, as they aren't perfect themselves, and not everything can or should be romanticized.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a deeply engaging and relatable read for me, blending romance with darker, horrific elements.

I've read a few other ones recently that were supposed to be in the genre, but this one was waaaay better.  \n\n- **Timelessness:**  \n  It had a timeless quality to it, even though the author put dates in throughout.  \n\n- **Mystery and Atmosphere:**  \n  The elements were all there for the mystery, the creepiness factor, and a great layer of \"wait - is it spirits or is she crazy\" aspect.  \n\n- **Literary Parallels:**  \n  The parallels with *The Turn of the Screw* were just right - enough to put the idea in the reader's mind but not anything over the top.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Ambiguity:**  \n  I would love to see this turned into a movie; I think actors could have a field day with Mama, Willemejn (can't remember the spelling on that one, sorry!), and Roos. Even Agnes. And the poor psychologist - was he conned or is he the good guy? I love that we just don't know.  \n\n- **Personal Interpretation:**  \n  Personally, I like to believe that it was all as Roos told it, but that is just my imagination letting loose.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout in the gothic genre, offering a timeless, mysterious, and atmospheric story with rich character depth and ambiguity.

This breaks the usual rule where spirits are either beautiful and good or ugly and malevolent.  \n\n- **Pacing and Expectations:**  \n  If you’re looking for a fast-paced story with scary twists and turns, you might be disappointed. However, if you appreciate a story about love in its many forms, along with a heavy and at times suffocating atmosphere, you’ll likely be captivated, just as I was.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully crafted exploration of loneliness, love, and the bonds that form in unexpected ways.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Theme and Concept:**  \n  The intersection between mental illness and the supernatural is a central theme that intrigued me. The ambiguity of whether the haunting or possession is real or a product of the narrator's mind added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  The book reads like a classic ghost story, creating a timeless and eerie atmosphere. The occasional mention of modern elements, such as cars, felt jarring and slightly out of place, as I kept picturing the setting in a much older time period. This unintentional anachronism actually enhanced the story's unsettling quality for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel masterfully blends psychological ambiguity with supernatural elements, creating a haunting and atmospheric tale. The classic ghost story feel, combined with the occasional modern touch, added to the eerie and timeless quality of the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Most of what happens can be explained differently depending on how you view it, which keeps you questioning throughout.  \n\n- **Influence and Style:**  \n  The novel feels very much inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, capturing a similar sense of mystery, dread, and psychological complexity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping and atmospheric read that skillfully blends gothic elements with psychological ambiguity. It keeps you guessing and leaves a lasting impression, much like the works of Poe.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This novel is a haunting gothic tale that masterfully intertwines horror and poignant romance, delving into themes of love, belonging, and trauma. Set in post-World War II Holland, it follows Roos Beckman and her centuries-old spirit confidant, Ruth. The narrative unfolds across two timelines: the past is presented in first-person perspective, while the present is revealed through a psychologist's notes, seamlessly weaving together Roos's story. \n\nAs an only and lonely child, Roos is coerced by her mother into acting as a psychic medium during fraudulent seances, leading to her growing disillusionment with her mother's deceitful practices. When a wealthy widow offers her shelter, Roos hopes for stability and normalcy, but instead finds herself ensnared in a dark world of sibling rivalry and supernatural manipulation.",

Drawing inspiration from Poe and Shirley Jackson, it immerses readers in a gothic setting that enhances the narrative's time and place. As a sapphic love story with LGBTQ+ themes, it incorporates elements of horror, séances, spirit companions, and murder. The multi-timeline structure adds complexity and depth to the tale."

Roos had me instantly immersed with her story.\"  \n   - \"This was one of the most beautifully haunting books I've read in a while.\"  \n   - \"My Darling Dreadful Thing was such a unique reading experience... and that’s what it truly was; an experience.\"  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n   - \"It was everything that I wanted from a gothic horror, Edgar Allen Poe-esque novel: dark, romantic, claustrophobic with a chilling atmospheric setting.\"  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - \"My favorite characters were the spirit companions, Ruth in particular, even though she lost her shit at the end.\"  \n   - \"We must protect Peter at all costs.\"  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - \"There’s a reason the word 'haunting' is rarely used in a positive way. To never be free of someone, well, that’s not always a comfort.\"  \n   - \"Happy. Such a funny little word, don’t you think? Perhaps not so hard a state to achieve, but nearly impossible to maintain, and different for everyone.\"  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n   - \"Now let’s talk about the slight twist to the story. Personally, I recommend going into this book blind.\"  \n   - \"Throughout the book, we never really know if Ruth actually exists or if Roos is suffering from a mental disorder & imagines her.\"  \n   - \"I feel like the author provides evidence for the reader to choose either for the ending they interpreted.\"  \n\n- **Writing Quality and Author’s Skill:**  \n   - \"I can’t believe this was a debut novel for this author. I hope to see more from her in the future!\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a beautifully haunting and immersive experience, blending gothic horror, dark romance, and chilling atmosphere. The characters, especially Ruth and Peter, are memorable, and the narrative’s ambiguity about Ruth’s existence adds depth. The author’s debut is impressive, leaving a lasting impact and a desire for more of her work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n★★★★.75 (4.75 stars)"

The imagery, while often grotesque and haunting—featuring dead ghosts and decaying bodies—was also achingly beautiful and strikingly visual.",

The heavy focus on ghosts amplifies the tension, and while the ending is both bittersweet and horrific, it still allows for some possibility.",

It evoked a mix of feelings, but the overall emotional resonance was moderate.\n\n- **Writing and Language:**\n   - The writing and language, particularly the visual descriptions, were exceptionally strong throughout the novel. This aspect alone elevated my overall rating by half a star.\n   - The descriptions, though often of grotesque and haunting imagery (like dead ghosts and decaying bodies), were achingly beautiful and visually stunning.\n\n- **Narrative Perspective:**\n   - Roos as a point-of-view character was lovely and engaging. Her perspective added depth and charm to the story.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**\n   - This is a sapphic novel, but it is primarily a tragic horror story rather than a romance. The tragic elements are evident from the very beginning, as it’s clear early on that Agnes is dead.\n   - The novel is heavily focused on ghosts, and while the ending is bittersweet and horrific, it leaves room for possibilities.\n\n- **Reading Experience:**\n   - I had a great time reading this novel overall. I particularly enjoyed alternating between the audiobook and my Kindle, which was a new experience for me.\n   - The narrator for the audiobook was wonderful, and I would definitely seek out more works by this author in the future.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**\n   - The novel includes themes and mentions of child abuse, rape, incest, domestic abuse, and the potential weaponization of mental health.

It balances oppressive bleakness with enjoyable Gothic overload, enhanced by touches of dark humor and sweetness. This keeps the story fresh, adult, and genteel despite its bloody subject matter and creepy imagery.  \n\n- **Genre Authenticity:**  \n  The book avoids the unfortunate trend of trying to emulate Anne Rice’s aesthetic, which often leans into graphic sex and violence to appeal to a younger audience. Instead, it delivers a mature Gothic experience that respects the genre’s roots and appeals to grown-up readers.  \n\n- **Influences and Originality:**  \n  While the novel has identifiable influences—such as *The Turn of the Screw*, E.A. Poe, Shirley Jackson, and *Crimson Peak*—Van Veen’s voice and vision are uniquely her own. She brings a fresh take to beloved genre themes.  \n\n- **Author’s Approach and Notes:**  \n  I appreciated the author’s notes before and after the novel. She thoughtfully provides trigger warnings but remains unapologetic about not whitewashing or downplaying the unpleasantness of the past, which I respect.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters of Ruth and Peter stand out. Ruth is fascinating—brutal yet loyal and loving. Peter, on the other hand, is the sweetest undead soul in fiction; the scene where he strokes the bee was particularly touching.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a very good Gothic novel that balances darkness with humor and sweetness. It’s creative, well-written, and respectful of the genre’s traditions while offering a fresh perspective. I’m eagerly looking forward to Van Veen’s next work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nSolid 4 stars, with some moments leaning toward 4.5."

            "The book alternates between Roos’s first-person perspective and interviews conducted by a doctor, along with case notes, effectively creating ambiguity around Roos’s sanity and the truth of events. However, the pacing becomes uneven after a pivotal moment, resulting in a disjointed feel. Despite this, the ambiguity aligns with the book’s central theme, prompting readers to question the reliability of the narrators. The ending captures the essence of Henry James, leaving readers to ponder who is telling the truth and whether any characters, aside from the doctor, are truly sane. This conclusion fits well within the Gothic tone and maintains the story's ambiguity.\n\nThe narrative follows Roos Beckman, who, alongside her mother, runs a business that facilitates communication between the living and the dead. Roos has a spirit companion, Ruth, who possesses her during sessions. The plot thickens when Roos encounters Agnes Knoop, a widow, and is overtaken by an unknown force during a session, leading Agnes to take Roos to her estate. The mystery revolves around the question of who did what to whom, with Roos facing accusations of murder. The narrative keeps readers guessing about reality, reminiscent of *The Turn of the Screw*.",
            "Roos Beckman is a complex and pitiable character whose perspective propels the story forward. By the end, she remains enigmatic, grappling with uncertainty about herself and Agnes. Agnes Knoop, in turn, is an elusive figure, with her stories and motives shrouded in ambiguity. Doctor Montague serves as a determined investigator, seeking the truth and adding depth to the narrative.",
            "Set in the Netherlands after World War II and extending into the 1960s, the novel features a decaying estate that serves as a quintessential Gothic element, reminiscent of *The Fall of the House of Usher*. This eerie, crumbling house enhances the unsettling atmosphere throughout the story."

        "conclusion": "*My Darling Dreadful Thing* is a compelling Gothic novel with a strong atmosphere, complex characters, and a mystery that keeps you guessing. While the pacing falters at times, the narrative’s ambiguity and the eerie setting make it a worthwhile read, especially for fans of Henry James and Gothic literature.",

The story draws inspiration from Henry James' *The Turn of the Screw* and Gothic novels, setting the stage for *My Darling Dreadful Thing*.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel is set in the Netherlands post-World War II and extends into the 1960s and beyond. The decaying, moldering estate where much of the story takes place is a quintessential Gothic element, reminiscent of *The Fall of the House of Usher*.

This leads to Agnes taking Roos to her estate. The mystery revolves around who did what to whom, with Roos accused of murder. The narrative keeps you guessing about what is real and what isn’t, much like *The Turn of the Screw*.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Roos Beckman: A complex and pitiable character whose perspective drives the story. Even by the end, she remains enigmatic, unsure of herself and Agnes.  \n  - Agnes Knoop: An elusive character whose stories and motives are constantly in question.  \n  - Doctor Montague: A determined figure who seeks the truth, adding an investigative layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The book alternates between Roos’s first-person perspective and interviews conducted by a doctor, along with case notes.

We understand she's a bog person, we understand she's skeletal, we understand her hair and skin have been dyed, we understand that her jaw goes clickedy-clackedy.

This felt very on-brand and intriguing.  \n  - Roos’s mother is portrayed as a deeply flawed and abusive figure, and the author, van Veen, effectively sets the tone for her character in the author’s note, warning readers about the impending terrors.  \n\n- **Content Warnings and Genre Expectations:**  \n  - The author’s note at the beginning is crucial, as it provides content warnings and sets expectations for the trauma and secrets inherent in the genre. This is especially important for readers who may need to decide whether to proceed.  \n  - Despite the dark themes, the story is ultimately a queer love story, which is a significant reason why I stayed engaged throughout the book.  \n\n- **Personal Reading Context and Impact:**  \n  - My enjoyment of this book was somewhat influenced by having just read a particularly sinister modern gothic novel. This timing affected my perception, making me feel like I didn’t fully appreciate this book as much as I could have.  \n  - I plan to revisit this book after some time away from the genre to give it a fairer shot, as I believe my current feelings are not entirely reflective of the book’s quality.  \n\n- **Appeal to Target Audience:**  \n  - Fans of gothic literature, trauma processing, and unconventional love stories will find a lot to enjoy here. The book manages to be both creepy and emotionally resonant, which is a compelling combination.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this read and appreciated its unique blend of gothic elements and queer love.

This book was nearly flawless, a true masterpiece, and has become my cherished obsession.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The passing of time was unclear to me, and I struggled to discern the specific period in which the story was set. There was also a disconnect between the intended period (late 1800s) and the atmosphere and events portrayed.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  My admiration for Ruth was boundless, and her intimate bond with Roos was sacred and delicate. While I did appreciate the character of Agnes, it was Ruth who truly captivated me.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I was moved to tears in chapter 32, only to realize a few more chapters remained. The writing was exquisite, and I longed for more moments between Ruth and Roos.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a masterpiece that left me utterly devoted and emotionally moved. While the execution of the time period and pacing could have been clearer, the characters, particularly Ruth, and the exquisite writing made this a truly unforgettable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The introduction of Agnes, a wealthy widow, presents Roos with a chance for freedom, but this new opportunity is overshadowed by looming tragedy.",

The story follows Roos Beckman, a young woman who serves as a spirit conduit for her mother's séances. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she attracts a mysterious spirit companion named Ruth. The plot thickens when Roos is hired by Agatha, who brings her to a crumbling estate filled with secrets and danger. The narrative alternates between past and present, as Roos is interrogated in connection with a murder, adding layers of mystery and tension.",

            "The plot, while not action-driven, is rich with tension, suspense, and unexpected twists. The pacing was excellent, allowing me to breeze through the book. However, the lack of a clear resolution left me with unanswered questions that diminished my overall satisfaction. Although the romance isn't the main focus, it was enjoyable and added depth to the narrative. The exploration of queerness and mental illness in a historical context was refreshing, and I found myself rooting for the characters. The ambiguous ending left me craving more clarity; I wished for a definitive account of events rather than relying on Roos’ unreliable narration. While I personally found the lack of a fulfilling conclusion and unanswered questions—such as the significance of the cover and title—frustrating, I recognize that some readers may appreciate the ambiguity.",

It creates a murky, dreary, and heavy atmosphere, which is executed very well. The gothic vibe is complemented by tension, suspense, twists, and a strong horror element.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are not necessarily likable but are incredibly interesting, complex, fleshed out, and full of depth. Roos, the unreliable narrator, is a standout, and while the trope is done well, it made it difficult for me to fully connect with the story.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot, though not action-packed, is filled with tension, suspense, and unexpected twists. The pacing was excellent, as I breezed through the book. However, the lack of a clear resolution left me with unanswered questions, which detracted from my overall satisfaction.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is absolutely gorgeous. Van Veen has a remarkable way with words, conveying emotions and themes with literary finesse. Her ability to evoke shock, disgust, or beauty through her prose is highly commendable.\n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  While the romance isn’t the central focus, it was enjoyable and added depth to the story. The exploration of queerness and mental illness in a historical setting was refreshing, and I found myself rooting for the characters.\n\n- **Ending and Ambiguity:**  \n  The ambiguous ending left me wanting more clarity. I wished for a definitive account of what actually happened, as opposed to Roos’ unreliable narration. The lack of a fulfilling conclusion and unanswered questions (e.g., the meaning of the cover and title) were frustrating for me personally, though I understand some readers might appreciate the ambiguity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is objectively fantastic, with its gothic atmosphere, complex characters, and stunning writing. While the unreliable narrator trope and ambiguous ending didn’t fully resonate with me, I still highly recommend it. It’s a thought-provoking and beautifully crafted novel, and I look forward to reading more from Van Veen.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

Although the pacing slowed in the middle, the book remained captivating overall. I anticipated more action based on the synopsis, but the slower tempo allowed for deeper character exploration. While I predicted a few twists, they were still well-crafted and impactful. The atmospheric, gothic writing style perfectly complements the haunting setting of the eerie estate.",

The representation of sapphic romance and a Southeast Asian (Indo) character, crafted by a lesbian author, was both meaningful and well-executed. The characters are complex and well-developed, adding depth to the narrative. While the sapphic romance subplot was a highlight, it's important to note that this is not primarily a romance-focused book.",
            "This novel is a subtle horror story that relies on unsettling imagery rather than fast-paced action. The haunting portrayal of Ruth lingered in my mind, even giving me nightmares. Despite its eerie moments, the narrative is infused with warmth and affection, particularly evident in the found family dynamic among the characters.",
            "Set in the Netherlands during the 1950s, this novel presents a unique and refreshing backdrop rarely seen in literature. The exploration of Dutch colonization in Indonesia and Agnes’s Indo heritage is both fascinating and educational, providing valuable insights into a lesser-known aspect of history.",
            "This novel masterfully intertwines gothic horror with a distinctive ghost story, introducing a spirit companion instead of a conventional haunting. It sensitively explores themes of trauma, mental illness, and toxic relationships, which, while thought-provoking, also enhance the story's unsettling atmosphere."

The omnipresent ghosts and the eerie atmosphere made the story genuinely scary and unsettling at times.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story is built around an interview between Doctor Montague, a psychiatrist, and his patient Roos Beckman, who is on trial for the death of Agnes Knoop. Through these interviews, we learn about Roos' troubled past, her life with Mama, and her relationship with Agnes. The plot is twisted and keeps you questioning what is real and what is imagined.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Roos is a complex protagonist with a difficult upbringing. Her relationship with Mama, who exploited her for fake seances, and her later bond with Agnes, who becomes her lover, are central to the story. The dynamic between Roos and Agnes is both tender and unsettling, especially as Roos goes to extreme lengths to please her.  \n\n- **Supernatural Elements vs. Mental Illness:**  \n  The author skillfully blurs the line between the supernatural and mental illness. Roos' imaginary (or ghostly) friend, who helps during the seances, raises questions about whether she is gifted or mentally ill. This ambiguity adds depth to the narrative and keeps the reader guessing.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Johanna Van Veen's writing is dark, twisted, and delightful.

However, I found the development of Agnes and Roos' relationship somewhat unconvincing due to the power imbalance and class differences, especially since Roos feels socially stunted. I appreciated that Agnes was portrayed as a flawed yet beautiful biracial Javanese widow navigating the complexities of a White, wealthy Dutch society.",
            "This story serves as a powerful reminder that tuberculosis remains a modern affliction affecting millions. Willemijin embodies the archetype of the classic gothic \"consumption\" patient, perfectly capturing the genre's essence. The narrative evokes comparisons to works like Henry James's *The Turning of the Screw*, Daphne du Maurier's *Rebecca*, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's *The Yellow Wallpaper*, and even *Les Misérables*—particularly the Mama and Roos scene, which echoes a moment with Cosette. Additionally, the influence of *Doctor Who* and its Weeping Angels is felt, especially in Roos's nightmares."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a well-balanced gothic story with a rich atmosphere and intriguing character dynamics. While some aspects of the relationships and ending could have been stronger, the novel successfully captures the essence of the genre and offers thoughtful representation and thematic depth.",

Good job, Past Me.  \n\n- **Gothic Atmosphere and Balance:**  \n  This was a nice gothic story that felt well-balanced, though it could irk some readers (not me) who would prefer reading the influences that van Veen nods to. The generally decaying wealthy atmosphere was essential for me to stick with a gothic story.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  My favorite parts were the relationship between Roos and Ruth, the basic explanation of how spirit companions are created, and the dynamic between Agnes and Roos. However, I was not always sold on Agnes and Roos' relationship as it developed, given the power dynamic and difference in class, especially since Roos feels socially stunted.  \n\n- **Character Representation:**  \n  I appreciated that Agnes was allowed to be a flawed, beautiful biracial Javanese widow navigating a White, wealthy Dutch class.  \n\n- **Themes and Real-World Connections:**  \n  The reminder that tuberculosis is still a modern disease that plagues millions of people was impactful. Willemijin being a classic \"wasting away\" gothic consumption patient felt right for capturing the genre.  \n\n- **Ending and Reflection:**  \n  The ending might not have been as thrilling as I expected, but it feels like the right direction to go with, especially after some reflection.  \n\n- **Influences and References:**  \n  Some of the obvious influences and my suspected ones include:  \n  - Henry James, *The Turning of the Screw*  \n  - Daphne du Maurier, *Rebecca*  \n  - Charlotte Perkins Gilman, *The Yellow Wallpaper*  \n  - *Les Misérables* (the Mama and Roos scene reminded me of a Cosette scene)  \n  - *Doctor Who* and the Weeping Angels (because of a Roos nightmare)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a well-balanced gothic story with a rich atmosphere and intriguing character dynamics. While some aspects of the relationships and ending could have been stronger, the novel successfully captures the essence of the genre and offers thoughtful representation and thematic depth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 out of 5 stars"

It serves as a great introduction for someone who wants to explore gothic literature but finds the classics too boring.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Roos, a gifted girl who can see spirits, particularly a spirit named Ruth. Exploited by her Mama, Roos is forced to perform fake seances to earn income, enduring significant trauma throughout her adolescence and young adulthood. The plot takes a turn when Agnes, a mysterious and beautiful woman, attends a seance to communicate with her late husband, leading Roos into unfamiliar territory.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n  The beginning of the book was fantastic—it was incredibly atmospheric, haunting, and spooky. The writing was vivid and impeccably paced, creating a strong sense of immersion.  \n\n- **Narrative Development and Expectations:**  \n  As the story progressed, it didn’t unfold as I initially imagined. While this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, I realized the book is ultimately a love story, as the author emphasizes in her note.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Comparisons:**  \n  This book would appeal to fans of specific gothic works like *The Fall of the House of Usher* (short story), *Rebecca* (the novel), or *Crimson Peak* (the movie).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of gothic and supernatural elements, with a strong atmospheric start and vivid writing. While it diverges from initial expectations, it ultimately delivers a poignant love story. It’s an excellent choice for readers interested in gothic literature but seeking a more accessible entry point than the classics.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The ending strikes a poignant balance of sadness, hope, and relief. Roos experiences significant character development, and her transformation is both compelling and satisfying, leaving some aspects open to interpretation. The story centers on the evolving relationship between Roos and Agnes. Trapped in an abusive situation with Mama, who forces her into fraudulent séances, Roos finds rescue in Agnes, a wealthy widow. Their connection becomes the heart of the novel, beautifully evolving from a servile dynamic to a loving bond. \n\nThe lore surrounding the ghosts is intriguing; they are rare and require specific conditions for their creation, such as preservation in a bog and a human feeding them blood while naming them. This process forges a unique connection between the spirit and the person. The ancient ghosts, like Ruth and Peter, have lost their humanity, adding an unsettling tension to the narrative. Ruth, in particular, exhibits violent tendencies that can be quite discomforting. Overall, the story weaves together themes of resilience, love, and the complexities of human connection.",
            "Roos begins as a timid, subservient character but gradually gains confidence as Agnes allows her to grow. Her lingering fear of abandonment adds depth to her character. Agnes herself is complex, with her family's dark secrets and traumas unfolding throughout the narrative, enriching the story further.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Discovery and Initial Impressions:**\n   - I found this book through my library on Libby, and the premise was super intriguing. I hadn’t heard anyone talking about it, which made it a pleasant surprise.\n   - I can’t believe how much I liked this book, especially since it’s not widely discussed.\n\n- **Genre and Style:**\n   - This isn’t an action-packed story; it’s more of a literary experience, which I very much enjoy.\n   - The pacing is slow, so it’s not for readers who need constant action. However, if you enjoy gothic, sapphic, and spooky stories, this is a great choice.\n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**\n   - I listened to this as an audiobook, and I highly recommend it. The narrator was excellent.\n   - The only minor irritation was that the names Roos and Ruth are quite similar, which occasionally caused confusion, but it didn’t significantly affect my experience.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**\n   - The book is dripping in atmosphere. The setting is gothic and haunting, and the writing is vivid.\n   - I would give it a 10/10 on atmosphere. The flowing prose and sensory descriptions made me feel completely immersed.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - The story revolves around two women, Roos and Agnes, and their evolving relationship. Roos is trapped in an abusive situation with Mama, who forces her to participate in fraudulent séances. Agnes, a wealthy widow, rescues Roos, and their connection becomes the heart of the novel.\n   - The relationship between Agnes and Roos is beautifully developed. They find solace in each other, and their bond transforms from servile to loving, shedding the initial power dynamic.\n   - The lore of the ghosts is fascinating. Ghosts are rare in this world, and their creation involves specific conditions, such as the body being preserved (e.g., in a bog) and a human feeding the spirit their blood and naming them. This creates a unique bond between the spirit and the person.\n   - The ghosts, like Ruth and Peter, are ancient and no longer feel human, which adds tension and unease. Ruth, in particular, is prone to violence, which made me uncomfortable at times.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Roos starts as a timid, subservient character but gains confidence as Agnes gives her room to grow. Her lingering fear of being discarded adds depth to her character.\n   - Agnes is a complex character, and her family’s dark secrets and trauma are gradually revealed, adding layers to the story.\n\n- **Trigger Warnings and Sensitive Content:**\n   - There is a trigger warning for incest. Agnes’s sister-in-law and husband were romantically and sexually involved, resulting in a pregnancy. This was justified in the story as an attempt to keep their bloodline pure due to Agnes not being white.\n   - This plot point was a bit unsettling, but I understand why it was included.\n\n- **Symbolism and Themes:**\n   - The saint statues are intriguing, and I’m curious about their symbolic meaning. They add another layer of mystery to the story.\n\n- **Ending:**\n   - The ending was a mix of sadness, hope, and relief. Roos undergoes significant character development, and I appreciated the transformation she undergoes.\n   - It’s a satisfying conclusion, though it leaves some room for interpretation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a haunting, atmospheric, and beautifully written gothic novel with a strong focus on character relationships and development. While the pacing is slow and the plot is minimal, the vivid setting, unique ghost lore, and emotional depth make it a standout read. It’s perfect for fans of sapphic, spooky, and literary stories, though it does contain sensitive content that may not be for everyone.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Atmosphere: 10/10\n- Overall Enjoyment: Highly recommended for fans of gothic and literary fiction."

            "This Dutch lesbian melodrama follows Roos and Agnes, two girls seemingly haunted by long-dead spirits. Their love blossoms during a staged séance, but their relationship ultimately leads to death and despair. While the premise initially struck me as somewhat silly, the execution—rich with gothic and supernatural romance—renders it compelling.",
            "In this story, Roos lives with her mother, a fraudulent medium who uses her daughter to amplify the eerie experience for clients. Agnes, a young widow, sees through the deception but feels a strong connection to Roos. Their relationship is both sweet and tragic, as they bond over their shared ability to see spirits—or perhaps their shared mental illness. Supporting characters, such as Wilhelmine, Agnes’s antagonistic sister-in-law, add depth to the narrative.",
            "The writing is superb, infused with a melodramatic flair that suits the genre perfectly. Roos's conversations with a court-appointed psychologist serve as effective foreshadowing, enhancing the story's tension and sense of inevitability leading to the tragic ending.",

Set in the 1950s, this tone is fitting, reflecting the challenges faced by queer individuals and women during that time. The melodramatic writing style complements the gothic, supernatural romance genre, amplifying the eerie and tragic atmosphere.",

            "The story unfolds as a slow burn, characteristic of Gothic horror. Even when the action intensifies, it often feels minimal. The old-fashioned language and potential language barrier contributed to a slower reading pace for me. Set in the Netherlands during the early 1950s, post-WWII, it follows Roos Beckman, a fraudulent medium who can see only one ghost—her spirit companion, Ruth. The plot centers on Roos being acquired by the wealthy widow Agnes Knoop, who shares her gift. The narrative delves into the descent into madness and destruction at Agnes's estate, forming the heart of the tale.",

            "Roos grows up in a hostile and abusive environment, enduring starvation, beatings, and exploitation as a sexual object. Throughout the story, she is manipulated first by her mother, who exploits both her and Ruth, and later by Agnes, with whom she becomes dangerously infatuated. Roos is willing to jeopardize the entire Rozentuin for Agnes, whom she finds irresistibly attractive.

Roos can see spirits, specifically her spirit companion, Ruth, while no one else can. Some people believe her, while others think she is mad.  \n\n- **Character Development (Roos):**  \n   - Roos was raised in a hostile and abusive environment, starved, beaten, and used as a sexual object for much of her younger life.  \n   - She is manipulated throughout the book, first by her mother, who exploits her and Ruth, and later by Agnes, whom she becomes deeply infatuated with.  \n   - Roos is willing to do anything for Agnes, even to the point of jeopardizing the entire Rozentuin.  \n\n- **Relationships:**  \n   - **Roos and Agnes:** Roos is unhealthily enamored with Agnes, finding her irresistibly attractive. Agnes, however, is secretive and withholds critical information about her past, including her marriage to Thomas.  \n   - **Roos and Willemijn:** Their relationship is estranged and transactional. Willemijn admits that Roos is merely a pawn in her plans.  \n   - **Roos and Ruth:** Roos describes her bond with Ruth as motherly or familial, but Ruth uses this bond to possess Roos and harm others. Ruth’s affections seem more possessive and jealous, especially regarding Roos’s relationship with Agnes.  \n\n- **Characterization (Agnes):**  \n   - Agnes is secretive and has a history of lying and deceiving, as noted by Dr. Montague. She doesn’t reveal the truth about her marriage to Thomas until it’s too late.  \n\n- **Characterization (Other Characters):**  \n   - I hate Willemijn, Thomas, and Mama. They are all deeply flawed and contribute to the toxic dynamics in the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Overall, I liked the book, but the characters somewhat ruined it for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel has a compelling concept and explores complex relationships and character dynamics.

This slump lasted for a while before the story picked up again and maintained excellent pacing in the final third. The use of a narrative device—cutting from the story to a later interview that reveals future events—was something I didn’t enjoy. It disrupted the flow and took away from the element of surprise.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  The sapphic relationship between Roos and Agnes was beautifully handled. Their friendship blossoming into something more felt authentic and compelling.  \n\n- **Supernatural vs. Psychological Ambiguity:**  \n  The spirit aspect of the story was exceptionally well-executed. The author masterfully balanced the ambiguity between whether the haunting was real or a manifestation of mental illness. I personally interpreted it as a real haunting, but the narrative leaves enough room for readers to draw their own conclusions.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  The final third of the book was perfectly paced, and the conclusion was satisfying.

            "Ruth and Peter's quirky traits and fondness for each other made them truly endearing. However, I found Roos to be a less appealing character. Her extreme neediness and tendency to center everything around herself became tiresome. While her trauma from her upbringing was evident, her inability to allow Agnes to experience any negative feelings without assuming they were about her was frustrating. Although Agnes and Roos shared a trauma bond, I didn't care for their romantic relationship; it felt more like a mother-daughter dynamic. Roos lacked a warm maternal figure, and Agnes had never had children, which made the Freudian undertones of their relationship—both motherly and romantic—uncomfortable for me.",
            "The author skillfully hints at Thomas's abuse, particularly during the séance scene, which piqued my suspicion. However, the unfolding narrative kept me second-guessing. The strong Victorian atmosphere of the book influenced my perception, making me envision the story in that context, despite its 1940s and 1950s setting. This may stem from the fact that the story isn't set in America, as my references for that era are primarily U.S.-based.",

The duality of Roos's existence—navigating a world where she is a medium with a spirit companion and another where she experiences schizophrenia and hallucinates ghosts—was captivating. Each event seamlessly intertwined both narratives, keeping me engaged and guessing throughout the story.",

            "In this story, Roos, the protagonist, has the unsettling ability to see ghosts, particularly one named Ruth, who has haunted her since childhood. Their relationship is deeply codependent and often creepy, yet Ruth remains Roos's only source of comfort amid her abusive home life, where her mother forces her to conduct unwanted seances. \n\nWhen Roos meets Agnes, a widow with her own spirit companion, their bond contrasts sharply with Roos's experience with Ruth. Agnes's relationship with her ghost is tender and nurturing, and as they live together in Agnes's late husband's estate, Roos begins to transform. She reflects, “I truly think I wasn’t aware that I had a body before I met Agnes... With Agnes, my body no longer was an inconvenience to be brutalised into submission. It was as if she had woken me from a deep slumber with that lover’s kiss at the séance.” \n\nThrough her connection with Agnes, Roos discovers a new sense of self and healing, making this story a poignant exploration of love, trauma, and personal awakening.",

Each section opens with a transcript of an interview between a doctor and a patient, creating a seamless transition into the subsequent chapters, which focus solely on the patient's voice. This structure resonated with me and enhanced the reading experience.",

Roos, accompanied by her spirit guide Ruth, stands out as particularly fascinating; her complex past blurs the line between truth and fantasy. Agnes, who grapples with prejudice and her own troubled history, is equally compelling. Additionally, Willemijn, who confronts her own demons and illness, adds significant depth to the narrative.",
            "The book is set in the Netherlands and features Dutch character and place names, yet it is written in English. This combination felt somewhat jarring, as the presence of Dutch names amidst English text created a sense of inconsistency. Anglicizing the names or writing the book in Dutch would have been more fitting, considering the setting and the author's Dutch background. Additionally, there were awkward moments, such as characters expressing love in English or struggling to understand someone speaking English, which disrupted the flow of the story.",

Each \"part\" began with a transcript of an interview between a doctor and a patient, which made the following chapters feel like a continuation of the interview, with only the patient speaking. This structure worked well for me.  \n\n- **Setting and Language:**  \n   - The book is set in the Netherlands, with Dutch character and place names, but it’s written in English. This felt a bit jarring at times, as reading Dutch names amidst English text seemed inconsistent. It would have been easier if the names were anglicized or if the book were written in Dutch, given the setting and the author’s Dutch background.  \n   - There were occasional awkward sentences, such as characters saying, \"I love you,\" in English or realizing they couldn’t understand someone because they were speaking English. These moments pulled me out of the story.  \n\n- **Genre and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The book is a Gothic horror story, but I didn’t find it particularly scary. This might be because I grew up watching horror movies, so I’m not easily frightened. However, the eerie setting—a large, empty mansion surrounded by bogs in the middle of nowhere—was well-crafted and immersive. It felt like a place where one’s mind could easily wander into fantasy.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The characters were intriguing and well-developed. Roos, with her spirit guide Ruth, was particularly fascinating—her past made it unclear whether she was telling the truth or living in a fantasy. Agnes, who faced prejudice and had her own troubled history, was also compelling. Willemijn, battling her own demons and illness, added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite the minor issues with language and setting, I found the story interesting and engaging.

            "This evocative gothic debut follows Roos, a young girl enduring adversity and exploitation at the hands of her mother, who forces her to work in a séance business. The story takes a dramatic turn when Roos forms a profound bond with an old spirit named Ruth, ultimately becoming the star of the show. The narrative unfolds through interviews with Roos and a psychiatrist following the tragic events at the Knoop family estate, Rozentuin. The use of an unreliable narrator adds depth and intrigue, making the story engaging. However, the inclusion of multiple themes and a complex structure occasionally leaves some elements feeling rushed or underdeveloped. Despite this, the pacing keeps the reader invested, and the twisting narrative techniques are skillfully executed.",

The well-developed characters add significant depth to the story.",

Nonetheless, the exploration of these themes enriches the narrative and enhances its relevance."

For a book about Roos' journey processing and overcoming her childhood trauma from her mother, I felt like it didn't go as deep into her sometimes unhealthy and codependent dynamic with Ruth. The Agnes storyline was similar in the sense that there were certainly toxic aspects to it, from Roos feeling beholden to Agnes and putting her on a pedestal, to Agnes' refusal to properly communicate with Roos.  \n\n- **Character Development and Resolution:**  \n  Roos has a small victory toward the end in terms of her dynamic with Ruth, but I feel like it was at least a bit of a missed opportunity. While both of these stories were interesting to read about, I don't know if I could say that they were resolved in a satisfying way. The author tried to have Roos strike out on her own at the end and begin her healing arc, but excludes much of Ruth and Agnes' behavior as something Roos needs to heal from.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Atmosphere:**  \n  Overall, I had a good time reading, and the vibes of this book were great for fall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book excels in its gothic atmosphere and thematic exploration of mental health through the metaphor of ghosts.

However, the ending left me somewhat disappointed; it felt drawn out and took a direction I didn't quite appreciate. Despite this, the rest of the narrative was fantastic! The plot takes a darker turn when a client named Agnes attends a séance and falls in love with Roos, feeling compelled to save her. Roos then moves in with Agnes and her ailing sister-in-law. While life improves, it doesn't turn out to be as wonderful as anticipated.",
            "I appreciated the character development in this story, particularly that of Roos, a girl in her twenties who appears no older than fifteen due to her extreme thinness. Having been mistreated throughout her life, Roos's journey reflects her struggle to understand her worth and navigate her circumstances.",
            "In this story, Roos encounters Ruth, a spirit who becomes her eternal protector and companion. Living with her mother, they conduct séances, using Ruth's presence to create the illusion that Roos is possessed by the spirits of others' loved ones.",

But everything else was just great!  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved the characters' development. This is the story of Roos, a 20-ish-year-old girl who is so thin she looks no older than 15. Roos was mistreated her whole life and didn’t know any better.  \n\n- **Themes and Relationships:**  \n  One day, Roos meets Ruth, a spirit bound to her who becomes her home and protection forever. Roos lives with her momma, and they perform \"seances.\" Because of Ruth, they’re able to pretend that Roos is possessed by people's family spirits.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Twists:**  \n  The story takes a dark turn when a client, Agnes, comes to a seance and falls in love with Roos, feeling the need to save her.

I wish Ruth had taken on the role of the main villain instead of ending up with Roos after Thomas returned and Agnes passed away. To me, Ruth felt like a parasite, keeping Roos dependent on her and eliminating anyone who threatened that dynamic. Agnes should have survived! I envisioned a scenario where Agnes and Roos defeated Ruth and Thomas, shared a heartfelt goodbye with Peter (whom I adored), and lived in peace thereafter. However, I accept the ending the author chose.",

            "The ending of the novel is satisfying, delivering a payoff that aligns with the reader's investment in the story. It leaves a lasting impression, with emotionally and thematically significant moments etched in memory. This sapphic romance is intricately woven with dark, chilling themes, centering on Roos, a woman with psychic abilities ensnared in her mother’s manipulative grasp. The narrative explores the homophobic and patriarchal horrors of post-WWII Dutch society, shedding light on the struggles faced by lesbian survivors. Rich in Gothic horror elements, the story features an undead character, Ruth, who adds depth and pathos to the tale.",
            "Roos is a complex character marked by psychic fragility and significant romantic struggles, evoking the essence of Tennessee Williams' Blanche Dubois but with greater agency. Ruth, the undead companion, stands out as a unique and emotionally resonant figure, often becoming the reader's favorite zombie. The characters are profoundly shaped by their personal and national traumas, which are vividly depicted and integral to the narrative.",
            "The author, despite their Dutch background, impressively writes in English, capturing the cultural nuances of the story. Their evocative and thought-provoking prose prompts deep reflection on human relationships and societal norms. The novel effectively draws me into its world, overcoming my initial reservations about certain tropes, such as con-artist psychics and spirit lovers.",
            "Set in post-WWII Netherlands, the novel immerses readers in a unique cultural and historical context that enriches the narrative. The distinct Dutch setting is a defining element, making it impossible to relocate the story without sacrificing its essence. The atmosphere is dark and chilling, infused with a strong sense of Gothic horror that is both unsettling and captivating."

        "conclusion": "The author's novel is a masterful blend of sapphic romance, Gothic horror, and historical trauma, set against the backdrop of post-WWII Netherlands. The story is rich in character development, atmospheric setting, and thought-provoking themes, making it a compelling and memorable read. The unique cultural perspective and the emotional depth of the characters, particularly Ruth, elevate the novel beyond typical horror tropes. The ending is satisfying, and the overall experience is one of deep engagement and reflection.",

Despite this, the conclusion was masterfully handled and made up for the slower sections.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating and morbid read, with a beautifully crafted Gothic atmosphere and a fearless exploration of dark themes. While the romance subplot felt rushed and the pacing slowed in the second half, the bittersweet and masterful conclusion left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story turned my stomach at times, yet I found myself deeply engaged with its emotional depth.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship between the protagonist and their older widowed companion was compelling, as was the connection with the bog mummy ghost that had haunted them since childhood.

Typically, in gothic stories, the villain gets their comeuppance, but here, it felt ambiguous—almost as if the villain might have won. This unresolved tension added a thought-provoking layer to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel masterfully blends emotional intensity, complex character relationships, and classic gothic tropes, though its ambiguous ending left me questioning the moral resolution.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  - I wasn’t sure how gothic horror would work for me, but this book was surprisingly sweet and romantic despite its horror elements.  \n  - The pacing is slow, leaning more toward creeping dread than outright terror, which I enjoyed.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The story is set in post-World War II Netherlands, and the atmosphere is dark and creepy, effectively established through the introduction of Roos' ghostly friend, Ruth.  \n  - The remote mansion setting adds to the eerie vibe, with increasingly disturbing events unfolding as the story progresses.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - The protagonist, Roos, is a young woman with a unique ability to see ghosts, and her relationship with her domineering mother is central to the story.  \n  - The wealthy young widow who befriends Roos adds complexity to the narrative, and their interactions are intriguing.  \n  - The alternating POV between Roos and a psychiatrist’s interviews creates a layered perspective on Roos’ mental state and the traumatic event she’s involved in.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - Trauma is a central theme, and much of it is portrayed sympathetically, with moments that resonated deeply with me.  \n  - The story includes some gore and spice, but it never becomes overly disgusting, striking a balance that worked well for me.  \n\n- **Cultural and Historical Context:**  \n  - There are slurs against Asian people that fit the time period but are important to be aware of before reading.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - While *My Darling Dreadful Thing* isn’t a new favorite, I definitely enjoyed it and would recommend it to fans of slow-burn, atmospheric horror.  \n  - I’m interested in picking up future books by the author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis gothic horror novel blends sweetness and romance with a dark, eerie atmosphere, exploring themes of trauma and relationships in post-World War II Netherlands. While the pacing is slow and the horror leans toward creeping dread, the story is compelling and emotionally resonant. Despite some dated language, it’s a worthwhile read for fans of atmospheric horror.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The progression felt satisfying and kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n  The love between Ruth, Roos, and Agnes was definitely interesting but in a good way.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The book is well-written, with the author skillfully setting a tone that is both eerie and stomach-churning.  \n   - The style is described as \"eerie and beautiful,\" which adds to the book's appeal.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Roos, the protagonist, is portrayed as an unusual and ill-adjusted girl, with outdated speech and behavior.  \n   - Roos and her love interest, Ruth (a mummified corpse), share a similar manner of speaking and acting, which adds to their off-putting yet intriguing dynamic.  \n   - Other characters, however, feel less authentic, as their speech and actions often seem to serve the reader rather than the story.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n   - The book is structured as Roos recounting her life story to her doctor, leading up to the main event.  \n   - This narrative choice results in excessive over-explanation, with characters frequently telling rather than showing, which makes the story feel like a slog.  \n   - The pacing suffers due to the lack of suspense, as the ending is revealed early on, leaving little room for guesswork or intrigue.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Suspense:**  \n   - The story lacks suspense, as key plot points and the ending are disclosed early, leaving little to wonder about.  \n   - Other story beats are introduced but are immediately explained or easily assumed, reducing the need for reader engagement or curiosity.  \n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The book explores themes of queerness in horror, off-putting intimacy, and slow-burn horror, which are compelling and unique.  \n   - The setting and cast are interesting, contributing to the book's eerie and beautiful atmosphere.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Despite its potential, the book's execution makes it difficult to fully enjoy or recommend.  \n   - It may appeal to readers who enjoy themes of queerness in horror, unsettling intimacy, slow-burn horror, or fans of the movie *Crimson Peak*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *My Dreadful Darling* has many strengths, including its eerie writing style, unique themes, and intriguing characters, its over-reliance on telling rather than showing, lack of suspense, and slow pacing make it a challenging read. The book has potential but falls short in execution, leaving me unsure whether to recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story centers on Roos, who is sold by her mother to a wealthy widow and moves into a decaying estate. While the premise is intriguing, the execution falls short of expectations. The plot seems more appropriate for a YA audience, which doesn't resonate with my personal tastes. However, the sapphic romance adds emotional depth and warmth, offering a poignant contrast to the darker themes.",
            "In this story, Roos, the protagonist and a medium, relies on her spirit companion to enhance her séances. However, her character often feels younger than her early twenties, likely a reflection of her abusive past. This immaturity can make the prose seem simplistic at times.",
            "The prose occasionally felt simplistic, which diminished the overall experience. However, there were standout moments of effectively creepy imagery.",
            "The gothic setting and dark atmosphere were captivating, enhanced by a crumbling family estate and séances that contributed to the eerie vibe. The 1950s Netherlands backdrop stood out, offering a unique and immersive experience.",
            "The concept of a spirit companion assisting Roos during séances is both intriguing and full of potential. The approach to communicating with the undead in a non-creepy manner feels fresh and engaging."

            "The book alternates between psychiatric interviews and Roos’s personal narrative. While the contrast between the clinical tone of the interviews and the gothic, Poe-inspired storytelling is intentional, it doesn't always blend seamlessly. The first part is gripping and eerie, but the macabre atmosphere fades over time, leading the spirits to lose their unsettling quality and veer into the realm of silliness. Pacing is a significant issue; the story unfolds at a painfully slow rate, generating frustration rather than fear. Roos’s insistence on telling her story “her way” further complicates matters, as her narrative often meanders and struggles to find its focus.",
            "Roos is a complex character with a compelling backstory, but her narrative style can be frustrating. Her tendency to ramble and sidestep the main point detracts from her otherwise intriguing personality.",
            "The story effectively establishes a gothic tone reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe from the outset. However, this atmosphere falters as the narrative unfolds, causing the initial creepiness to dissipate.",
            "This debut novel shows promise but struggles with pacing and uneven execution. Although the gothic elements and premise are compelling, the slow progression and inconsistent tension may not resonate with all readers.",

She shares a unique bond with an ancient, vampire-like familiar spirit that possesses her with her consent. As Roos navigates her life and a murder case with a psychiatrist to assess her competency for trial, the premise is intriguing and full of potential. However, the execution ultimately fails to deliver on that promise."

            "This dark and gothic novel follows Roos, a 21-year-old woman haunted by a traumatic past, and her spirit companion, Ruth, a centuries-old bog body. The story unfolds through fragments of a psychiatrist’s journal, which creates uncertainty around Roos’s delusions and the reality of her experiences. This narrative structure effectively builds tension and sustains an unsettling atmosphere. However, the ending, though predictable, feels anticlimactic and fails to add significant value to the overall story.",

            "The novel delves into dark themes such as trauma, flawed coping mechanisms, and the psychological effects of abuse. The author approaches these subjects with compassion, skillfully avoiding romanticization while highlighting the complexities of trauma. A particularly poignant aspect is the exploration of cultural identity and language, especially through the character of Agnes, who is of Indonesian descent."

However, the slow pacing, lack of a major climax, and reliance on familiar tropes detracted from the experience. While it didn’t deliver the spookiness I hoped for, it had its moments and would appeal to fans of gothic, atmospheric tales.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This dynamic is understandable, as Roos, a people-pleaser, is manipulated by Willemijn and fears disappointing Agnes. However, it ultimately feels like a convenient plot device leading to the big twist in the final third. While the twist is logical, it also comes across as somewhat predictable.",

The book also emphasized the significance of non-romantic and non-familial love, a perspective often overlooked in media."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Atmosphere, Tone, Pacing, and Characters:**  \n   - The book excels in creating a great atmosphere, tone, and pacing. The characters are well-developed and engaging.  \n\n- **Themes and Subversion of Expectations:**  \n   - The story didn’t follow the expected path based on the blurb (e.g., Ruth becoming jealous and possessive over Roos and Agnes). Instead, it explored a deeper theme about finding love and support in unexpected places, which I appreciated. The book also highlighted the importance of non-romantic and non-familial love, which is often overlooked in media.  \n\n- **Visceral Descriptions and Gothic Elements:**  \n   - The book was more visceral than I anticipated, with vivid descriptions of wounds, scars, blood, decay, and other dark elements. It effectively uses the classic Gothic trope of questioning whether the supernatural elements are real or a product of an unreliable narrator.  \n\n- **Use of Miscommunication as a Plot Device:**  \n   - Two-thirds of the book rely heavily on miscommunication, particularly Roos’ assumptions about Agnes’ marriage and her supposed desire to reunite with Thomas. While this miscommunication makes sense within the story (Roos is a people-pleaser manipulated by Willemijn and terrified of displeasing Agnes), it feels like a convenient plot device to set up the big twist in the final third of the book. The twist, while logical, was somewhat predictable.  \n\n- **Derivative Elements and Homage to Gothic Classics:**  \n   - The book is undeniably Gothic and acknowledges its influences, such as naming the main male spirit after *The Turn of the Screw* and including a quote like “Love makes monsters of us all.” However, by the end, it felt overly derivative of *Crimson Peak* and *Rebecca*, almost like a mashup of the two.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a solid Gothic novel with strong atmosphere, pacing, and characters. It subverted my expectations with its themes and delivered a visceral, dark experience. However, the heavy reliance on miscommunication and its derivative nature compared to other Gothic classics kept it from becoming a new favorite for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars."

The ending introduces convenient plot twists that contradict previously established rules, particularly regarding the timelines for spirits' returns, such as those of Thomas and Agnes, as well as the rationale behind Agnes's return as a spirit.",

Despite these flaws, the standout characters and fresh approach to ghosts made it worth the read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

Despite reading the author's note, I was still blindsided by the lack of horror elements. The spirit companion, while described as creepy, didn’t feel as unsettling as I anticipated.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The romance in the story felt less like a genuine connection and more like trauma bonding between the characters.

In contrast, the relationship between Roos and Ruth was far more compelling. Ruth’s fierce protectiveness—biting M’s throat, poisoning Agnes, and preferring death over separation—was intense. Roos forgives Ruth for these actions because she can't imagine life without her.

            "Agnes and Willemijn come across as one-dimensional, lacking depth and complexity. While Roos, the main character, is more developed, she still feels somewhat underexplored. I could empathize with her due to her upbringing and life experiences, but her annoying traits made it difficult to fully connect with her. In contrast, I found Ruth captivating, especially her origins inspired by bog bodies, which cleverly explained the scarcity of spirits. Her fierce loyalty and overprotection of Roos were both unsettling and endearing, particularly given Roos' lack of affection throughout her life. The vivid descriptions of Ruth possessing Roos for tasks like performing séances were engaging and added depth to the narrative.",
            "The writing is strong, presented in the first person from Roos' perspective, with the exception of the interview transcripts. Roos' use of somewhat antiquated language, despite the 1950s setting, lends a haunting quality to the narrative. The vivid descriptions, especially of the house where Roos lives, create a beautiful atmosphere. I wish I could visualize it more clearly, as I imagine it would be enchanting for those who can.",

I enjoyed this aspect quite a bit, as it adds complexity to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  - I loved Ruth, particularly how her origins were inspired by bog bodies, which explained why there aren’t many spirits wandering around.

            "About 30% into the book, I found it difficult to resume reading after a break. The story failed to maintain the eerie atmosphere it initially promised, as the characters led mundane lives despite the presence of disturbed spirits. The tension between the main characters, Roos and Agnes, lingered too long without significant developments. While the plot did gain momentum in the middle and towards the end, I craved more depth regarding the spirits and greater substance in the action. The ending was satisfactory, with the writing effectively intertwining past and present events. The interview segments were well-executed and connected nicely to earlier plot points, but Roos’s lack of consequences for her crimes felt unresolved. I had hoped for a courtroom scene for Roos, but it never materialized.",

The narrative shifts between a past point of view, case studies involving a doctor and a patient, and the prosecution of Roos, which disrupted the flow for me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I felt the characters were underdeveloped. While Roos and Agnes share a kiss (spoiler), their personalities and relationships lacked depth, making it hard to fully connect with them.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The sense of eeriness was one of the highlights of the book. It delivers a gothic horror vibe that can leave readers shocked and captivated, making it a great choice for those seeking a chilling experience.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Roos, who struggles to prove her innocence and sanity in a world where spirits are real. The psychological tension between Roos and Doctor Montague, who questions her mental state, adds an intriguing layer to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I had hoped, it has its strengths, particularly in its eerie atmosphere and gothic horror elements. However, the slow pacing and underdeveloped characters detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story felt slow and disjointed, making it hard to remain engaged. Conversations with the doctor interrupted the narrative flow, fostering a sense of detachment from the events. Additionally, these dialogues revealed too much, diminishing any suspense or sense of discovery.",
            "The characters lacked likability, making it difficult to connect with them. Roos' character was inconsistent, displaying childish traits in some instances while exhibiting unexpected maturity in others. Her knowledge of historical facts, like bog burials, felt implausible considering her background of growing up in a cage.",

Additionally, the sparse and unresolved references to Agnes' family kris were disappointing, as they hinted at a potential plot point that ultimately went nowhere."

In general, I liked how weird and dark this book was.  \n\n- **Critiques of the Narrative Structure:**  \n  Where it lost me was the sessions with the doctor. I really don’t like when the narrative jumps ahead to reveal future events, then we have to work backwards to learn how we got there. It just never hits with me.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Romance:**  \n  I found Agnes to be a fascinating character, but the romance between her and Roos didn’t resonate with me. This might be because some of Roos’ manufactured childishness is still stressed with Agnes when she’s initially with her.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  This is a creepy read with some great vibes and a wild grave-robbing scene.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Replay Value:**  \n  While I enjoyed certain aspects, it’s not a book I’ll be returning to in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis gothic horror novel has a lot of strengths, including its dark and weird tone, unique elements like bog bodies, and intriguing character dynamics.

            "The story was enjoyable but ultimately felt restrained, particularly towards the end. The climax was confusing and anti-climactic, especially regarding the reveal of Agnes's death. Pacing issues slowed the buildup to the climax, and the court case at the end seemed unnecessary, prolonging an already lackluster conclusion. Thomas's resolution felt abrupt and unsatisfying, and the title felt awkwardly tacked on, diminishing its significance.",
            "I found Roos and Agnes's romance sweet, though Agnes's age and appearance were unclear. Willemijn's age was also ambiguous, which made it difficult to connect with her character. Ruth was somewhat interesting, but I would have liked to see more of her development. Peter felt underdeveloped and was absent for a significant portion of the story.",
            "The story delved into intriguing themes but ultimately fell short of fully embracing them.",
            "The story had the potential for a darker, more dramatic tone but ultimately felt too safe and optimistic. Agnes's death, despite the buildup, lacked the dramatic impact it deserved. Additionally, Roos forgives Ruth too easily, diminishing the emotional weight of their relationship. The ending felt rushed and failed to deliver the depth and darkness I had anticipated."

The pacing was uneven, the climax was underwhelming, and the ending felt rushed and overly safe. While I enjoyed it and would recommend it, I wish the story had committed more to its darker themes and delivered a more dramatic and impactful conclusion.",

            "The inclusion of the doctor's interviews initially adds an intriguing layer of realism and uncertainty to Roos' story. However, as the narrative progresses, the doctor's presence undermines the mystery by explicitly detailing elements that disrupt the ominous foreshadowing. The trial scene, in particular, feels redundant, eliminating any lingering doubts about Roos' mental health and the reality of the ghosts, which diminishes the story's intrigue. The final chapters come across as baffling and disjointed, with Roos embarking on a new life while still clinging to the hope of Agnes' return. The attempt to reintroduce doubt about Roos' mental state and the reality of Ruth through the doctor's writing feels unnecessary and ineffective, as the mystery has already been compromised. Despite this, the story's mystery elements are delightfully twisted, with each reveal eliciting gasps of horror. Roos' journey through the enigmas of Rozentuin is compelling enough to stand on its own, warranting a solid 4 stars.",
            "Ruth and Roos' codependent relationship is both compelling and intricate, creating a captivating dynamic. In contrast, Roos and Agnes' relationship, though still dark, hints at a more positive trajectory for Roos. The tension stemming from Roos' desperation to please Agnes and the fragile nature of their bond adds depth to the narrative.",

            "I appreciated the story's ambiguity regarding the reality of the spirits. When it was mentioned that the pills prevented their appearance, I found myself questioning their existence. However, the bite on Agnes's body and Roos's struggle to carry her to the bog suggest the spirits were indeed real. \n\nOn the other hand, I wasn't a fan of the plot. I initially expected a traditional ghost haunting story, but it took an unexpected turn. I did enjoy the unique way the spirits attach themselves to humans and their cannibalistic tendencies. The idea of a ghost friend licking your wounds for blood is genuinely spooky, which I appreciated. \n\nThe unexpected incest subplot caught me off guard, but I was more disappointed by the lack of conflict between Ruth and Roos. I wanted to see Ruth grapple with Roos finding happiness with someone else, but instead, we got a lackluster dead husband villain. I grew weary of hearing about him, only for his presence to be dismissed with indifference. Overall, it felt underwhelming.",
            "By the end of the story, I found myself really disliking Ruth. I'm still puzzled about whether we're meant to support Roos in accepting Ruth, especially when she claims she can't be happy without her. After all, Ruth tried to kill her beloved! I personally could never forgive Ruth, even if she wasn't the one who ultimately caused Agnes's death.",
            "The writing style was excellent, and I particularly enjoyed the seamless transition between Roos's perspective and the interview transcripts.",
            "In this novel, I felt like I was being queer-baited throughout the love story. I genuinely believed that was the case until the characters finally kissed—an event that didn’t occur until the last 80 pages! While I appreciated the sapphic love, I was left feeling a bit played. On a positive note, I loved Roos drinking Agnes's blood; I’m all for feral girlies!"

Instead, we got a lame dead husband villain.\n   - I got super tired of hearing about that man, just for him to be sent away by pure indifference. Lame.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - By the end of the story, I REALLY disliked Ruth.\n   - I am still confused as to if we are supposed to support Roos accepting Ruth and saying she can't be happy without her... Like, girlypop, Ruth tried to kill your beloved. What is going on?\n   - I would have personally never been able to forgive Ruth, even if she wasn't what ultimately killed Agnes.\n\n- **Ending and Ambiguity:**\n   - I did enjoy the ambiguity at the end of the story as to whether or not the spirits themselves were even real.\n   - When they said that the pills stopped the spirits from showing up, I genuinely did a double take and was unsure.\n   - I'm assuming they must have been real, though, with the bite on Agnes's body and the fact that Roos wouldn't have been able to carry her to the bog? idk, we'll just assume they're real.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**\n   - When it comes to the love story, I really felt like I was being queer-baited throughout the novel.\n   - I really believed that was what was happening up until they finally kissed.

The ambiguous ending invites interpretation, allowing readers to ponder whether Roos is trapped in delusions or if the supernatural events genuinely took place.",

Their relationship is intriguing but uncomfortable, particularly because Roos was a child when Ruth, who has been dead for centuries, connected with her.

Roos often makes poor decisions driven by her good intentions and her emotional attachment to Agnes, adding depth to their interactions.

There were moments, especially in the early descriptions of Ruth, where I really enjoyed it. However, in some areas, the descriptions felt a little tired and repetitive.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The pacing disappointed me. While the book held my interest throughout, not a lot actually happened, and I felt things needed to move a bit faster. The \"big dark gothic secret\" was predictable, and while it made sense, I had hoped for something more shocking or surprising.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  Roos and Ruth's relationship was a standout for me—fucked-up yet sweet, with a level of complication that I really enjoyed. Roos and Agnes were also compelling, though their relationship felt more straightforward compared to Roos and Ruth.  \n\n- **Execution of Threats and Tension:**  \n  The threats in the book were good in concept but fell short in execution. For example, Mr. Mesman was built up throughout the story, but the chapter dedicated to him felt underwhelming. I had already pieced together his actions through context clues and was hoping for something more surprising or impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIn summary, this is a pretty good book with strong spooky vibes and a focus on queer relationships, which I appreciated. However, it could have been better with faster pacing, more surprising plot twists, and more compelling execution of its threats. If you're here for the atmosphere and sapphic themes, you'll likely enjoy it, but don't expect too much in terms of unpredictability or tension.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The use of Dutch words in an English narrative also detracted from the reading experience. Overall, the story had potential but lacked the depth and consistency needed to fully deliver on its gothic atmosphere and thematic ambitions.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The few surprises I didn’t see coming felt typical for the genre and lacked a strong impact, leaving some parts of the plot feeling lackluster.",

It features classic elements such as a dilapidated house, family secrets, death, and love, enhanced by a touch of sapphic romance. I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of the spirits as both charming and unsettling companions—especially the benevolent ones. The imagery was striking, allowing me to vividly envision Ruth and Peter."

This inconsistency made it difficult to fully connect with or understand the character.  \n\n- **Supernatural Elements:**  \n  The spirits in the story suffered from an identity crisis, fluctuating between being spectral pets and fleeting glimpses of true horror. This lack of consistency diminished their impact and left them feeling underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The book aimed to explore themes of connection, trauma, and taboo subjects, but these felt underdeveloped. They were overshadowed by inconsistent characterization and pacing, resulting in a superficial exploration of deeper ideas.  \n\n- **Plot Convenience:**  \n  The story relied heavily on plot convenience, such as contagion being no match for advancing the plot. This detracted from the believability and immersion of the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*My Darling Dreadful Thing* is a decent distraction that offers a few hours of entertainment, but its uneven characters, inconsistent supernatural elements, rushed conclusion, and superficial exploration of deeper themes ensure it won’t linger long in the reader’s memory.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars – a middling rating reflecting its flaws and forgettable nature."

While this theme is prevalent in renowned horror novels like *The Haunting of Hill House* and *The Shining*, it’s not one I actively seek out.

I may give it another try in the future, but for now, it wasn’t the right fit.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars"

The premise—queer, spooky, and filled with possessions—sounded absolutely up my alley.  \n\n- **Themes and Enjoyment:**  \n  I really enjoyed the themes explored in the story. What was here was fun and enjoyable, and I cared for the characters. The story was engaging enough to keep me interested.  \n\n- **Pacing and Depth:**  \n  However, I felt like there could have been more from start to finish.

Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable read, and the stunning cover makes it a must-have for my collection.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75/5"

This made it feel unnatural and unsatisfying when it finally happened.  \n\n- **Characterization and Relationships:**  \n  The main character (MC) is described as childlike in both appearance and personality due to her upbringing. This made the romantic interest from a woman in her late 30s feel off-putting and inappropriate.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had strong atmospheric descriptions and an intriguing premise, its slow pacing, lack of thrilling moments, and poorly developed romance left me feeling disappointed. The mismatch between the MC’s characterization and the romantic subplot further detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The atmosphere evokes a sense of being unable to escape someone or something, which is not always comforting.  \n- **Genre Suitability (Gothic Fiction):**  \n  Gothic fiction is a genre that often feels hit or miss for me, and this particular novel falls into the \"miss\" category.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel’s haunting tone and atmosphere create an unsettling experience, but it didn’t resonate with me as a successful example of gothic fiction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While I went in expecting a strong horror vibe, it didn't fully deliver on that front.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The beginning of the book was really good and engaging, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming more and more disappointed. The latter part of the novel didn't maintain the same level of intrigue or quality as the opening.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Overall Experience:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the book for what it was. It had its moments, and I appreciated certain aspects of the story.  \n\n- **Language and Grammar:**  \n  There were a few language-related issues that bothered me, particularly instances where the grammar felt iffy or inconsistent.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started strong and had its enjoyable moments, it didn't fully meet my expectations as a horror story. The pacing faltered as the story progressed, and some language issues detracted from the overall experience. However, I still found it worthwhile for what it offered.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, since this is not a ghost story per se but more like a hallucinatory effect of mental illness, there’s no such explanation.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - The book was very slow-paced, with almost nothing happening even in 60% of the book. The actions were wrapped up in the last part of the book. If this was intentional, I think the author didn’t succeed in building the tension effectively.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot and Character Authenticity:**  \n   - The love story felt a little forced, especially from Agnes’ part. Her character, despite being written as a foreigner, lacked authenticity.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The only interesting character, in my opinion, was Willemijn, which felt very ironic given the other characters' lack of depth or appeal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise was intriguing, the execution fell short in terms of pacing, tension-building, and character authenticity.

It's probably the only reason I actually finished the book.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone (Gothic Horror):**  \n  While I enjoy Gothic Horror, this book missed the mark for me. It was a slow burn, which is typical for the genre, but the storyline didn’t engage me, and the payoff felt lackluster.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, particularly Ruth and Agnes, were strong, well thought out, and multi-layered, adding depth to the story. Their relationship and the more sensual scenes were the highlight of the book, creating excitement that the rest of the story lacked.  \n\n- **Plot and Engagement:**  \n  The storyline didn’t captivate me, and I didn’t connect with the characters enough for their depth to save the dull plot.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  If you're new to the horror genre or only occasionally read horror, you might enjoy this book. However, if you're an avid horror reader who prefers disturbing and terrifying content, this might not be for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the audiobook narration was excellent and the characters were well-developed, the slow-paced plot and lack of a compelling storyline made this Gothic Horror novel fall short for me. It’s a decent choice for casual horror readers but may disappoint those seeking more intense and terrifying content.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Agnes initially thought Roos was a minor due to her malnutrition, and there was a significant power imbalance between them.\n   - Agnes took advantage of Roos' desperation for love and security, which was not adequately critiqued by the narrative.\n   - The romantic development between Roos and Agnes felt forced and lacked believability. Their interactions were limited, and Roos' insecurity and desperation overshadowed any genuine connection.\n\n- **Plot and Climax:**\n   - The climax was underwhelming. Agnes' solution to the threat posed by Thomas was to take medication that prevented them from seeing the ghosts, which did not address the physical danger the ghosts posed.\n   - The resolution felt weak and unempowering, suggesting that the ghosts might have been imaginary, which undermined the characters' struggles.\n   - The final confrontation with Thomas was anticlimactic, with Roos simply asking him to leave, and him complying without resistance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I was disappointed by this book. While the concept had great potential, the execution fell short in several key areas. The setting lacked authenticity, the characters were underdeveloped, and the relationships, particularly between Roos and Agnes, were problematic and unconvincing. The climax and resolution were unsatisfying, leaving me with a sense of missed opportunity.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

By the halfway mark, I decided not to finish the book.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The relationship dynamics felt off-putting. A 21-year-old character repeatedly calling a woman \"mama\" felt unnatural and gave me the \"ick.\" Additionally, the scene where Ruth drinks Roos' period blood was deeply unsettling and contributed to my discomfort with the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite an intriguing premise, the novel failed to hold my interest due to its slow pacing, unsettling character dynamics, and moments that felt unnecessarily disturbing. I ultimately chose not to finish it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1/5"

            "The mystery element lacks intrigue, and the decision to withhold the reason for Roos' trial feels contrived. The resolution is unsatisfying and vague. Additionally, the ghost rules are inconsistent; spirits are said to be unable to affect the physical world, yet they do so repeatedly. The inspiration from *The Turn of the Screw* is superficial, concentrating on the least compelling aspect—whether the spirits are real.",

Roos, the protagonist, comes across as overly naïve and inconsistent; her sheltered upbringing contradicts her level of sexual knowledge. The villains are one-dimensional, depicted as excessively evil and racist without any nuance. The romance between Roos and Agnes lacks chemistry; while Roos finds Agnes attractive, there’s no convincing reason for Agnes to reciprocate. Overall, their relationship feels flat and unengaging, with no meaningful progression.",

A particular line in a romantic scene—“my little darling thing, how you have grown since I first saw you”—is especially criticized for being disturbing and poorly crafted."
