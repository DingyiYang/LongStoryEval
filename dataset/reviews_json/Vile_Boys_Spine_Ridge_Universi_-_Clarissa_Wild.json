It seemed like the kind of story I would enjoy.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Structure:**  \n   - The first few chapters lacked a clear plot, leaving me confused about what was happening.  \n   - Too many characters were introduced without contributing meaningfully to the plot, adding to the confusion.  \n   - The plot felt disjointed, with sudden and unexplained developments, such as Caleb’s dad and Crystal’s mom’s storyline, Kai’s role, and Ares’ dad’s business.  \n   - The pacing was inconsistent, with major events (like Caleb’s mom’s death) happening abruptly without proper buildup or resolution.  \n\n- **Character Development and Point of View (POV):**  \n   - The frequent switching of POVs within chapters was disorienting and prevented me from connecting deeply with any character.  \n   - Just as characters started to become interesting, the POV would shift, leaving me frustrated and disconnected.  \n   - Some characters, like Ares and Crystal, had intriguing dynamics (e.g., Ares knowing Crystal wanted to kill him but making her fall in love), but these were not explored in depth.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**  \n   - The use of certain phrases, like “the nub,” felt awkward and distracting.  \n   - The dialogue and scenes, such as Blaine being tied up, had moments of intensity but were overshadowed by the overall confusion.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite my initial excitement, the book failed to hold my interest. I continued reading out of a sense of obligation rather than enjoyment.  \n   - The smutty scenes were a highlight but could not compensate for the lack of a coherent plot or character development.  \n   - By the end, I was skimming through the pages, unable to fully engage with the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had moments of potential, particularly in its steamy scenes and some character dynamics, it ultimately fell short due to its confusing plot, excessive POV switching, and lack of meaningful character development. The disjointed storytelling and unresolved questions left me frustrated and unsatisfied. I finished the book but would not recommend it to others.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a low rating (likely 2/5 or lower)."

            "The female main character (FMC) lacked the depth of Penelope from *Evil Boys*. While both characters harbored secrets and ulterior motives, this FMC came across as dull and exhausting. Her repetitive inner monologues, filled with self-deception, quickly diminished my interest. In contrast, I adored the male main characters (MMCs)! They embodied the morally grey archetype that any book lover craves. However, *Evil Boys* remains the standout. I enjoyed the camaraderie among the gangs and their witty banter. Lana, Kai, Nathan, and Mylo truly exemplify the essence of Evil Boys.",
            "I found the book unengaging until around 70-75% in, as I was already aware of the main character's fate from Evil Boys. This knowledge made the narrative feel slow and predictable, leaving me waiting for the story to unfold."

The potential was there, but the execution fell flat.  \n\n- **Male Characters (MMCs):**  \n   - I loved all the male main characters (MMCs)!

            "\"Vile Boys,\" the third installment in the Spine Ridge University Series, unfolds alongside \"Evil Boys.\" The story follows Crystal, a young woman who sacrifices her body to care for her mother, as she navigates her complex relationships with the boys of Tartarus House: Ares Torres, Blaine Navarro, and Caleb Preston. Rich with danger, drama, and unexpected twists, the narrative weaves together violence and steamy moments, making it a captivating read.

The boys of Tartarus House bring distinct dynamics to the story: two harbor animosity towards her, one seeks to be her savior, and another conceals a secret, yet they are all drawn to her. The established relationships among the boys and their interactions with Crystal add richness to the character dynamics. Additionally, cameos from familiar characters are a delightful treat for fans.

            "The twist revealing Crystal's manipulation of the boys was surprising and expertly crafted.",
            "Crystal is a strong and compelling character skilled in manipulation. Among the group, Ares stood out as my favorite; his assertiveness and emotional openness captivated me. Caleb’s sensitive and protective nature added significant depth to his character, while Blaine, though decent, was somewhat diminished by his excessive use of the nickname “darling.” I loved watching Crystal finally allow Ares into her life and embrace the boys. The highlights of their relationship were Ares’s blend of dominance and vulnerability. Caleb’s protectiveness towards both Crystal and Ares was heartwarming, and Blaine’s role in teaching Crystal self-defense showcased his protective instincts, even as his nickname habit detracted from his appeal."

While it’s a great book on its own, it didn’t fully live up to what I had hoped for.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The plot is a bit weird and takes almost half of the book to develop. However, once it gets going, it becomes engaging.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The spice was definitely spicy! With a 10” D, some jewelry, and plenty of MM and group scenes, it delivered on the heat. The dirty talk and the way the characters used their “dongs” were particularly memorable.  \n\n- **Hygiene Concerns:**  \n  One major issue I had was the lack of hygiene in certain scenes. Unless it’s a SA scene, I don’t want to read about such disregard for cleanliness. This is something I’ve mentioned before in other reviews, and it’s a recurring frustration for me.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Everyone in the book is unhinged, which makes for a wild ride. If you’re not prepared for that kind of energy, it might be overwhelming.  \n\n- **Twists and Emotional Impact:**  \n  There was a twist closer to the end of the book that reminded me why I fell in love with the *Sick Boys* series (the first books). It was a moment that really stood out and added depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a good book with plenty of twists and good spice, though the hygiene issues were a drawback.

While I don’t mind spice-heavy reads when I’m in the mood for them, the imbalance here was frustrating. Additionally, the one-on-one spice scenes with the guys were very closed-door and only described in detail when the main character, Crystal, was involved, which felt inconsistent and odd.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**  \n  The repetitive use of the word “darling” became unbearable. It felt overused and cringe-worthy, to the point where it detracted from my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Descriptive Language:**  \n  Some of the descriptions, like “pussy thumping,” were jarring and unintentionally humorous.

The lack of believable relationships and repetitive character traits, combined with some illogical plot points and overused phrases, make it a flawed read despite its engaging surface-level appeal.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "This series is packed with numerous intimate scenes—over 500 pages filled with them, in fact. While it can be excessive at times, the story begins to pick up towards the end, which is a welcome surprise. Overall, the heavy focus on sexual content can overshadow the plot, but the latter portion offers a glimpse of intrigue. ",

            "While I may deny it, I know the truth deep within my heart: I never expected to willingly surrender myself to such killers. These boys have tainted every part of me, leaving only a sweet, consuming hatred—the very hatred that fuels my desperate desire for them to claim me. No one has ever made me wish to surrender my soul as fervently as she does, wanting it for her own. If this desire leads to my ruin, so be it. She may see herself as the weak one, but I am utterly defenseless against her.",

To protect her mother, Crystal makes a deal to surrender herself to the boys—but there's a twist: Crystal's true identity is not what it seems.

His quirky complaints—like dead bodies in the freezer with his ice cream—and the scene featuring hot cocoa and a romance novel add to his charm. **Ares:** Initially difficult to connect with, Ares's dominant and obsessive nature ultimately became appealing. Gaining insight into his struggles fostered deep empathy for his character. **Caleb:** Instantly likable, Caleb's broody and reckless demeanor drew me in, and I particularly valued the connection between him and Ares. **Crystal and Group Dynamics:** The characters' interdependence was profound; they complemented one another beautifully.

            "This book is the weakest of the three. While the other two contained some semblance of a story, this installment mainly consists of the protagonist being assaulted for 75% of the narrative, leaving little room for plot development. The dialogue often felt disconnected, as if I had missed crucial context. \n\nThe last quarter finally introduces a bit of action—she's kidnapped and nearly auctioned off before being rescued, resulting in significant bloodshed. In the second book, a key detail about Felix emerges unexpectedly, and this installment hints at a complex relationship between Ares and Kai, which was never mentioned in Kai's book. \n\nThe story is riddled with inconsistencies. At one point, the protagonist wears a onesie, then suddenly changes into a dress. It initially mentions three masked figures pursuing her, yet only Caleb and Ares appear. She tosses her dress aside, only for it to reappear in her arms moments later. The narrative features excessive point-of-view shifts, often focusing more on Caleb and Crystal than on the main plot. Overall, the execution left much to be desired.",
            "In this story, Ares's feelings for the protagonist remain ambiguous. At one moment, he seems upset by her blood, hinting at possible affection, but that sentiment quickly dissipates. Caleb, who typically isn't attracted to women, finds her irresistible—an intriguing twist, indeed. The book features significantly more male-male action, suggesting that the two men might prefer each other over her. Blaine's introduction only adds to the confusion; although he appears to have many lovers, a single touch from her makes her his sole focus. Ares is frustrated by this dynamic but does nothing to intervene.\n\nThe highlight of the story is Ares's heartfelt confession to Crystal, who is surprisingly small at 4'9\". Despite her size, the narrative raises eyebrows when it suggests she can accommodate three partners simultaneously—almost implausible. Blaine’s repeated use of \"darling\" feels excessive, and the revelation that Crystal orchestrated the meeting between her mother and Caleb's father comes as a surprising twist, though it feels unconvincing in its execution.",
            "The epilogue felt a bit cringeworthy, largely due to the repeated use of the word \"hardon.\"",
            "This installment wasn't as \"dark\" as the previous ones, though the knife handle made an appearance once more. Some moments felt off-putting, like the spitting scene. Ares's self-proclamation as a god and Blaine's admiration of his own looks added an intriguing yet awkward layer to the story.",
            "My initial impressions of Caleb's mother were largely accurate, yet there's a poignant twist that unfolds as the group supports him through it. Meanwhile, Ares is summoned by his father, hinting at deeper issues, as it's clear someone is causing him pain—though the characters themselves remain unaware of the perpetrator. The revelation that Kai and Ares are brothers adds another layer, particularly since their father perceives them differently due to Ares's refusal to harm innocents. This unexpected dimension of Ares's character was a real surprise."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this book was a disappointment compared to the previous two. The lack of a coherent plot, numerous inconsistencies, and questionable character interactions made it difficult to enjoy. While there were a few moments that stood out, such as Ares' confession to Crystal and the emotional depth in Caleb's storyline, these were not enough to salvage the book. The writing style, pacing, and repetitive themes further detracted from the experience. I don't think I'll read anymore from this author.",

At least the other two had some kind of story, but this one is just them assaulting her for 75% of it.\n   - There is no plot. Most of the conversations seemed like I had missed something important. I felt like I was missing something all the time.\n   - The last 25% actually has a bit of a story! She gets kidnapped, which we knew from the last book. She is just about to be sold in an auction when they save her. They kill a lot of people!\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - I never knew if Ares liked her or not. At one point, he looks upset when he sees her blood, which made me think he actually liked her, but that didn't last long.\n   - Caleb says he doesn't normally get turned on by women, but she is different - of course, she is.\n   - There is a lot more MM action in this book, and it seems they would rather have each other than her!\n   - When Blaine joins the mix, it's just confusing. It seems like he has a lot of lovers, but one touch from her, and she is all he wants.\n   - Ares is pissed that someone else gets her but doesn't stop it.\n   - Ares' confession to Crystal was the best part of the book.\n\n- **Consistency and Continuity:**\n   - In the second book, you find out something about Felix which is never mentioned in the first book and is quite important. Then, in this book, there is obviously something going on between Ares and Kai, but it was never mentioned in Kai's book.\n   - There are so many mistakes in this book. One minute she has a onesie on, then she is taking off her dress. At first, it says three masks are chasing her, but then only Caleb and Ares find her. She throws her dress on the ground, but then it's back in her arms, then she picks it up, plus loads more!\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**\n   - Most of the first half is all about Caleb and Crystal.\n   - The Epilogue was a little cringe.\n   - How many POVs there were in one chapter.\n   - How many times the word \"hardon\" is used!\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**\n   - Wasn't as 'dark' as the others, although the knife handle played a part again.\n   - The spitting in her mouth. Ew.\n   - Ares calling himself a god.\n   - Blaine calling his face and body magnificent.\n\n- **Character Traits and Physical Descriptions:**\n   - The fact she was 4ft9. Of course, she was.\n   - The fact she is so tiny but takes 3 dicks in one hole (is that even possible).\n\n- **Dialogue and Interactions:**\n   - How often Blaine said \"darling\"!\n   - That it turns out Crystal did set up the meeting with her mum and Caleb's dad, but it was so out of the blue it made no sense.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - What I thought I knew about Caleb's mum was right, but there is a quite sad bit, and while the group is helping him through it.\n   - Ares is summoned by his father. You know someone is hurting him, but you don't know who (they don't know who - it's pretty obvious). They tell Kai, who turns out he and Ares are brothers, but their dad sees them differently because Ares won't kill innocent people - I wouldn't have guessed he had a nice side.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this book was a disappointment compared to the previous two in the series. The lack of a coherent plot, numerous inconsistencies, and questionable character interactions made it difficult to enjoy. While there were a few moments that stood out, such as Ares' confession to Crystal and the emotional depth in Caleb's storyline, these were not enough to salvage the book. The writing style, pacing, and repetitive themes further detracted from the experience. I don't think I'll read anymore from this author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Plot and Storyline: 2/10\n- Character Development and Relationships: 4/10\n- Consistency and Continuity: 3/10\n- Writing Style and Pacing: 3/10\n- Themes and Tone: 3/10\n- Character Traits and Physical Descriptions: 2/10\n- Dialogue and Interactions: 3/10\n- Emotional Impact: 5/10\n\n**Overall Rating: 3/10**"

            "Crystal, the female main character, stands apart from her predecessors with her reserved, pure-hearted demeanor. While she tends to shy away from trouble, her resilience and resourcefulness shine through. Although her hidden agenda is somewhat predictable, her growth in strength throughout the story is truly inspiring.\n\nThe supporting characters—Ares, Caleb, and Blaine from The Tartarus House—each bring unique qualities to the table. Ares, initially grumpy and controlling, gradually reveals his fiercely loyal and protective nature, which makes it easier to empathize with him. Caleb, brooding and reckless, possesses a kind heart, with his strong bond with Ares serving as a noteworthy highlight. Meanwhile, Blaine emerges as my favorite character, thanks to his intelligence, charm, arrogance, humor, and passion for smutty romance novels.\n\nThe emotional depth and tension among the characters elevate the narrative, especially with poignant lines like, “I wanted to hate you, little rose. But the more I watched you suffer as much as I had, the more it made me bleed.” Overall, the interplay between their distinct personalities and complex emotions adds an intense richness to the story.",

She is reserved, pure-hearted, and avoids trouble but is resilient and capable of holding her own.  \n  - Her hidden agenda was somewhat predictable, but her growth in strength throughout the book was inspiring.  \n  - Ares, Caleb, and Blaine from The Tartarus House each have distinct personalities.  \n    - Ares is controlling, possessive, and grumpy but fiercely loyal and protective. Initially hard to warm up to, his circumstances made me empathize with him.  \n    - Caleb is brooding and reckless but has a kind heart. His strong bond with Ares was a highlight.  \n    - Blaine is my favorite character in the book due to his intelligence, charm, arrogance, humor, and love for smutty romance novels.  \n\n- **Romance and Themes:**  \n  - The book is an excellent choice for fans of reverse harem (RH) bully romance with twists, violence, and steamy, kinky scenes.  \n  - The emotional depth and tension between the characters, especially with lines like, “I wanted to hate you, little rose. But the more I watched you suffer as much as I had, the more it made me bleed,” added to the story’s intensity.  \n\n- **Recommendations and Warnings:**  \n  - I highly recommend reading the previous books to fully grasp the depth of the story.  \n  - Trigger warnings should be checked beforehand due to the book’s themes and content.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Vile Boys* is a standout installment in the Spine Ridge University Series, offering a compelling mix of character development, emotional depth, and steamy romance.

The reader doesn’t gain a solid understanding of the characters until near the end of the novel, which feels rushed and leaves much to be desired in terms of depth.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing of the story feels rushed, particularly in the latter part of the book, where character development is finally addressed.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  This book may be worth a read for those seeking a quick, spicy novel with elements of violence and smut, especially if accessed through Kindle Unlimited or as an ebook purchase.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has its merits as a quick, spicy read with violent and steamy elements, it falls short in terms of writing style, character development, and pacing. The repetitive language and rushed character arcs make it a less satisfying read for those seeking depth and consistency.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "This story features two unexpected plot twists that truly surprised me. Crystal finds herself in peril after witnessing something she shouldn't have, propelling the narrative into a harrowing tale of kidnappings, murders, and abuse. The established connections among the men prior to Crystal's arrival, along with the intriguing cameos from other characters, enrich the overall depth of the narrative.",
            "Crystal is a resilient character who stands firm against Ares and Caleb's attempts to break her. The dynamics among Crystal, Ares, Caleb, and Blaine shift from toxic to genuinely caring, particularly after her rescue. Ares, the commanding villain, is arrogant and intimidating, often referring to Crystal as \"Little Rose\" and \"Ambrosia.\" Blaine, bubbly and vain, is openly romantic and eager to win Crystal's heart. Caleb, my favorite, is a switch who thrives on danger and has a playful edge; he’s Nathan’s ex-boyfriend and primarily attracted to men until he meets Crystal. The book dives into steamy scenes right from the start, with highlights including the cafeteria, rose maze, car, party, gun scene, shower DVP, and post-rescue moments. It does contain triggers such as knife play, breath play, and degradation, so readers should be aware.",
            "The author's writing is captivating, seamlessly blending spice, drama, and emotional depth.",
            "This story explores themes of toxic relationships transforming into love, the impact of family backstories, and the depth of intense connections."

        "conclusion": "Vile Boys is an addictive, spicy, and emotionally intense read that ruined me for other books in 2024. The characters, especially Caleb, Ares, and Blaine, are unforgettable, and the plot twists kept me hooked. While the smut is off the charts, the emotional depth and character development make this more than just a spicy read. I’m already excited for the next book!",

He calls Crystal \"Little Rose\" and \"Ambrosia.\"  \n   - Blaine is bubbly, vain, and pansexual. He’s the romantic one who openly wants to be with Crystal and gives her his heart.  \n   - Caleb is my favorite—a switch, turned on by danger, and a little freak. He’s Nathan’s ex-boyfriend and mostly into guys before meeting Crystal.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n   - The story has two major plot twists I didn’t see coming.  \n   - Crystal gets into trouble after witnessing something she shouldn’t, leading to kidnappings, murders, and abuse.  \n   - The connections between the guys before Crystal arrived and the cameos from other characters in the series add depth.  \n\n- **Spice and Smut:**  \n   - The smut starts on page 1 and is consistent throughout.  \n   - Favorite spicy scenes include the cafeteria, rose maze, car, party, gun scene, shower DVP, and the scenes after rescues.  \n   - The book includes triggers like knife play, breath play, degradation, and more.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n   - Clarissa Wild’s writing is addictive, with a perfect balance of spice, drama, and emotional depth.  \n   - Themes include toxic relationships evolving into love, family backstories, and intense connections.  \n\n- **Triggers and Content Warnings:**  \n   - The book includes heavy triggers like autassassinophilia, suicide, human trafficking, abuse, death of a parent, and more. Readers should check the full trigger list on Clarissa’s website.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nVile Boys is an addictive, spicy, and emotionally intense read that ruined me for other books in 2024.

However, by the halfway mark, I began to warm up to the characters, and by the 70% mark, I found myself more accepting of Ares.",

If you’re not into these themes, this book might not be for you.  \n\n- **Series Context and Comparison:**  \n   - This is the final book in a series of three, and it’s my favorite due to its ability to weave in the other poly quads from the previous books.  \n   - The flow is similar to the other books, but the plot and character arcs are distinct, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Character Evaluation:**  \n   - **FMC (Crystal):**  \n     - Weak and boring, lacking defining personality traits. She felt like a damsel in distress throughout the book, needing constant saving.  \n     - Her plan to avenge her father’s murder was poorly thought out and unrealistic.  \n     - While she was cute and sexy, her bashfulness and reluctance to own her sexual desires were tiresome.  \n   - **MMCs (Ares, Blaine, Kaleb):**  \n     - **Ares:** A possessive, domineering, and psychotic alpha with a rich backstory. His calm demeanor balanced the chaos of the group. His romantic feelings for Kaleb and Crystal were compelling.  \n     - **Blaine:** A pansexual, confident, and protective character with a sense of humor. His love for smut and weaponry made him stand out.  \n     - **Kaleb:** A demi-sexual character with daddy issues, who evolved nicely throughout the book. His dynamic with Ares and the group was delightful.  \n\n- **Plot and Smut Balance:**  \n   - The book leans heavily toward smut (80/20 ratio). The smut is intense and caters to a wide range of kinks, making it a standout feature.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n   - Excellent LGBTQ+ representation, with fluid sexualities and polyamorous relationships.  \n   - Themes include dark romance, BDSM, enemies-to-lovers, and college life.  \n\n- **Favorite Dynamics and Quotes:**  \n   - The quad’s dynamic was a highlight, with each character connecting differently yet forming a cohesive unit.  \n   - Favorite quotes include:  \n     - *\"I want to be the one who owns her heart, and if I can't make it mine entirely, then I will it into pieces and divide it amongst us all.\"*  \n     - *\"I watch her run off like a flower petal losing petals to a harsh wind. She's almost too pretty to taint. ... Almost.\"*  \n\n- **Spice Rating and Kinks:**  \n   - Spice rating: 5/5.  \n   - Kinks include BDSM, blood play, knife play, degradation, praise kink, primal play, DP, and more.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Tropes:**  \n   - Reminds me of *Carnage* by Shantel Tessier.  \n   - Tropes: Reverse harem, MM, college, dark romance, enemies-to-lovers, and mask kink.  \n\n- **Re-read Value:**  \n   - I would and have re-read this book, primarily for the smut rather than the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a dark, smutty, and intense read with a strong focus on character dynamics and kink. While the FMC was underwhelming, the MMCs and their relationships carried the story. It’s a must-read for fans of dark romance and polyamory, though the heavy emphasis on smut may not appeal to everyone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: 5/5  \n- Spice Rating: 🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶 (5/5)  \n- Smut vs. Plot: 80/20"

However, their unclear motivations leave me craving more insight into their intentions.",

Crystal, seeking revenge for her father's murder, initially believes Ares is responsible, only to discover that his father is the true villain.

Ultimately, they must also save Ares from his mafia-connected father, adding another layer of complexity to the story.",

            "In *Vile Boys*, Crystal begins as a seemingly innocent girl, leaving me concerned about her ability to navigate the treacherous world of the Vile Boys. By the end, however, I was thoroughly impressed by her transformation into a strong, intelligent character. Her resilience in the face of male antagonism was exactly what I had hoped for.

Each character brought depth to the narrative, with Blaine setting high expectations, Caleb fueling my obsession, and Ares stealing my heart. Their personal stakes added to the story's intensity. The spice in this installment was even more tantalizing than in previous books, and the action was relentless. The author consistently excels in delivering an exhilarating reading experience.",

The story was so gripping that I couldn’t put it down.\n\n- **Character Development (Crystal):**  \n  Crystal, the protagonist, started as a \"good girl\" who had me worried about how she would handle the Vile Boys. However, by the end of the book, I was amazed by her transformation into a strong, intelligent female character. Her resilience in a setting where men try to break her was exactly what I hoped for.\n\n- **Character Development (The Vile Boys - Ares, Caleb, Blaine):**  \n  Ares, Caleb, and Blaine are devilish, ruthless, and vile with a god complex, yet they were everything I could have hoped for. Their personalities and individual stories added depth to the narrative. Blaine set my expectations high, Caleb fueled my obsession, and Ares stole my heart. Their personal stakes in the story made it even more compelling.\n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  The plot of *Vile Boys* was unexpected and thrilling. It was a story I didn’t see coming, and I loved every moment of it. The battle felt personal, and the narrative delivered everything I dreamed of in one book. The bonus epilogue at the end reassured me and left me eager for more.\n\n- **Spice and Action:**  \n  The spice in *Vile Boys* was even spicier than in previous books, and the action was packed with intensity. Clarissa Wild consistently delivers on both fronts, making the reading experience exhilarating.\n\n- **Author’s Consistency and Future Expectations:**  \n  Clarissa Wild has yet to let me down. Her ability to deliver captivating stories with spice, action, and strong characters is unmatched. Although I don’t know when her next book will be released, I’m willing to wait patiently because she always delivers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Vile Boys* is a thrilling addition to the Spine Ridge University series, with strong character development, unexpected twists, and an addictive narrative.

Blaine, one of the three male characters, is underutilized, primarily serving as the group's sweet balance. Caleb's dialogue and personality become repetitive, even after he realizes his love, making him feel stagnant.

The well-written smut was a highlight, although I would have appreciated more dirty talk. The high spice level elevated my overall rating for the book.\n\nHowever, Crystal's character felt overly innocent, especially in light of her later intentions. Her actions didn’t align with her personality, and it would have been more effective to explore the unraveling of her innocence.

While the books are interconnected standalones, reading *Sick Boys* and *Evil Boys* first provides better context for the characters and events.  \n   - The book ties into the timeline of *Evil Boys*, particularly addressing what happened to Crystal during that period.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n   - Crystal, the protagonist, transitions from being a \"good girl\" to someone entangled in a dark, vengeful journey after witnessing a murder committed by Ares, Caleb, and Blaine from Tartarus House.  \n   - The story explores her complex relationship with the three morally gray male characters, who are ruthless and manipulative but ultimately central to her transformation.  \n   - The book provides a satisfying conclusion to Crystal's story while maintaining a strong connection to the overarching series narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - Clarissa's storytelling is praised for its unpredictable twists and turns, which keep readers engaged.  \n   - The pacing is well-balanced, with enough focus on Crystal's individual story while seamlessly integrating events from the previous books.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n   - The book incorporates popular tropes such as dark college romance, bully romance, stepbrother dynamics, \"why choose\" (reverse harem), morally gray male leads, enemies-to-lovers, tortured heroes, and \"villains get the girl.\"  \n   - The \"touch her and die\" trope adds an extra layer of intensity to the story.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement and Recommendations:**  \n   - The reviewer highly recommends signing up for the bonus content after reading *Vile Boys* to explore where the story goes next.  \n   - The book is described as a must-read for fans of the series, with its ability to tie up loose ends while delivering a compelling standalone narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Vile Boys* is a gripping addition to the *Spine Ridge University* series, offering a dark, twist-filled romance that ties together the events of the previous books while giving Crystal a well-deserved spotlight.

            "The first half of the book focuses more on atmosphere than on plot, while the second half delivers an intense shift, featuring dramatic developments and several jaw-dropping moments.",
            "The author expertly crafts the male characters, initially making them unlikable but gradually winning the reader over. Each character is distinct and well-defined, steering clear of the typical pitfalls found in \"why choose\" novels, where characters often feel like mere duplicates. My only critique is that I wished for more involvement from Blaine, as he seemed sidelined by Ares and Chase's relationship.",

            "The book is infused with exquisite detail, particularly highlighted by a memorable scene at the party. The third-act breakup is skillfully crafted and feels entirely justified, in contrast to many breakups that often come across as forced or easily resolved."

Despite a minor issue with Blaine’s involvement, the book is a standout in the why choose genre. I highly recommend it, but caution readers to check trigger warnings due to its dark themes.",

I signed up for an ARC of *Vile Boys* (totally not expecting to receive it) and was over the moon when I opened the email confirming it had been sent.  \n\n- **Series Context and Standalone Appeal:**  \n  *Vile Boys* is the third book in the Spine Ridge University series. Even though there were mentions of characters from the previous books, I didn’t feel like I had missed anything by reading this one first. I will definitely be going back to read the earlier books.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story starts with Crystal at a party at Tartarus House, where she encounters Ares, Blaine, and Caleb. It’s a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time when she witnesses a murder. Worried she might talk, Ares, Blaine (who loves reading romance books), and Caleb decide to silence her by threatening her mother. Crystal, however, has no intention of letting them get away with it. While she agrees to be at their beck and call, she’s not going down without a fight.  \n\n- **Spice and Heat Level:**  \n  The book is incredibly hot, with non-stop spice. It’s filled with dirty and spicy scenes that kept me hooked.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book is packed with twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.

At 4’9” with blond hair and blue eyes, her height is mentioned a bit too often for my taste. \n\n**Ares:** I have issues with him.

Blaine is respectful, warns Crystal about the others, and even teaches her self-defense. \n\n**Caleb:** I liked him almost as much as Blaine, though Blaine edges him out slightly. Caleb fits the bully romance trope—mean, but not as bad as Ares.",

Caleb was mean, as expected in a bully romance, but at least he wasn’t as bad as Ares.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing threw me off because many sentences felt abruptly cut short, making the flow feel disjointed.  \n\n- **Tropes:**  \n  The book includes several tropes: reverse harem (MMMF/why choose), college dark romance, bully romance, and enemies to lovers. It’s a typical bully romance, which might appeal to fans of these themes.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some flaws, I found it to be a good book overall and would recommend it to anyone interested in the tropes it explores.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a solid bully romance with a mix of dark and college themes. While the writing style felt choppy at times and some characters were less likable, the story was engaging enough to recommend, especially for fans of the tropes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️✨ (3.5 stars)  \n🌶️🌶️🌶️ (3/5 spice level)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the characters in these books, especially Blaine, who stands out as my favorite. His penchant for reading romance novels with a touch of smut makes him instantly relatable. Initially, the boys may come across as unlikable, but as we delve into their backgrounds and the challenges posed by their parents, their behavior becomes more understandable."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved all the characters in these books. Blaine was definitely my favorite in this book—he reads romance novels with smut, which makes him perfect already. At first, the boys seem terrible, but once you get insight into their backgrounds and what their parents put them through, their behavior makes sense.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Dynamics:**  \n  The smut in these books is awesome. The idea of finding three guys and having a dynamic like Crystal does is appealing, especially in today’s society with the economy and rising costs of living. The chapter where Blaine and Caleb are together with Crystal was particularly hot—I wish I could’ve been Crystal in that scene.  \n\n- **Bully Romance Trope:**  \n  The bully aspect of these books is a major turn-on. The feeling of being helpless and at someone else’s mercy is thrilling. While they bully Crystal at first, it evolves into something more for all of them, which I love. The books don’t feel needlessly cruel, and the bully dynamic adds to the intensity of the smut.  \n\n- **Series Appeal:**  \n  I loved all three books in this series. They’re perfect if you’re looking for hot sex and a story where bullies turn into something nicer. The series is well-written and engaging, with a great balance of romance, smut, and character growth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book (and the series as a whole) is a fantastic read for fans of bully romance and steamy scenes. The characters are well-developed, the dynamics are thrilling, and the smut is top-tier. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a mix of intensity, romance, and spice.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️"

            "In the story, Crystal observes the Tartarus boys committing an act of violence, which establishes the foundation for their antagonistic relationship. While she has her own hidden motives for approaching them, her past connection with Ares adds depth to their dynamic. Initially intent on controlling and tormenting Crystal, the boys ultimately form a profound and unbreakable bond with her as they disclose their vulnerabilities and scars.",
            "Crystal's transformation from a timid, good girl to a strong, resilient character is truly surprising as she stands up to the Tartarus boys. Ares, the menacing leader shaped by his troubled past, exerts a controlling presence. Caleb thrives on danger and is intensely complex, with Ares being the only one who truly gets him. Meanwhile, Blaine adds comedic relief and stands out as the group's sweetest member, though he's still bound to Ares and Caleb by their shared society.",

The timeline, which aligns with events from *Evil Boys*, made it harder to get into compared to the previous two books in the series. However, once the story found its footing, I was completely hooked.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I loved the dynamic of this foursome, as it felt completely different from what we’ve seen before in the series.

I can't imagine that Crystal and Ares aren't living together, considering how attached they are. It seems implausible that their parents wouldn't notice what's going on. Plus, after six years, it raises the question of why no one has gotten married.",

            "In this gripping tale, Crystal embarks on a quest for revenge following her father's death. The plot thickens when she witnesses a group of boys committing murder at a party. In an attempt to evade them, she inadvertently draws their attention, prompting them to pursue her to ensure her silence. Ares, the group's leader and a prominent member of the Tartarus house, becomes intrigued by Crystal after noticing her smile amidst the chaos. Tension escalates when Caleb, who harbors feelings for Crystal, becomes jealous of her connection with Ares, especially after learning that their parents are dating. Meanwhile, Blaine emerges as the more easygoing member of the group, sharing a genuine bond with Crystal. The story is engaging and well-paced, filled with enough twists to keep readers captivated. The author skillfully balances action, romance, and character development, making for a compelling read.",
            "Crystal is a determined and intriguing protagonist fueled by her strong desire for revenge. Ares, a dominant and enigmatic figure, is drawn to her in a way that feels both dangerous and compelling. Caleb's jealousy and skepticism about the coincidences surrounding Crystal add depth to his character. My favorite character, Blaine, stands out with his charm and self-assurance, offering a refreshing contrast to his friends. His immediate connection with Crystal is endearing, and the romantic tension among the group, especially between Crystal, Ares, and Blaine, is captivating. Blaine’s genuine affection for Crystal, paired with his distinct personality, makes their connection particularly memorable.",

While the books are technically standalones, I think it’s best to read the first two because the timelines overlap, and characters from the previous books make appearances.  \n\n- **First Experience with the Author:**  \n  *Vile Boys* is my first Clarissa Wild book, and it was a crazy, fun experience. I’m torn about how to view this book—it feels like it could have been split into two separate stories.  \n\n- **Smut and Erotic Content:**  \n  The smut level was seriously on point and escalated as the story progressed. The scenes were beyond hot, covering a wide range of dynamics like MF, MM, MFM, and reverse harem.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  On the other hand, I felt the story took too long for the actual plot to take shape. While I appreciated learning about the characters’ dark pasts and trauma, these elements seemed overshadowed by the frequent erotic scenes. As a result, the emotional impact of certain revelations didn’t hit as hard as I expected.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Interest:**  \n  Despite my mixed feelings, I’m happy I dipped my toes into this world and can easily see myself reading more from Clarissa Wild.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Vile Boys* was a wild, smut-heavy read with a slow-building plot.

            "The timelines in the story are confusing and inconsistent. For instance, Caleb’s dad and Crystal’s mom's engagement timeline is unclear; the chapter states “weeks later,” yet Caleb insists they’ve only known each other for a week. The plot lacks depth, leaving it feeling hollow, and the characters' claim of “owning” Crystal lacks real significance. The narrative would benefit from the removal of unnecessary subplots. Additionally, the pacing is uneven, with abrupt transitions between characters and scenes. The intimate moments between Caleb and Ares, which many readers likely anticipated, are disappointingly brief and underdeveloped.",
            "The physical portrayal of Crystal is notably exaggerated and unrealistic, particularly when juxtaposed with the male characters—Crystal stands at just 4'9\", while Ares towers at 6'7\" and Blaine at 6'9\". Additionally, the male characters’ attributes, described as “they all have 10 inches,” come across as excessive and unnecessary, even for a smut-focused narrative.",

No. They were not a good match in my opinion.  \n\n- **Plot vs. Smut Ratio:**  \n  This book is similar to *Den of Vipers* in that it’s 90% porn and 10% plot. There’s smut in every chapter, except for some of the last few chapters, which are action-packed.

She also witnessed a murder that some boys want her to keep quiet about.  \n   - I wasn’t the biggest fan of Crystal in the previous book, but Clarissa Wild has a way of making her character incredibly likable in this one.  \n\n- **Character Development (Blaine, Caleb, and Ares):**  \n   - I fell HARD for Blaine, Caleb, and Ares, just like I did with the characters in the previous books.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I LOVED LOVED LOVED this book! It’s hands down one of my favorite new reads for the year.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations and solidified Clarissa Wild as one of my favorite authors. The character development, especially for Crystal and the male leads, was exceptional, and the story kept me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I prefer Ares over Felix, it’s only slightly. The chemistry among the characters in *Evil Boys* is strong, but I felt that in *Sick Boys*, the dynamics leaned more towards Felix/Pen and Dylan/Ali/Pen. In *Vile Boys*, I sense a similar pattern with Crystal/Blaine, Crystal/Ares, and Ares/Caleb. I only enjoy Blaine’s chemistry with Crystal and Caleb’s with Ares; the four of them together don’t quite click.

However, something about the writing in this book felt off. It might have been the repetitiveness of certain phrases or word choices, or perhaps the characters being overly dramatic at times.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Caleb and Blaine were cute at times but also a bit annoying. Their extra/dramatic behavior detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot could have been fleshed out better. It felt drawn out in some parts, which made the pacing less engaging.  \n\n- **Spice/Smut Content:**  \n  The smut was a highlight of the book. The spice level was consistent with the rest of the series, possibly even exceeding expectations. I’d rate it 4-5🌶️ for sure.  \n\n- **Series Comparison:**  \n  While I enjoyed this series overall, I think *Vile Boys* could have been better. *Sick Boys* remains my favorite in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was insane, hot, and entertaining, but it had some flaws in its writing, character development, and pacing.

Just when you think there’s no chance for redemption, it hits you unexpectedly.  \n  - I loved how not all three men in the book were trying to completely wreck the FMC. One of the MMCs stood out as kinder and more caring, which was a twist I didn’t see coming.  \n  - This MMC genuinely helped the FMC without betraying the men he’d lay his life down for, adding depth to his character.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  - The plot twists in this book were incredible. It really outdid itself, and I’m kicking myself for waiting so long to read it.  \n  - The story kept me engaged, and the unexpected turns made it a standout read.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  - The filth is still there, but the balance between spice and emotional depth was perfect.  \n  - The dom/sub dynamic really worked for me and added to the overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a fantastic addition to the series, with well-developed characters, unexpected twists, and a perfect blend of spice and emotional depth. It exceeded my expectations and left me eager for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot: 5/5  \n- Spice: 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️/5"

Ares, Caleb, and Blaine are the spotlight guys in the book, and Crystal is the prey.  \n   - Crystal ends up seeing something she shouldn’t have, and the guys make her pay for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n   - Though that may seem straightforward, there are many secrets that come out that you didn’t see coming!  \n\n- **Romantic/Spicy Elements:**  \n   - And the spice! If you’ve read any of Clarissa Wild’s books, you know the spice is chef’s kiss!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Vile Boys* is a compelling read with unhinged characters, unexpected twists, and plenty of spice. While it may not be my favorite of Clarissa Wild’s works, it still delivers an engaging and thrilling experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I enjoyed this part a lot more and found it much more satisfying.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Books in the Series:**  \n  While this book was okay, I liked the second book in the series a lot more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had a slow and confusing start, but the spice kept me hooked. The plot improved significantly in the final quarter, making it more enjoyable. However, it didn’t quite measure up to the second book in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The revelation that Penelope is part of a mafia family was shocking and added depth to the story. Dean Caruso's death was a pivotal moment, while Alistair's father's acceptance of him was genuinely touching. The thrilling rescue of Rory by Lana, Blaine, Kai, and Nathan heightened the stakes, especially during the intense moments with Skulls and Serpents, Phantoms, and Caleb's mission to save Lana. The emotional reunion of Lana, Felix, and Rivera, where they uncovered painful truths about their past, was particularly heartbreaking.\n\nThe twist revealing that Kai and Ares are brothers was masterfully executed, especially with the clever concealment of Ares's last name until that moment. The backstory surrounding Crystal's father's death added further complexity to the narrative. Kai's realization of Ares's abuse and his decision to confront it marked a powerful turning point. The collaboration of the Skulls and Serpents, Phantoms, and Tartarus to rescue Ares from his father was both epic and satisfying, culminating in cathartic scenes where Kai confronts his father and Crystal shoots Torres.\n\nThe school nurse's reactions to the characters' injuries provided much-needed comic relief, while Rivera's efforts to keep them out of jail showcased his loyalty. Finally, the reconciliation between Ares and Kai was heartwarming and beautifully portrayed."

            "Set at Spine Ridge University, the story revolves around Crystal and the Tartarus boys—Ares, Blaine, and Caleb—as they navigate a reverse harem polyamorous relationship. Initially, Crystal offers herself to the boys to save her mother, but it soon becomes clear that she has a deeper motive: revenge for her father's death, which she believes Ares had a hand in. As the plot unfolds, it is revealed that Ares' father, Mr. Torres, is the true culprit. The climax sees the group banding together to confront Mr. Torres, culminating in Crystal killing him to avenge her father and protect Ares from his abusive parent. The final act showcases a united front among the Skull and Serpent Society, Phantoms, and Tartarus, emphasizing teamwork and solidarity. Notably, the women play a crucial role in bringing the men together, underscoring their strength and influence throughout the narrative.",

Ares's dominance creates a compelling power struggle, while Caleb's tough facade masks a more submissive nature, adding depth to his character. The chemistry among the three men and Crystal is well-developed, although Crystal occasionally feels overshadowed by their interactions. Ares is intense and borderline unhinged, which is both disturbing and captivating. His arrogance is effectively countered by Crystal's ability to assert control, making their dynamic satisfying. As a goddess who brings Ares to his knees, Crystal's empowerment is striking, though her impact could have been more consistent throughout the narrative. Additionally, the absence of tender moments that don't lead to sex makes it difficult to grasp the evolution of the characters' emotional connections.",

Ares dominates the others, creating a compelling power dynamic.  \n  - Caleb pretends to be tough but is actually more submissive, which adds an interesting layer to his character.  \n  - The bonding and chemistry among the three men and Crystal are well-developed, though Crystal sometimes feels underutilized or overshadowed by the male characters' interactions.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Ares is portrayed as intense and borderline insane, which is both disturbing and captivating. His arrogance is balanced by Crystal's ability to dominate him, making their dynamic satisfying.  \n  - Crystal's role as a \"goddess\" who makes Ares kneel is empowering, though her character could have been more consistently impactful throughout the story.  \n  - The lack of \"cute\" moments that don’t end in sex makes it hard to understand when or how the characters developed deeper emotional connections.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  - The book is very direct and to the point, with little room for subtlety or emotional depth.  \n  - The pacing is dominated by explicit scenes, leaving little space for plot development or meaningful aftercare moments.  \n\n- **Strengths and Weaknesses:**  \n  - Strengths: The intense and varied kinks, the power dynamics between characters, and the chemistry among the main trio (Ares, Caleb, and Blaise) are engaging.  \n  - Weaknesses: The lack of aftercare, minimal plot, and underutilization of Crystal’s character are notable drawbacks.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a steamy, kink-filled read with strong character dynamics and chemistry among the main trio.

If these themes aren’t your cup of tea, this book won’t be for you.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  This is book 3 in the Spineridge University Series.

Some of my favorites include:  \n  - *\"If you won’t surrender willingly … well, these devilish boys will definitely drag you down to their degenerate, hedonistic hell and claim your heart anyway. Because you don’t like villains who ask nicely. You like villains who make you beg.\"*  \n  - *\"They think they're gods, but I will bring them to their knees.\"*  \n  - *\"Now let your God take you to purgatory.\"*  \n  - *\"Don't worry Crystal, we'll only steal your fucking soul. Nothing more, nothing less. And when we're done with you, you won't even want it back.\"*  \n  - *\"He named me Ares because he wanted to raise a god.

Their “Don’t fuck with me” attitude is empowering and adds a unique dynamic to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Smut:**  \n  Clarissa’s writing is exceptional, especially when it comes to crafting smut. The intimate scenes were intense, well-written, and added to the overall allure of the book.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Memorability:**  \n  The book left a lasting impression. Lines like, “Yes, pray to me, little rose, and your god will fucking come to your beck and call,” and, “You've beguiled all of us, so let me return the favor by turning you into our favorite obsession, our aphrodis-iac... my fucking Ambrosía,” are unforgettable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Vile Boys* is a masterpiece of dark romance, delivering a perfect blend of suspense, character development, and steamy scenes. It’s a standout in the series and will undoubtedly be one of my top reads of 2024. Clarissa has outdone herself once again.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️ (5/5 for spice)  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5 overall)"

However, since it had been a while since I read the first two books, I struggled to recall everyone's relationships. I recommend reading them in order for better continuity.

The way she is able to build the plot while having multiple POVs is pure talent. I would read 900 pages of Clarissa's writing in the Spine Ridge University world.  \n\n- **Engagement and Immersion:**  \n  I was so engrossed in this book, it became my new personality. Even though these books are long, they still never feel long enough.  \n\n- **Character Development and Interconnections:**  \n  I love the overlap of Penelope and Lana in this story, as well as the follow-up in Crystal's story that we are introduced to in Lana's story.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Surprises:**  \n  Crystal and the Tartarus guys had one of the biggest plot twists for me out of the three books. I knew somehow they were involved in the tragedy she went through, but I was shocked when it was revealed what actually happened.  \n\n- **Anticipation and Satisfaction:**  \n  This book was so good, and I have been looking forward to it for months. It did NOT disappoint.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nClarissa Wild delivers an exceptional novel that lives up to the high expectations set by her previous works. The intricate plot, well-developed characters, and shocking twists make this book a standout in the Spine Ridge University series. It’s a captivating read that leaves you wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
