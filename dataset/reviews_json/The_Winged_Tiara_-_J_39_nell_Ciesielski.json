So I thought I’d give it a go and see how I got on/which camp it’d fall into.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n   - Alas, for me it fell into the latter, and suffered from the same things as the two books I didn’t care for: ongoing alcohol use and scenes I wished faded to black a little sooner.  \n   - I quit drinking a few years ago, and the MC’s enjoying my then-favorite drink on the regular was a special personal challenge.  \n\n- **Future Interest in the Author's Work:**  \n   - I’m not sure I’ll leap into other books by the author, now that a few have missed the mark (and for the same reasons).  \n\n- **Disclosure:**  \n   - I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book initially intrigued me with its fascinating premise and beautiful cover, it ultimately fell into the category of the author’s works that didn’t resonate with me.

            "The plot offers an imaginative and lighthearted take on the heist genre, reminiscent of a satirical spy film. This approach creates fun and entertaining scenarios. However, I believe the story could have benefited from deeper exploration of angst and emotional conflict, which would have further enhanced its impact. While I appreciated its simplicity, I wanted more—additional length, more intense groveling, anger, and emotional depth to fully capture the cat-and-mouse dynamic.",
            "The dual POV offered valuable insights into both Esme and Jasper, but Jasper emerged as the more compelling character. His emotional expressiveness, wit, and nuanced backstory made him stand out. In contrast, while Esme was likable, she appeared less engaged in their estranged relationship, prioritizing survival over emotional reconciliation.",

Instead of delivering a fun, lighthearted romantic caper, the story becomes overly complicated due to excessive details that overshadow the central romance and adventure.

The campy feel added to the charm.\n\n- **Historical Setting and Authenticity:**\n   - The author stays true to the opulence of post-war/pre-war European elite society. While I couldn’t personally relate to certain aspects, like the constant drinking, I appreciated the historical accuracy. The \"live loud\" mentality after the deprivation of war made sense and added depth to the setting.\n\n- **Character Choices and Relatability:**\n   - The hero and heroine don’t always make choices I can identify with, but this is fiction, and I was fully invested in their hijinks and banter. Their impulsive marriage on Armistice Day and their reunion as jewel thieves four years later made for a unique and engaging dynamic.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story is a fun cat-and-mouse romp across Europe, with Jasper and Esme as professional adversaries with a romantic history. Their constant one-upping was hysterical, and I didn’t know who to root for. The plot takes a darker turn with a sinister twist, leading to a wow-worthy ending.\n\n- **Narration (Audio Book Experience):**\n   - Ann Marie Gideon’s narration was wonderful. She captured the characters' personalities beautifully and used a variety of accents for the supporting cast, enhancing the overall experience. Listening to the audio book added an extra layer of enjoyment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*The Winged Tiara* is a thoroughly enjoyable read (or listen) with a captivating blend of historical authenticity, humor, and adventure. The unique premise, engaging characters, and excellent narration make it a standout experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review, but the overall tone is highly positive."

The vivid descriptions of 1920s Paris, Venice, and Neuschwanstein Castle transported me to the past. The author’s ability to capture the essence of the roaring 20s, from smoky jazz bars to the criminal underworld, made the setting feel alive and cinematic.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s writing style reflects the English of the 1920s, adding authenticity to the narrative. The scenes of crime and the cat-and-mouse chase for the tiara were so well-crafted that I could feel the tension and excitement the characters experienced.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This book was a fun adventure!

            "The storyline and setting were enjoyable, but I occasionally struggled to follow the characters' locations. The narrative felt a bit scattered, which may have been influenced by my experience listening to the audiobook.",
            "The character development was solid but fell short in several areas. While we gained some insight into Esme and Jasper's childhoods, I felt we didn't fully explore their characters. I would have liked to see more growth in their relationship. Their connection was passionate and featured intriguing dynamics as they navigated their bond. However, it leaned a bit too heavily on intensity for my taste, even though it is a closed-door romance.",
            "The story captivated me from the start with its suspenseful cat-and-mouse dynamics. The historical setting brilliantly transported me to the roaring '20s, immersing me in the vibrant scenes of the era. This is the second novel I've read this year set in this time period, and I've discovered how much I enjoy it. I look forward to exploring more stories from this fascinating decade."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Winged Tiara* was an engaging and enjoyable read, particularly for its historical setting and suspenseful elements.

I enjoyed the suspense element, and the cat-and-mouse aspect was fun to watch unfold. The historical element was great; I could really picture the scenes and felt like I was in the middle of the roaring '20s. I never realized how much I enjoy this time period, and this is the second book I’ve read this year set in the roaring '20s. I look forward to reading more.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character development was good but lacking in many ways. We got to learn a little bit more about Esme and Jasper and their childhood, but I felt like we didn’t pull back many layers of their character. I would have liked to see them grow together more.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The storyline and setting were fun, though at times I had a hard time keeping up with where the characters were. It felt like the story hopped all over, which might have been due to listening to it as an audiobook.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship between Esme and Jasper was very passionate. It had some interesting dynamics as they tried to figure out their relationship. Overall, it was probably on the side of too much for me, though it is a closed-door romance.  \n\n- **Christian and Moral Elements:**  \n  I was a bit disappointed by the Christian element. I chose to review this book because the publisher is a Christian publisher, and I was expecting at least a little bit of Christian influence. However, it was completely lacking, and some of the characters’ morals did not align with Christian values. I would not label this as Christian fiction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Winged Tiara* was an engaging and enjoyable read, particularly for its historical setting and suspenseful elements. However, the character development felt incomplete, and the lack of Christian themes was disappointing given the publisher’s background. Despite these shortcomings, I look forward to reading more from J’nell Ciesielski.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n  The Winged Tiara is a historical fiction novel set in the early 1900s, a time period I’m particularly drawn to. The story takes place across Europe, adding a rich and immersive backdrop to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story revolves around two main characters engaged in a game of cat and mouse, trying to outwit each other for the ultimate prize. While the book is a slow burn, it picks up significantly about two-thirds of the way through, becoming difficult to put down. The pacing is occasionally slowed by detailed descriptions of landscapes, food, and clothing, which, while exquisite, can detract from the momentum.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  There’s a compelling “will they/won’t they” romance between the two main characters, which adds depth to their dynamic. The tension between them, as competing professional thieves, is both intriguing and entertaining.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character development is well-executed. I found myself quite fond of the male main character (MMC) and occasionally annoyed with the female main character (FMC). However, I loved the ending for both characters, as it felt satisfying and well-earned.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The novel blends danger, mystery, and intrigue seamlessly. There are a couple of plot twists—one I anticipated early on, and another that genuinely surprised me. The story maintains a balance between adventure and romance, making it engaging throughout.  \n\n- **Descriptive Writing:**  \n  The descriptions of the landscape, food, and dress are absolutely exquisite. They allowed me to vividly picture the story, though they did contribute to the slower pacing at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Winged Tiara is a captivating historical fiction novel with a strong romantic subplot, adventure, and a compelling female lead. While the pacing is slow initially, the story gains momentum and becomes hard to put down. I highly recommend it to fans of historical fiction and romance who enjoy a mix of intrigue and strong character development.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was different from what I usually read, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  \n\n- **Predictability and Suspension of Disbelief:**  \n  While the book was predictable in some places and required major suspension of disbelief in others, I could easily forgive these flaws because the plot was so fun.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The characters are not heroes but survivors focused primarily on self-preservation, with occasional bits of heroism, especially at the end.

The anticipation of the \"real prize\" of their game added to the excitement.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  - The on-and-off romance between Esme and Jasper was a highlight for me. I appreciated that they had a shared history, which played a central role in the story. The sparks between them were undeniable, but I liked that their relationship was far from easy—it was more than difficult for them to be together. I rooted for them to figure things out and appreciated that there were no quick resolutions.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  - While there were a few slower parts that I skimmed, I was mostly eager to keep reading. I found myself looking for opportunities to read just a little more to see what would happen next and to enjoy more of this amazing story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a captivating read with a perfect blend of mystery, romance, and historical fiction. The dynamic between Jasper and Esme, along with the intriguing plot, kept me hooked. Despite some slower moments, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and look forward to exploring more of J’nell Ciesielski's work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
