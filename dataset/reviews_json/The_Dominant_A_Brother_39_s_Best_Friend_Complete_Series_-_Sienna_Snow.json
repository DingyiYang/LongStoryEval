            "The combined edition of the trilogy—*Claim, Defy, Own*—is ideal for readers who prefer not to wait between installments. This emotional rollercoaster culminates in the standout ending of *Own*, where both characters confront their internal struggles to achieve a satisfying happily-ever-after (HEA).",
            "In this trilogy, the protagonist Sophia is a beautiful, strong, and resilient woman who has developed emotional armor due to her challenging upbringing. Her counterpart, Damon, is a dominant yet damaged man struggling to connect after a failed Dom-Sub relationship. What begins as a one-night encounter between Sophia and Damon quickly evolves into a deeper relationship filled with highs, lows, and significant sexual tension. \n\nDamon introduces Sophia to the world of BDSM in a safe manner, but his self-sabotaging mindset often adds unnecessary stress to their dynamic. However, Sophia's tenacity and emotional strength, shaped by her difficult family dynamics, enable her to navigate these challenges effectively. \n\nThe Morelli siblings add an intriguing layer to the story, though I wished for more background on them. Their presence enriches the narrative, and I look forward to exploring other books featuring these characters.",
