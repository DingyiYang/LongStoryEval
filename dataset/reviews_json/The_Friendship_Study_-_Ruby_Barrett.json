            "I thoroughly enjoyed the first two-thirds of the book, but the final act fell short for me. Up until the breakup, I was ready to rate it 5 stars. However, George, Jesse's best friend and former boyfriend, played a frustrating role that left me feeling conflicted. His meddling and patronizing behavior made it hard to appreciate him early on. Although the breakup fit within the story's narrative, the epilogue's focus solely on sex was disappointing and diminished my overall satisfaction with the ending.",
            "I appreciated how the author developed Lulu (FMC) and Jesse (MMC), revealing their deep personal struggles and gradual journey toward vulnerability, despite facing setbacks. Jesse’s bisexuality and demisexuality were pivotal to the narrative, rather than mere footnotes. In contrast, George's self-centeredness and lack of genuine care influenced my view of the story's resolution.",

Their connection matures while navigating a \"no dating rule,\" which they cleverly reinterpret. It was heartwarming to witness them open up, discovering both love and a best friend in each other.

            "The premise of the story—Jesse and Lulu participating in a study on adults' struggles to make friends—was intriguing. I anticipated a slow burn, but by the 40% mark, they were already engaging in platonic intimacy without physical contact. The sex scenes felt awkward and unnecessary, failing to establish genuine chemistry. The contrived rules intended to create tension fell flat, relying on a series of misunderstandings that made me want to shake the characters rather than root for them. The friends-with-benefits concept felt underdeveloped and could have led to more compelling conflicts if they had refrained from acting on their feelings.",
            "The chemistry between Jesse and Lulu is compelling. Jesse, who grapples with self-expression following an accident that ended his firefighting career, connects deeply with Lulu, a neurodivergent history professor prone to mishaps. Their understanding of one another is unique and refreshing. I appreciated the representation of Jesse as a mostly openly bisexual man in a heterosexual relationship, and I hope to see more stories that uplift bisexual men in romance. His bisexuality is portrayed authentically, including his past relationship with George and the challenges he faces in coming out to his grandfather, who has dementia. Additionally, the book sensitively addresses mental health, particularly Jesse's emotional struggles related to his disability and chronic pain."

I want more romances like this and more uplifting of bi men in romance.  \n   - Jesse's bisexuality was handled authentically; he had a previous relationship with George before Lulu, and he struggles coming out to a grandfather with dementia.  \n   - I also loved how mental health was represented in this book, including Jesse's emotional struggles with his disability from a car accident and chronic pain.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Chemistry:**  \n   - The chemistry between Jesse and Lulu was strong overall.  \n   - Jesse, who struggles to express himself since the accident that ended his firefighting career, and Lulu, an accident-prone neurodivergent history professor, understand each other on a level that no one else has.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The premise of the story—Jesse and Lulu participating in a study exploring why adults have difficulty making friends—was intriguing.  \n   - I was hoping for more of a slow burn, but by the 40% mark, they were already engaging in platonic intimacy without touching each other.  \n   - The sex scenes felt awkward and superfluous to the plot, failing to build physical chemistry. The weird rules meant to manufacture tension didn’t work for me.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n   - The tension in the story relied on a series of dumb misunderstandings, which made me want to shake the characters rather than root for them.  \n   - The friends-with-benefits premise felt thin and could have set up more interesting conflicts if they hadn’t acted on their feelings.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Critique:**  \n   - The book had lots of great moments, but it didn’t fully pan out for me in the end.  \n   - Despite its strengths, the execution of certain elements (e.g., sex scenes, misunderstandings) left me wanting more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had strong representation, authentic character dynamics, and an intriguing premise, the pacing, awkward sex scenes, and reliance on misunderstandings detracted from my overall enjoyment.

            "The characters were nuanced and authentic, embarking on independent journeys of growth that felt sincere. Their interdependence strengthened their development. However, the friends-to-lovers trope felt misapplied, as the absence of friendship and community was glaring—particularly since the protagonists struggled with isolation. This oversight diminished the potential for a deeper sense of belonging by the story's conclusion. On a positive note, the portrayal of bisexuality was approached with tenderness, honesty, and sensitivity.",

Therapy—both individual and group—plays a crucial role in shaping their relationships throughout the story.

The intimate scenes, however, were well-crafted and enjoyable, highlighting mutual masturbation, the use of toys and lube, and Lulu's use of a strap-on.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  I absolutely loved the friendship-turned-relationship of Lulu and Jesse. Their struggles with making friends as millennial adults felt so real and relatable, almost to the point of being painful. I saw so much of myself in Lulu—her love for history, her obsession with the Phillies, and more—and I also found parts of myself reflected in Jesse. Their journey to self-acceptance and learning to love themselves for who they are was deeply moving.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The themes of searching for belonging and success as an adult resonated strongly with me. The exploration of self-love and appreciation was beautifully woven into the story, making it both heartfelt and impactful.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n  The story features a dual first-person POV and includes tropes like former firefighter MMC, history professor FMC, blind date, forced proximity, opposites attract, forbidden relationship, friends-with-benefits, and a cat dad. The dynamic of \"he falls first\" added a charming layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  The book includes bisexual main characters, a gay supporting character, and addresses topics like chronic pain from injury, undiagnosed ADHD (neurodivergence), and anxiety. This representation felt authentic and meaningful.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The story includes sensitive topics such as a past injury caused by a car accident, a grandparent with advanced dementia, and past sexual assault. These elements were handled with care but are worth noting for readers.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The spice level was a 3.5/5, providing a good balance of romance and intimacy without overwhelming the emotional core of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute joy to experience. The heartfelt connection between Lulu and Jesse, the relatable struggles of adulthood, and the beautifully crafted themes of self-love and belonging made it a standout read. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a story that balances emotional depth with a satisfying happily-ever-after.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice: 3.5/5"

While I appreciated the emotional depth and spice, I felt the romance and plot could have been more developed. Despite this, I still highly recommend it for its representation, tropes, and overall journey.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated the dual perspectives of Jesse and Lulu in their relationship, as it enriched the story. The author’s representation of a bisexual man in Jesse is commendable, as such portrayals are often lacking. Jesse's journey of self-discovery added depth to his character, highlighting his need for personal growth before entering a serious relationship. Lulu was also a compelling character; I enjoyed her role in the humanities and found her genuine and sweet, though some of her actions, like climbing a tree, were frustrating. However, I wished for a deeper exploration of Jesse's past, as it was only briefly referenced.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n   - I loved getting both Jesse's and Lulu's perspectives on their relationship. Being inside both of their heads was really beneficial to the story.  \n   - I appreciated that Ruby Barrett worked to represent a bi man in this book. It's rare to see bi men represented, and I appreciated that in Jesse.  \n   - Jesse's journey of self-discovery was compelling. He needed to work on himself before committing to a serious relationship, which added depth to his character.  \n   - Lulu was an interesting character, and I loved seeing a woman in the humanities. She was genuine and sweet, though her actions sometimes frustrated me (e.g., climbing high up in a tree).  \n\n- **Character Backstories and Depth:**  \n   - I would have liked to feel more of Jesse's connection to his past. While it was referenced throughout the book, I never got an in-depth look into his story.  \n   - For Lulu, I would have liked to see progress toward an ADHD diagnosis. It was mentioned but not explored further, which felt like a missed opportunity.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n   - The premise of the book was intriguing—a study about friendship where participants aren't supposed to get romantically involved. It set up a lot of potential for conflict and tension.  \n   - I appreciated the immediate chemistry between Jesse and Lulu, but I would have liked to see more emotional and personal connection develop between them.  \n\n- **Author's Writing and Future Works:**  \n   - I enjoyed Ruby Barrett's writing and will be checking out more of her books in the future. I'm excited to see the other stories she tells!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a really enjoyable read.

            "The book centers on Lulu and Jesse, participants in a study designed for adults struggling to form friendships. Jesse is on the mend from an accident that abruptly ended his career as a firefighter/EMT, while Lulu is searching for her identity after leaving her university amid betrayal. The premise is both relatable and engaging, particularly in its exploration of adult friendships and personal growth.",
            "Lulu and Jesse's growth was a standout aspect of the story. Their evolution from strangers to friends to lovers felt authentic and relatable. Jesse's journey of self-discovery and Lulu's search for belonging were particularly poignant. However, Lulu's occasional emotional immaturity seemed inconsistent with her age (30), which was a minor frustration. The romance developed gradually rather than being love at first sight, with a spark that intensified as they confronted their fears and hesitations. The heartwarming bonding moments emphasized relationship-building over the relationship itself. Additionally, Betty the cat was a delightful touch; Jesse's affection for her added charm and made his character even more endearing.",

            "Initially, the book started off slowly, leaving me uncertain about my enjoyment. However, it quickly captivated me and turned into a fast-paced read. If you find yourself in a similar situation at the start, I encourage you to stick with it—it’s well worth it!",
            "I was deeply invested in the backstories of the two main characters and how their experiences led them to participate in The Friendship Study. Lulu faced the ultimate betrayal from her boyfriend and best friend, forcing her to return home. The author skillfully explores the emotional trauma of betrayal and the feelings of inadequacy that can stem from having a highly successful parent who creates opportunities. Lulu's struggle to understand her loneliness and inability to connect with her coworkers truly resonated with me. In contrast, Jesse endured a physical trauma that left him unable to work or engage in the hobbies that once defined him. Since his accident, he has isolated himself from colleagues and friends. The book offers excellent representation of mental health, disability, and neurodivergence, while also incorporating themes such as friends with benefits, friends to lovers, LGBTQIA+ representation, and the grumpy x sunshine trope.",
            "The pacing and writing were impeccable, with each section enhancing the storyline, resulting in a well-rounded and engaging read.",
            "The themes of emotional trauma, loneliness, and self-discovery are profoundly moving. I found the story particularly resonant in its exploration of the challenges adults face in forming friendships. Both Lulu and Jesse navigate career changes while seeking happiness in their new life paths.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed watching Lulu and Jesse's friendship blossom as they provided each other with comfort. Their chemistry was evident from their first kiss, and the story featured plenty of steamy scenes, including playful moments with toys. The romance was a delightful blend of sweetness, passion, and heartfelt connection, striking a perfect balance between fun and seriousness."

However, it quickly hooked me and became a very quick read. If you feel the same way at the beginning, give it a bit longer—it’s worth it!  \n\n- **Character Development and Backstories:**  \n  I was very invested in the backstories of both main characters (MCs) and how their experiences led them to sign up for The Friendship Study. Lulu experienced the ultimate betrayal from her boyfriend and best friend, which forced her to move back home. The author does an excellent job of exploring the emotional trauma betrayal leaves on a person, as well as the feelings of inadequacy that can arise from having a very successful parent who can pull strings to create opportunities. Lulu’s struggle to understand why she feels so lonely and can’t connect with her coworkers really pulled on my heartstrings. Jesse, on the other hand, experienced a physical trauma that left him unable to do his job or pursue the hobbies that defined him. Since his accident, he’s isolated himself from his colleagues and most of his friends.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Resonance:**  \n  The themes of emotional trauma, loneliness, and self-discovery were deeply moving. The story resonated with me, especially the exploration of how difficult it can be to make friends as an adult. Both Lulu and Jesse had to restart their careers and find happiness in the new paths their lives were taking.  \n\n- **Romantic and Emotional Connection:**  \n  I loved seeing how Lulu and Jesse became friends and offered each other comfort. Their chemistry was obvious from their first kiss, and there were plenty of steamy scenes, including some playful moments with toys. The romance was sweet, sexy, and heartfelt, with a perfect balance of fun and serious elements.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  The book includes excellent representation of mental health, disability, and neurodivergence. It also features themes like friends with benefits, friends to lovers, LGBTQIA+ representation, and the grumpy x sunshine trope.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The pacing and writing were perfect.

            "In this story, Jesse's bisexuality and the biphobia he encounters are thoughtfully explored. He also grapples with a career-ending injury and cares for a parent with Alzheimer’s, and I found these challenges portrayed with depth, even though I haven't experienced them myself. Lulu is equally engaging, and I appreciated her journey to find her place in her career. Although not explicitly stated, her ADHD is subtly woven into the narrative, providing context for her behavior. The author shares their own ADHD diagnosis experience, shedding light on the difficulties neurodivergent women face in obtaining official diagnoses. This book offers nuanced representation of both queer and neurodiverse identities, which I valued. Jesse’s bisexuality and Lulu’s ADHD are authentically integrated into the story. The romance is sweet, and I enjoyed how the initial friendship between Jesse and Lulu is complicated by a taboo against romantic relationships. While friends-with-benefits isn’t my favorite trope, the author handles it well, creating tender and vulnerable interactions infused with passion. Despite the temporary nature of their FWB arrangement, I found myself rooting for them to realize they belong together, even as other opportunities arise.",

            "The story follows Jesse and Lulu, two lonely individuals brought together by their mutual friend George, who is also Jesse’s ex-boyfriend. He persuades them to participate in his PhD study on the challenges millennials face in making new friends. The study's rule against romance among participants creates tension that Jesse and Lulu inevitably test and eventually breach. This premise is refreshing, steering clear of clichés like the awakening trope, and instead thoughtfully incorporates labels and identities as integral to the characters. The opening chapter sets a high standard, and the rest of the book maintains that engagement throughout. The pacing is well-balanced, allowing both emotional depth and romantic tension to flourish.",
            "Lulu’s resilience is truly admirable; despite being betrayed by those she trusted, she remains unbitten and struggles to forge new connections. Jesse’s journey is equally compelling as he reclaims aspects of his life lost after an accident, discovering a new path forward. His loyalty to his grandfather, despite not remembering him, adds depth to his character. The development of all study participants enriches the narrative, not just Jesse and Lulu. The slow-burn tension as they test the boundaries of the study’s rules is captivating, and their eventual transgression is both rewarding and satisfying. The romance is intense and well-executed, striking a perfect balance between emotional depth and physical chemistry.",
            "This story powerfully captures the challenges of making friends as an adult, particularly in the absence of workplace connections. The characters' emotional journeys, filled with messy feelings and complex situations, are profoundly moving. Rather than providing easy solutions, the narrative emphasizes the importance of forging new connections that feel authentic and satisfying."

        "conclusion": "This book is a heartfelt, emotionally charged romance with a refreshing premise and well-developed characters. The relatable struggles of adult friendships, the slow-burn romantic tension, and the authentic character growth make it a standout read.

Lulu's character is particularly relatable, especially in her depiction of ADHD, imposter syndrome, and rejection-sensitive dysphoria. Her messy, clumsy, and emotionally intense nature resonated with my own experiences, offering a sense of recognition that was both surprising and comforting. Jesse's character also struck a chord, especially his struggle with losing his career, social life, and sense of self after becoming disabled.

            "The story follows Jesse and Lulu, who share a passionate first kiss but are hindered by their involvement in a \"friendship\" study that forbids romantic relationships. This setup creates a captivating dynamic filled with sexual tension and boundary exploration. The premise of the study, which investigates why adults find it difficult to form friendships, adds an intriguing layer to their connection.",
            "In this engaging story, Jesse, a quiet yet attractive firefighter, grapples with insecurities stemming from a life-altering car accident that has shaken his sense of self. Meanwhile, Lulu returns home, uncertain and seeking solace after escaping a toxic relationship with her best friend and ex. Both characters are well-developed, and their struggles and growth resonate authentically.\n\nThe chemistry between Jesse and Lulu is palpable, ignited during a blind date orchestrated by Jesse’s ex-boyfriend. The sexual tension is skillfully crafted, as they navigate the boundaries of their friendship while exploring their connection. Lulu’s neurodivergence is portrayed with sensitivity, adding depth to her character, while the bisexuality of both protagonists feels genuine and integral to their identities, rather than merely a nod to diversity.\n\nThe intimate scenes are refreshingly well-written, incorporating creative elements such as toy play, pegging, mutual masturbation, and truck sex. These moments serve as a natural extension of Jesse and Lulu’s feelings for each other, never feeling excessive or out of place. Overall, this story offers a compelling exploration of identity, connection, and desire."

            "Although the novel is relatively short, certain sections felt slow, impacting the overall pacing. The forced proximity and grump-sunshine tropes were skillfully executed, though at times they leaned towards predictability.",
            "In this story, Logan is a stoic and introverted character grappling with the trauma of a leg injury that ended his firefighting career. He also faces the challenges of his grandfather's Alzheimer's, leaving him feeling trapped in a low place. In contrast, Lulu is a cheerful yet insecure character who feels like an imposter, largely due to her father's influence in securing her teaching job. As a neurodivergent individual with undiagnosed ADHD, she strives to prove her worth independently.\n\nBoth characters experience significant personal growth: Logan confronts his trauma and emotional barriers, while Lulu works to overcome her insecurities and establish her identity. Their romance develops quickly, fueled by a strong initial attraction and built on mutual understanding and support. The friends-to-lovers trope is central to the narrative, with their connection deepening through the Friendship Study.\n\nHowever, the third-act breakup feels unnecessary and frustrating, though their eventual reconciliation is satisfying. Logan's bisexuality is subtly yet meaningfully represented, exemplified by his habit of painting his nails. Additionally, his chronic pain and use of a cane provide authentic representation of chronic illness and disability. Lulu's neurodivergence is portrayed thoughtfully, adding depth to her character. Overall, the story effectively explores themes of personal growth and the complexities of relationships.",

I also appreciated George's role and the emphasis on his friendship with Jesse, and later with Lulu. However, I was disappointed that the hint of Lulu possibly being neurodivergent or having ADHD was never explored further. Additionally, I felt there was an excessive focus on sex, particularly toward the end, which detracted from the story for me. While intimacy is a part of love stories, it felt overdone in this case."

While sex is part of a love story, it felt excessive, especially toward the end, which annoyed me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Strengths:**  \n  - Despite its flaws, it was a very enjoyable book with good representation and lovable characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had significant potential and offered strong representation and likable characters, but it fell short in fully executing its concept and addressing certain themes. While I appreciated the open discussion of bisexuality and the emphasis on friendship, the implausible \"Friendship Study\" and excessive focus on sex detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5  \n\n**Content Warning (CW):**  \nMention of sexual abuse."

Additionally, Jesse's story of rediscovering himself after an accident adds another layer of emotional depth to the narrative.",

For instance, many characters were enthusiastic about rugby, a sport that lacks popularity in the U.S. Additionally, phrases like “I didn’t go to university” or “when I was at university” felt out of place, as Americans typically use “college.” These minor inconsistencies, while small, disrupted my immersion in the story.",

The numerous subplots, such as the drama involving the ex-boyfriend and ex-best friend, detract from the story's potential. A deeper focus on the complexities of a single character would have strengthened the narrative. At times, the pacing feels uneven, resulting in a choppy reading experience. Significant editing and rewriting were necessary to enhance the flow and clarity of the story.",

The main character's potential neurodivergence (AUDHD) is hinted at in one scene but not explored further, which is disappointing. While Jesse is mostly likable and endearing, his friendship with his ex feels unnecessary and off-putting. The representation of neurodivergence is underdeveloped, missing a valuable opportunity for exploration. Additionally, George's character seems pointless and contributes little to the story.

            "Jesse, a muscular bisexual man in his mid-30s and a former firefighter, is depicted in the story, but the cover art fails to reflect this. Instead, the cover features a youthful-looking man who appears to be in his 20s and seems quite ordinary.",
            "The book was unexpectedly steamy and emotionally charged. The third-act breakup was particularly heartbreaking and left a lasting impact. Overall, the story was heartfelt, centering on two individuals yearning to truly belong to one another. I related to the challenges of recent college graduation and the struggle to find friends and a sense of belonging. Jesse's aversion to socializing and preference for peace and quiet resonated with me. However, I struggled to empathize with the more self-pitying aspects of the millennial experience."

I appreciate when queerness is simply a part of a character's existence rather than a focal point. The depiction of undiagnosed ADHD, particularly through Jesse's support in helping Lulu understand her identity, was also impactful. Furthermore, the portrayal of chronic pain, past injuries, and the use of a mobility aid, like a cane, was both thoughtful and meaningful."

They both had so much to work through, and they were able to do this individually and together.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  One of my favorite things was the queer and mental health representation! I love when being queer isn’t a big deal in a book; the main characters just exist as who they are. I also loved the undiagnosed ADHD representation and the way Jesse helped Lulu figure out that this is a part of who she is. Additionally, the portrayal of chronic pain, prior injury, and the use of a mobility aid (cane) was well-done and meaningful.  \n\n- **Plot and Relationships:**  \n  The story beautifully explores the challenges of making friends as an adult, showing that it’s perfectly okay to have a couple of high-quality friends rather than a million. The dual perspective added depth to the narrative, and the forbidden love and friends-to-lovers tropes were executed wonderfully. The dynamic between Jesse and Lulu, from their initial friendship to their deeper connection, felt authentic and engaging.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The setting in Pennsylvania added a grounded, relatable feel to the story, making it easy to immerse myself in the characters’ world.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book handles sensitive topics like a parent figure with Alzheimer’s/dementia, a non-fatal car accident, injury from the accident, and a discussion of sexual assault by the survivor with care and respect.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a heartfelt and engaging read, blending themes of friendship, love, and personal growth with meaningful representation.

While the third-act breakup felt forced, the rest of the story was thoroughly enjoyable and left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The flow kept me engaged without feeling rushed or dragged out.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved being able to be in the minds of both main characters (MCs) to see how they were struggling internally and trying to connect with each other. The FMC is all sunshine with a loud personality, and the MMC is all grumpy, barely saying a word. They worked so well together, and their growth throughout the story was compelling.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The grumpy/sunshine trope was executed perfectly. Their journey had me laughing, crying, closing the page with aggravation, and smiling. It’s a wonderful odd-man-out friends-to-lovers story with a slow burn and some forced proximity elements.\n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The spicy scenes were creative and super hot, with a few “teach me” scenes that were 👏👏. The open-door scenes added depth to their relationship without overshadowing the emotional connection.\n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The book deals with deep topics like family member with Alzheimer’s/dementia, mental health (anxiety, depression), grief over injury (mobility issues), and recounted sexual assault. Despite these heavy themes, the story doesn’t feel dark or heavy.

However, the third act breakup felt unnecessary, and Lulu's reason for being in the study was overly convoluted. The coming-out scene with his grandfather, who has Alzheimer's, was exceptionally well executed.

A simple moment of Jesse eating her out could have conveyed the same emotional weight.",

It offers a refreshing take on romance, making it a compelling read for those seeking more substance and authenticity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The ending disappointed me, primarily due to the unnecessary use of the Third Act Breakup, which detracted from my overall enjoyment. I also craved more closure regarding Jesse’s parents, as their storyline felt unresolved. While the plot isn't groundbreaking and relies on familiar tropes like forced proximity, forbidden romance, and friends-to-lovers, it does incorporate small yet meaningful details—such as body positivity themes like female body hair and nail polish on men—that add a refreshing layer to the narrative.",
            "The characters in this story are authentic and relatable, enhanced by the author’s inclusion of everyday details often overlooked in romance novels. Jesse’s character, in particular, is well-crafted; his bisexuality is an integral part of his identity without overshadowing his personality, making him feel realistic and nuanced. The book thoughtfully addresses representation, portraying Jesse (and possibly Lulu) as bisexual in a way that feels natural rather than overly dramatized or stereotyped."

They truly complement each other and make one another better.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  I genuinely enjoyed the book and couldn’t put it down. The story kept me engaged throughout, and I was invested in the characters’ journey.  \n\n- **Third Act Conflict:**  \n  The only aspect I didn’t like was the third act breakup. It didn’t make much sense to me why they were “taking a break” or whatever you want to call it. This part felt a bit forced and didn’t align with the rest of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I honestly did not expect to like this book as much as I did. It left a lasting impression on me, and I can’t stop thinking about it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my minor issue with the third act breakup, this book was a delightful and immersive read. Jesse and Lulu’s relationship felt authentic and heartwarming, and their growth together was a joy to witness.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4⭐️"

I appreciated that the story focused on the relationship itself rather than making being queer the character's entire identity or the sole plot of the story. The representation of a bisexual man was particularly refreshing and well-done.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The biggest issue for me was that the storyline fell a little flat. While the relationship dynamics were engaging, the overall plot lacked depth and didn’t fully captivate me.  \n\n- **Realism and Immersion (Millennial Friendship Study):**  \n  The millennial friendship study design felt majorly flawed and, at times, coercive. As someone who works in academia, I found it hard to stay immersed in the story because of these unrealistic elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the book’s normalization of queer relationships and its refreshing representation of a bisexual man, the storyline felt underdeveloped, and the flawed millennial friendship study design hindered my immersion in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their first date rivals the worst first date I’ve ever been on, which is saying something.  \n  - Despite their initial awkwardness, I started to root for them as they came out of their shells, and I wanted to see them be together.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The progression of their relationship felt a bit confusing at first, especially when she invites him inside after what seemed like the worst date ever. It made no sense to me initially.  \n  - However, certain moments, like the tree scene, stood out and added depth to their connection.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  - Their awkwardness was both frustrating and endearing, making me invested in their journey.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the characters’ initial interactions were baffling and their awkwardness was almost too much to handle, the story grew on me as they developed and opened up. Despite some confusing moments, I found myself rooting for them and appreciating the unique dynamics of their relationship.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

This made the narrative feel rushed and incomplete.\n\n- **Character Chemistry:**  \n  The chemistry between the characters was lacking. Their interactions felt forced, and I didn’t sense a natural connection or emotional depth between them. This made it difficult to become invested in their relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing premise, the execution fell short. The pacing was uneven, the character development felt rushed, and the lack of chemistry between the protagonists made the story less compelling than I had hoped.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They have messy brains, not in a negative way but in a way that makes them feel so real and relatable.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Relationship Development:**  \n  You can literally feel the tension between them while they are still trying to stick to the rules of the study.
