            "Ariel is a complex and deeply troubled character. Her violent intrusive thoughts and actions—such as contemplating killing her father, pushing an older woman under a bus, and harming her best friend—underscore her internal struggles. She grapples with feeling too big, too queer, and too rough to meet her parents' expectations, all while fearing the loss of control over her mind. Additionally, her undiagnosed OCD intensifies her emotional turmoil.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Characterization and Emotional Depth:**  \n  Ariel is portrayed as a complex and deeply troubled character. Her violent intrusive thoughts and actions, such as killing her dad, pushing an older woman under a bus, and harming her best friend, highlight her internal struggles. She feels \"too big, too queer, too rough\" to meet her parents' expectations and is terrified of losing control of her mind. Her undiagnosed OCD adds another layer to her emotional turmoil.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Format:**  \n  The novel is written in verse, a format I particularly enjoy. This stylistic choice enhances the emotional intensity of the story and makes Ariel’s inner world feel even more raw and immediate.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book is oppressive, frightening, and deeply emotional, capturing the weight of Ariel’s struggles. However, it also ends on a hopeful note, which provides a sense of closure and healing.  \n\n- **Reader’s Emotional Response:**  \n  The story broke my heart into a thousand pieces. I felt a strong urge to yell at Ariel’s parents for their lack of understanding and to hug Ariel, reassuring her that she would be okay. While my heart slowly mended as the story progressed, the emotional scars from this intense read will likely remain for a while.  \n\n- **Audience Consideration:**  \n  This book is not for everyone due to its heavy and triggering content. I highly recommend checking the trigger warnings before deciding to read it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Ariel Crashes a Train* is a powerful and emotionally charged YA novel in verse that delves into the mind of a girl grappling with undiagnosed OCD and overwhelming internal struggles. While the story is oppressive and heartbreaking, it ultimately offers hope and healing.

            "A novel told in verse can be a powerful medium, especially for exploring heavy subject matter. However, in *Ariel Crashes a Train*, this format ultimately detracted from the story. Instead of poetic entries, I encountered clunky sentences that lacked emotional depth. The frequent shifts to paragraph structure made it read more like a transcript than a collection of poems. As a result, I couldn't connect with Ariel's emotions, and the narrative felt stripped of the feelings that typically enrich novels in verse.",
            "In this compelling story, Ariel, the protagonist, grapples with undiagnosed OCD and intrusive, harmful thoughts. While her distant parents offer little support, her older sister Mandy is a steadfast source of strength. During her summer job, Ariel encounters Rex and Ruth, whose youthful understanding and acceptance provide the connection she has longed for. It’s heartening to witness Ariel's growth as she realizes she is not a budding serial killer, as her thoughts implied, but rather a teenager navigating the challenges of OCD. The support from her sister, friends, and even her boss is a touching highlight of the narrative.",
            "The book tackles significant themes like mental health and OCD, which I usually find compelling. However, the verse format ultimately fell short of my expectations. As a fan of novels-in-verse and stories focused on mental health, I had high hopes, but the format did not enhance the narrative as I had anticipated.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Format and Structure:**\n   - I think a novel told in verse can be a powerful thing and can really elevate a book that deals with heavy subject matters. However, in *Ariel Crashes a Train*, the format did a disservice to the subject. Many times it didn’t feel like I was reading poetic entries, but rather clunky sentences that lacked emotion. The structure often switched to paragraphs, making it read more like a transcript than verses of poems. I didn’t feel any of the emotions I am sure Ariel felt, and it ended up reading like a novel stripped of feelings rather than one infused with them, as novels told-in-verse tend to be.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Ariel, the protagonist, struggles with undiagnosed OCD and obsessive, harmful thoughts. Her aloof parents offered no help, but her older sister, Mandy, was amazing and always stood by her. Ariel meets Rex and Ruth during her summer job, and despite their youth, they exhibit so much understanding and acceptance that Ariel was missing from her parents and others. I enjoyed seeing the growth in Ariel after she learns she is not a soon-to-be serial killer (as her thoughts suggested), but rather a teen dealing with OCD. I loved seeing her sister, friends, and even her boss join together to help her.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - It was sad to see Ariel constantly struggle with her condition, and I wish the format had been different to better convey the emotions she was experiencing. The lack of emotional depth in the writing made it difficult to connect with Ariel’s journey on a deeper level.\n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**\n   - The book deals with heavy subject matters, such as mental health and OCD, which I typically find compelling. However, the execution of these themes through the verse format fell short of my expectations. I came in with high hopes, given my love for novels-in-verse and books centered on mental health, but the format didn’t enhance the story as I had hoped.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *Ariel Crashes a Train* tackles important themes like mental health and OCD, the novel-in-verse format didn’t deliver the emotional depth or poetic impact I expected. The character development, particularly Ariel’s growth and the supportive relationships with her sister and friends, was a highlight.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Understanding of Intrusive Thoughts:**\n   - The book effectively clarifies what intrusive thoughts truly are, distinguishing them from mundane decisions like choosing not to clean or eating dessert. Intrusive thoughts are portrayed as genuine, unwanted, and often terrifying.\n   - The author highlights how intrusive thoughts are exacerbated when combined with OCD, making them more extreme and difficult to manage.\n\n- **Exploration of Gender Identity:**\n   - The book delves deeply into the complexities of gender identity, using vivid metaphors and thought-provoking questions. For example, the protagonist questions societal constructs of gender, such as, \"How do you know you’re a girl?\" and explores the commodification of gender roles.\n   - The reader relates heavily to the gender aspect, appreciating the nuanced and relatable portrayal of these struggles.\n\n- **Mental Health Representation:**\n   - The book provides a raw and authentic depiction of living with OCD and intrusive thoughts, particularly when these thoughts are violent and bloody.\n   - It also addresses the challenges of unsupportive parents and other external factors that compound the protagonist's mental health struggles.\n   - The reader notes that the book feels like an \"own voices\" narrative, lending it credibility and depth.\n\n- **Writing Style and Quotes:**\n   - The writing is praised for its creativity and emotional resonance, with several quotes standing out as particularly impactful. For example:\n     - \"Car or carnival sometimes it feels like everyone around me knows something I don’t—that there was a blueprint of their identity they received at birth, and build the architecture of their life brick by solid brick while I am using Legos.\"\n     - \"I told Rex and Ruth I am afraid of hurting the people I love but also I am afraid of the people I love hurting me, and me not loving myself enough to stop them.\"\n\n- **Content Warnings and Accessibility:**\n   - The reader emphasizes that this is not an easy book to read due to its intense and graphic content, including violent intrusive thoughts and challenging family dynamics.\n   - They recommend the book but advise potential readers to review content warnings before starting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a powerful exploration of intrusive thoughts, OCD, and gender identity, written with authenticity and emotional depth. While it is a challenging read due to its intense themes, it offers valuable insights and relatable perspectives. The writing is creative and impactful, making it a memorable and thought-provoking experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.5/5"

            "Ariel is a multi-faceted character constrained by societal expectations and her own self-imposed rules designed to shield others from harm. The novel vividly depicts her internal struggles with Harm OCD, a often-overlooked subtype of the disorder. Central to the story is Ariel's relationship with her family, particularly her sister and her religious father, who dismisses the idea of therapy in favor of prayer. Her sister and friends significantly influence her journey, helping her realize that she is not the monster she believes herself to be.",
            "This novel, written in verse, effectively conveys the experience of living with OCD. Cole's talent shines through as she captures the terror, irrationality, doubt, and self-perpetuating nature of the disorder. The depiction of recovery, particularly through exposure therapy, is both accurate and hopeful, providing valuable insight for those affected by OCD.",

Her struggles with identity, parental expectations, and loneliness make her deeply relatable.\n   - The portrayal of Ariel’s mental health, particularly her OCD, is unique and nuanced. The crocodile metaphor for her intrusive thoughts is striking and effectively conveys her internal battles.\n   - The supporting characters, Rex and Ruth, play a crucial role in helping Ariel navigate her struggles, while her sister’s diagnosis adds a layer of realism to her journey.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**\n   - The novel addresses OCD in a way that feels fresh and authentic, shedding light on a topic rarely explored in YA literature.\n   - It also tackles broader societal issues, such as the patriarchy, gender identity, and the pressures of conforming to societal norms.\n   - The inclusion of themes like police brutality, racism, and transphobia adds depth and relevance to the story, making it a thought-provoking read.\n\n- **Writing Style and Format:**\n   - The novel is written in verse, which sets it apart from traditional YA novels and adds a poetic, lyrical quality to the narrative.\n   - While the format is innovative, the story occasionally feels repetitive, as if the author is overemphasizing certain points, which detracts from the overall impact.\n\n- **Educational and Discussion Potential:**\n   - This book would be an excellent choice for high school classrooms, as it encourages meaningful discussions about mental health, gender, and societal expectations.\n   - The novel’s exploration of complex themes provides ample material for students to analyze and reflect upon.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**\n   - The book includes heavy themes such as suicide, suicide ideation, blood, intrusive thoughts of harm, OCD, depression, police brutality, murder, gun use, racism, and transphobia. These elements may be triggering for some readers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a groundbreaking addition to YA literature, offering a unique exploration of OCD, gender identity, and societal pressures. While the verse format is refreshing, the occasional repetitiveness slightly diminishes its impact. Despite this, the book’s powerful themes and relatable protagonist make it a must-read, especially for those interested in mental health and social justice.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Story:**  \n  The novel follows Ariel, a seventeen-year-old girl grappling with intrusive thoughts, OCD, and feelings of being \"too much\" for those around her. She works at Wildwood, a summer carnival, where she befriends Ruth and Rex. The story explores her mental health struggles, her strained relationship with her parents, and her journey toward self-acceptance with the help of her friends. The narrative is raw and unflinching, depicting Ariel’s near-suicide attempt and her gradual progress in facing her fears.\n\n- **Voice:**  \n  Ariel’s voice is brutally honest, raw, and unfiltered, capturing her fears, questions, and struggles with identity, mental health, and societal expectations. The use of bold, creepy font for intrusive thoughts and italics for others’ speech effectively differentiates her inner turmoil from external dialogue. Her exploration of gender, sexuality, religion, and body image adds depth to her character.\n\n- **Style:**  \n  The book’s opening is gripping, immediately immersing the reader in Ariel’s world of intrusive thoughts. However, the lack of trigger warnings is a notable oversight, as the content could be deeply unsettling for unprepared readers. The novel-in-verse format works well in some moments, particularly during intense emotional scenes, but at times feels disjointed and abrupt, especially in the latter part of the book.\n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The story is set in Ariel’s town, primarily at Wildwood, her home, and other local spots. The consistent use of these locations creates a sense of familiarity and grounding, which contrasts effectively with Ariel’s chaotic inner world.\n\n- **Accuracy:**  \n  The depiction of OCD and intrusive thoughts is thorough and realistic, covering a wide range of manifestations (sexual, violent, religious, perfectionism). The inclusion of definitions and resources at the end adds educational value, and the emphasis on professional treatment for mental health is commendable.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Ariel is a deeply relatable protagonist, and her struggles evoke immediate sympathy. Ruth and Rex are well-developed supporting characters, each bringing unique perspectives and strengths to the story. Ariel’s parents are portrayed as distant and self-absorbed, adding complexity to her home life. Supporting adults like Megga and Cipinko provide much-needed care and attention.\n\n- **Theme:**  \n  The central theme revolves around self-acceptance and the societal pressures that make individuals feel \"wrong\" or \"other.\" The story challenges the idea of fitting into rigid societal norms and celebrates the complexity of human identity.\n\n- **Illustrations:**  \n  The crocodile illustrations on the spine are a clever nod to Ariel’s intrusive thoughts, blending cuteness with a sinister undertone. The cover design is visually appealing and helps readers visualize Ariel.\n\n- **Design (Format, Organization, etc.):**  \n  The novel-in-verse format has its strengths, particularly in conveying Ariel’s emotional turmoil. However, some sections feel disjointed, and the pacing drags in the final third of the book. The ending, while expected, could have been more fleshed out to better showcase Ariel’s growth.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a powerful exploration of mental health, identity, and self-acceptance, with a raw and honest narrative voice. While the novel-in-verse format has its moments of brilliance, the pacing and structure could be improved. The lack of trigger warnings is a significant drawback, but the accurate and empathetic portrayal of OCD and intrusive thoughts makes this a standout in YA fiction.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5 (initially considered 5/5 but adjusted due to pacing and structural issues)."

            "Ariel’s struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are poignantly portrayed, revealing her battle with dark, intrusive thoughts.

In contrast, her sister Mandy provides crucial support, studying religion and psychology to better assist Ariel and advocating for professional help.

She feels out of place in her own mind and body, which is further complicated by violent intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors aimed at preventing these thoughts from manifesting.  \n   - Her large body doesn’t fit into the narrow societal expectations for teenage girls, adding to her sense of alienation.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The carnival environment of Wildwood is an intriguing and well-crafted backdrop that adds depth to the story.  \n   - The home environment is cold and distant, with parents who are more absorbed in their own lives than in connecting with Ariel, their only child living under the same roof.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - The novel explores themes of loneliness, mental health, and self-discovery. Ariel’s journey is marked by her struggle to find her place in the world.  \n   - The portrayal of intrusive thoughts using a different font effectively illustrates how they disrupt and intertwine with her other thoughts, adding a layer of authenticity to her mental health struggles.  \n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**  \n   - The story suffers from trying to tackle too many themes at once, which dilutes its impact. A more focused narrative with fewer themes would have made the overall experience more compelling.  \n   - This issue mirrors the author’s previous work, *Dear Medusa*, where a similar lack of focus was noted.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n   - Ariel’s older sister leaves for university, and her best friend takes a summer job elsewhere, leaving her feeling isolated.  \n   - At her summer job in Wildwood, Ariel meets other young people grappling with their own issues, who help her find a sense of belonging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a pleasant reading experience overall, particularly due to the unique carnival setting and the authentic portrayal of Ariel’s mental health struggles. However, the novel’s impact is lessened by its attempt to address too many themes simultaneously, resulting in a lack of focus. A more streamlined narrative would have made the story more powerful.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Although the novel is character-driven with minimal action, I found myself deeply invested in Ariel's journey.",

I didn't remember the description, so it's a testament to how well Cole portrayed OCD that I was able to identify it before Ariel realized it.\n\n- **Exploration of Mental Health (OCD):**\n   - After reading the acknowledgments, I understand why and appreciate Cole's exploration of the topic. I loved the portrayal of the crocodile brain.\n\n- **Support System and Relationships:**\n   - I loved the support Ariel gets from her new friends, her sister, and even her boss. I wish Ariel could have gotten more support from her parents, but that's just realistically not the case in many situations. Still sucks, though.\n\n- **Themes of Gender, Racism, and Mental Health:**\n   - I enjoyed the concept of challenging gender and racism and all the mental health topics that connected Ruth, Rex, and Ariel.\n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**\n   - I think the book was a little longer than it needed to be, though I definitely enjoyed the novel-in-verse style.\n\n- **Representation:**\n   - I'd recommend this for people who love stories about mental health that feature queer characters.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ariel is portrayed as a complex character who struggles with her identity, feeling \"too tall, too queer, too rough,\" and grappling with an internal \"crocodile\" that represents her intrusive thoughts. Her journey of self-discovery and her relationships with her friends (Ruth and Rex) and her sister highlight her growth and the challenges she faces.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The novel explores themes of mental health, specifically OCD, and the stigma surrounding it. Ariel's intrusive thoughts and her coping mechanisms, such as rituals, are depicted in a raw and honest manner. The story also touches on themes of family dynamics, with Ariel's parents being self-absorbed and dismissive of her struggles, telling her to \"pray more\" instead of offering meaningful support.  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The plot revolves around Ariel's summer job at a carnival, where she forms meaningful connections with Ruth and Rex. Together, they help her confront her mental health struggles, with her sister playing a key role in diagnosing her OCD. The narrative is intense and emotionally charged, with no conventional \"happy ending,\" which adds to its realism but may also make it difficult for some readers.  \n\n- **Audience Suitability:**  \n  The book is described as a challenging read, potentially triggering for some students due to its raw portrayal of mental health struggles and the lack of parental support. It may not be suitable for every reader, particularly younger or more sensitive audiences.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a poignant and unflinching look at mental health, identity, and family dynamics through the lens of a young protagonist. While it is a powerful and thought-provoking story, its intense themes and lack of a traditional resolution make it a difficult read that may not be suitable for all audiences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This format limited the depth and development I was hoping for.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book felt too long and meandering, especially in the middle. The pacing dragged, and the story seemed to lose focus, which made it harder to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Impact:**  \n  Ariel’s thoughts were portrayed in a disjointed manner, which was effective at times in conveying her mental state. However, I wanted more depth and exploration of her character and relationships. The lack of awareness from those around her about her OCD felt realistic but also frustrating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book tackles an important and relevant topic in mental health, its execution fell short for me. The verse format and pacing issues detracted from the story’s potential, leaving me wanting more depth and cohesion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars."

The book captures the disordered and unorganized thinking of someone struggling with OCD, mirroring the chaotic internal world of the protagonist, Ariel.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The use of verse in the book works exceptionally well, as it aligns with the fragmented and disordered thought processes of someone living with OCD.

It is the only representation of OCD that I have ever related to on such a profound level.  \n\n- **Impact and Recommendation:**  \n  I believe this book should be read by everyone who minimizes or misunderstands OCD. It has the potential to foster empathy and understanding for those living with the disorder.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a powerful and deeply personal exploration of OCD, offering an authentic portrayal of intrusive thoughts and the internal struggles of living with the disorder.
