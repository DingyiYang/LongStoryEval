His enthusiasm seeps through the pages, and it resonates with my own passion for niche interests.  \n\n- **Representation of Older Characters:**  \n   - Celeste, at 42, is navigating life and love beyond her 20s, which I appreciate as I get older. Her journey into birding as a new interest in her 40s is inspiring, even if her path to it is unconventional.  \n\n- **Consent and Communication in Relationships:**  \n   - The book portrays consent and communication in the bedroom as sexy and empowering. John‚Äôs care for Celeste‚Äôs comfort and boundaries is a refreshing and attractive portrayal of healthy intimacy.  \n\n- **Healing and Self-Discovery:**  \n   - Celeste‚Äôs healing journey is relatable and realistic, showing that healing isn‚Äôt linear. Her struggles with self-worth and being \"too much\" for some people resonated deeply with me.  \n\n- **Balancing Change and Authenticity in Relationships:**  \n   - The book explores the delicate balance of changing for a partner while staying true to oneself. This nuanced portrayal of relationships feels authentic and avoids the all-or-nothing approach often seen in stories.  \n\n- **Inclusive Representation:**  \n   - The inclusion of LGBTQIA+ characters feels natural and effortless, avoiding tokenism. Friends and family who are bi, gay, nonbinary, etc., are presented as a normal part of life.  \n\n- **Relatable Themes and Personal Connection:**  \n   - Celeste‚Äôs triggers and struggles, particularly her journey of self-acceptance, were personally relatable. Her realization that being \"too much\" for some doesn‚Äôt diminish her value as a person was deeply meaningful to me.  \n\n- **Aesthetic Appeal:**  \n   - The cover is adorable, and I‚Äôm unapologetically a fan of judging books by their covers.  \n\n**Why Others Might Not Love It as Much:**  \n- The fake-ish relationship trope with a deadline might frustrate some readers.  \n- The characters fall into insta-lust quickly, which could be a red flag for those who dislike that trope.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Birding with Benefits* might not be a book I‚Äôd universally recommend for a 5-star rating, it deeply resonated with me. The characters‚Äô passions, the realistic portrayal of relationships, and the themes of healing and self-discovery made it a standout read. The inclusive representation and thoughtful handling of consent further elevated the story for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5 stars (though I acknowledge others might rate it a 4)."

Their personal issues add depth to their interactions and growth throughout the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The romance is a slow burn, with a grumpy/sunshine dynamic that evolves gradually. The tension builds as John quietly instructs Celeste in birdwatching, leading to sparks flying between them. The story explores whether they can navigate their pasts and find a second chance at love.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Style:**  \n  The narrative unfolds at a steady pace, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the characters' journey.

His POV, his relationship with his best friend Chris, his quiet observant nature, his competence, his communication skills, and his integrity stood out. Dubb has created a male main character (MMC) for the ages.  \n   - Celeste: She frustrated me. Her whirlwind of self-discovery post-divorce and her rigid belief that she must be alone to avoid losing herself in a partner felt overbearing. Her \"act first, think later\" personality and constant planning were overwhelming, though other characters calling her out on her behavior added some balance.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n   - The conflict between John and Celeste felt real and visceral. John, who felt at home in his skin with Celeste, contrasted sharply with her tendency to plan ways he could change. Their resolution in the moment was interesting and well-executed.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing is beautiful, with emotions and intimacy portrayed exceptionally well. However, the grand gesture near the end could have been replaced with straightforward communication, which felt like a missed opportunity.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - I got off to a slow start with the book, mainly because Celeste's manic and flighty nature made it hard to connect initially.

            "The relationship between Celeste and John begins with a misunderstanding, evolves into a beautiful friendship, and ultimately transforms into something magical. The slow burn of their connection is captivating, and the eventual romantic payoff is perfectly spiced. I appreciated how they brought out the best in each other while navigating their past traumas. It was refreshing to read about characters in their 40s, as Celeste and John are, highlighting the complexities of dating and relationships later in life in an authentic and relatable way. Celeste's quirky, fun, and energetic personality resonated with me, especially her tendency to dive headfirst into new experiences and her habit of giving advice she sometimes struggles to follow. The bond between Celeste and her daughter is special, realistic, and deeply touching, particularly for someone who has recently lost their mother. John embodies the qualities I admire in a character‚Äîquiet sincerity, sweetness, masculinity, and gentleness.",

However, this was easy to overlook due to the genre‚Äôs typical ‚Äúromance logic.‚Äù  \n\n- **Themes and Details:**  \n  The birding theme was present but not overdone, striking a good balance that added charm without overwhelming the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful and cozy read with well-developed characters, a steady pace, and plenty of enjoyable romantic moments. Despite a minor timeline inconsistency, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience that I highly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It follows Celeste Johansson, a forty-two-year-old language arts teacher, as she embarks on a journey of independence and self-discovery. The transition from a fake relationship to a genuine connection is skillfully portrayed, with the birdwatching competition providing a fresh and authentic backdrop.",
            "Celeste's transformation from self-neglect to prioritizing her own needs is both compelling and relatable. Her habit of writing inspiring quotes on post-its and placing them on her bathroom mirror adds a charming dimension to her character. John Maguire, recently single and healing from a breakup, is a well-rounded character whose passion for birdwatching and aspirations of becoming a bird guide are endearing. The portrayal of both characters' fears about vulnerability and potential heartache adds depth to the story. \n\nThe mature and well-communicated romance between Celeste and John is a highlight. Their relationship evolves naturally from pretense to genuine connection, culminating in a friends-with-benefits arrangement. The absence of miscommunication is refreshing, and their hesitations about pursuing a full-fledged relationship feel authentic given their personal circumstances.",
            "The birding facts woven throughout the novel enhance the authenticity of the competitive backdrop. The engaging writing and the well-developed lives of Celeste and John add depth to the narrative. The resolution of the birding competition is satisfying and refreshingly avoids clich√©s.",
            "The novel delves into themes of independence, self-discovery, and personal growth. A central focus is Celeste's journey to understand that she can prioritize herself while being in a relationship, though her hesitations can be frustrating at times. Rather than following a typical Cinderella narrative, the story presents realistic and relatable challenges faced by middle-aged individuals."

        "conclusion": "Sarah T Dubb‚Äôs debut novel, *Birding with Benefits*, is an original and engaging story that combines a unique birdwatching premise with a mature, well-communicated romance.

            "I approached this birding romance with skepticism, given my fear of birds, but the story quickly captivated me. The plot centers on a misunderstanding: Celeste thinks John needs her as a fake girlfriend to make his ex jealous, while he actually requires a partner for a birding competition. As their fake relationship develops, it transforms into a genuine connection, seamlessly blending humor, chemistry, and emotional depth.",
            "Celeste‚Äôs vibrant energy beautifully contrasts with John‚Äôs steady and kind demeanor, creating a captivating dynamic. Their undeniable chemistry evolves into a playful ‚Äúbirding with benefits‚Äù arrangement, adding charm to the narrative. The secondary characters, particularly John‚Äôs friend Chris, are memorable, and I would love to see a book centered on him. However, Celeste‚Äôs emotional journey could have been more developed. Her fear of losing herself in relationships stems from her past marriage, but the specifics of that experience and her ex‚Äôs role remain vague. It seems Celeste could benefit from therapy, especially given her tendency to impose her plans on her daughter, Morgan, and even John. Meanwhile, John appears stagnant, with unclear aspirations for his woodworking business and birdwatching teaching. His prolonged relationship with Breena, despite their evident mismatch, also lacks sufficient explanation.",

While the emotional arcs and character motivations could have been more developed, the charming dynamics between Celeste and John, along with the strong secondary characters, make it a memorable read.

Overall, the book was a joy to read, and it recovered well from a minor hiccup in the plot.",

Celeste, a divorc√©e who has sworn off love while rebuilding her life, adds depth and relatability to the story. Both she and John are well-developed and engaging characters, and watching their feelings evolve naturally throughout their time together was a highlight. However, the third-act conflict between Celeste and her daughter felt exaggerated and somewhat inconsistent with her character.

While I initially had trouble engaging with the story, switching to the audiobook format enhanced my experience, thanks to the excellent narration.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As someone deeply involved in birding, I find it hard to believe that the main characters could casually participate and think they stand a chance at winning. Serious birders would be far more dedicated‚Äîconstantly checking eBird for sightings, waking up at 4 am, driving long distances, and spending hours waiting for a single sighting. They would also bird before and after work and drop everything for a rare sighting.  \n\n- **Character Behavior and Motivation:**  \n  The characters‚Äô behavior doesn‚Äôt align with the mindset of a serious birder. For instance, one character sees a new species but chooses not to mention it to avoid interrupting their partner‚Äôs awe of nature. This feels unrealistic to me, as a birder with a life list of over 600 would prioritize adding to their list over such considerations.  \n\n- **Authenticity of the Birding Experience:**  \n  While the story is cute and enjoyable for casual birders, it lacks the depth and obsession that define serious birders. The main character‚Äôs aspiration to guide professionally feels unconvincing without demonstrating the obsessive, list-driven behavior typical of professional birders.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is charming and enjoyable for casual readers or those with a passing interest in birding.

            "Celeste's character left me wanting more. As an older female main character and a teacher, I hoped to connect with her, but she felt one-dimensional. Her enthusiasm for teaching seemed like a mask for the emotional baggage from her divorce, and beyond her lack of pleasure, there wasn't much depth to her character. In contrast, I adored John. He was a quiet, mysterious, yet sweet cinnamon roll of a male main character. His reactions to conflict were consistent and true to his nature, and his blend of passion and patience made him irresistibly swoon-worthy. His keen attention to detail, particularly in his birding-level observations of Celeste, was both endearing and memorable.",

These traits made her character feel less relatable and more like a caricature.\n\n- **Realism and Relatability:**  \n  The heroine's behavior often pulled me out of the story because it didn't align with how real people typically act. Even if such people exist, the narrative seemed to acknowledge that her personality could be overwhelming, as it explicitly labeled her as \"a lot.\" This self-awareness didn't make her quirks more endearing; instead, it highlighted why some might find her exhausting.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel's premise was enjoyable and inventive, the heroine's overly quirky and unrealistic behavior detracted from my overall reading experience. Her characterization felt exaggerated and at times frustrating, which made it harder to fully immerse myself in the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story begins on a fun and engaging note, but it also delves into moments of angst and drama, particularly influenced by Celeste's personality and her relationships with others. The third act features some exaggerated moments that could have been toned down. The plot centers on Celeste and John, two newly divorced individuals in their forties who meet through a mutual friend. Initially, Celeste believes John needs a fake girlfriend for an event, only to learn he actually requires a partner for a bird-watching tournament in Tucson. This six-week competition, which includes weekends spent birdwatching, serves as the story's backbone. The dynamic between Celeste and John, along with their interactions with other teams‚Äîespecially John's ex and her partner‚Äîadds both fun and competitiveness to the narrative.",
            "John is an exceptional male lead, one of the best I‚Äôve encountered. His passion for birdwatching and woodworking, combined with his calm and knowledgeable demeanor, makes him an engaging character. In contrast, Celeste is enthusiastic and competitive, but she occasionally comes off as overly controlling, which I found slightly irritating. The supporting characters, like John‚Äôs best friend Chris, who works with endangered baby snails, add charm, though they could have been more fully developed. The romance between Celeste and John unfolds gradually as they interact during the competition and attend social events, such as Celeste‚Äôs teacher gatherings. Their chemistry is palpable, and their shared experiences foster a bond, even amidst their initial hesitations about starting a new relationship.",
            "The birdwatching scenes are truly memorable and enjoyable. The vivid descriptions of nature, combined with John's passion for helping others appreciate their surroundings, create an immersive atmosphere. Additionally, the Tucson setting for the birdwatching tournament provides a unique and refreshing backdrop to the story."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a lovely story with a unique premise centered around birdwatching. The memorable nature scenes, the standout character of John, and the gradual development of the romance make it an enjoyable read. While some of Celeste‚Äôs traits and the third-act drama were slightly off-putting, the book is recommended for readers who appreciate a romance with beautiful nature walks and a touch of competitiveness.",

            "I found Celeste to be a relatable character on her journey of self-discovery, whether after a divorce or while still in a relationship. Her story resonated with me as it emphasizes the importance of authenticity and not conforming to others' expectations. I often feel \"too much\" and have been encouraged to tone myself down, making Celeste's empowering journey feel personal.\n\nHowever, I found John‚Äôs character less believable. While I appreciated his attentiveness and detail-oriented nature, the combination of his \"man's man\" lumberjack persona with extreme social awkwardness and academic tendencies felt inconsistent. It was hard to accept that someone with only one long-term relationship‚Äîwhere his partner \"wore the pants\"‚Äîwould possess such refined romantic and intimate skills. \n\nAdditionally, it seemed unrealistic for Celeste, who had been diminished by men in her past, to feel so comfortable being her vibrant self around John, who is quiet and socially awkward.

            "I admired everything Celeste represented, but I felt she could have benefited from therapy after her divorce and during her self-discovery journey. Having experienced two unsuccessful long-term relationships myself, I understand her struggles. However, I can't fathom shutting off my desire for love, even after being cheated on. The conflict with Morgan frustrated me, and I believe therapy could have helped Celeste navigate that situation more effectively. On the other hand, I absolutely loved John‚Äîhe was an exceptional book boyfriend, deserving of an A++++ rating. Most men should aspire to be like him, and I appreciated his character growth throughout the story. The name of his new business brought me to tears, yet I felt Celeste overlooked its significance, despite its connection to her values."

However, I couldn‚Äôt imagine closing off the part of me that just wanted love, even after being cheated on and getting a very bad end of the stick.  \n   - The conflict with Morgan irritated me, and I feel like therapy could have helped Celeste navigate that aspect better.  \n\n- **Character Development (John):**  \n   - I loved John. He was incredible the whole time‚Äîan A++++ book boyfriend. Most men should strive to be like him.  \n   - I was glad to see his growth throughout the story. The name of his new business made me tear up, and I felt like Celeste glossed over it when she learned of it, even though it alluded to her and what she stands for.  \n\n- **Parent-Child Relationship (Celeste and Morgan):**  \n   - We didn‚Äôt see many interactions between Celeste and Morgan regarding Morgan‚Äôs future, but I feel like Celeste was asking the wrong questions. It makes sense why Morgan stalled on being fully open about her plans.  \n   - Celeste pushing her beliefs onto her daughter was a big no-no. Part of learning and growing as a young adult is going after relationships and experiencing heartbreak. You can‚Äôt shield anyone from that, and that may not even be their experience.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - This book was fantastic in so many ways. As a whole, I 100% recommend it.  \n   - I cannot thank NetGalley and the publisher enough for the ARC in exchange for an honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an excellent book with strong character development, particularly for John, and relatable themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. While Celeste‚Äôs journey was compelling, her lack of therapy and her handling of Morgan‚Äôs future were areas that could have been improved.

It‚Äôs refreshing to see grown adults navigating life and relationships, proving that life doesn‚Äôt end at 40.  \n  - John is a quiet, nerdy man who carries himself with confidence, especially when it comes to Celeste. This balance of traits made him a compelling character.  \n  - Celeste‚Äôs relationship with her daughter, Morgan, was beautifully portrayed. Their fight and subsequent reconciliation felt authentic and well-written.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics and Communication:**  \n  - John and Celeste‚Äôs communication style was refreshing. They were honest and candid when necessary, but also held back at times in a way that felt very realistic and relatable.  \n  - The progression from fake dating to real feelings was executed well, with the emotional tension building naturally over the six weeks of the birding contest.  \n\n- **Themes and Unique Elements:**  \n  - The birding theme was a standout aspect of the story. While I‚Äôm not a birder myself, I appreciated the deep passion and perspective it brought to the narrative. I even learned a thing or two about birding!  \n  - The tropes‚Äîfake dating, making the ex jealous, divorcee/single mom, and the ‚Äúyou idiots love each other‚Äù dynamic‚Äîwere deployed effectively and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Resonance and Authenticity:**  \n  - Celeste‚Äôs struggle to find stability after her divorce and her fear of giving into her feelings for John added emotional depth to the story. Her journey felt genuine and relatable.  \n  - The story was warm, lovely, and enjoyable, with a perfect balance of humor, heart, and spice.  \n\n**Disliked:**  \n- I don‚Äôt really have any notes here. It was a very enjoyable, warm, and lovely story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartwarming and authentic exploration of love, self-discovery, and second chances.

I empathized with her daughter, Morgan, who often felt overshadowed by Celeste‚Äôs enthusiasm regarding college. Supporting characters like Chris, John‚Äôs best friend, and Linda and Maria, Celeste‚Äôs friends, add depth to the narrative. Chris‚Äôs supportive nature and meaningful conversations with John are particularly endearing, while Maria‚Äôs candidness about her ‚Äúrules‚Äù offers a refreshing perspective.

            "I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this story. While it initially seemed cute and fun, it had a unique depth that set it apart. The drama was handled maturely and realistically, which I appreciated. The quirky setting, especially the birding aspect, added to the charm. Although there was a third-act breakup, it was refreshingly free of miscommunication; the characters openly discussed their feelings and ended things amicably, even though they were both left feeling miserable.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the main characters, Celeste and John, both of whom grapple with personal baggage that leads to significant character growth. Even minor characters, like the woman who attends therapy and offers an apology, demonstrate development. The chemistry between Celeste and John was palpable, and I found myself rooting for their romance from the start. Their interactions had me giggling, swooning, and fanning myself‚Äîit's a testament to the author's skill in capturing chemistry.\n\nI also appreciated the casual representation of LGBT+ characters. Celeste's daughter is best friends with a nonbinary person, and their relationship is portrayed as completely normal. Additionally, Chris appears to be bisexual, dating Greg while also showing interest in women. This normalization of diverse identities is refreshing and should be the standard.\n\nThe spice in the story was enjoyable, but I was left disappointed by the absence of a final sex scene or an epilogue. Overall, it was a great read!"

It sounded super cute and fun, but it definitely had a little something special weaved in.  \n  - I liked that there was a bit of drama, but it was handled in a mature, realistic way. The setting provided the fun quirky stuff (BIRDING!!!!).  \n  - There was a third act breakup, but it was NOT due to miscommunication‚Äîthey talked about their feelings openly and cleanly broke up (despite them both being mutually miserable about it afterwards).  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I loved both the main characters, Celeste and John. They both have relationship and general life baggage to overcome, and I felt like we saw real character growth/development in both of them.  \n  - Even minor characters showed growth, like the other woman who went to therapy and apologized.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  - Their very obvious chemistry was my biggest compliment. I was rooting for them immediately and could see them falling in love. They had me giggling, swooning, and fanning myself.  \n  - I LOVE when authors can really nail down the chemistry between characters.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  - I loved the casual inclusion of LGBT+ characters. Her daughter is best friends with (and then dating) a nonbinary person, and it's portrayed as normal‚Äîa complete non-issue.  \n  - I'm pretty sure Chris is bi (was on a date with Greg but also showed interest in women throughout). Overall, great job on that front. Love the normalization‚Äîas it should be!  \n\n- **Spice and Ending:**  \n  - The spice was great!

His ability to identify birds by their calls adds a unique charm.  \n   - Celeste is fun, goofy, and adventurous, but her carelessness with John‚Äôs feelings towards the end was slightly frustrating.  \n\n- **Romance and Spice:**  \n   - The romance is mature (40+), with multiple explicit open-door scenes.  \n   - The intimate scenes are raunchy and well-written, with John‚Äôs ability to ‚Äútalk her through it‚Äù being a standout element.  \n   - However, the timing of some spicy scenes felt off, such as after a major emotional conflict with Celeste‚Äôs daughter, which disrupted the pacing.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The story felt a bit mechanical at times, with a lack of spontaneity in the romance.  \n   - The absence of an epilogue was disappointing, leaving the ending feeling abrupt.  \n\n- **Narration and Writing Style:**  \n   - The narration was well-done, and the writing style was engaging, making it a strong debut novel for the author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable read with a charming premise, lovable characters, and plenty of spice.

Throughout the book, Celeste pressures her daughter to enroll at NAU, only to learn at an art show‚Äîmore reminiscent of a graduation ceremony‚Äîthat her daughter has no intention of attending. It strains credibility that an involved mother like Celeste would be unaware of her daughter's true intentions or the relevant deadlines and payment plans.",

Celeste is on a post-divorce mission to say yes and try new things, and John becomes one of those new experiences. Their relationship evolves from fake dating to a casual arrangement, which, as expected in romance novels, doesn‚Äôt stay casual for long.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The fake dating premise is amusing, and the story explores themes of connection and personal growth. The romance is low-angst and features open-door scenes, making it a fun and lighthearted read.  \n\n- **Activities and Adventures:**  \n  The book includes a variety of activities that add charm and depth to the story. Birding plays a significant role, which I particularly enjoyed as someone from a family of casual birders. Beyond birding, there are scenes involving bowling, a costume party, and even a playful nod to the pottery scene from *Ghost* with some hanky panky in a woodshop. These moments highlight the fun and chemistry between Celeste and John.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Repetition:**  \n  While I enjoyed the story, I found the frequent mention of Celeste and John needing a connection with a person (and not being suited for casual sex) to be a bit preachy. It was a valid point, but the repetition made it feel overemphasized.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a very enjoyable read!

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I really enjoyed this book, which surprised me because I didn‚Äôt expect to. Initially, I wasn‚Äôt amused by the idea of a romance centered around birds, but this book truly embodies the saying, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt judge a book by its cover.‚Äù It‚Äôs one of my most memorable reads of the summer and possibly the year.  \n\n- **Character Development (Main Heroine):**  \n  What I loved most was the main heroine, a woman who had lived a full life. She came with the baggage of being a divorcee and a single parent, and I found her journey refreshing. It was inspiring to see a character rediscovering herself at a later age and still figuring things out.  \n\n- **Thematic Depth (Birding):**  \n  The birding aspect of the story was incredibly well-integrated. It wasn‚Äôt just a backdrop; it played a significant role in the narrative. I learned so much about birds just by reading this book, and it even inspired me to sit in my yard and listen to bird sounds as I wrote this review.  \n\n- **Relationships (Mother-Daughter Dynamic):**  \n  The relationship between the mother and daughter was a highlight. It felt authentic and relatable, especially as someone who remembers being a teenager and how exhausting it could be for a parent. Celeste‚Äôs struggles with her daughter resonated with me, and it added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Cultural References:**  \n  The story also reminded me of the Disney movie trope of rejecting parental expectations, like the line, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not throwing away my dreams, Dad, I‚Äôm throwing away yours.‚Äù While not exactly the same scenario, it evoked a similar sentiment, which I appreciated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful surprise, blending romance, self-discovery, and an unexpected love for birding into a memorable story. The relatable characters, especially the main heroine, and the authentic mother-daughter relationship made it stand out. It‚Äôs a book that not only entertained me but also left me with a newfound appreciation for birds.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The pacing is natural, as Celeste immerses herself in birding and uncovers a newfound passion. Their developing ‚Äúcasual‚Äù relationship during the competition adds both tension and depth to the narrative.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, particularly Celeste and John. Celeste, a 42-year-old English teacher who has been divorced for two years, embarks on a journey of self-discovery, determined to embrace new experiences. This leads her unexpectedly into John‚Äôs world. John is a complex character grappling with self-worth after a difficult relationship, feeling inadequate as he is. The friendships with Chris and Maria were also highlights for me. The chemistry between Celeste and John is palpable, and their choice to embrace their attraction results in some steamy moments. The emotional conflict is well-crafted, with John yearning for more as the competition concludes, while Celeste initially resists, wanting to maintain her independence. Celeste's grand gesture at John's first birding business event was charming and reminiscent of *Love Actually*.",

The book is one of the steamiest I've read, which surprised me, but it was well-executed.

I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in the steamy scenes and ended up skimming most of those parts.  \n\n- **Thematic Focus (Birding):**  \n   - A significant portion of the book is dedicated to birding, which aligns with the title, *Birding With Benefits*. I appreciated that a niche hobby like birding got its own book, and it added a unique element to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I really liked both main characters, Celeste and John. Their personalities and dynamics stood out to me and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n   - The cover is fantastic! It‚Äôs visually appealing and caught my attention.  \n\n- **Author‚Äôs Writing Style:**  \n   - I enjoyed the author‚Äôs writing style and would definitely read more books by them in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Birding With Benefits* is a steamy romance with a unique focus on birding, which I found refreshing. While the steamy content wasn‚Äôt my preference, I appreciated the well-developed characters and the author‚Äôs engaging writing style. The cover design is also a standout feature.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars  \n\n**Note:**  \nI received a complimentary copy of this book from Simon & Schuster Canada through NetGalley.

The Tucson contest cleverly brings Celeste and John together, despite their initial intentions to stay single. Their evolving feelings unfold naturally, creating an authentic and compelling narrative.",
            "Celeste Johanssen, a 42-year-old middle school language arts teacher and adventurous divorcee, is a well-crafted protagonist. Her relationship with her 17-year-old daughter, Morgan, adds depth as she navigates the challenge of balancing her expectations with her daughter's aspirations.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really enjoyed the characters in *Birding with Benefits*. Celesta, the protagonist, is recently divorced and on a journey to find herself, which made her relatable and engaging. Her interactions with John, who starts as a partner for a birding competition, felt natural and evolved organically. The inclusion of Celesta‚Äôs teenage daughter added depth and authenticity to the story, especially through their realistic dialogue.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance between Celesta and John begins as a friends-with-benefits situation and gradually develops into something more. The progression felt believable and well-paced. The spice scenes were well-written and complemented the plot rather than overshadowing it, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is plot-driven, with the romance and spice serving to enhance the narrative rather than dominate it. The birding competition provided a unique and refreshing backdrop for the story, making it stand out. The pacing was steady, and the plot kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Authenticity and Realism:**  \n  The dialogue between Celesta and her teenage daughter felt authentic and added a layer of realism to the story. This grounded the narrative and made the characters‚Äô experiences more relatable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Birding with Benefits* is a delightful summer read with well-developed characters, a unique plot, and a romance that feels genuine and engaging. The spice is tastefully integrated, and the story‚Äôs authenticity makes it a standout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I didn‚Äôt like how people tried to push her away from that, but by the end, her reasoning made sense because she was holding herself back due to fears from past relationships.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story explored themes of self-discovery and overcoming personal fears. The main character‚Äôs journey felt relatable, especially her struggle to break free from past traumas.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The birders in the story got a bit freaky, which added an interesting dynamic to the narrative.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I listened to this as an audiobook, and it‚Äôs hard for me to tell if I got tired of the book because of the story itself or because that‚Äôs just how I tend to feel with audiobooks in general.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a solid read with a relatable main character and an engaging exploration of self-discovery. While the audiobook format made it harder for me to fully connect, the story itself was meaningful and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Originality:**  \n  - The concept of the novel is really cute and unique, especially within a beloved trope. I haven‚Äôt come across a book that incorporates birding before, which made it stand out.  \n\n- **Character Chemistry:**  \n  - I enjoyed the chemistry between the characters. Their interactions were engaging and added to the story‚Äôs charm.  \n\n- **Character Authenticity (Age Representation):**  \n  - The characters are supposed to be in their 40s, but their actions often felt more like New Adult (NA) behavior. This inconsistency detracted from the enjoyment of reading about \"mature\" characters.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  - The first 70% of the book was strong and kept me invested. However, the latter part of the story fell off for me. The pacing and plot development in the final section felt weaker, and I found myself becoming more annoyed, particularly with Morgan and their relationship dynamics.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite the issues with the ending, this was almost a 5-star read for me. The strong start and unique concept made it memorable, but the weaker conclusion held it back.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had a lot of potential with its charming concept and engaging character chemistry. However, the inconsistent portrayal of mature characters and the weaker ending prevented it from being a fully satisfying read. It‚Äôs a solid 3.5-star book that could have been exceptional with a stronger finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars  \n\n*Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.*"

I particularly appreciated Celeste's relationship with her 17-year-old daughter, which added significant depth to her character. The introduction of her best friend Maria, a new mother grappling with the challenges of parenthood, was a thoughtful addition. It's refreshing to see characters in their early 40s navigating life with nearly grown children and the complexities of new motherhood. Initially, Celeste appears to fit the manic pixie dream girl trope, which was off-putting, but she evolves beyond that as the story unfolds. However, the inclusion of an Evil Ex trope felt clich√©d, reinforcing the notion of a single perfect partner and positioning Celeste as \"not like other girls.\"",

However, she evolves beyond that trope as the story progresses. The inclusion of an \"Evil Ex\" trope was disappointing, as it felt like a clich√© way to position Celeste as \"not like other girls\" and perpetuated the idea of a single perfect partner.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Tension:**  \n  The sexual tension between Celeste and John, her fake date and birding partner, is electric and well-written. The scenes before they have penetrative sex are particularly intense and well-crafted. Sarah T. Dubb excels at writing passionate, can't-keep-my-hands-off-you moments.  \n\n- **Balance of Story and Spice:**  \n  While there are a lot of sex scenes, the balance between the story and the spice feels just right. The narrative doesn‚Äôt get overshadowed by the steamy moments.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  I appreciated Celeste‚Äôs relationship with her 17-year-old daughter, which added depth to her character. The inclusion of her best friend Maria, a new mother struggling with the challenges of parenthood, was also a nice touch. It‚Äôs refreshing to see characters in their early 40s navigating life with almost-grown children and new parenthood.  \n\n- **Thematic Elements (Birding):**  \n  As a non-birder, I surprisingly enjoyed the birding aspect and wished there had been more of it. The most magical and well-written moments occurred during the birding competition, and I felt this element could have played a larger role in the narrative.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  Given the romcom cover, I expected more humor. While the book was enjoyable, it didn‚Äôt deliver as many laughs as I had hoped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a solid and very hot summer read. Despite a rocky start with some tropes I didn‚Äôt love, the story found its footing with strong character relationships, well-written romantic tension, and an engaging birding theme.

            "The story follows Celeste, who, after her divorce, decides to embrace a \"year of yes.\" She agrees to pose as a partner for John, a birdwatcher, resulting in a fake dating scenario. The clever twist of miscommunication regarding the nature of their partnership‚Äîromantic versus birding‚Äîadds an engaging layer to the plot. However, the stakes feel somewhat low and unrealistic, particularly John's quest to win a birding competition for credibility in wildlife science, which comes across as poorly researched.",
            "The characters in the story largely lack depth, with only Celeste and John experiencing minor growth. Their dynamic follows a predictable pattern: Celeste, the enthusiastic woman, and John, the composed man, learn from each other. Their communication stands out for its clarity, a refreshing change in a genre often driven by miscommunication. Interestingly, their third-act breakup stems from over-communication, adding a unique twist. However, the book leans heavily into sexual themes, with John being overly touchy and fixated on Celeste. The frequent mentions of Celeste biting her lower lip are both amusing and cringe-worthy. \n\nWhile the story attempts to engage with woke culture, it often feels forced, particularly with a friend group composed entirely of queer people of color, which comes across as unrealistic and tokenistic. The heroes and villains costume party, where Celeste and John dress as Hypatia and Indiana Jones, features a heavy-handed discussion on the historical roles of educated women and the ethics of archaeology, which feels out of place and overly preachy.",
            "The writing was average, featuring some cringe-worthy moments, like Celeste's frequent habit of tossing her hair into a messy bun. At times, it felt reminiscent of Wattpad fanfiction.",
            "While certain sections of the book, especially the competitive birdwatching scenes, were engaging, the overall experience fell flat. I found myself more captivated by the birds than the characters."

        "conclusion": "This book was a mixed bag. While it had some clever plot twists and moments of genuine humor, it fell short in character development, writing quality, and the integration of social commentary. The overly sexual content and forced representation detracted from the story rather than enhancing it. Ultimately, it was an average read that didn't leave a lasting impression.",

The miscommunication about the type of partner (romantic vs. birding) was a clever twist that worked well for the plot.\n   - The stakes were somewhat low and unrealistic, particularly John's need to win the birding competition to gain credibility in wildlife science, which felt poorly researched.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The writing was average, with some cringe-worthy moments, such as Celeste frequently \"throwing her hair into a messy bun.\" It felt reminiscent of Wattpad fanfiction at times.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters were mostly flat, with only Celeste and John showing minor growth. Their dynamic was predictable: Celeste, the \"excited woman,\" and John, the \"calm man,\" teaching each other life lessons.\n   - Their communication was refreshingly clear, especially in a genre where miscommunication often drives the plot. Their third-act breakup resulted from over-communication, which was a unique twist.\n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Content:**\n   - The book was overly sexual, with John being excessively touchy and fixated on Celeste.

            "This book presents a unique premise centered around birding, which I found both new and intriguing. The combination of fake dating and a bird-watching contest added an interesting dynamic to the narrative. The first half was fast-paced, engaging, and easy to follow, with clear chemistry between Celeste and John. Their individual traumas enriched their characters. However, the introduction of the \"Birding with Benefits\" plot in the second half felt off-putting and inconsistent with their maturity as adults, detracting from my enjoyment. This section was slower and less engaging, ultimately leading to my disappointment with the book.",
            "Celeste, the protagonist, begins as a relatable and likable character, enriched by her role as a divorced mom and teacher. However, in the second half of the story, her behavior shifts to become immature and pushy, diminishing my fondness for her. Additionally, her strained relationship with her daughter feels underdeveloped and concerning. I did appreciate the exploration of characters in their 40s navigating life's challenges, as this perspective is often overlooked in literature.",

The execution of the trope fell short, and the overall experience left me feeling unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a low to mid-range rating (e.g., 2.5/5 or 3/5)."

            "The book struggles with pacing, especially in the middle section, where it shifts from a fake romance to a friends-with-benefits scenario. The inclusion of three consecutive chapters dedicated to sex scenes felt excessive and interrupted the narrative flow. Additionally, the third-act breakup was poorly executed, exacerbating the pacing issues. However, the premise of a birding contest and the need for a partner was intriguing and initially engaging. The subplot involving Celeste and her daughter was particularly compelling, adding depth to the story.",
            "John's portrayal as a slow-birder presents an intriguing concept, yet it conflicts with the competitive birding premise, resulting in a lack of coherence in his character. Meanwhile, Celeste shows promise, but her development is overshadowed by an overemphasis on romantic and sexual elements.",
            "The book falls short of its promise to provide a compelling narrative about birding. The birding scenes are few and lack detail, prioritizing the characters' physical attraction over the activity itself. While the bird count at the beginning of each chapter is a nice touch, it fails to contribute meaningful insights into the world of birding.",
            "The book attempts to weave in numerous tropes, which ultimately dilutes their individual impact. The transition from a fake romance to a friends-with-benefits storyline feels forced and undermines the overall narrative.",
            "As an asexual ornithologist, I found the premise of this romance refreshing, particularly with relatable characters like a 40-year-old divorcee with nearly adult children. The struggle against social pressure to be in a relationship while healing from breakup trauma resonated deeply and added an engaging layer to the story."

John comes across as overly cautious, while Celeste‚Äôs enthusiasm sometimes overpowers others.  \n\n- **Romantic Connection:**  \n  I enjoyed the setup of the fake dating trope, which created a sweet meet-cute moment. However, I felt the author missed an opportunity to deepen their romantic connection by not including more meaningful conversations about their past relationships.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The bird references during the sex scenes felt very cringey and took me out of the moment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its charming moments, particularly with the fake dating trope and the initial setup, the slow pacing, underdeveloped romantic connection, and awkward writing choices detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

            "John is a standout character‚Äîan introverted, thoughtful, and respectful \"cinnamon roll\" with a passion for nature, woodworking, and bird-watching. His backstory, which includes leaving grad school to support his family and grappling with feelings of inadequacy, adds significant depth to his character. His teaching moments about bird-watching are both endearing and engaging, and his attempts to communicate through writing during emotional scenes are relatable and well-executed. However, his choice to engage in casual intimacy, despite his values, slightly diminishes his likability.\n\nIn contrast, Celeste is frustrating and often unlikable, coming across as whiny, selfish, and overly reliant on profanity. Her views on divorce and self-discovery, particularly as a parent, are off-putting. Her insistence on casual intimacy, even when John offers emotional support, is disappointing. While there are sweet moments in the romance between John and Celeste, particularly in their shared love for nature, the excessive focus on physical attraction detracts from the emotional depth of their relationship. The absence of non-sexual intimacy, like cuddling, is a missed opportunity to showcase their connection.\n\nMost supporting characters are unlikable, especially John's best friend, who embodies a middle-aged manchild. Breena and Linda stand out as exceptions, showing potential to be more compelling with additional development. Morgan, Celeste's teenage daughter, is also unlikable, despite her warm rapport with John. Overall, the story presents intriguing characters but struggles with balance in its romantic and emotional elements.",
            "The vivid descriptions of nature and bird-watching provided a unique and educational perspective that was truly enjoyable. However, the excessive profanity and emphasis on casual intimacy felt jarring and out of place. Additionally, the themes of divorce and self-discovery were addressed in a manner that came across as shallow and unrelatable.",
            "The pacing of the book was slow, leading me to contemplate abandoning it multiple times. While there were engaging moments, like John's bird-watching lessons, they were too infrequent. Additionally, the heavy emphasis on physical attraction and casual intimacy rendered certain sections repetitive and unappealing."

The main characters (MCs) had conflicts but worked through them maturely, engaging in healthy conversations.  \n\n- **Themes and Setting (Birds/Birding):**  \n  - The birds and birding elements were a nice backdrop for the story without being overwhelming. It added a unique touch without bogging down the plot with excessive details.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  - The side characters felt fleshed out, with their own lives and motivations. They didn‚Äôt feel like NPCs (non-player characters) who existed solely to advance the plot.  \n\n- **Romantic and Spicy Scenes:**  \n  - The spice was a fun surprise‚Äîwho knew birding could be so steamy? There were some enjoyable spicy scenes, balanced with healthy conversations about boundaries and communication. These discussions didn‚Äôt ‚Äúkill the mood‚Äù but enhanced it.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Focus:**  \n  - Once the ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù part of the story picked up, it dominated much of the middle plot. While I enjoyed the initial buildup and tension, the focus on spicy scenes and dialogue became repetitive for me. This might appeal to some readers, but it lost some of the story‚Äôs spark for me.  \n\n- **Subplot (FMC‚Äôs Teenage Daughter):**  \n  - The plotline involving the female main character‚Äôs (FMC) teenage daughter felt underdeveloped. It escalated and resolved too quickly. While sweet and complex, it didn‚Äôt add much to the story for me.  \n\n- **Character Growth and Immaturity:**  \n  - There were occasional immature moments from the characters, but they were on self-discovery journeys and actively acknowledged their baggage. This made their flaws somewhat forgivable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this novel as a light summer romance, especially as someone who loves birds and mature relationship dynamics. While the focus on spicy scenes and the underdeveloped subplot with the FMC‚Äôs daughter were minor drawbacks, the healthy communication, unique birding backdrop, and well-rounded side characters made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The plot seems to validate the criticisms Celeste received from her ex-husband and daughter, who labeled her as excessive.

I would have liked to see more depth in Celeste's character, particularly regarding her marriage, her role as a mother, and her ex-husband's influence. This would have better illustrated her hesitance toward serious relationships and her desire to embrace new experiences. While I don't mind steamy novels, I was surprised by the explicit content.

No dire situations or dramatic upbringings. That was refreshing.  \n   - John was interesting, but not so interesting that I needed to get into his head. I could have used more of Celeste; not more quirkiness but more heft regarding her marriage, her role as a mom, her ex's role as a husband. I think that would have better shown her reticence about a serious relationship and her desire to basically do a \"year of yes\" to new experiences.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Point of View:**  \n   - I'm a fan of 3rd person, multi-point of view novels. This is one I think would have benefited from a 1st person POV, specifically Celeste.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Content:**  \n   - I'm not averse to steamy novels, but I just didn‚Äôt EXPECT all the explicit sex. After a few go-rounds, it became more redundant and less interesting.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n   - Would I recommend this book?

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - This novel is perfect for fans of ‚ÄúThe Big Year‚Äù and those who enjoy the fake-dating rom-com trope.  \n  - The story leans heavily into internal conflict rather than external, which might appeal to some readers but feels drawn out over time.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - The main characters are immediately endearing yet frustrating in their own ways, as they serve as their own obstacles.  \n  - The side characters, particularly Maria, a new mom, add depth and likability to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The meet-cute happens right at the beginning and is entertaining, with a fun mix-up.  \n  - The pacing slows as the story progresses, with the internal conflicts feeling prolonged and repetitive.  \n  - The focus shifts from birding action to bedroom action, which might disappoint readers expecting more of the former.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Highlights:**  \n  - An early scene where the protagonist, Celeste, helps Maria put new motherhood into perspective is particularly impactful and compelling.  \n  - A later mirror scene where Maria helps Celeste in a similar way is sweet and satisfying.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Critique:**  \n  - I enjoyed the novel overall but felt it lacked depth and development in certain areas.  \n  - The first half was stronger (four stars), while the second half felt weaker (three stars).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a charming read with endearing characters and some standout emotional moments, particularly involving the side character Maria. However, the pacing slows in the second half, and the shift in focus from birding to romance may not satisfy all readers. While enjoyable, the story could have benefited from more depth and development.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- First half: 4 stars  \n- Second half: 3 stars  \n- Overall: 3.5 stars"

            "The main characters were refreshingly less irritating than typical romance protagonists, which was a relief.

Meanwhile, John's character development was virtually nonexistent, which was disappointing.",

            "I find it frustrating when books rely on the main character's child to provide the wisdom needed to resolve third-act conflicts. It's not a child's role to solve adult problems; grown-ups should address their own issues. I don't view this resolution as a happy ending, as the characters are fundamentally different and lack the communication skills necessary to support each other effectively.",

The cover design was intriguing enough to draw me in.  \n\n- **Author's Passion and Themes:**  \n  The author is clearly passionate about birds and birding, which is evident in certain scenes, like the one where a character asks, \"Tell me what bird sounds you think of while you get a bj.\" This unique theme adds a quirky touch to the story.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters felt more YA-ish in their development, but this is undeniably an adult book. Their personalities and interactions leaned toward a younger vibe, which was a bit unexpected given the mature content.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is light-hearted and includes familiar tropes like fake dating, secrets, emotional moments, and life-building elements. However, the pacing starts off slower, with most of the action kicking in around the 60% mark.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Expectations:**  \n  I thought the fake dating trope would make me love this book, but overall, it was just alright. It didn‚Äôt fully meet my expectations, but it was still an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a light-hearted, quirky read with a unique birding theme and a mix of familiar tropes like fake dating and emotional growth. While the pacing starts slow and the characters feel more YA-ish, it‚Äôs still an entertaining adult novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The tension building throughout the story was particularly well-done and kept me invested.\n\n- **Romantic Development and Emotional Depth:**  \n  While the characters were in a \"friends with benefits\" situation, their feelings were clearly developing. However, I felt there was a lack of meaningful dialogue and inner thoughts to explore this emotional progression. This made their connection feel somewhat underdeveloped.\n\n- **Dialogue and Character Maturity:**  \n  The dialogue, when present, often felt immature and didn‚Äôt align with the age of the characters. This detracted from the overall believability and depth of their interactions.\n\n- **Balance of Spice and Substance:**  \n  The abundance of spicy scenes started to overshadow the plot and character development, making the story feel a bit flat in the latter half. A better balance between these scenes and the emotional or narrative depth could have elevated the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book and found more to love than critique.

I was hoping for a more balanced approach that focused less on physical intimacy and more on emotional or intellectual connections.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the characters and their relationship development, the novel ultimately fell short of my expectations. It was a predictable, light-hearted romance with an overemphasis on bedroom scenes, which didn‚Äôt align with my preference for a nerdier, less explicit story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The unique premise was refreshing and added a fun twist to the story.  \n\n- **Tropes and Plot Devices:**  \n  The inclusion of the fake dating trope was a highlight for me. It added an engaging dynamic to the characters' relationship.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  Most of the book was adorable, with a lighthearted and charming tone that made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  When the spice hits, it hits hard! The romantic moments were intense and well-executed, adding a layer of excitement to the story.  \n\n- **Memorability:**  \n  While I enjoyed the journey, the book will likely not stick with me in the long term. It was just okay by the end.  \n\n- **Content Balance:**  \n  I felt there could have been a bit more bird content. The birding theme was a unique aspect, but I wished it was explored more deeply.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this rom-com was a fun and lighthearted read with a unique birding contest premise and an engaging fake dating trope. While the romantic moments were intense and enjoyable, the book didn‚Äôt leave a lasting impression, and I wished for more focus on the birding theme.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The writing style is engaging, as it \"really got going\" once the story picked up momentum.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are \"likable and fairly well rounded,\" with well-justified core conflicts that add depth to their personalities.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is \"crazy steamy\" and gains significant momentum as it progresses, making it an engaging read. However, the absence of an epilogue left me wishing for more closure.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is a delightful blend of charm, depth, and steaminess, with well-developed characters and a compelling plot. While the pacing and character conflicts are strong, the lack of an epilogue slightly detracts from the overall satisfaction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

He‚Äôs quiet, strong yet soft, and takes his time, which made him the primary reason I continued reading.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The birding competition, a central element of the plot, fell flat for me. It didn‚Äôt deliver the excitement or engagement I expected.  \n  - The story includes detailed references to bird wildlife, such as behaviors, lifestyles, and nesting skills, which added a unique touch but didn‚Äôt fully compensate for the lackluster plot.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The use of bird puns like ‚ÄúTweethearts‚Äù was playful and lighthearted, adding a whimsical tone to the story. However, this didn‚Äôt entirely offset the discomfort I felt with Celeste‚Äôs character.  \n\n- **Heat Level and Content Warnings:**  \n  - The book contains explicit scenes, which may appeal to some readers but felt out of place given the juvenile tone of Celeste‚Äôs character.  \n  - Content warnings include mentions of babies/newborns, cancer, and infidelity, which are handled within the narrative but may be triggering for some readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential and some redeeming elements, such as John‚Äôs character and the playful bird references, it ultimately fell short for me. Celeste‚Äôs juvenile behavior and the underdeveloped plot, particularly the birding competition, made it difficult to fully enjoy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars."

The story became tedious as it went on, and by the end, I was just waiting for it to be over.  \n\n- **Potential and Missed Opportunities:**  \n  There are elements of good here, but the execution fell short. Maybe it needed a different pacing or a completely different sequence of events to make it work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a strong opening and some promising elements, the rushed relationship dynamics, lack of meaningful exploration of the characters' differences, and poor pacing ultimately made it a tedious read. By the end, I was eager for it to conclude.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2/5 stars."

Instead of supporting her daughter during a career-defining moment, she disrupts it, making it about herself.  \n   - The daughter is portrayed as a thoughtful, intelligent character trying to navigate her life while dealing with her mother‚Äôs chaos.
