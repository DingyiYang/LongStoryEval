            "This novel effectively explores the 'Butterfly Effect,' demonstrating how a seemingly minor event, like a flaw in a child's flotation device, can lead to significant disruptions in family and community harmony. It thoughtfully addresses key themes, including coping with grief, the tension between capitalist and alternative lifestyles, the effects of trauma and PTSD on relationships, and the quest for meaning in life despite physical disfigurement. The narrative raises important moral and ethical questions, such as the implications of lying, the consequences of undermining a partner's authority for the sake of a child, and the intrusive nature of the press and social media. The author employs strong metaphors, notably the butterflies that a young girl believes embody her deceased sister, serving as a poignant symbol of her grief.

Once a prosperous couple united in their dreams and careers, they now find their world in disarray. To facilitate a move, they head to New Hampshire to renovate and sell Marie’s grandfather’s estate. Their surviving children—Brendon, Hannah, and Pen, Bee’s twin—each cope with their grief in unique ways. The estate is home to Davina, a disfigured war veteran and nurse beloved by the community for her work as a medicine woman and midwife. Although she has a rightful place there due to a promise made by Marie’s grandfather, Leo and Marie wish to evict her to expedite the sale. The narrative unfolds into a compelling and poignant exploration of strong personalities, deep emotions, and the consequences of nearly irreversible decisions.",

Rather than succumbing to anger, she channeled her skills into building a meaningful life and enriching the lives of others.",

I’m now a fan and just downloaded another of her books.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The novel opens by introducing readers to a family who have recently lost an 8-year-old girl, Bee, to accidental drowning. Leo and Marie Egide, the parents, were once prosperous and aligned in their dreams, hopes, and jobs, but their world falls apart after the accident.  \n   - To subsidize a move, they travel to New Hampshire to fix up and sell Marie’s grandfather’s estate. Their remaining children, Brendon, Hannah, and Pen (Bee’s twin), are also grieving in their own ways.  \n   - On the estate lives Davina, a disfigured war veteran and nurse, who is loved by the town for her role as a medicine woman and midwife. She lives there by a promise from Marie’s grandfather, but Leo and Marie want her gone to sell the property.  \n   - The story evolves into a fascinating, painful, and redeeming tale of strong personalities, emotions, and almost irrevocable actions.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The author’s character development is exceptional. Each chapter is told from the perspective of one of the main characters, allowing the reader to understand their thoughts, motives, and reasoning.  \n   - I mostly loved each character, though sometimes their behaviors were abhorrent, which emphasized their humanity.  \n   - My favorite character was Davina, whose early life was beautiful but whose burn injuries caused significant loss. Despite this, she didn’t waste time on anger and instead used her skills to make a life and enrich others.  \n\n- **Emotional and Visual Engagement:**  \n   - As a reader, I could visualize the scenery: the power of the Merrimack River, the expansive forest full of resources, and the home life of a grieving family trying to move forward.  \n   - I could feel the emotions of the family, the townspeople’s reverence for Davina, the young love between Hannah and Rock, Pen’s childhood inquisitiveness, and Brendon’s gnawing guilt.  \n\n- **Themes and Relationships:**  \n   - The novel explores family as the most complicated relationship on earth, delving into grief, guilt, and redemption.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Book Club Suitability:**  \n   - This is an excellent read for a book club, with discussion questions provided at the end of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSuzanne Redfearn has crafted a deeply emotional and visually immersive story that explores grief, family dynamics, and redemption. The multi-perspective narrative and rich character development make this one of my favorite books this year. I highly recommend it, especially for book clubs.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, as the story unfolds, the tension within the small community intensifies, marked by escalating antagonism and a palpable sense of impending danger. Centered on Marie Egide and her family, who are mourning the loss of Bee after a tragic accident, the plot follows their journey to New Hampshire to sell an inherited property and start anew. Complications arise when they encounter Davina Lister, the “River Witch,” who claims the land was given to her by Marie’s grandfather. The premise thoughtfully explores themes of grief, personal values, and happiness through the interconnected lives of its characters.",

The multiple points of view and short chapters hinder the flow and development of certain situations, making the story feel overwhelming at times.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The novel revolves around Marie Egide and her family, who are grieving the loss of Bee after a tragic accident. They travel to New Hampshire to a property Marie has inherited, intending to sell it and start anew. However, complications arise when they encounter Davina Lister, the “River Witch,” who believes the land was given to her by Marie’s grandfather.  \n   - The premise is thoughtful, exploring themes of grief, personal values, and happiness through the lives of multiple characters.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Marie is portrayed as a struggling, hard-to-like character, while her daughters, Pen and Hannah, are charming and endearing.  \n   - Davina is a magnetic and complex character, embodying a wise woman/fairytale archetype. She carries her own burdens and adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Themes:**  \n   - The portrayal of the Egide family’s grief is well-executed, conveying the weight of their loss and how their grief evolves over time.  \n   - The novel examines what brings happiness and personal value, particularly through Davina’s perspective.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The multiple points of view and very short chapters initially make the book confusing and disrupt the flow. Some situations feel underdeveloped due to the fragmented structure.  \n   - Despite this, the tension and atmosphere in the small community grow palpably as antagonism and anger escalate, creating a sense of impending danger.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Works:**  \n   - While the book has many strengths, it doesn’t reach the same level as the author’s previous work, *Hadley and Grace*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a thoughtful exploration of grief, personal values, and happiness, with powerful scenes and a compelling premise. The characters, particularly Davina, are well-drawn and engaging, though Marie’s unlikeability may be a drawback for some readers. The multiple points of view and short chapters hinder the flow and development of certain situations, making the story feel overwhelming at times. Despite these flaws, the growing tension and atmospheric storytelling are commendable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded up."

            "The story follows Marie Egide and her family as they seek a fresh start after a tragic accident by moving to her late grandfather’s house in Merrimack County, New Hampshire. Their plan to spend the summer preparing the house for sale is disrupted when Marie discovers Divina Lister, a returning army veteran, living in a cabin on the property. Divina asserts that Marie’s grandfather permitted her to stay indefinitely, leading to a tense conflict between the two. A fire in the surrounding timberland sets off a chain of events that compels both women to confront their past traumas and ultimately find common ground.",
            "Marie is a determined advocate for her rights, having diligently maintained her property. Divina, known as “the river witch” by locals, is a multifaceted character grappling with PTSD and grief. Meanwhile, Marie’s daughter Penelope, wise beyond her years, finds comfort in the belief that her sister Phoebe’s spirit endures in butterflies.",
            "This narrative delves into themes of grief, loss, PTSD, and the significance of learning from our mistakes. It underscores that a single misstep does not define a person's character and emphasizes the importance of seeking help to cope with trauma. The story powerfully illustrates the value of forgiveness and the potential for finding common ground, even amidst hostility.",
            "This book is emotionally resonant, prompting readers to reflect on how they might navigate similar situations. The writing style evokes the emotional depth and sensitivity of Catherine Ryan Hyde. Additionally, Penelope’s connection to butterflies adds a touching and sweet dimension to the narrative."

        "conclusion": "*Where Butterflies Wander* by the author is a thought-provoking and emotionally rich novel that delves into themes of grief, forgiveness, and healing. The conflict between Marie and Divina serves as a catalyst for both characters to confront their pasts and find a way forward. The narrative is both heartwarming and poignant, with a strong message about the importance of empathy and understanding. It’s a perfect choice for readers who enjoy emotionally charged stories similar to those by Catherine Ryan Hyde.",

            "The story follows the Egide family as they escape to a New Hampshire estate following a family tragedy. There, they meet Davina, a mysterious river witch who claims the cabin was a gift from Marie's grandfather. The narrative delves into themes of grief, family dynamics, and societal rejection, culminating in a tense standoff between the family and Davina.

Marie is determined to sell the estate and move forward, while her daughters, Hannah and Pen, hold opposing views on Davina.

It beautifully portrays the idea that when we lose someone, they are not entirely gone, as seen through the symbolism of butterflies and the presence of Bee. The emotional depth resonated with me, especially the portrayal of how each person copes with loss differently, whether in the right or wrong way.  \n\n- **Character Development and Multiple POVs:**  \n  The story features multiple points of view, which initially made it a bit challenging to keep track of the characters. However, as the story progressed, I found my bearings and appreciated the insights into each character's thoughts and perspectives. The characters grow throughout the narrative, and my favorites were Penelope and Davina.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was slow at times, but I felt it suited the overall theme of the story. The short chapters kept me engaged and added to the sense of drifting along a river, which mirrored the emotional journey of the characters.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n  The writing style was immersive, and the layers of the story were well-crafted. The atmosphere felt reflective and poignant, making it a beautiful read that I would highly recommend to others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a deeply moving and beautifully written novel that explores grief, loss, and the different ways people navigate tragedy.

The book itself was great, however, left me wanting a little bit more. I think this is due to the big expectations I had from hearing such great things!  \n\n- **Character Development and Complexity:**  \n  This novel follows so many different characters (although they are all in the same family besides Davina), that it took me a while to remember who was who and what their role was in the family. Davina and her loving personality were definitely my favorite character.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  I felt like some parts of the story dragged on, while others were glossed over way too quickly. In my opinion, there were a few parts that could have been explored more, such as the ending, which ended far too abruptly.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  Even though I felt it lacked a few things, the novel beautifully covers grief & loss as well as found family.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a great novel with strong emotional themes, but it fell slightly short of my high expectations due to pacing issues and an abrupt ending. Despite these flaws, it was an enjoyable read that resonated with me on a deeper level.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars rounded up.  \n\nThank you NetGalley & Lake Union Publishing for the opportunity to read this ARC!"

I wanted a \"happily ever after\" where everyone ends up together.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution:**  \n  - Not every storyline was fully closed out, which impacted my overall satisfaction with the book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n  - The book was a quick read, and I did enjoy it overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I liked the book a little more than a 4-star read, it didn’t quite reach 4.5 stars for me. The character development was strong, with one character redeeming themselves by the end. However, the ending didn’t fully align with my expectations, and some unresolved storylines left me wanting more. Despite these points, it was an enjoyable and quick read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Liked it a little more than 4 stars but not enough for 4.5 stars."

In contrast, Davina, the river witch, emerged as a lovable and complex character. Her kindness and struggles with PTSD made her stand out, and I admired her resilience.

However, as the narrative unfolded, it became clear that this structure added nuance and depth to the book. Experiencing the world through various lenses—from Pen's innocent viewpoint to the complexities of Davina's mind—enriched the story and deepened my understanding of the characters' motives and thoughts.",

The central themes of loss and resilience are poignantly illustrated through the characters' journeys from denial to acceptance. It explores the struggles and emotions that lead to rediscovering one's identity through the power of community and togetherness, particularly embodied in Davina's character. Davina emerges as a remarkable symbol of strength and hope, her kindness and forgiving perspective on life, despite her many losses, leaving a profound impact.

This understated approach is what makes the story truly charming."

Life seldom unfolds with the dramatic force of an action-packed novel; instead, it's more of a novel woven from small, mundane moments that mostly make sense when examined in reverse.\n\n- **Themes and Character Development:**  \n   - This is not a story about the hero and the villain. It's a story about the complexity of human nature and how there are always two sides to everything.  \n   - The predominant theme of loss and resilience is beautifully captured in each of the characters, from denial to acceptance.  \n   - It is a journey of navigating struggles and emotions to find again a sense of who you are through the power of community and togetherness, all encapsulated beautifully through Davina's character.  \n   - Davina stands out as a marvel of strength and a literal beacon of light. Her kindness and forgiving way of looking at the world, despite all her losses, left a lasting impression.

It is rich and engaging, immersing readers in the characters' complex lives. However, the philosophical reflections of the eight-year-old character, while intriguing, come across as implausibly mature and detract from the narrative's realism.",

The middle-aged woman living in a cabin, deeply scarred by her past, possesses a magical ability to read others and create healing potions. The interactions between the children and this woman form the narrative's heart, showcasing unexpected connections and personal growth.",
            "The narrative is engaging and holds the reader's interest, though it has its flaws. While the author's effort to explore profound philosophical themes is admirable, it ultimately lacks the depth needed to fully resonate with the audience.",

While the philosophical depth attributed to the children detracts from the realism, the engrossing plot and rich themes make it a worthwhile read. The story’s setting and character interactions create a beautiful yet conflicted world that keeps readers engaged.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4 stars."

Grief and loss are central themes, though the death is not depicted in graphic detail.",

While Marie, the mother, is somewhat difficult to empathize with despite her backstory, Penelope, Hannah, and Davina are incredibly relatable. Leo comes across as a bit bland, and Brendon grapples with his own challenges. I found it hard to believe that Hannah, despite her maturity, was permitted to respond to Juliet’s letters, especially given her deception about her age. Her articulate reflections on love, a subject she has no real experience with, felt unrealistic.",

That said, I had no trouble finishing the book.\n\n- **Format and Accessibility:**  \n  The book is included in Kindle Unlimited, offering both text and audio options. The audio version featured six different narrators for the various points of view (POVs): Marie, Penelope, Hannah, Leo, Brendon, and Davina. Little Penelope’s voice was especially adorable. However, I’m not a fan of Kate Rudd as a narrator (she voiced Marie), as her inflections and timing felt odd to me.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  The story is told through multiple POVs, with everything written in first person/present tense, except for a letter in the Prologue set in 2002. The chapters are listed numerically, and the Table of Contents indicates the POV, which is also included as a header at each chapter/POV change.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are complex, with layered personalities and situations. Marie, the mother, was a little hard to like, even with insight into her personal story. Penelope, Hannah, and Davina were extremely likable, while Leo felt a bit vanilla, and Brendon had some issues. I found it a stretch that Hannah, despite her maturity, was allowed to answer Juliet’s letters, especially since she lied about her age. Her eloquent writing on topics like love, which she had no personal experience in, felt unrealistic.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The book touches on themes like physical attraction and love, which could have been explored further. For instance, it made me think about how relationships evolve when people change physically over time, like gaining weight or aging. The discussion questions included in the Kindle copy were thought-provoking and encouraged deeper reflection.\n\n- **World-Building and Details:**  \n  I was curious about the pronunciation of the family’s last name, Egides, which wasn’t clearly explained. Additionally, I was a bit bothered that the reason Davina and her mother fled from her father was never fully explained, even though it’s mentioned early on.\n\n- **Author’s Insights:**  \n  The Author’s Note, which wasn’t included in the audio, provided interesting background on the inspiration for the story.

The story relies heavily on dialogue, leaving little room for descriptive details about the setting.  \n   - By the end of the book, I had no clear mental image of the characters or the places in the story, which was a drawback.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its emotional depth, compelling characters, and intricate narrative structure. While the lack of imagery and world-building was a minor disappointment, the writing style, story, and themes made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n8.9/10"

            "The book introduces several intriguing plot points but ultimately leaves too many loose ends unresolved. \n\n1. Davina’s family secret feels more like a backstory than a pivotal element, lacking any meaningful resolution.  \n2.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Marie Egide, who is trying to rebuild her family after a tragic loss by selling her grandfather's home and starting anew. However, her plans are disrupted by Davina, a war veteran and local healer known as \"the river witch,\" who claims lifetime rights to the land. The conflict escalates as the town sides with Davina, and Marie struggles with her growing resentment, especially when her daughters begin to find emotional and physical healing through Davina. The novel explores themes of grief, healing, family secrets, and community dynamics.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I found it challenging to relate to most of the characters, as they felt inconsistent at times. Marie's journey of coping with loss and her evolving feelings toward Davina were central, but her character didn't resonate deeply with me. Davina, as the enigmatic \"river witch,\" was intriguing but could have been more fleshed out. The daughters' healing process added emotional depth, but their development felt secondary to the main conflict.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The novel is described as a \"heartbreaking tale,\" and it does deliver on emotional weight, particularly in exploring grief and the complexities of healing. However, it didn't grip me as strongly as the author's previous work, *In An Instant*, which I loved. While it was an interesting read, it didn't evoke the same level of connection or emotional investment.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  The writing was engaging enough to keep me interested, but the pacing felt uneven at times. The resolution of the family's secrets and the central conflict was satisfying, though the journey to get there didn't hold my attention as much as I had hoped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Where Butterflies Wander* is a decent read for those seeking a story about grief, healing, and family secrets. While it didn't captivate me as much as the author's previous work, it still offers an emotional and thought-provoking narrative. If you enjoy heart-wrenching tales with complex characters and community dynamics, this might be worth your time.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The novel centers on the Egide family as they grapple with a profound loss during a summer in a small New Hampshire town, seeking healing. The main conflict arises when Marie decides to evict Davina, a war veteran residing on their property, creating a rift within the family and the community. Themes of grief, family turmoil, and moral dilemmas are prevalent throughout the narrative. Marie’s grief and anger impede her children’s healing, while Davina’s kindness and resilience starkly contrast with Marie’s selfishness. A dramatic twist occurs when Brendon, Marie’s son, burns down Davina’s cabin without facing any repercussions, leaving this plot point feeling unresolved and unsatisfying. The pacing is steady, with short chapters and multiple perspectives that enhance the flow of the story. The tone is emotional and reflective, effectively capturing the complexities of grief and family dynamics.",
            "Marie is a deeply flawed character, driven by grief and anger, which makes her hard to empathize with despite her tragic circumstances. In contrast, Davina, Hannah, and Penelope emerge as the most likable characters, with Davina particularly shining through her kindness and strength. Brendon's abrupt shift from a selfish, entitled child to a more empathetic individual feels somewhat unrealistic. Leo, the father, comes across as bland, while Hannah's maturity and eloquence seem exaggerated for her age.",
            "This beautifully written novel features multiple perspectives and short chapters, resulting in a quick and engaging read. The first-person present tense narration, along with various narrators in the audiobook, enhances the storytelling's depth. Additionally, the Author’s Note and discussion questions in the Kindle version offer valuable context and reflection opportunities."

The novel’s pacing and writing style made it an engaging read, though certain plot points, like Brendon’s lack of consequences and Davina’s unresolved backstory, left room for improvement.

After the tragic loss of their daughter, she and her husband, Leo, plan to sell both the inherited property and their current home to finance a new one. However, upon visiting the property, they find a cabin occupied by Davina, a scarred veteran who has lived there for over 20 years with Marie’s grandfather's permission. Tension escalates when Marie attempts to evict Davina, resulting in Davina's arrest and the cabin being set ablaze by Brendan, leaving her homeless. A pivotal moment occurs when Davina selflessly saves Brendan’s dog from a trap, sacrificing a finger in the process.

            "The book features several intriguing plot moments, yet the two main storylines—the family's grief and Davina's struggles—feel disjointed, as if they were hastily combined. Neither narrative achieves a satisfying resolution: the family's sorrow lingers, Davina's journey culminates in abuse, and even Bingo the dog faces a tragic fate.",
            "The alternating points of view offer valuable insights into the characters, but they can feel disjointed and chaotic. Marie, in particular, appears more as a villain than a grieving mother, which undermines the emotional depth of her character. While Davina's wisdom is endearing, her storyline feels disconnected from the main themes, making it seem more appropriate for a different book.",

One group follows the tormented family of Marie, Leo, Brendon, Penelope, and Hannah as they navigate the loss of their daughter, sister, and twin, Phoebe. The other group focuses on Davina, a river witch, veteran, and mother who has also experienced the heartache of losing a daughter."

Davina is endearing in her wisdom, but her storyline feels disconnected from the main themes and seems more suited to a different book.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  The book has many interesting plot moments, but the two storylines (the family’s grief and Davina’s struggles) feel like separate stories that were merged together. Neither storyline reaches a satisfying resolution. The family’s grief remains unresolved, Davina’s arc ends with her being abused, and even Bingo the dog suffers an unfortunate fate.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While I didn’t hate the book, the lack of resolution left me feeling unsatisfied with the ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents an intriguing premise and explores complex themes, but the execution falls short due to messy POVs, disjointed storylines, and unresolved endings.

            "The short chapters and multiple perspectives create a fragmented narrative that can be confusing. The story culminates in an unlikely happily-ever-after that feels contrived and unsatisfying. Numerous unrealistic and illogical elements detract from the story's believability, particularly the drowning incident involving Bee. At eight years old, she should have been able to swim without floaties, especially since her family owns a pool. It's also hard to believe that her brother, sitting nearby, wouldn’t have heard her struggling. Additionally, Marie's decision to buy out her sister and cousins to retain control of her grandfather’s house—despite not visiting it in 22 years—strains credulity. Given the family's financial situation and the distance from Connecticut to New Hampshire, this choice seems even more implausible. Their plan to sell the New Hampshire house to buy a new one also lacks logic, as selling their current home in Connecticut would have made more sense.",

The narrative feels overly convoluted, burdened by too many subplots and unresolved issues, leading to frustration and disappointment.

Her immaturity and selfishness, exemplified by her desire to expose Davina's secret without considering the implications, rendered her unlikable. Similarly, Brandon was hard to sympathize with, displaying irrational anger and making poor choices, such as his reckless plan to burn down Davina's cabin, which he justified with flawed reasoning that bordered on psychopathic behavior.

The narrative felt surface-level and lacked depth, especially for a story involving the loss of a child.  \n\n- **Plot and Realism:**  \n  The plot reads like a Hallmark movie, only worse.

I’m glad I didn’t pay anything for it, as it was offered free on Amazon Prime.  \n\n- **Commitment to Finishing:**  \n  Despite my dissatisfaction, I finished the book because I always complete what I start.

            "The premise of a mystery-thriller featuring a 'river witch' was intriguing, but the execution ultimately fell short. The story lacked authenticity, despite its contemporary New Hampshire setting. Resolutions felt overly convenient, with many elements left unexplained or poorly addressed. The treatment of the dog was particularly frustrating, serving more as a plot device than a meaningful aspect of the narrative. Additionally, background characters were unjustly punished for crimes they didn’t commit, while the true perpetrator faced minimal consequences.",

Brendon, the middle child, began with a compelling guilt arc but ultimately devolved into rage and entitlement. Penelope, the youngest, had some relevant chapters, but others felt like filler. Hannah, the oldest, contributed little to the overall narrative. Marie, the mother, was hateful, contradictory, and self-centered, showing no significant growth by the end. Leo, the husband, was overly dependent on others and only defended his family once, in a moment of anger. Davina's reasoning was often nonsensical, and her actions, especially concerning her children, were questionable.",
