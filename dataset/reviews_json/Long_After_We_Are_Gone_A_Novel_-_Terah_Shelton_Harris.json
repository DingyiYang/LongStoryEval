            "The ending features some contrived moments of reconciliation and faith that feel forced. Nonetheless, fans of the genre may still find the overall resolution enjoyable. The storytelling follows a predictable formula, lacking in inspiration and creativity. It adheres to a standard structure without offering any notable enhancements in characterization or thematic depth. Additionally, the integration of real-life research and examples could have been more effectively executed, possibly through a footnote approach akin to that in *Chain-Gang All Stars*.",
            "The characters, especially Tokey and Mance, lack depth. Tokey is relegated to the role of the less interesting sibling, while Mance's anger issues remain superficially addressed. Although the relationship between CeCe and Ellis shows promise, it is diminished by the clichéd protector myth trope, which oversimplifies their connection.",
            "The novel heavily relies on familiar tropes, such as the protector myth and the Beauty and the Beast dynamic, which feel overstretched and undermine the story's originality. Additionally, the depiction of small-town villains and patriarchal relationships is criticized for being conventional and lacking depth.",
            "The novel is set primarily in the fictional town of Diggs, North Carolina, with some scenes in Charlotte. While Diggs is vividly portrayed, Charlotte feels underexplored, despite its significance to themes of Black land loss, community formation, and familial estrangement. The regional planning perspective is commendable, but the narrative could have benefited from a deeper exploration of the interconnected fates of rural, exurban, suburban, and urban areas.",
            "The novel explores significant themes such as Black land loss, community formation, and familial estrangement. Its emphasis on heirs' property status and the challenges of preserving family land is both relevant and commendable. However, the treatment of these themes occasionally comes across as preachy, with awkwardly inserted statistics about property law disrupting the flow of dialogue."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Long After We Are Gone* is a decent read, particularly for fans of multi-generational family sagas about Black Southerners.

The novel could have benefited from a more inspired approach to storytelling and a more nuanced handling of its themes and characters.",

The setting is well-described, but Charlotte feels underexplored despite its relevance to the themes of Black land loss, community formation, and familial estrangement.\n   - The regional planning perspective is appreciated, but the novel could have delved deeper into the interconnected fates of rural, exurban, suburban, and urban settings.\n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**\n   - The novel addresses important themes like Black land loss/dispossession, community formation, and familial estrangement. The focus on heirs property status and the challenges of preserving family land is particularly relevant and appreciated.\n   - However, the handling of these themes sometimes feels preachy and explanatory, with clunky mid-dialogue inclusions of lengthy statistics about property law.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - The characters, particularly Tokey and Mance, feel underdeveloped. Tokey is sidelined as the \"less interesting sibling,\" and Mance's anger issues are not explored in depth.\n   - The relationship between CeCe and Ellis has potential but is undermined by the overused \"protector myth\" trope, which detracts from the complexity of their connection.\n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**\n   - The storytelling is formulaic and lacks inspiration. The novel follows a typical structure without any significant flourishes in storytelling, characterization, or overall message.\n   - The inclusion of real-life research and examples could have been handled more tastefully, perhaps using a footnote approach similar to that in *Chain-Gang All Stars*.\n\n- **Tropes and Narrative Choices:**\n   - The novel relies heavily on familiar tropes, such as the \"protector myth\" and the \"Beauty and the Beast\" dynamic, which feel overused and detract from the story's originality.\n   - The portrayal of small-town villains and patriarchal relationships is also criticized for being too conventional and lacking depth.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**\n   - The ending includes some forced \"we are family\" and \"come to Jesus\" moments, which feel contrived. However, the overall resolution is still enjoyable for fans of the genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *Long After We Are Gone* is a decent read, particularly for fans of multi-generational family sagas about Black Southerners. While it addresses important themes and has moments of tension and enjoyment, it falls short in terms of character development, narrative originality, and the depth of its exploration of complex issues. The novel could have benefited from a more inspired approach to storytelling and a more nuanced handling of its themes and characters.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Plot and Setting: 7/10\n- Themes and Relevance: 8/10\n- Characterization: 5/10\n- Writing Style and Execution: 6/10\n- Tropes and Narrative Choices: 4/10\n- Ending and Resolution: 6/10\n\n**Overall Rating: 6/10**"

I may pick it back up later to see how everything turns out, but for now, I'm done.  \n\n- **Character Development and Complexity:**  \n   - The reason I lost interest was the characters. First of all, there are too many characters. The book is written from the point of view of the 4 children, and the chapters rotate between them.

It was taking too much effort to keep up with them.  \n   - The 4 children have come home to visit when their father, King, passes away. They find out that their family home may be snatched up by a development company, despite the property being passed down through the heirs for decades.  \n   - The children are terrible people, except for Tokey, who suffers from an eating disorder.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narration:**  \n  The narration by Diontae Black was very well done.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style and Storytelling:**  \n  I am a huge fan of Terah Shelton Harris’ writing style and her artfully done storytelling. I enjoyed her previous book, *One Summer in Savannah*, and I enjoyed this one as well.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel is a generational family drama set in North Carolina, where patriarch King’s last words, “Don’t let the white man take the house,” bind his children to the preservation of his legacy and dreams. The story follows four siblings, each battling personal problems, who must come together to save the Kingdom from a development company. It touches on themes such as buried secrets, forgiveness, love, homophobia, heir property (which I had never heard about), addiction, and violence.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The family is portrayed as being at odds with one another but also deeply filled with love.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  I look forward to more from this accomplished author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Long After We Are Gone* is a compelling and emotionally rich novel that masterfully weaves together family drama, personal struggles, and societal issues. Terah Shelton Harris’ storytelling shines, and the narration enhances the experience. It’s a thought-provoking and heartfelt read that leaves me eager for more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I enjoyed the author's previous work, *One Summer in Savannah*, this one fell short. Had I not been intrigued by the heir property aspect, it would have been a DNF (Did Not Finish).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was well-written and tackled heavy themes, the unlikeable characters and uncomfortable handling of certain issues made it a challenging read for me. The resolution at the end and the historical intrigue of heir property were the saving graces, but overall, this was not a book I connected with.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars"

            "The book begins slowly, but it's absolutely worth the wait. Around the 60% mark, the climax unfolds, turning it into a \"just one more page\" read as you're eager to discover each sibling's next move.",
            "I appreciated the depth of character development in this story. The characters felt authentic and tangible as they navigated their choices and challenges. Cece's journey, marked by her persistent selfishness until her eventual awakening, struck a chord with me as it felt genuine. Tokey's struggle to connect with her family, particularly with Cece, was compelling; her tendency to lash out due to her own vulnerabilities highlighted the tension in their relationship and underscored her battle with addiction. Junior's experience of blaming others for his self-concealment resonated profoundly, especially when he eventually recognized that it was still his choice. The narrative also powerfully addresses the issue of homophobia, particularly in a small-town setting. Mance's desire to provide and protect served as a misguided justification for his actions, ultimately blinding him to the love and support around him, as he dismissed the voices of those who cared for him, convinced he knew better.",

Its release had been bookmarked in my calendar.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The book started off a little slow, but it was 100% worth it. At about 60% in, the climax hits, making it a \"just one more page\" kind of read as you want to see what each sibling will do.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The tone or writing style of this book is different from the author’s first book, but the heart of the story remains the same. It still tackles real-world problems and delves into deep internal struggles that many people face, reflecting them back to the reader.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I loved the way these characters were developed. They felt more real and raw in how they moved through the world and the choices they made.  \n   - Cece, almost to the very end, still wasn’t getting it and remained selfish until she finally let go, which felt very real.  \n   - Tokey’s struggle to connect with her family, especially Cece, while constantly snapping at her and projecting hostility, was compelling. This behavior went counter to what she claimed to want and was part of what drove her addiction.  \n   - Junior’s journey of blaming everyone in his life for making him hide himself until he realized it was still a choice resonated deeply. The book also highlights the very real problem of homophobia, especially in a small town.  \n   - Mance used his desire to provide and protect as an excuse, but it blinded him to what he truly had. He ignored the words of those who loved him, insisting he knew better.  \n\n- **Themes and Relatability:**  \n   - The book explores so many themes and discussions, making it excellent for book clubs. It’s nearly impossible not to identify with at least a bit of each character, which is what makes it a great book.  \n\n- **Comparison to the Author’s Previous Work:**  \n   - While I don’t believe in comparing books, I loved the first one, but this one stood out for its deeper character development and raw portrayal of their struggles.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a deeply engaging and thought-provoking read, with well-developed characters and themes that resonate on a personal level. It starts slow but builds into a compelling narrative that keeps you hooked.

However, some aspects of the writing felt less effective, with occasional stilted sentence structures and awkward transitions. A standout moment exemplifying the author's skill is:  \n*“It will take a long time, perhaps a thousand good mornings from now, when it's all over, to understand the impact of King's death. The Solomons will rearrange the pieces they know, question what they will never understand, and reimagine the events in their minds. How it was the best and worst thing for them as a family. How it changed them individually, for the better and for the worse. They will think of King often, what he worked for, instilled in them, believed in.”*  \nOverall, while the writing has its flaws, the emotional depth and beauty of certain passages shine through.",

As a result, *Long After We Are Gone* had a lot to live up to, especially since I read it so soon after the debut.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The novel follows the journey of the four Solomon siblings—CeCe, Tokey, Junior, and Mance—as they navigate the impending death of their father, King Solomon. The story begins with King's instruction to his children: \"Don't let the white man take the house.\" The house is part of a 200-acre estate known as \"The Kingdom,\" which has been in the Solomon family for 230 years. The siblings must grapple with their individual plans for the land while contending with external forces that have their own designs on the property.  \n\n- **Character Development and Perspectives:**  \n   - Each chapter provides the perspective of a different sibling, which I appreciated for its uniqueness. The author does an excellent job of adding depth to the characters, conveying their personalities, motivations, and inner struggles. I enjoyed witnessing the siblings' evolving relationships with one another and their individual growth throughout the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n   - While there are lyrical and poignant sentences throughout the book, I found some aspects of the writing less effective. The sentence structure occasionally felt stilted, and there were awkward transitions in certain parts. Despite this, the author's ability to craft beautiful prose shines through in moments like:  \n     *\"It will take a long time, perhaps a thousand good mornings from now, when it's all over, to understand the impact of King's death. The Solomons will rearrange the pieces they know, question what they will never understand, and reimagine the events in their minds. How it was the best and worst thing for them as a family. How it changed them individually, for the better and for the worse. They will think of King often, what he worked for, instilled in them, believed in.\"*  \n\n- **Engagement with Specific Storylines:**  \n   - I struggled to feel invested in one of the sibling's storylines and often wished they would make different decisions. This lack of connection slightly diminished my overall enjoyment of the novel.  \n\n- **Historical and Cultural Context:**  \n   - The Author's Note at the beginning of the book is essential reading. It provides critical context about the historical practice of Black families purchasing land after Reconstruction, which was often passed down without a will, known as heir property. This lack of clear title possession is central to the plot of *The Kingdom* in the novel.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings:**  \n   - The book includes sensitive content, such as the death of a parent, eating disorders, homophobia, murder, physical abuse, sexual assault, and violence.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Long After We Are Gone* is a compelling exploration of family, legacy, and identity, with richly developed characters and a poignant premise. While it didn't quite reach the heights of the author's debut for me, it remains a thoughtful and impactful read. The historical context and lyrical prose elevate the story, even if some aspects of the writing and certain storylines didn't fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Personal Rating: 3.75 stars (rounded to 4.0 stars for Goodreads)."

            "The tension in the story is solid but not exceptional, which is why I didn't give it a full five stars. Some concepts felt formulaic rather than organically developed, and certain elements were predictable or clichéd. Cece's character became overwhelming at times, with narrative interjections about thoughts and emotions feeling excessive. Additionally, the backstory for Cece and Ellis was overly long and repetitive, though I did appreciate the concise backstories for the other characters.",

She employs a clear and straightforward approach to storytelling, while her characters and plots remain complex and multi-layered. Her narratives are well-structured, effectively hitting key points.

The central conflict centers on the threat to the Solomon family's North Carolina land, which has been in their possession for 200 years. Through the characters' personal struggles and interactions, the narrative delves into themes of identity, family loyalty, and self-acceptance.",
            "The characters in this story are compelling and memorable. Mance is particularly complex; he displays strength and devotion to his wife Lisha, yet struggles with his temper and questionable side hustles. Junior, a school principal with a loving family, grapples with his identity as a gay man, leading a dual life between his Outer Man and Inner Man. Cece, a successful New York lawyer, faces a downward spiral as she misappropriates company funds and becomes embroiled in extortion and an affair with a colleague.

Tokey, one of the Solomon daughters, was a character I really liked, but her role felt too minor, and her struggles were not given the depth they deserved.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Antagonists:**  \n  The villains in the story came across as cartoonish, and the bad things that happened (outside of the fight for the property) felt over-the-top. While this added drama to the narrative, it detracted from the realism and emotional weight of the story.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was a drama-filled read that many readers might enjoy. However, it didn’t quite live up to my expectations, especially after loving Shelton Harris' previous work, *One Summer in Savannah*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Long After We Are Gone* sheds light on an important and underrepresented issue through the lens of Heir Property, the unlikable characters, underdeveloped subplots, and exaggerated antagonists made it a challenging read. Despite these shortcomings, I remain hopeful for Shelton Harris' future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story unfolds gradually, revealing King Solomon’s history and making his character and motivations more relatable. It skillfully balances past and present, enriching the family saga.

After the death of the family patriarch, the four adult children are reunited to fight for their ancestral land. Each sibling has their own personal struggles, but they unite when it comes to family.  \n\n- **Author's Note and Context:**  \n  The author’s note at the beginning is highly recommended. It provides important trigger warnings for sensitive readers and offers enlightening historical context about \"heir property,\" which adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Author's Skill:**  \n  Terah Shelton Harris is an excellent writer. Her ability to craft compelling narratives is evident in this novel, as well as in her debut book, *Summer in Savannah*, which, while very different from this one, is also very good.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a poignant and well-written story about family, heritage, and the complexities of sibling relationships. The historical context provided in the author’s note enhances the reader’s understanding and appreciation of the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I found it difficult to connect with or root for them, which impacted my overall enjoyment of the novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the author's writing style, my inability to connect with the characters made it challenging to fully enjoy the story. The novel explores themes of family and personal flaws, but the lack of likable characters left me feeling disconnected.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Of the three, I enjoyed this one the most because it felt the most interesting and complex.\n\n- **Engagement and Connection:**  \n  While I found the story to be \"fine,\" I didn't feel a strong connection to it. It didn't resonate with me on a deeper level, which made it just an okay read for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was an enjoyable listen on audiobook, particularly due to its complexity and family dynamics. However, it didn't leave a lasting impression, and I found it to be just average in terms of emotional engagement.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5"
