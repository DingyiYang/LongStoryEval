Over the next decade, Jane remains with Mateo despite his abusive behavior and gives birth to their daughter, Scarlet. Following her father's death, Jane returns to her hometown to support her mother and reconnects with old friends, including her former boyfriend, Nik. Ultimately, Jane chooses not to flee to Canada but instead stays to rebuild her life. However, this decision feels underwhelming, lacking a strong emotional payoff or resolution.",

While her prolonged stay with Mateo, despite his abusive behavior, illustrates the fear and helplessness often faced by victims, it remains frustrating for the reader. Additionally, Jane’s failure to seek help from someone at the club where she worked feels like a missed opportunity for a quicker escape."

While I initially found Jane's struggle to find help and protection somewhat unbelievable, I recognize that this may reflect the harsh reality for many survivors. The portrayal of her desire to escape, her acknowledgment of danger, and the lack of resources or support she encounters were emotionally impactful and difficult to read.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot (Second Chance Love):**  \n  The second chance romance between Jane and her first love, Nic, felt too simple and quick for my taste. While I appreciated the eventual happily ever after (HEA), the lack of tension or apprehension about how their relationship would work out made it less compelling. This aspect held me back from fully loving the story, even though I still enjoyed it overall.  \n\n- **Ending and Predictability:**  \n  Despite knowing there would be a happy ending, the actual conclusion was not entirely predictable. The way the story unfolded in the end was surprising and satisfying, even if the overall trajectory of the romance felt straightforward.  \n\n- **Appeal to Target Audience:**  \n  This novel is likely to resonate with readers who enjoy tragic, emotional stories with a second-chance romance. While it didn’t quite earn a 5-star rating from me, I can see it being a hit for fans of romance with heavy, traumatic themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt exploration of domestic abuse and second-chance love, blending emotional depth with a hopeful resolution.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The book was heart-wrenching and evoked strong emotions, making it difficult to put down despite the emotional toll.  \n  - It’s a novel for readers seeking a good cry, as it leaves the reader’s heart “ripped to shreds” and eyes in need of eyedrops.  \n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  - The story follows Jane and her daughter, who have faced significant hardships. Jane returns home after her father’s death to help her mother but has an ulterior motive.  \n  - Jane’s old best friend and first love, Nik, still has feelings for her and tries to convince her to stay.  \n  - Jane’s secrets are revealed throughout the story, adding depth and emotional weight to the narrative.  \n  - Jane’s stubbornness and reluctance to ask for help were frustrating, though she trusts her daughter, Kait. The reviewer felt Nik should have been trusted more.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Works:**  \n  - This novel is notably different from Wiesner’s other works, *The Second Chance Year* and *Wish I Were Here*, as it lacks magical realism and focuses on emotional depth rather than humor.  \n  - While the other novels elicited laughter, this one brought tears, but it’s equally good in its own way.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Nostalgia:**  \n  - The mention of the *Warrior Cats* series by Erin Hunter was a delightful touch, evoking nostalgia and putting a smile on the reviewer’s face.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Re-read Potential:**  \n  - The reviewer enjoyed the novel and can see themselves picking it up again in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis emotionally charged novel delivers a heart-wrenching story of love, loss, and secrets, making it a compelling read for those seeking a good cry. While it differs from the author’s previous works in tone and style, it stands strong on its own. Despite some frustrations with Jane’s character, the book’s emotional depth and nostalgic references make it a memorable and enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

I would have preferred a dual POV instead of a third-person perspective, particularly during pivotal moments like her departure, his scholarship loss, and her return, as his viewpoint would have added depth. I found Scarlett's birth and timeline confusing; it was unclear how she could feel both certain and uncertain, and his objections only heightened the ambiguity, leaving this aspect unresolved.
