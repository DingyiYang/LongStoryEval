The audiobook added a wonderful layer to the storytelling experience.  \n\n- **Character Development and Complexity:**  \n  Annie “Ahn Le” Shaw is a deeply intense character with a complicated history. Her struggles with OCD, intrusive thoughts, and mental health spirals made her an unreliable narrator, yet I found myself constantly rooting for her to thrive. Her journey was both heartbreaking and compelling.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The novel explores unique elements such as contamination OCD, toxic familial relationships, generational trauma, and the immigrant experience. The complicated mother-daughter relationship particularly resonated with me and pulled at my heartstrings.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  This thriller was action-packed, with a back-and-forth timeline of events that kept me engaged. The deaths of two close acquaintances added tension, leading to a gripping investigation that forced Annie to regain control of her life.  \n\n- **Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n  Annie’s friendship with Ike provided a lovely respite amidst the otherwise grim relationships she endures. It was a touching and well-developed aspect of the story.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  Be warned, there’s a dog that’s unalived in the story, which may be distressing for some readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a very unique and memorable thriller that skillfully blended intense character development, emotional depth, and a gripping plot. I can’t wait to see what K.T. Nguyen comes up with next!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The descriptions of Annie’s OCD symptoms were incredibly evocative and demonstrated a deft handling of a mental illness that is often poorly represented in the thriller genre.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The chapters in Part 1 were very short, and every other chapter alternated between flashbacks, dreams, memories, or flash-forwards. This constant shifting pulled the reader in multiple directions instead of allowing for a smooth introduction to the characters or premise.

I actually appreciated the flashbacks to Annie’s childhood later on.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character’s actions and emotions were over-explained, which felt like spoon-feeding character development. It was already clear how Annie was feeling through her words and actions, but the author repeatedly explained her emotions, opting for both showing and telling. For example, during arguments, the text would explicitly state that Annie said something because she was angry or confused.  \n\n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n  The plot twist was extremely easy to figure out early in the book.

Me, a survivor of a harrowing immigration story, becomes a source of physical and mental abuse for Anh, even haunting her after death.  \n  - Anh’s interactions with her devoted husband and judgmental teenage daughter add layers to her struggles, as her phobias and need for cleanliness make normalcy nearly impossible.  \n\n- **Plot and Tension:**  \n  - The story intensifies when Anh becomes a suspect in the murder of Byrdie, an eccentric elderly woman with whom she shares a toxic relationship.  \n  - The police investigation, coupled with the unraveling of her marriage and life, creates relentless tension that kept me hooked.  \n  - Nguyen masterfully blurs the line between reality and imagination, leaving me questioning what was real and what was in Anh’s mind.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - Nguyen’s writing is evocative and anxiety-inducing, with chapters that are both maddening and compelling.  \n  - The author skillfully weaves past crimes and incidents into the narrative, creating a twisted and clever storyline that kept me guessing until the end.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The novel explores themes of survival, mental illness, and the lingering effects of trauma, particularly through Anh’s relationship with her mother.  \n  - It provides a raw and eye-opening portrayal of OCD, making me more aware of the challenges faced by those living with the condition.  \n  - The story’s emotional depth and relatability left me questioning reality and reflecting on my own experiences in unexpected ways.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nK.T.

Her difficult childhood and complex feelings about her mother shape her personality, but I wouldn’t want to be her friend. As an unreliable narrator battling personal demons and mental illness—common tropes in this genre—her repeated internal monologues questioning her culpability in the murder become tiresome. While her husband appears caring and supportive, doubts linger about his true intentions. Additionally, the presence of multiple attractive male characters, including her husband and a man she meets at her daughter’s school event, feels unrealistic and undermines the story's authenticity.",

Nguyen’s writing skillfully immerses the reader in Annie’s confusion and keeps them riveted by the suspense. The story balances creepy moments with a grounded sense of reality.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n  The book delves into emotionally challenging themes, such as Annie’s fraught relationship with her mother and her mother’s hoarding. These elements were difficult to read and almost made me stop early on, but they added depth to the story.\n\n- **Character Likability and Morality:**  \n  Annie’s morally questionable actions might alienate readers who prefer likeable protagonists. However, her complexity adds to the narrative’s richness.\n\n- **Pacing and Character Development:**  \n  The story maintains strong pacing and suspense throughout, though the teenage daughter’s rapid character transformation towards the end felt somewhat tropey and less convincing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a 5-star psychological thriller for me, with its unique perspective, fresh execution of tropes, and gripping suspense. While some elements, such as the emotionally heavy themes and Annie’s moral ambiguity, may not appeal to all readers, it’s a fantastic debut that showcases Nguyen’s potential as a writer.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

Despite her challenges, she works diligently to transform her life, unearthing a newfound strength fueled by a desire for a more fulfilling romantic existence. This awakening leads her to engage in affairs during her husband's work trips, which ignites feelings of independence and empowerment, prompting her to consider leaving him. I am particularly drawn to narratives featuring unstable characters, and Annie, with her OCD, PTSD, anxiety, and penchant for pathological lying, is exceptionally captivating. Each of her struggles feels authentically earned, deeply rooted in her traumatic childhood, her complicated relationship with her mother, the recent death of an acquaintance, and her perplexing status as a suspect in that death.",

            "I was thoroughly captivated by the book until the final 50 pages, where the ending felt like a letdown. The premise of intrusive thoughts leading the protagonist to believe she might be a serial killer was compelling, but the execution missed the mark. The husband's abrupt revelation as the mastermind felt predictable and disappointing, resulting in a conventional thriller ending that lacked the subversive depth I had anticipated.",
            "Annie’s character is well-developed, authentically depicting her struggles with OCD and generational trauma. As someone who also experiences contamination OCD, I found her portrayal relatable and accurate. In contrast, Duncan's character presented challenges; his consistently terrible behavior towards Annie initially struck me as typical thriller sexism. However, it ultimately revealed him to be the antagonist, making the book’s plot feel predictable in retrospect.",
            "This debut novel showcases an impressive writing style, particularly in its adept use of third-person present tense, a notoriously challenging narrative choice. The engaging prose kept me immersed, making the ultimately disappointing ending all the more frustrating. Despite this, the book features genuine moments of tension and emotional depth that elevate it beyond the typical thriller.",
            "The book adeptly examines themes of OCD and generational trauma, particularly the experiences of Vietnam War survivors and refugees. The portrayal of intergenerational trauma is authentic, and the representation of OCD is well-crafted, drawing from the author’s own experiences. However, while the message that “OCD doesn’t make you a bad person” is important, the narrative misses opportunities for a more nuanced exploration of these themes.",

The concept of intrusive thoughts taking over and making the protagonist think she might be a serial killer was intriguing, but the execution fell flat. The husband’s sudden reveal as the mastermind behind everything was predictable and disappointing. It felt like a typical thriller ending, lacking the subversive and nuanced conclusion I had hoped for.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Annie’s character, particularly her struggles with OCD and generational trauma, was well-developed and authentic. The portrayal of her OCD was accurate and relatable, especially for someone like me who also deals with contamination OCD. However, Duncan’s character was problematic. His behavior towards Annie was consistently horrible, and while I initially dismissed it as typical thriller sexism, it turned out to be a blatant hint that he was the antagonist. This made the entire book feel more obvious in hindsight.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The book effectively explores themes of OCD and generational trauma, particularly the trauma of Vietnam War survivors and refugees. The intergenerational impact of trauma was portrayed authentically, and the OCD representation was well-handled, thanks to the author’s own experiences. However, the book didn’t delve much deeper than the basic message that “OCD doesn’t make you a bad person,” which felt like a missed opportunity for more nuanced exploration.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  K.T. Nguyen’s writing style was impressive, especially for a debut novel. She managed to pull off third-person present tense, which is notoriously difficult to write and read. The writing was engaging and kept me hooked, making the disappointing ending even more frustrating. The book had moments of genuine tension and emotional depth, which elevated it above typical thrillers.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The pacing was generally good, keeping me engaged throughout most of the book. The tension and anxiety were well-crafted, and there were moments that genuinely moved me. However, the ending disrupted the overall flow and left me feeling unsatisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *You Know What You Did* is a solid debut novel with strong themes and authentic representation of OCD and generational trauma.

Some scenes are so visceral that they deliver a powerful reality check, leaving a lasting impact.  \n\n- **Thriller/Mystery Elements:**  \n  While the book is marketed as a thriller, I found these elements to be less satisfying. The plot, though twisted, becomes predictable relatively early on. This lack of suspense detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Impact and Future Potential:**  \n  Despite its flaws, *You Know What You Did* is a solid read.

            "The novel began slowly, which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. However, by the halfway point, the story picked up dramatically, culminating in a shocking and emotionally resonant ending that left me in disbelief for the protagonist, Annie.",
            "The novel skillfully delves into themes of trauma, displacement, and the generational divide between Annie and her mother. The mother's hoarding reflects her desire for security and permanence, while Annie's retreat into art and imagination showcases her yearning for freedom and self-expression. The increasing clutter in their home serves as a powerful metaphor for the emotional turmoil and tension in their relationship.",
            "Although I don't belong to the demographic reflected in the story, I resonated deeply with the anxiety and struggles of Annie and her mother as they adjusted to life in the U.S. The mother’s enthusiasm for garage sales and her attachment to seemingly worthless items starkly contrasted with Annie’s view of it as hoarding and neglect. This dynamic underscored the mother's trauma from her past in a war-torn country, revealing her desire to secure possessions in her new life. Meanwhile, Annie longed for emotional connection and stability.",
            "The author's talent for eliciting visceral reactions is truly impressive. I felt Annie's anxiety and compulsions so acutely that I experienced physical responses—my heart raced, my breath quickened, and I felt an urge to clean or fix something. This deep level of immersion showcases the author's skill in creating a compelling, emotionally charged narrative."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This was a solid 4-star read that masterfully portrayed the emotional struggles of its characters, particularly Annie and her mother. While the pacing started slow, the story built to a powerful and surprising conclusion. The novel’s ability to evoke such strong emotional responses and its exploration of trauma and displacement make it a memorable and impactful debut.",

However, by the halfway point, the story escalated dramatically, leading to a shocking and emotionally impactful ending that left me in utter shock for the protagonist, Annie.  \n\n- **Emotional Resonance and Character Depth:**  \n  Despite not belonging to the demographic depicted in the book (immigrant, refugee, or Vietnamese), I deeply felt the anxiety and struggles of Annie and her mother as they navigated their new life in the US. The mother’s excitement over garage sales and her attachment to seemingly worthless items contrasted sharply with Annie’s perception of it as hoarding and neglect. This dynamic highlighted the mother’s trauma from having nothing in a war-torn country and her desire to secure possessions in her new life, while Annie yearned for emotional connection and stability.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The novel effectively explores themes of trauma, displacement, and the generational divide between Annie and her mother. The mother’s hoarding symbolized her need for security and permanence, while Annie’s escape into art and imagination represented her longing for freedom and self-expression. The growing piles of junk in their home mirrored the emotional clutter and tension in their relationship.  \n\n- **Writing and Immersion:**  \n  The author’s ability to evoke visceral reactions was remarkable. I found myself feeling Annie’s anxiety and compulsions so intensely that I experienced physical responses like a racing heart, quickened breath, and an urge to clean or fix something. This level of immersion is a testament to the author’s skill in crafting a compelling and emotionally charged narrative.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Works:**  \n  As a debut novel, this was an impressive effort, and I am eager to see more from the author, KT. The storytelling was impactful, and I hope they continue to explore complex themes and characters in their future works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a solid 4-star read that masterfully portrayed the emotional struggles of its characters, particularly Annie and her mother. While the pacing started slow, the story built to a powerful and surprising conclusion. The novel’s ability to evoke such strong emotional responses and its exploration of trauma and displacement make it a memorable and impactful debut.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

            "The characterization in this story is outstanding. The author masterfully engages readers with each character while maintaining a persistent sense of suspicion after every interaction. This approach captivates your attention and makes the book difficult to put down. What starts as a desire to know what happens next quickly transforms into an urgent need to discover their fates, leading you to race through the pages.",

Nguyen connects you with each character but always leaves you with suspicion hanging in the air after every encounter.

Your want to know what they do next quickly turns into a NEED to know, and you’ll find yourself flying through the pages.  \n\n- **Representation of Mental Health (OCD):**  \n  The portrayal of OCD was uniquely skin-tingling and unsettling. I definitely got the heebie-jeebies on more than one occasion. It added a layer of tension and discomfort that made the story even more gripping.  \n\n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n  The ending was shocking, twisty, and very impactful. I am still not over it. The way imagination and reality blur for Annie, leaving her as a main suspect in multiple police investigations, kept me on the edge of my seat. The uncertainty of whether to believe Annie or the evidence added to the suspense.  \n\n- **Themes and Genres:**  \n  This book masterfully weaves together themes of unreliable characters, mother/daughter dynamics, domestic thrillers, body horror, mystery, drama, character studies, art, and mental health.

While the premise is intriguing, the characters' actions and dialogue often come across as overly dramatic and unrealistic.",

The repetition in the writing, possibly intended to reflect OCD, felt frustrating rather than creative, detracting from the reading experience.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Annie, the protagonist, is an artist with a seemingly perfect life, but her greatest shame is her mother, a Vietnamese immigrant with a hoarding problem and a temper. After her mother’s death, Annie feels free, but strange occurrences and her mother’s taunting voice begin to haunt her. Despite the intriguing setup, the characters’ actions and dialogue felt overly dramatic and unrealistic.\n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n  The novel explores themes like disgust-triggered OCD, generational trauma, imposter syndrome, and murder. While these ideas had potential, their execution lacked subtlety. The themes felt heavy-handed, as if the reader was being repeatedly bashed over the head with them, which made the story less enjoyable.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The dialogue was incredibly cheesy, and the overall tone of the book resembled a Disney original movie rather than a gripping thriller. The writing style, though possibly aiming for creativity, ended up feeling repetitive and frustrating.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some cool ideas for a thriller, its execution fell flat.

            "The book attempts to cover too much ground, resulting in a lack of cohesion. The first half delves deeply into domestic fiction with themes of mental illness, while the second half abruptly shifts to a crime thriller. This transition, compounded by multiple subplots, distracts from the main storyline. Additionally, the integration of three narratives—present-day events, non-linear flashbacks, and an undated hotel storyline—adds confusion rather than depth. The pacing also falters, with the climax and resolution crammed into the final 30 pages, leaving me feeling rushed and ultimately unsatisfied.",

While his motivations, linked to his PTSD as a war journalist, were explained, there was a notable absence of foreshadowing or hints earlier in the book, undermining the impact of the reveal. This portrayal of PTSD also felt stigmatizing and was poorly executed. In contrast, the exploration of generational trauma and the refugee experience, especially through the relationship between Annie and Mẹ, was well-crafted and added significant depth to their characters.",

However, while the book attempts to portray Annie's OCD and her struggles with contamination rituals and mental spirals, the execution felt disjointed. The abrupt shift from domestic contemporary fiction to crime thriller diluted the focus on mental illness, making it less impactful than I had hoped.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The book tried to do too much, resulting in a lack of cohesion. The first half leaned heavily into domestic fiction with mental illness themes, while the second half abruptly transitioned into a crime thriller. This shift, along with multiple side-plots, distracted from the main storyline. Additionally, the inclusion of three narratives—present-day, non-linear flashbacks, and an undated hotel storyline—created confusion rather than enhancing the story. The pacing also suffered, with the climax and resolution crammed into the last 30 pages, leaving me feeling rushed and unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Character Development and Motivations:**  \n  The revelation of Duncan as the orchestrator of the murders felt unearned and left-field. While his explanation made sense in the moment, there was no foreshadowing or subtle hints earlier in the book to make the reveal satisfying. His motivation, tied to PTSD from being a war journalist, felt stigmatizing and poorly handled. On the other hand, the exploration of generational trauma and the refugee experience, particularly through Annie and Mẹ's relationship, was well-done and added depth to their characters.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book excelled in its portrayal of generational trauma and the complexities of refugee experiences. The flashbacks provided context for Annie and Mẹ's fraught relationship, offering insight into their conflicts and mental health struggles.

            "The ending reveal felt predictable, diminishing its impact. The storytelling was unnecessarily convoluted, particularly with the addition of a third time period labeled \"Hotel,\" which was vague and disorienting. This ambiguity regarding its context—whether past or future—was frustrating. The climax appeared abrupt and anti-climactic, as crucial plot points were skipped, leaving me wondering if I had missed a chapter. Additionally, the climax's tension was undercut by several short chapters presented out of order, which revealed outcomes prematurely. The flashbacks further added to the disorientation, flowing in and out of the main narrative without clear breaks, often requiring me to reread sections to grasp the timeline. While the Hotel scenes were intriguing in concept, their execution disrupted the overall narrative flow.",
            "The characters were effectively portrayed as morally complex, navigating imperfect relationships. The teenage daughter stood out, with the protagonist insightfully exploring the deeper emotions driving her anger in a relatable manner. Additionally, the book offered an authentic and nuanced representation of OCD, suggesting it may be based on own voices, as noted in the acknowledgments.",
            "The writing appeared amateurish, especially in the final chapters where the dialogue fell flat. The antagonist's villainous monologue during the climax, while running through the woods, came off as unrealistic and awkward. Additionally, the protagonist’s explanation of her altered relationship at the end felt unnatural, punctuated by a forced line of dialogue.",

            "The story centers on Annie Anh Le Shaw, a first-generation Vietnamese American artist whose life spirals after her mother’s death. The narrative delves into Annie’s OCD, her troubled relationships, and a murder investigation, but some scenes are overly prolonged. The detailed descriptions of her OCD struggles could be condensed for a better flow. Additionally, certain subplots, such as her friend’s cheating husband, feel superfluous and detract from the main narrative. The plot twists and reveals lack impact; for those familiar with true crime, the outcome becomes predictable early on. While I appreciated the story's conclusion, it unfortunately lacks the surprise I typically seek in thrillers.",

However, I felt uneasy at first because it seemed like medicine and cognitive behavioral therapy were portrayed negatively, which I believe is a dangerous message, especially within the POC community where mental health is already stigmatized. I prefer that characters with mental illness are not vilified and that treatments are not further stigmatized. By the end of the novel, I was relieved that these values were not violated.\n\n- **Themes of Societal Injustice:**  \n  The book touches on societal injustices, such as how Annie, a Vietnamese woman, was suspected of wrongdoing while her well-off white husband was not. It also briefly compares the treatment of Vietnamese refugees to that of migrants crossing the border from Mexico and elsewhere. While these themes were brought to the forefront, I felt they were not explored in enough depth. I would have liked more discussion around these comparisons, as they inspire intriguing conversations.\n\n- **Plot and Genre Execution:**  \n  The suspense/thriller plot was prioritized, which kept me engaged.

However, when she realizes her medication isn't effective and begins a new dosage, it feels like a weight has been lifted, bringing clarity to her thoughts and concerns. Watching her navigate intrusive thoughts, distinguish imagination from reality, and grapple with self-doubt due to someone exploiting her vulnerabilities enriched her character significantly.",

Tension escalates when a woman who commissioned Annie’s artwork is discovered dead, making Annie a suspect. Compounding her turmoil is her husband’s abrupt decision to leave for Syria. A shocking turn arises when Annie awakens to find her lover near death from spider bites, casting doubts on her involvement.

Her husband encourages her to seek therapy as she navigates the challenges of raising a rebellious teenager and dealing with dismissive wealthy locals who undervalue her artistic talent. As her paranoia intensifies, Annie suspects her husband of infidelity and impulsively spends the night with another man. This behavior casts her as an unreliable narrator, making it difficult to trust her account of events. Annie is neither inspiring nor particularly sympathetic; instead, she comes off as whiny and unpredictable. Her erratic emotions and actions create a disconnect, hindering readers from forming a connection with her character.",

The detailed descriptions of mental illness struggles may be triggering for some readers.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s ability to convey Annie’s mental state is commendable. The narrative effectively immerses the reader in her perspective, making her struggles feel real and immediate.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a raw and intense exploration of mental illness, family dynamics, and personal crisis. While it is gripping and thought-provoking, its unflinching portrayal of mental health struggles may be difficult for some readers. The twist at the end adds depth to the story, making it a memorable read despite its emotional heaviness.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "From the outset, I anticipated the identity of the villain, but I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of their motives. I appreciate a solid villain-explains-everything conclusion, especially when it avoids clichés and unnecessary length. This one delivered beautifully.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed Annie's backstory, especially her complex relationship with her mother and her mother's trauma, which illuminate Annie's own struggles with mental health. The narrative provides a strong foundation for understanding how both women arrived at their respective challenges. While many characters are unlikable, their choices often become clear—take Tabby's harsh treatment of Annie, for instance; it's understandable in the context of Duncan's constant heroism.",

Her relationship with her mother and her mother's own trauma was key in understanding Annie and how she dealt with her own mental health concerns. It had a solid base, making it easy to see why both women ended up as they did.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  I knew early on who the villain was going to be, but I wasn't able to predict all of the reasoning. I love a good villain-explains-everything wrap-up, especially when it isn't super cheesy or drawn out, and this one really nailed it for me.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n  Even though many of the characters were not likeable, there were still moments where you could understand their choices. For example, Tabby was awful to Annie, but it was easy to see why when Duncan was always \"the good guy.\"  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Triggers:**  \n  Trigger warning: the dog dies, and it feels so unnecessary, though I know that wasn't really true. It was just incredibly upsetting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel effectively explores Annie's struggles with OCD and her complex relationships, particularly with her mother.

However, the story takes a disappointing turn after the revelation of her actions, which lacks the suspense expected from a thriller. Annie's failure to recognize the obvious can be frustrating, yet this ultimately highlights how invested I've become in her character throughout the middle chapters. The setup feels sluggish, making the beginning of the book a bit of a struggle to get through.",

Her tendency to make poor choices, driven by confusion and frustration, adds to her relatability while highlighting her flaws. However, there are moments when Annie comes across as a passive observer in her own life, which diminishes her appeal as a compelling protagonist.",

            "I reduced my rating by one star because some story elements felt disjointed, which took me out of the narrative. The concept of forgetting events aligned with the conclusion, but its presentation was disorienting. It seemed intended to suggest an unreliable narrator, yet it left me feeling unsettled. I wished for better pacing; the ending felt abrupt, as if it exploded into existence in the final moments of the book. Additionally, the recovery process appeared to happen suddenly, lacking a clear progression, which made it confusing when everything seemed to resolve so quickly. While the conclusion did make sense in hindsight, a smoother development throughout could have made it more convincing. I anticipated the ending, as it was either this outcome or a revelation that all the \"forgotten\" events were true—an outcome I would have found frustrating.",
            "The standout aspect of this book is undoubtedly Tabby, the daughter. While she can be annoyingly realistic in her teenage behavior, the evolution of her relationship with her mother is beautifully portrayed. ",
            "The story explores themes of contamination OCD, familial trauma, and the impacts of war and displacement. If you have OCD or similar tendencies, consider whether reading about the protagonist's obsessions might trigger you or evoke discomfort. This may not be the right read for you. While I don't have OCD myself, I found myself momentarily resonating with some of the character's struggles.",

It’s rare to see immigrant characters in literature, especially in the thriller/mystery genre. The story of Annie, whose mother’s traumatic upbringing due to the Vietnam War shaped her extreme anxiety, overprotectiveness, and debilitating OCD, resonated with me.  \n\n- **Exploration of Generational Trauma:**  \n  The novel effectively delves into how generational trauma is transmitted over years, regardless of how far removed the original trauma was. Annie’s struggles with her own OCD and her attempts to avoid replicating her mother’s parenting style highlight the lasting impact of such trauma.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Mental Illness:**  \n  I was initially hesitant because mental illness is often poorly portrayed in thrillers, lacking nuance or sensitivity. However, the depiction of Annie’s contamination OCD felt honest, raw, and not exploitative. It wasn’t used as a mere plot device, and I appreciated that the story ultimately affirmed Annie’s sanity.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  The gradual unraveling of bizarre and horrifying events in Annie’s life kept me engaged.

It didn’t feel like a thriller initially, leaving me unsure of where the story was headed.  \n  - The second part started strong, and I binge-read the last 70% of the book in one afternoon. The thriller elements kicked in, with Annie hallucinating after her friend goes missing.  \n  - The ending was unexpected and threw me for a loop, which I found really good.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Annie’s character is complex, shaped by a lifetime of mental abuse from her mother and the inheritance of her mother’s mental illness.  \n  - The story raises questions about whether Annie’s trauma has damaged her to the point of committing murder.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The book delves into heavy themes like family drama, death, cheating/affairs, and mental health issues such as anxiety, OCD, paranoia, and mysophobia.  \n  - Reading about Annie’s anxiety was so intense that it gave me anxiety, making it potentially triggering for readers with similar struggles.  \n\n- **Genre and Enjoyability:**  \n  - The book is a psychological thriller with a unique twist, making it worth the read for thriller fans.  \n  - Despite the slow start, the latter part of the book was gripping and enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI liked this book a lot! It’s a different kind of thriller with a strong emotional core and an unexpected ending. However, it may not be suitable for readers who struggle with anxiety or OCD due to its intense portrayal of these issues.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Characters: 5 ⭐️  \n- Pace: 3.5 ⭐️  \n- Enjoyability: 4 ⭐️  \n- Overall Rating: 4 ⭐️"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Representation of OCD:**  \n  The novel provides important and often neglected representation of what it can be like to live with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. While the portrayal is positive in that it addresses common misconceptions, it’s important to note that OCD doesn’t manifest solely as fears surrounding contamination, disgust, harm, and false memory OCD, as depicted through Annie’s character. The disorder can also present as fears and obsessions related to relationships, sexuality, pedophilia, and other themes.  \n\n- **Accuracy of Therapy Depiction:**  \n  The therapy Annie receives in the novel does not align with real-life evidence-based treatment for OCD. In standard treatment, patients are exposed to their feared situations and learn to tolerate the resulting distress without reacting. This critical aspect of therapy is absent in the interactions with Dr. Patel. I highlight this not to critique the fiction but to encourage readers seeking treatment to pursue evidence-based methods.  \n\n- **Author’s Perspective:**  \n  I understand the author has a personal diagnosis of OCD. While not mandatory, I would have appreciated an afterward where the author shares their own experiences with OCD symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Such a section could have added depth and authenticity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Educational Value:**  \n  For readers interested in learning more about OCD, I recommend seeking out books published by professionals in the treatment field or resources from organizations like the International OCD Foundation.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The novel includes triggers related to mental health, child abuse, domestic abuse, gaslighting, and self-harm.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*You Know What You Did* offers valuable representation of OCD, though it narrows the disorder’s manifestations and inaccurately depicts therapy.

While Annie's unreliable narration was compelling, the multitude of unresolved plotlines hindered deeper investment in any of them.

Her struggles with OCD and coping mechanisms are vividly portrayed, making her journey emotionally resonant. The generational trauma from her childhood is palpable and adds depth to her character.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book maintains a thrilling atmosphere, keeping readers unsure of what’s real or not. However, the ending feels rushed, with too many loose ends tied up hastily. One particular twist was far-fetched, leaving me questioning its plausibility.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The novel effectively brings the refugee experience to life, highlighting the complexities of generational trauma. The exploration of mental health, particularly Annie’s OCD, is well-executed and adds layers to the narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n  Nguyen’s writing creates a gripping and immersive atmosphere. The audiobook is also well done, enhancing the storytelling experience.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I enjoyed the book up until the ending, which felt overstuffed and less satisfying. While I wouldn’t universally recommend it, I think it’s worth a read if it’s already on your TBR list.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a compelling exploration of trauma, mental health, and the refugee experience, with strong character development and an immersive atmosphere. However, the rushed and overcomplicated ending detracts from its overall impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Annie is an endearingly frustrating character to whom I found myself deeply attached. My emotions fluctuated as I oscillated between wanting to hug her and feeling the urge to shake some sense into her. Her seemingly perfect life is, in reality, a total mess, largely due to her own choices. Meanwhile, her 14-year-old daughter comes across as annoyingly off-putting—leading me to wonder if the author is drawing from personal experience or merely guessing how teenage girls behave. Additionally, the parents' reactions (or lack thereof) to her behavior felt distracting.",

Once it picked up, I couldn’t stop reading until the end.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Annie was an annoyingly lovable character that I couldn’t help but become attached to. My feelings were all over the place with her—at times I wanted to hug her, and at other times, I wanted to shake some sense into her. Her \"perfect\" life was an absolute disaster, mostly due to her own actions, whether directly or indirectly.  \n- **Character Authenticity:**  \n  Annie’s 14-year-old daughter was extremely annoying and a bit off-putting. I kept wondering if the author was writing from experience or just guessing how all 14-year-old girls act. The parents’ reactions (or lack thereof) to her behavior also distracted me.  \n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  The story was a rollercoaster and a brain teaser, especially when trying to figure out certain characters. This is typical of a thriller, and it kept me engaged.  \n- **Author’s Debut Performance:**  \n  For a debut novel, Nguyen hit it out of the park.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Theme and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book explores how the actions of parents can haunt their children, particularly focusing on Annie, who grew up with her mother constantly warning her that something bad would happen. This led Annie to live her life imagining the worst. The emotional weight of the story is heavy, making it a challenging read at times due to the trauma depicted. Annie’s repeated mistakes and her strained interactions with Tabby evoke a sense of heartache, as it’s clear she doesn’t mean to hurt others.\n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n  Like most thrillers, the story is filled with twists and turns that keep the reader questioning what is real. The uncertainty of whether Annie is a reliable narrator adds to the intrigue. However, while the synopsis mentions three generations of Vietnamese women coming to terms with their past, this aspect doesn’t feel like the central focus of the book. The narrative might have been more engaging if it included POV chapters for Me and Tabby, providing a broader perspective.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The book delves into strained mother/daughter relationships, a theme I personally enjoy. However, all the relationships depicted in the story are fraught with tension and unresolved issues, which adds to the emotional complexity but also makes the reading experience more difficult.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Critique:**  \n  I enjoyed the book overall, but it was not an easy read due to the heavy themes and trauma. The thriller elements were compelling, but I felt the story could have been more interesting with additional perspectives from Me and Tabby.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a thought-provoking and emotionally intense thriller that explores the lasting impact of parental actions and strained family relationships. While the twists and unreliable narration kept me engaged, the heavy trauma and lack of focus on the three generations mentioned in the synopsis left me wanting more depth in certain areas.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The dynamic between the mother and daughter, and how it impacted the protagonist’s relationship with her own daughter, was interesting.  \n\n- **Execution of Flashbacks:**  \n  Unfortunately, the flashbacks felt more like they were there to make a direct point rather than adding depth to the plot.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**  \n  The “big secret” of ‘I know what you did’ felt lackluster after so much buildup. The story lacked surprise because there wasn’t really any other way it could have gone. The pacing didn’t help me feel engaged, though it did pick up later.  \n\n- **Character Reactions and Engagement:**  \n  The protagonist’s lack of reaction to certain events made it hard for me to care. For example, her lapses of time didn’t seem to affect her much, which left me feeling disconnected.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author Potential:**  \n  While the book wasn’t great for me, it did get better, and I don’t regret finishing it. I would be willing to read another book by this author if the plot sounded intriguing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had interesting themes and moments, but its execution, particularly in terms of pacing, character reactions, and the handling of the central secret, left me feeling underwhelmed.

While I enjoyed the premise, it was very boring at parts. If about 100 pages were cut, it would have been a 5-star read.  \n\n- **Representation of OCD:**  \n  As someone with OCD, I appreciated how the author portrayed the protagonist Annie's contamination OCD. The description of her symptoms was accurate and resonated deeply with my own experiences. This aspect elevated the book from a 3-star to a 4-star rating for me. However, I must note that the portrayal of Dr. Patel treating Annie with talk therapy was inaccurate. For OCD, CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is the gold standard, not talk therapy.  \n\n- **Plot Elements (Dog's Death):**  \n  The death of the dog, Deja, felt completely unnecessary. The story could have stood well on its own without this event. While I was aware of the warnings, Deja's demise triggered my own OCD and added an unnecessary layer of distress.  \n\n- **Character Development (Tabby):**  \n  The daughter, Tabby, was annoying and lacked discernable personality traits. The author seemed too focused on making her a typical teenager, which made her feel one-dimensional. Humanizing her more would have improved her character significantly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a good but slow-paced book that provides a great introduction to the complexities of OCD. While it has its flaws, the accurate portrayal of OCD and the psychological thriller elements make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (elevated from 3 stars due to the accurate representation of OCD)."

Mental health is a topic that should be discussed more in books, and this novel addresses it well. However, the depiction is very heavy and gave me some anxiety while reading. A trigger warning would be helpful for readers who have or are experiencing mental health issues, particularly OCD.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I found the book hard to get into and didn’t look forward to reading it until the final portion. By then, I was invested enough to see how the story ended. The narrative jumped around a lot, which left me confused at times about who the main character was referring to.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending felt abrupt and rushed. It seemed like Nguyen tried to tie everything together in the last 10% of the book. While I enjoy surprising and twisty endings, this one felt out of nowhere and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s portrayal of OCD is commendable and important, the heavy subject matter and pacing issues made it a challenging read.

The protagonist, Annie, deals with a surge of her disgust-driven OCD, and Nguyen, who herself has OCD, handles the subject with care. She avoids making it feel exploitative or portraying OCD as a melodramatic failing.  \n\n- **Mystery and Suspense:**  \n  I kind of figured out the mystery pretty early, but the novel still managed to be tense and suspenseful.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The book combines a sensitive exploration of OCD with an examination of how generational trauma can reverberate throughout a familial line. This added depth to the story and made it feel responsible in its storytelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found *YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID* to be a tense, suspenseful, and thoughtfully crafted novel that handles its themes with care and sensitivity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The blurred line between reality and delusion was intriguing but ultimately overshadowed by a lack of emotional connection.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The author demonstrates a deep understanding of the struggles and intrusive thoughts associated with OCD, making the character’s experiences feel authentic and insightful. Readers who are drawn to stories about inherited trauma and mental health challenges will likely appreciate this aspect of the novel.\n\n- **Genre Expectations (Thriller):**  \n  As a thriller, the book falls short in maintaining suspense and engagement. The narrative lacks momentum, and it isn’t until the final quarter of the story that the plot gains any significant traction. This pacing issue may disappoint readers seeking a gripping thriller.\n\n- **Potential Audience Appeal:**  \n  Despite its shortcomings as a thriller, the novel has the potential to resonate with readers who value character-driven stories and themes of trauma and mental health. It could strike a chord with those who appreciate introspective and emotionally layered narratives.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book shines in its portrayal of generational trauma and OCD, it struggles to deliver as a thriller due to slow pacing and a lack of suspense. However, its insightful character development and emotional depth may still appeal to readers drawn to stories about mental health and inherited struggles.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The portrayal of the teenage daughter was over-the-top and unrelatable, and the ending failed to deliver a memorable or impactful resolution.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the exploration of these themes is well-executed, the story itself is entirely predictable and follows an overdone trope.  \n- **Character Development (4/5):** The author did a great job developing characters and inserting raw emotion into their experiences. Annie, as an unreliable narrator with a mental disorder, is portrayed with depth, and her husband’s supportive role adds to the emotional weight of the story.  \n- **Writing Style (3/5):** The writing is medium-to-fast-paced, making it an easy read that can be finished within a few days. However, the style doesn’t stand out as particularly unique or memorable.  \n- **Originality (2/5):** The premise of an unreliable female narrator with a mental disorder and a supportive husband is a common trope in psychological thrillers. I can name at least three other books with a similar premise, which detracts from the story’s originality.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"You Know What You Did\" is a solid 3-star read that effectively explores OCD and the generational effects of mental disorders. While the character development and emotional depth are strengths, the predictable plot and lack of originality make it less compelling for readers seeking a twisty and unpredictable thriller.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot: 3/5  \n- Character Development: 4/5  \n- Writing Style: 3/5  \n- Originality: 2/5  \n- Overall: 3/5  \n\nThank you, NetGalley and Penguin Group Publishing, for allowing me to read an advanced copy of this book."
