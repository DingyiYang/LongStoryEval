        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  Amanda Dykes placed me in the small mining town of Mercy Peak, Colorado in 1948. The setting was immersive and added depth to the story, making it feel authentic and engaging.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel explores themes of friendship, finding purpose, restoration, redemption, and community. Dykes made me question why we sometimes choose isolation over community and concluded with a mission to extend kindness and change the world through small acts.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Marybeth Spatts’ journey of experiencing the gift of community was particularly impactful. I also appreciated the discussions around grief with Casey Campbell, who shared profound insights about loss and wholeness.  \n\n- **Philosophical and Reflective Elements:**  \n  Dykes gave me much to ponder, especially with the quote: “When the mountain cracked open it seemed like our hearts did, too, even wider - but then we saw what it made ….it’s a daily reminder that light will break into our darkness.” This idea of brokenness being redeemed into light resonated deeply.  \n\n- **Symbolism and Metaphors:**  \n  The exploration of penguins as an oxymoron and their perfectly imperfect purpose was a fascinating discussion. Additionally, Martin’s advice about looking for what’s NOT there and Casey’s references to math being the fabric of the universe added layers of meaning to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The treasure hunt for missing clues and the mystery of the Galloping Goose made the story compelling. However, the format of the book was slightly distracting at times.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Impact:**  \n  The novel encouraged me to reflect on my own life, particularly on how I approach grief and community. Casey’s perspective on grief—that we can be whole even while missing loved ones—was both comforting and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Acknowledgment:**  \n  I won this copy as a launch team gift and am grateful for the generosity of author Ashlynn McKayla Ohm.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAmanda Dykes’ novel is a beautifully crafted story that intertwines themes of friendship, purpose, and redemption within the rich setting of Mercy Peak. It challenges readers to reflect on their own lives and relationships while delivering a compelling narrative. Despite minor distractions in the format, the story’s depth and emotional resonance make it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story captivates with its unique narrative structure, incorporating newspaper articles, letters, lists, telegrams, and even a screenplay. While this complexity demands focus, it enriches the reading experience. The paperback format enhances accessibility. Although some treasure hunt elements strain credulity, the compelling storytelling more than compensates. The author expertly weaves historical details—like the challenges of mining life and the instability of early film materials—into an unpredictable plot that steers clear of clichés. While I did predict a few twists, it felt intentional rather than formulaic. Additionally, the inclusion of historical context, such as the methods of mail delivery to 1940s Colorado mountains, adds depth and intrigue to the narrative.",
            "The friendships in this book are both heartwarming and resilient, navigating through heartache toward restoration. Rusty's letter-writing style is simultaneously hilarious and profound, perfectly capturing the idea of “iron sharpening iron.” I found myself wishing to befriend the characters, especially those in the town of Mercy Peak. Holden Huxley, in particular, intrigued me and left me wanting more. The story treats singleness with depth and respect, avoiding a dismissive \"who needs a man\" attitude.",
            "The author has become an auto-buy for me. Her books are sweet and gracious, emphasizing restoration and the power of friendship. With a gentle, lyrical style reminiscent of Jan Karon’s Mitford series, her writing reassures readers that everything will be okay, even in difficult times. The romances unfold slowly and are rooted in friendship and shared experiences rather than instant physical attraction. While not overtly Christian, the stories subtly weave faith into the characters’ decisions, highlighting the importance of turning to God in times of need.",
            "This book is a beautifully lyrical exploration of restoration, courage, new beginnings, and the power of friendship. The lost mailbag enriches minor characters, making their stories essential to the overall narrative. Themes of faith and hope are subtly interwoven, providing a comforting sense of reassurance."

Near the midpoint, my interest waned, but the narrative picked up when two girls embarked on a quest to solve an old mystery involving a theft.

The setting and friendship focus reminded me of a wonderful mix of *Fried Green Tomatoes* and *Beaches*.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  At its core, this is a novel about the power of friendship, with complementary themes of forgiveness, grieving, overcoming life's obstacles, and discovering the true treasures of life. As a Christian fiction novel, the Christian themes are well woven and integrated into the plot but are not overt.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  There is a mystery with riddles and clues, which was fun and gave me *National Treasure* or Dan Brown vibes. The strategic flashbacks made me focus to understand how they fit into the plot, adding depth and making the novel an immersive experience rather than a cookie-cutter read.  \n\n- **Characters and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  I became invested in the characters from the first pages and never felt bored. The joy of singleness was celebrated, and while there was a satisfying romance and a happily-ever-after (HEA), the romance was not the focus of the book.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is a brilliant mix of epistles, newspaper articles, scripts, and the lyrical prose of Amanda Dykes, who can paint with words in a way totally unique to herself. These styles are well mixed, enhancing the storytelling.  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  This book is easily one of the top 3 novels I've read this year and will make its way into the company of a select category of books that have absolutely blown me away.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully crafted historical fiction with a strong focus on friendship, forgiveness, and overcoming life's challenges. The mystery, well-integrated Christian themes, and unique writing style make it a standout read. It’s immersive, emotionally engaging, and one of the best books I’ve encountered this year.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the enthusiastic tone suggests a high rating, likely 5/5."

            "The story unfolds at a leisurely pace, akin to a scenic route over its 370 pages. While the treasure hunt introduces a layer of intrigue, the narrative lacks the fast-paced, action-driven momentum some readers might expect. Certain research-heavy segments could have benefited from trimming to enhance the overall flow. Set in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado between 1937 and 1948, the tale centers on the disappearance of the mail train Galloping Goose No. 8 and its repercussions for the mining town of Mercy Peak. The plot follows Mercy Windsor, a former Hollywood starlet, as she returns to her hometown to unravel the mystery surrounding her childhood friend, Rusty Bright, and a hidden treasure that could potentially save her community.",

Her authorial voice is original and refreshing, unafraid to incorporate lyricism and poetry, which I found to be a joy to read.  \n\n- **Themes and Continuity:**  \n  The recurring themes across her books—treasure, friendship, buried secrets (both literal and spiritual), lost love, adventure, and faith conquering fear—are fascinating and well-executed.

However, I tended to skim the clue-heavy sections, knowing the outcome would eventually be revealed.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed the backstage \"peeks\" into Hollywood's Golden Age, which added a unique and nostalgic layer to the story.  \n\n- **Use of Epistolary Elements:**  \n  While I appreciated the creativity, I found the insertions of letters, play scripts, telegrams, and diary segments a bit confusing at times, as I'm not a huge fan of epistolary works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book immensely for its beautiful prose, heartfelt characters, and unique blend of mystery and nostalgia.

It resonated deeply, capturing a range of emotions from hardship to healing and hope.  \n\n- **Themes and Message:**  \n  The author, Amanda, beautifully encapsulates the essence of the story in her note: “In this, there was hardship. In this, there was healing. In this, there was hope. In this, there was wholeness at the end.” The narrative revolves around the promise of restoration, as reflected in Joel 2:25: “I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten…” This theme of divine restoration, where God breathes life into what seems lost, is central to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Spiritual Growth:**  \n  The characters’ journeys reflect God’s work in their lives, sometimes swiftly and sometimes over years, to restore what had appeared utterly lost. This portrayal of spiritual growth and redemption adds depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a profound exploration of hardship, healing, and hope, anchored in the promise of divine restoration. It left a lasting impression on me, both emotionally and spiritually, as it beautifully illustrates how God can breathe life into even the most broken aspects of our lives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While I appreciated the array of mysteries, I found the number overwhelming—three major ones alongside several minor plots. I would have preferred a single central mystery with a few supporting ones. Set in the 1930s/40s, the novel follows Hollywood legend Mercy Windsor, who faces a tragedy on set and is subsequently blacklisted. Seeking solace, she retreats to the Colorado mountains, a place she has always considered home despite never having visited. The story weaves together various mysteries, including a missing Galloping Goose train and a hidden treasure linked to the previous owner of Mercy’s new home. The setting evokes a cozy, small-town atmosphere reminiscent of *Virgin River*.",
            "This book exudes a sweet, comforting tone, emphasizing the strong friendship between Mercy and Rusty. It skillfully blends mystery with historical fiction and captures the essence of small-town life, resulting in a warm and engaging atmosphere.",
            "This charming historical mystery blends elements of inspirational fiction and romance, making it an excellent choice for fans of historical narratives, intriguing mysteries, and small-town settings."

While I thought the number of mysteries was slightly overwhelming, the cozy tone and historical setting made it a delightful experience. I would highly recommend it to fans of historical fiction, mysteries, or anyone who enjoys small-town stories.",

That said, it’s perfectly acceptable because I do love her other books.  \n\n- **Pacing and Initial Engagement:**  \n  The first hundred pages left me a little befuddled, but once I passed that mark, the characters became more defined.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters, Mercy Windsor/Marybeth Spatts and Rusty Bright, were definitely my favorites. As long-time pen pals, they were building a budding friendship. Mercy uses both her stage name and her given name interchangeably, which was a bit confusing.  \n\n- **Themes and Setting:**  \n  The novel explores themes of old Hollywood, long-lost things, and lost friendships, which are central to this epic story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  I found the screenplays and field notes interspersed in the novel to be a bit distracting.  \n\n- **Author’s Reputation and Recommendations:**  \n  Amanda Dyke’s debut novel, *Whose Waves These Are*, is my favorite so far. I’ve read almost everything she has in print except for *All the Lost Places*, which I really need to read. I have no hesitation recommending her books, as she is a Christy Award-winning author for her debut and an Inspy Award winner as well. She has a nice backlist, so I recommend just about anything she writes.  \n\n- **Disclosure:**  \n  I borrowed a copy of this book from my local public library and was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 255, Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel wasn’t my favorite from Amanda Dyke, it still has its strengths, particularly in character development and thematic depth. Despite some initial confusion and distracting elements, her storytelling remains compelling, and I continue to recommend her work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
