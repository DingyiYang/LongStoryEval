A village teacher and co-founder of a pacifist movement, Alefret is unusually large and initially seen as dull, fixated only on basic needs. After seeking refuge in a city during the conflict, he loses a leg in a bombing and is subjected to an involuntary experimental treatment using genetically modified wasps to regrow his limb.

I'm steadily becoming convinced that everything she writes is a remarkable work of art. This is a dark, challenging work to get through, but it’s brilliant in its execution.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The novel is a dark, challenging exploration of war and resistance, ending on a hopeful note but with a grindingly bleak path to get there. It’s very, very good, but prepare yourself for Cormac McCarthy levels of bleak and dark.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is phenomenal. I love the snippets of myth and old cultural tidbits from Alefret's village. The sheer astonishing weirdness of Varkal's biotech, perfectly ordinary to Varkallagi residents and thus not meriting much mention, is wonderful and is presented so seamlessly by the author that lizard guns seem, in the moment, to make perfect sense.  \n\n- **Exploration of War and Resistance:**  \n  This is a brilliant reflection on how the systems that support and continue war function or cease to function, as well as how resistance movements function or cease to do so. The complex ethics of pacifism are explored in depth, and nobody is idealized. Neither side (Varkal or Meddon) is Right, and no one, even among the resistance, is uncomplicated to sympathize with (well, maybe with the exception of Cera).  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The novel includes psychological and physical torture, but no sexual violence.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPremee Mohamed’s novel is a dark, challenging, and phenomenally crafted work that delves deeply into the complexities of war, resistance, and pacifism.

His disability—a missing leg—along with his stature, is viewed as a challenge, yet he remains resilient and resourceful throughout his journey.",

            "The story unfolds in a fluid manner, characterized by its curved lines that make straightforward summarization challenging. The first three-fifths are notably low on action, focusing instead on an internal journey. Its five sections feature gentle transitions rather than rigid chapter breaks, enhancing the meditative tone of the narrative.",
            "The protagonist is gradually unveiled, with new insights continuing to emerge right up to the book's conclusion. While the secondary characters are well-defined and transcend mere archetypes, their personal narratives lack depth.",
            "The writing is skillful and expansive, highlighting the author's talent. The tone is slow and contemplative, a stark contrast to the fast-paced cosmic horror of Mohamed's *Beneath the Rising* trilogy. The narrative is beautifully crafted, emphasizing introspection and gentle exploration.",

However, its slow pace is counterbalanced by a strong focus, preventing it from feeling meandering. The characters' persistent urgency and internal despair create a compelling stylistic contrast that ultimately draws the reader in."

Despite being physically imposing and ostracized as a \"freak\" and \"monster,\" he is intelligent, thoughtful, and deeply committed to pacifism.\n   - Qhudur, Alefret's jailer and companion, is dangerous, unpredictable, and espouses disturbing, authoritarian views. His character contrasts sharply with Alefret's ideals.\n   - The dynamic between Alefret and Qhudur is central to the story, highlighting their ideological clashes and personal growth.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot follows Alefret and Qhudur's journey to infiltrate Meddon's floating city, with Alefret attempting to start a nonviolent revolution.\n   - The pacing is deliberate and reflective, focusing on the philosophical and moral dilemmas rather than fast-paced action.\n   - The resolution sees Alefret successfully thwarting Qhudur's violent plans and bringing down the floating city with minimal loss of life, though the ending suggests that the struggle for peace is far from over.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**\n   - The writing is introspective and philosophical, with a focus on character development and thematic exploration.\n   - The tone is serious and thought-provoking, inviting readers to reflect on the themes of violence, nonviolence, and societal change.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is an unusual and compelling blend of fantasy and science fiction, with a strong emphasis on philosophical and moral themes. The central conflict between violence and nonviolence, embodied by the complex characters of Alefret and Qhudur, makes for a deeply engaging and thought-provoking read. While the worldbuilding is secondary to the ideas and themes, the story is rich in character development and moral exploration. It’s a rewarding read for those willing to engage with its slower pace and profound questions.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

He is a smart, un-beautiful, and conflicted individual—a malformed giant with an amputated leg that is growing back due to experiments by a mad scientist. Despite his physical and emotional struggles, he is gentle, thoughtful, and immensely principled. His unwavering commitment to pacifism, even in the face of extreme provocation, makes him a compelling and unique character.  \n\n- **Themes and Moral Dilemmas:**  \n  The book delves deeply into the theme of pacifism, exploring how one can remain committed to non-violence when faced with opportunities to kill someone who poses a grave threat to others. Alefret’s interactions with a violent zealot he despises, yet refuses to harm, serve as a powerful examination of this moral dilemma. The story raises thought-provoking questions about the limits of pacifism and the cost of maintaining one’s principles.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world in which the story is set is highly original and imaginative. Alefret’s society has advanced bioengineering, resulting in living tools like drug-delivering wasps, bandage-making spiders, and bullet-producing lizards. The enemies possess a flying city, adding another layer of intrigue and creativity to the setting.

The characters are superbly developed, each with distinct personalities and motivations. Alefret, in particular, is a deeply layered and memorable protagonist.  \n\n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n  The story is completely unique, with a narrative that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The ending is entirely satisfying, tying up the story in a way that feels both earned and impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterful blend of compelling characters, thought-provoking themes, and an imaginative world.

            "The plot is subtle and compelling, leading to a tense climax. While the slow pacing initially felt tedious, it effectively heightened the tension between the protagonist and his companion. However, the ending felt rushed, cramming too much into the final section and leaving some elements unclear.",
            "In this gripping story, the protagonist, Alefret, a committed pacifist, embarks on an impossible mission alongside a fanatical soldier who despises him. The tension between Alefret's dedication to non-violence and the mission's demands serves as the central conflict, driving the narrative forward.",
            "The prose is rich and flows seamlessly, occasionally employing a high register without crossing into pretentiousness. The vivid and imaginative descriptions, such as “a sky the color of teeth” and “books leaping off the shelves like cats,” enhance the reading experience.",
            "The novel masterfully evokes a World War II-like atmosphere, immersing readers in battles, life within a besieged city, and an underground rebellion, all contributing to a brooding, sometimes feverish tone. The world-building is inventive, featuring one side employing animal-based technology—such as lizards as weapons and wasps for medical deliveries—while the other utilizes advanced gadgets and a floating city.",

The themes resonate powerfully in today's context, reflecting on global conflicts and humanity's potential for finding common ground.",
            "Despite some minor flaws, this is one of the best books I've read in recent months. While I enjoyed the author's previous works for their adventure and imagination, they didn't quite elevate the author to my top tier. This book, however, has changed my perspective entirely.",

This book, however, has erased my doubts.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n   - The book has a more serious tone compared to her previous works.  \n   - It delves deeply into the philosophy of pacifism and war, as well as the psychology of being born different and finding one’s place in society.  \n   - The themes are timely, reflecting on wars breaking out globally and the human capacity to find common ground.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot is subtle and convincing, building toward a tense climax.  \n   - The pacing starts slow, which I found a bit tedious, though it helped build tension between the protagonist and his companion.  \n   - The ending felt rushed, with a large portion of the story crammed into the final section, making it less clear than it could have been.  \n\n- **World-Building and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The novel creates an enveloping World War II-like atmosphere.  \n   - The setting includes battles, life in a besieged city, and an underground rebellion, all of which contribute to a broody, sometimes feverish tone.  \n   - The world-building is inventive, with one side using animal-based technology (e.g., lizards as guns, wasps delivering medicine) and the other relying on advanced gadgets and a floating city.  \n\n- **Prose and Descriptions:**  \n   - The prose is rich and flows beautifully, with a high register in places but never pretentious.  \n   - The descriptions are inventive and colorful, such as “a sky the color of teeth” or “books leaping off the shelves like cats.”  \n\n- **Genre and Originality:**  \n   - The book defies easy genre classification, blending elements of SF and fantasy without clear magic or technological novums.  \n   - It uses genre as a mirror to reflect human foibles and societal issues, which I found compelling.  \n\n- **Character Development and Conflict:**  \n   - The protagonist, Alefret, is a pacifist sent on an impossible mission, accompanied by a fanatical soldier who hates him.  \n   - The tension between Alefret’s commitment to pacifism and the demands of the mission is a central conflict, making his journey gripping.  \n\n- **Minor Criticisms:**  \n   - Some elements introduced early on (e.g., the leg, the wasps) didn’t play as significant a role in the conclusion as I expected.  \n   - The pacing issues, particularly the slow start and rushed ending, were noticeable but didn’t detract significantly from my enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a thoroughly recommended novel for readers seeking a fresh, genre-defying story with beautiful prose and deep thematic exploration. Despite minor pacing issues and unmet expectations for certain plot elements, the book’s rich atmosphere, inventive world-building, and compelling characters make it a standout.

His partnership with Qhudur, a brutishly simplistic character, complicates his journey and tests his pacifist ideals. The novel delves into the physical and emotional toll on Alefret, particularly his enduring pain, which enriches his character and adds depth to the story.",

Although the narrative is detailed, it lacks depth in its broader world-building, particularly concerning the origins of this world and its parallels to Earth.",

His companion is a consummate killer and soldier, and their interplay is intriguing and deeply layered.  \n   - There are no traditional heroes; Alefert comes closest, but the author challenges deeply rooted beliefs, leading to a conclusion that feels both inevitable and impossible to anticipate.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Style:**  \n   - The action is slow-paced, with significant time spent in the protagonist’s mind and heavy philosophical dialogue to digest.  \n   - Despite the slower pace, the novel is thoughtful and impressively intelligent, making it a rewarding read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a highly recommended novel that blends science fiction and fantasy with profound philosophical themes. While the pacing is slow, the depth of the characters, the intricate world-building, and the thought-provoking narrative make it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Highly recommended.

            "The ending feels abrupt and unclear, which diminishes some of the novel's themes and stops it from reaching true masterpiece status. Nevertheless, it remains a powerful and significant work, resonating with righteous anger and addressing contemporary issues.",
            "The dynamic between Alefret, a pacifist leader, and Qhudur, a staunch soldier, lies at the heart of the narrative. Their ideological clashes and mutual dependence propel the story forward. Alefret's struggles, shaped by his genetic condition and imprisonment, enrich his character and strengthen his dedication to nonviolence. In contrast, Qhudur critiques Alefret’s pacifism as naive and cowardly, underscoring the tension between idealism and pragmatism.",
            "The novel unfolds in a war-torn, nameless world that merges early 20th-century technology—guns, radios, and planes—with fantastical elements like biomedically altered creatures, including vaccine-hornets, pteridons, and bullet-producing lizards. While the secondary fantasy world is captivating, it remains only partially developed, inviting readers to fill in the gaps. The desolate grasslands and the enemy's floating city provide evocative backdrops for the characters’ journey and ideological discussions.",
            "The novel delves into deep questions surrounding war, violence, and pacifism, such as whether it is preferable to lose a war rather than prolong it, and if targeted violence can be justified to avert greater harm. It challenges simplistic good versus evil narratives, presenting complex moral dilemmas that lack clear resolutions. The story critiques nihilistic and violent worldviews, portraying them as repugnant while offering a nuanced perspective on the realities and consequences of war."

While its ending is somewhat flawed, the novel’s profound empathy, rich world-building, and resonant themes make it a standout work in speculative fiction. It deserves recognition alongside other great SFF novels about war, particularly for its ability to evoke the spirit of Ursula K. Le Guin.",

By the time I realized the plot was in full swing, I was already deeply absorbed.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**\n   - While fantasy and science fiction often focus on epic battles and grand conflicts, *The Siege of Burning Grass* stands out for being quiet, introspective, and mournful. It explores the futility and senselessness of war, presenting a stark contrast to the glorified violence typical of the genre.\n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**\n   - The story follows Alefret, a pacifist and founder of the Pact, who is grievously injured, imprisoned, and tortured by his own side. He is given a mission to infiltrate the enemy’s floating city to end the war. His journey is physically, mentally, and morally taxing, and the narrative delves deeply into his internal struggles and philosophical dilemmas.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**\n   - The world is vividly depicted, with lush and vibrant prose that contrasts sharply with the brutal realities of war. The floating cities, famine, child soldiers, and government atrocities are all portrayed with a stark, unflinching clarity.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - Mohammed’s writing is stunning—lush yet stark, beautiful yet violent.

These contrasting technological approaches enrich the world-building, although some elements, such as the possibility of mechanical life, are not fully developed.",

It centers on Alefret, a civilian who helped establish the Pact, a non-violence pledge, only to be persecuted and tortured by his government. The narrative illustrates the futility of war, with both sides entrenched in misconceptions about each other's beliefs, perpetuating a cycle of violence. Through characters like Alefret and Qhudur, the story prompts critical reflections on morality, the potential for peace, and the internal struggles faced amidst chaos."

In contrast, Qhudur is a bloodthirsty war hero, fanatically devoted to his nation's cause.

In contrast, Qhudur embodies the opposite extreme, raising the question of an individual's impact on their empire. The conflict between these two characters underscores the limitations of both ideologies, ultimately leading to a conclusion that critiques both men and their nations, while still offering a glimmer of hope."

        "conclusion": "*The Siege of Burning Grass* is a grim, thought-provoking war fantasy that excels in its character dynamics, world-building, and thematic depth. The author’s writing is both ferocious and poetic, creating a bleak yet oddly hopeful atmosphere. While the ending feels rushed, the journey is compelling and reflective of the futility and horrors of war. This standalone novel is a must-read for fans of darker, character-driven fantasy.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author’s Unique Perspective and Writing Style:**\n   - Premee Mohamed’s unique perspective on the Cthulhu mythos in her previous trilogy cemented her as an author to watch. She dismantles and rebuilds the mythos with fervent glee, paying homage while crafting her own compelling story.\n   - Her writing is energetic and rich in prose, with a cadence that commands attention. The book has a distinct voice, evoking a looming gothic horror vibe.\n   - The narrative builds tension like a Shepard tone, never releasing it, even at the end of chapters, which often conclude with a lack of consciousness, plunging the reader into a new hell.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**\n   - The focus on character and the strife between the two main leads, Alefret and Qhudur, is both brutal and beautiful.\n   - Alefret is a physically imposing yet passive pacifist, missing a leg due to a bomb from his own side. Qhudur is a bloodthirsty war hero, fanatically devoted to his nation’s cause.\n   - Their dynamic is a match made in heaven, with neither trying to convert the other. Instead, they act as counterarguments, constantly goading each other and exposing weaknesses in each other’s philosophies.\n   - Their conversations are short, terse, and often tense, reflecting their mutual disdain and exhaustion with their roles.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**\n   - The world is haunting and magnificent, with hints of a pre-war past that feels distant and unreachable.\n   - The setting is a vast wasteland, reflecting the exhaustion of both warring empires. Encounters with others are rare and often end in death, emphasizing the bleakness of the world.\n   - The technological disparity between the empires is clear, but both sides feel equally drained, fighting to the death out of necessity rather than conviction.\n\n- **Themes and Philosophical Exploration:**\n   - The book explores themes of pacifism, the futility of war, and the impotence of individuals against empires.\n   - Alefret’s pacifism is constantly tested, as he grapples with whether his actions aid the war effort and whether his principles are worth maintaining in the face of overwhelming odds.\n   - Qhudur represents the opposite extreme, embodying the question of what one man cannot do for his empire.\n   - The conflict between the two characters highlights the impotence of both ideologies, culminating in a finale that condemns both men and their nations while offering a faint glimmer of hope.\n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**\n   - The book is gripping and was read in just three sittings, but the ending comes faster than expected.\n   - The abruptness of the ending makes sense thematically, as the conclusion is not the focal point. Instead, the journey and the exploration of themes take precedence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*The Siege of Burning Grass* is a grim, thought-provoking war fantasy that excels in its character dynamics, world-building, and thematic depth. Premee Mohamed’s writing is both ferocious and poetic, creating a bleak yet oddly hopeful atmosphere. While the ending feels rushed, the journey is compelling and reflective of the futility and horrors of war. This standalone novel is a must-read for fans of darker, character-driven fantasy.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- *The Siege of Burning Grass* – Set up your tents, and make sure your supplies don’t run out as you go for the long haul. -Alex"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The novel is a slow burn, but the ending feels rushed.  \n   - The narrative could have been shorter, as the pacing doesn't always justify the length.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - The story is set on an empty planet, which is revealed late in the book. This setting reduces the complexity of the thought experiment, making it feel convenient rather than deeply explored.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The protagonist is a pacifist leader, portrayed as a rescuer of people, but his \"prophet-like\" demeanor feels unconvincing.  \n   - The hero's physical condition (missing leg, potential facial disfigurements) is inconsistently used in the narrative, appearing only when convenient to the plot.  \n   - The corporal, who acts more like an officer, lacks the authenticity of a lower-ranking soldier. His authority feels misplaced, and the expectation of a reveal (e.g., as Internal Intelligence) is unfulfilled.  \n\n- **Philosophical Themes:**  \n   - The protagonist's pacifist philosophy is central to the story, but his humility comes across as another form of arrogance, which feels unrealistic compared to real-life pacifists.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The book is beautifully written, with evocative and precise language that enhances the reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel is beautifully written and explores intriguing philosophical themes, its pacing, inconsistent characterization, and underdeveloped world-building detract from its overall impact. The rushed ending and unconvincing portrayal of key characters leave the reader wanting more depth and coherence.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The dichotomy of his physical ability, pain, and mental acuity is where his character truly shined.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel for its language, meditative tone, and the intriguing character of Alefret. However, the pacing issues and occasional confusion about the world-building slightly hindered my full immersion in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded up)."

The lack of depth in world-building, underdeveloped plot, and inconsistent character decisions detract from its potential. The moral dilemmas and intriguing concepts, such as flying cities and the role of bees, were not explored thoroughly, leaving the story feeling incomplete and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

After surviving a bombing and enduring torture in prison, Alefret undergoes experimental leg regrowth. However, the premise that a well-known pacifist like Alefret would be embraced by the resistance in Turmoskal to assist Qhudur in ending the war lacks logical coherence. His motivations remain unclear; he has no compelling reason to join the mission beyond a vague hope for peace, yet he continues to push forward despite being kept in the dark about Qhudur's violent agenda.",

The characters' decisions feel muddled and superficial, hindering my ability to empathize with or comprehend their choices.",

The characters, such as the visionary scientist and the fervent zealot Qhudur, are richly developed, showcasing the author's skill in creating multidimensional portrayals.",

Bioengineering is a central theme, with inventive elements like wasps that introduce surprising twists to the fantasy landscape. While the concept of a flying city is visually striking and rich in metaphor, it falls short in practicality and relies on unrealistic technology.",

            "This book centers on a war between two nations and the moral dilemmas faced by Alefret, a pacifist protagonist pressured to compromise his values in hopes of ending the conflict. The narrative contrasts Alefret's pacifism with the military dogma of Qhudur, emphasizing the harsh reality that violence often seems inevitable in resolving disputes. It critiques both war and pacifism, echoing contemporary conflicts such as Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine. The story powerfully conveys the devastating truth of violence as a driving force in human conflict, leaving readers with a profound sense of sadness and prompting reflection on the chaos and senselessness of war.",

Alefret’s evolution and tortured soul propel the story, making his struggles and inaction central to the book’s critique of pacifism. In contrast, Qhudur’s fanaticism highlights this theme further. Alefret’s indecision, particularly regarding Qhudur, is a significant aspect of his character, though it sometimes feels elusive and hard to fully grasp. While Alefret’s physical deformity is a prominent theme, its relevance to the broader narrative and critique of war remains ambiguous.",
