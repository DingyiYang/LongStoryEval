I love broken characters trying to figure things out, and these two are so wonderfully broken. I love it when characters need time to heal and realize that sometimes, love alone isn't enough to achieve your HEA. Sara is a master at creating characters that you instantly understand, relate to, and root for, even when you think you won't. How could I possibly relate to a grumpy Scotsman? Turns out I do!\n\n- **Narration Performance:**  \n  The acting was phenomenal! Both Kelli and Will are excellent at accent work. I had to keep reminding myself that this was a romance with an HEA, but thanks to the incredible acting and Sara's storytelling, I was still sobbing for these two. This audio is dual narration. I loved Kelli's rich and sultry voice. Her male Scottish voice was spot-on and oh-so-perfect! I love it when female narrators, with their talents alone, make you swoon for the MMC! She nailed all the accents, making it easy to tell each character apart while empathizing with their plight. This is the first audio of hers I've done, but I am hooked!! Will has a wonderfully deep and robust vocal range. His Scottish grump is perfect and so swoony! I don't think I've heard a book he's narrated that I haven't loved. I need more of this man in my ears. He is so talented!\n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The story was fan-f*cking-tastic! I was so invested in Killian and Sylvie's journey that I found myself sobbing for them, even though I knew they would get their HEA. Sara's storytelling, combined with the incredible narration, made the emotional depth of the story truly resonate with me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a masterclass in character development and emotional storytelling, brought to life by phenomenal narration. Sara's ability to create relatable, broken characters and the exceptional voice acting by Kelli and Will made this an unforgettable experience.

It evoked a range of emotions, from giddiness to frustration and swooning.  \n  - I felt so incredibly giddy in parts, frustratingly angry in others, and swoony as well.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Killian Barclay is a dark, mysterious, and complex character. He‚Äôs a recluse who hosts scandalous parties but hides deeper layers beneath his brutish exterior.  \n  - Sylvie Devereaux is strong-willed and determined, with a sharp wit that matches Killian‚Äôs intensity. Their dynamic is filled with banter, push-and-pull, and growth as they learn to work together.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The premise is intriguing: Sylvie agrees to marry Killian for ten million dollars, leading to a year-long arrangement filled with tension, conflict, and eventual understanding.  \n  - I wish the book had been another 500 pages to include more banter, fighting, angsty moments, and steamy scenes.  \n\n- **Romantic and Spicy Elements:**  \n  - The romance is spicy, sweet, and adorable, with plenty of steam and tension.  \n  - The push-and-pull between Killian and Sylvie is captivating, and I wanted even more of their angsty moments and chemistry.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  - The narrators did a fabulous job, and I loved listening to every second of the audiobook.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a rollercoaster of emotions, blending spice, sweetness, and angst in a way that left me craving more. The characters were compelling, the plot was engaging, and the narration was excellent. Sara Cate has once again delivered a story that hits all the right notes, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what she comes up with next!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific numerical rating mentioned in the review.)"

Initially, Sylvie appeared spoiled, entitled, and somewhat selfish, but her transformation throughout the story was remarkable, ultimately making me root for her.

However, the story wrapped up so perfectly that I‚Äôm willing to wait for the next installment. I‚Äôll likely purchase the rest of the series when it‚Äôs released since I‚Äôve already invested in this first book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, Sylvie and Killian, were incredibly meaningful and well-developed. They‚Äôve become two of my all-time favorite characters, and their journey was unforgettable.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The story wasn‚Äôt just about BDSM, as the warnings might suggest. Instead, it focused on two broken individuals who initially hated each other, fell in love, and then had to separate to heal before coming together as whole, free people. This emotional depth made the story resonate with me.  \n\n- **Tone and Enjoyment:**  \n  The book was a fun and engaging read, especially the holiday scenes, which felt timely since it‚Äôs currently the Christmas season for me.  \n\n- **Ending Satisfaction:**  \n  I was grateful for the happy ending for Sylvie and Killian, as it left me feeling happy and satisfied.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial hesitation about the book being part of an unfinished series, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The characters, emotional depth, and satisfying ending made it a memorable and enjoyable read. I look forward to the next installment in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Killian Barclay, on the other hand, is a reclusive, angry man consumed by heartache and excess, which has turned his ancestral home into a family disgrace. Despite his flaws, he is a broken character who elicits empathy and affection from the reader. \n\nThe relationship between Sylvie and Killian begins with tension, banter, and palpable animosity, set against the backdrop of a shocking and unconventional meet-cute.

            "This marriage of convenience story set in Scotland features the rich, grumpy Killian and is executed brilliantly. It's one of my favorite examples of the trope. The slow burn from forced proximity to genuine feelings is incredibly satisfying. While the friends-with-benefits angle didn't work at first, the evolution of their relationship was perfect.",
            "Killian is a wonderfully grumpy character, and I loved witnessing his gradual transformation as he warmed up to Sylvie. His shift from being closed off to boldly declaring, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine, deal with it,‚Äù was both charming and endearing. Sylvie, on the other hand, is relatable and hilarious, especially her impulsive decision to move to Scotland to marry a man who initially despised her. The forced proximity and their slow-building bond were beautifully crafted, making their journey of opening up and falling in love truly heartwarming. I absolutely adored their relationship."

However, it turned out to be such a good story, far exceeding what I anticipated.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n  The marriage of convenience trope set in Scotland with a rich, grumpy man named Killian was executed brilliantly. It‚Äôs one of my favorite marriage-of-convenience stories I‚Äôve read. The slow burn from forced proximity to genuine feelings was incredibly satisfying. The friends-to-benefits angle didn‚Äôt work initially, but the way their relationship evolved was perfect.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Killian was such a sad, grumpy character (Grumpy with a capital G), and I loved how he slowly warmed up to Sylvie. His transformation from being closed off to declaring, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine, deal with it,‚Äù was adorable. Sylvie, on the other hand, was relatable and hilarious. Her willingness to drop everything and move to Scotland to marry a hot man who hated her was so entertaining.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The forced proximity and slow-building bond between Killian and Sylvie were beautifully written. Watching them open up to each other and fall in love was heartwarming. I absolutely adored their relationship.  \n\n- **Narration and Performance:**  \n  The audiobook narration was fantastic. Will Watt‚Äôs Scottish accent was a treat, and the voice actress for Sylvie did an amazing job bringing her character to life.  \n\n- **Author and Series Potential:**  \n  This was my first Sara Cate book, and it definitely won‚Äôt be my last. I‚Äôm eager to check out more of her work and the rest of this series, especially if it involves Killian‚Äôs brothers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful surprise, blending humor, romance, and a slow-burn relationship that I couldn‚Äôt get enough of. The characters were well-developed, the narration was excellent, and the story kept me hooked from start to finish. I highly recommend it and can‚Äôt wait to read more from Sara Cate.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.75‚≠êÔ∏è"

            "The story features several time jumps, leaving me longing for more in-depth moments between Killian and Sylvie. The ending felt abrupt and lacking in closure, which was disappointing; while epilogues aren't essential, a more resolved conclusion would have been welcome. That said, the marriage of convenience trope, along with the Beauty and the Beast vibes, made for an enjoyable read. Focused on Killian, a reclusive Scottish billionaire, and Sylvie, who finds herself caught breaking into his mansion, their relationship transitions from enemies to lovers, infused with plenty of tension and chemistry.",
            "Killian and Sylvie have strong personalities that initially clash, reminiscent of cats and dogs. Their sudden realization of chemistry may feel abrupt, but it aligns well with their characters. Both are grumpy, enhancing their dynamic, while their forced proximity fosters growth and connection.",
            "The romance primarily unfolds in Killian's mansion, echoing the Beauty and the Beast theme. However, the story would have been enhanced by exploring additional settings. The briefly mentioned parties hosted by Killian felt underdeveloped, missing an opportunity for richer storytelling."

However, as the narrative unfolds, their growth becomes apparent, and their backstories provide context for their behavior, making them more relatable and endearing. Their relationship evolves beautifully, featuring tender moments alongside spicy scenes.

Their dynamic was a real \"hate-to-love\" situation, and their romance felt incredibly passionate because of it.  \n\n- **Romantic Tropes:**  \n  The story incorporated some of my favorite tropes: marriage of convenience, grumpy x grumpy, and forced proximity. These elements added depth and tension to the relationship.  \n\n- **Character Appeal:**  \n  Killian, the Scottish broody man, was undeniably hot! However, I do think he could‚Äôve been kinkier, considering that was such a big part of his character. I was expecting more exploration in that area.  \n\n- **Scene Execution:**  \n  There was one BDSM-related scene between the couple that I thought was done beautifully. It was so emotionally charged and well-written‚Äîonly Sara Cate could pull off something like that!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel delivered a passionate and emotionally charged romance with strong character dynamics and thoughtful mental health representation. While I wished for more exploration of Killian‚Äôs kinkier side, the story still managed to captivate me with its tropes and beautifully executed scenes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story centers on a marriage of convenience between tough New Yorker Sylvie Devereaux and Scottish playboy Killian Barclay. Initially caught sneaking into Barclay Manor, Sylvie is presented with a deal by Killian's sister: marry Killian to enhance his reputation, stay for a year, and receive $10 million. However, the true intention is for Sylvie to win Barclay Manor in the divorce and hand it over to Killian's manipulative family. The plot is emotionally charged, filled with tension and passion as the characters' relationship evolves.",
            "Sylvie and Killian are strong-willed characters whose frequent clashes create a dynamic rich in tension and chemistry. What begins as a contentious arrangement gradually evolves into a passionate connection. Their emotional journey is marked by frustration, anticipation, and heartbreak, especially during the poignant third-act breakup.",
            "The author is renowned for her spicy, kink-focused novels, but *Keep Me* is notably more subdued. While it includes elements of BDSM, the primary emphasis is on the emotional and romantic growth of the characters. The story is engaging and elicits a variety of emotions, making it an enjoyable read."

While it is less intense in terms of kink compared to the author's other works, it delivers a compelling story with strong character dynamics and a satisfying emotional arc.

            "I love a couple that uses bickering as foreplay, and *Keep Me* delivers just that. Sylvie, shaped by a neglectful past and a string of bad partners, is determined to stand on her own. When offered a $10 million boon, she agrees to deceive Killian, the man who recently rejected her. Beneath his gruff exterior, Killian harbors deep wounds, and Sylvie sees through his defenses. Their constant sparring reignites his sense of vitality, complicating his feelings of hatred toward her. The first half of the book captivated me with the characters' emotional armor; both are defensive yet yearning for love, unsure how to embrace it. By the halfway mark, Killian enters his \"My Wife\" phase, while Sylvie becomes focused on helping him heal from his past traumas, drawn to his physicality in the process.",

He falls in love with Sylvie first, but his frequent insults (e.g., calling her a cow) make him unlikable at times.  \n  - **Sylvie:** While she tries to help Killian and her love for him is evident, her entitled attitude (already well-off but seeking financial independence) detracts from her likability.  \n  - **Side Characters:** These were enjoyable and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  - The relationship between Killian and Sylvie is marked by mutual rudeness and hostility, which can be off-putting. However, their emotional connection and Sylvie's efforts to support Killian add depth to their dynamic.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  - The book lacks the BDSM and intense smut typically expected from the author. Instead, the romantic scenes are softer and less explicit.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The author‚Äôs attention to mental health and the realistic portrayal of healing are commendable. However, the heavy name-calling and rudeness between the main characters may not appeal to all readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Keep Me* was an enjoyable read with a strong focus on mental health and realistic healing timelines. While the characters‚Äô hostility and lack of intense spice were drawbacks, the emotional depth and side characters added value. I would recommend it to readers who can tolerate the characters‚Äô rudeness and are looking for a softer romantic story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê.5/5  \n- Spice: üå∂Ô∏èüå∂/5  \n- Characters: üíÉüíÉüèΩüíÉüèΩ/5"

The Beauty and the Beast vibes, along with the character development, kept me hooked, even if I had some reservations about certain character actions.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I anticipated a story heavy on spice rather than plot, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a compelling narrative alongside the heat. The tale centers on a grumpy Scottish billionaire known for his playboy ways and an American tourist whom his family persuades to marry him. He believes this union will enhance his reputation and secure his family castle, but the marriage contract holds deeper secrets. Their relationship evolves from strangers to adversaries, filled with conflict and banter, before blossoming into something more profound as they share their pasts and struggles. The tension escalates when he uncovers the true reason behind her agreement to marry him.",
            "The male main character (MMC) is grumpy, morally gray, and not the typical golden retriever type, which may not resonate with all readers. However, his redemption arc is satisfying, leading to a sweeter conclusion than I expected. The female main character (FMC) is well-developed, and the dual POV enriches their evolving relationship.",
            "The book skillfully weaves together popular tropes such as forced proximity, grumpy/grumpy dynamics, enemies to lovers, marriage of convenience, and a reformed playboy. Additionally, its representation of mental health adds significant emotional depth to the narrative."

The story revolves around a grumpy Scottish billionaire with a playboy reputation and an American tourist his family enlists to marry him. He believes the marriage will help his reputation and secure his family castle, but there‚Äôs more to the marriage contract than he knows.

The tension builds when he discovers the real reason she agreed to marry him.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The male main character (MMC) is grumpy, mean, and morally gray, which might not appeal to fans of golden retriever-type MMCs.

The female protagonist (MFC) often comes across as spoiled and entitled, particularly in her expectation that her parents should support her despite her poor financial choices.

It was so much more than I thought this book was going to be.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations, delivering not only the kinky fun I associate with Sara's work but also a deeply emotional and satisfying story. The characters, their growth, and the romantic tension were all highlights, though the audiobook narration with heavy Scottish accents was a bit overwhelming for me. Overall, a fantastic read with a perfect ending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars"

Their growth from a potential disaster to matters of the heart was beautifully portrayed.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The subtle romantic gestures, like him calling her ‚ÄúMo Ghraidh‚Äù (my love) early on without her knowing its meaning, added a layer of sweetness and depth to their relationship.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a standout in the author‚Äôs repertoire, blending romance, emotional depth, and character growth in a way that feels fresh and heartfelt. What began as a story of convenience and conflicting interests transformed into a deeply moving tale of love and partnership.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The ending, in particular, felt inconsistent and left several unresolved issues, detracting from the overall satisfaction of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nSpicy***** (This likely refers to the level of romantic or sexual tension in the story, rated highly by the reviewer.)"

While it lacked the emotional intensity I craved in the third act, it was still a refreshing and enjoyable story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot quite a full 4 stars, but close."

The goodbye scene was so emotional that it made me cry my eyes out.  \n- **Plot and Conflict Resolution:**  \n  The story avoids the typical breakup trope, which I found refreshing. However, I felt that the mother‚Äôs apology came across as a bit too sudden and lacked sufficient reasoning, making it feel slightly out of the blue.  \n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book had a strong emotional impact on me, especially during the goodbye scene, which was incredibly moving.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation:**  \n  I absolutely loved this book and can‚Äôt wait to read more from Sara Cate. It left me wanting more of her storytelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a heartfelt and emotional read with well-developed characters and a refreshing take on relationships. While the mother‚Äôs apology felt a bit abrupt, the overall story was deeply satisfying and left me eager for more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It added intensity and realism to their relationship, making it more compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had a strong start with its character dynamics and tension, though the audiobook narration had some flaws. Switching to the ebook enhanced my enjoyment, and the slow-burn romance with its intense moments was a highlight.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While it might not hold up under intense scrutiny, my initial impression was solid, and it reminded me of Tessa Bailey‚Äôs style, which I enjoy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

I love her writing, stories, and the emotions she sparks whenever I read one of her books. *Keep Me* was a different style than Sara Cate's usual, but I appreciate that she wrote something special to her and could creatively write something so unapologetically her.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n  I liked the plot, the arranged marriage, and the dislike-to-love trope. It was a good time, and who doesn‚Äôt love a guy with a Scottish accent and a little bit of damage?  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book had good character growth, especially for the main characters. However, the female main character (FMC) was a little annoying, and I couldn‚Äôt look past it, even as her character developed over time.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  While it was a good read, some parts of the story didn‚Äôt keep me as interested as her other books. I understand she took a different turn with this book, but it didn‚Äôt fully captivate me throughout.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The book was cute, spicy, and enjoyable overall.

His problems didn‚Äôt feel more significant than those of the average male main character (MMC). Sylvie, on the other hand, was unbearable at first.

I felt the author tried to incorporate too many elements at once, which left certain parts underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I enjoyed elements of Killian and Sylvie‚Äôs relationship and how their personalities meshed well together. However, their transition from hating to loving each other felt rushed, and I didn‚Äôt feel like we got to see that shift fully on the page.  \n\n- **Conflict and Drama:**  \n  There was potential for dramatic OM/OW (other man/other woman) drama, but it never fully materialized, which felt like a missed opportunity.  \n\n- **Kink and Themes:**  \n  The kink was pretty tame, especially for Sara Cate, and didn‚Äôt stand out as much as I expected. The mental health themes, while present, felt like they escalated from 0 to 100 in terms of severity, which was a bit jarring.  \n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  The audiobook was good but not great. I loved Will Watt‚Äôs narration, but Kelli Tager‚Äôs Scottish accent felt a little cringe to me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues and underdeveloped elements, I still enjoyed this romance and am excited to see what Sara Cate comes up with next in this interconnected standalone series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Story: 3/5  \n- Audiobook: 3/5"

            "The book excels in its portrayal of BDSM, but its toxic relationship dynamics and uneven character development diminish the overall experience. The happy ending feels unearned and fleeting, as only one character confronts their issues, leaving the future of the relationship in doubt.",
            "In this story, the male protagonist, Killian, is portrayed as toxic and manipulative. His derogatory remarks, such as calling the female protagonist a cow, and his deceit regarding their open marriage make him difficult to empathize with. Sylvie, the female protagonist, grapples with the emotional fallout from her parents' neglect and her boyfriend's betrayal. However, her emotional growth feels unrealistic, particularly when her issues seem to resolve abruptly after her parents' secretary is fired. The relationship between Killian and Sylvie is fundamentally flawed, lacking a healthy foundation. Their dynamic is toxic, and the happy ending feels forced and unsustainable. \n\nOn a positive note, Killian's decision to seek therapy and work on himself demonstrates a level of self-awareness and growth that is often absent in similar characters. In contrast, Sylvie's character arc feels incomplete, as she does not experience the same depth of personal development. Her unresolved trauma and absence of therapy leave her growth feeling unfulfilled.",
            "The BDSM elements of the story are skillfully crafted, distinguished by their emotional depth. Unlike many novels that emphasize only the physical aspects, this one beautifully weaves in the emotional connection between the characters. Killian's dominance is portrayed with clear and relatable motivations, a refreshing change from characters whose dominance feels arbitrary or unrealistic. The author approaches the BDSM scenes with taste, ensuring they are both sweet and meaningful rather than merely sensational."

Her unresolved trauma and lack of therapy make her character arc feel incomplete.  \n\n- **Overall Satisfaction and Ending:**  \n  - While the book has its strengths, particularly in its portrayal of BDSM, the toxic relationship and uneven character development detract from the overall enjoyment.  \n  - The happy ending feels unearned and temporary, as only one character addresses their issues, leaving the relationship's future uncertain.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a mixed bag, with well-executed BDSM elements and some positive character growth overshadowed by a toxic relationship and uneven character development. While the emotional depth of the BDSM scenes is commendable, the unresolved issues and unrealistic resolutions make the story feel incomplete and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The tension and chemistry between Sylvie and Killian are masterfully crafted. Their push-and-pull dynamic and the will-they/won‚Äôt-they suspense in the first half are utterly captivating. When they finally come together, the intensity of their passion is breathtaking. Their stubbornness and the seemingly insurmountable obstacles they face create a deliciously agonizing tension that I both loved and hated. While I may not like Killian, I sympathize with him; everyone in his life claims to know what's best for him, yet no one truly helps‚Äîonly seeks to control him. This resonates with my own feelings of alienation and misunderstanding. Sylvie, though prickly, is entirely believable and sympathetic due to her circumstances. It‚Äôs hard not to feel compassion for her. Killian, an agoraphobic and broken man grappling with the tragic loss of his parents through drinking and partying, is deeply flawed yet compelling, making him a fascinating character to follow.",

            "This book is a deeply emotional journey, filled with gut-wrenching moments that make you want to both confront and comfort the characters. At its core, it explores the theme of learning to love oneself while grappling with personal brokenness. Sylvie and Killian's fractured pieces fit together in a way that makes their relationship beautifully painful. The intensity of their fear, longing, jealousy, passion, and grief is amplified by the impossible circumstances they face, particularly for Sylvie, who knows their connection will ultimately lead to heartache."

            "This story features an arranged marriage and a delightful enemies-to-lovers trope between two characters who discover they need each other more than they realized. While Sylvie's initial deception was occasionally frustrating, I appreciated her willingness to stand up for Killian, even when she believed she hated him. Their evolving trust and friendship was beautifully portrayed and felt genuinely special. Both Sylvie and Killian are complex, misunderstood characters grappling with buried pain that drives their impulsive and reckless behavior. Sylvie may initially appear spoiled and reckless, while Killian comes off as a recluse, but both possess significant depth. I found myself completely enamored with Killian, experiencing every emotion he felt. The character growth for both Sylvie and Killian was remarkable, as they learned to work on themselves individually to become whole together.",

I blame Killian for all of it‚Äîthat gorgeous jerk.\n\n- **Plot and Romance Development:**  \n  Is this the start of a meet-cute romance? Ummm... no.

            "The book centers on Sylvie, who sneaks into a Scottish house to see a famous heirloom and unexpectedly meets Killian, a highlander. She later accepts a marriage proposal from his family, aimed at improving his playboy reputation, with the stipulation that she receives $10 million after a year. The plot revolves around a fake marriage, with both characters harboring ulterior motives: Sylvie has her own hidden agenda, while Killian seeks to appease his family. As the story unfolds, their relationship evolves from mutual disdain to understanding and support.",
            "Initially, Killian comes across as a brute and an unlikable character, making it difficult to connect with him. However, as his struggles and vulnerabilities unfold, he becomes more relatable.

Both characters experience significant personal growth, learning to support and stand up for each other despite the facade of their fake marriage.",

Killian, the MMC, initially seems unlikable, but his character arc ultimately reveals his depth, which I came to appreciate. The female lead, though entitled, is shaped by her difficult upbringing with neglectful parents, adding layers to her character. Their relationship, rooted in mutual anger and dissatisfaction, feels both necessary and compelling.

            "\"Keep Me\" is the first installment in the Sinful Manor series, and it certainly lives up to the hype. I was eager to dive into this story, and it did not disappoint. Sylvie embarks on a vacation in Scotland with her soon-to-be ex-boyfriend, where they search for an antique typewriter. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she sneaks into Killian's manor, setting off a chain of events that changes everything. Upon returning home, she discovers her boyfriend in a compromising situation with her former best friend. In a surprising twist, Sylvie is offered $10 million to marry Killian for a year, a proposition she never imagined would lead to unexpected love.",

Lacking any form of affection, they even severed her financial support, leaving her in a state of desperation.

            "At first, I found it hard to connect with the main characters, but by the end, I grew to love them. Their flaws and emotional scars made their journey feel genuine. Although their turmoil originates from different places, they manage to bond amid the chaos of their lives. The hate-to-love dynamic was captivating, and their marriage of convenience, while questionable, added depth to their relationship. I appreciated how they supported each other without attempting to \"fix\" one another; Sylvie didn‚Äôt see herself as Killian‚Äôs savior, and Killian took the necessary steps to heal, which felt both realistic and empowering. As expected from the author, the spice was fantastic, enhancing the story's intensity. The execution of the hate-to-love dynamic, including the \"hate sex,\" effectively heightened the emotional and physical chemistry between the characters.",

They are flawed, damaged, and protective of themselves, which made their journey feel authentic.  \n   - Their emotional turmoil stems from different places, but they find a way to connect through the messiness of their lives.  \n   - The hate-to-love dynamic was compelling, and their marriage of convenience, though sketchy, added an intriguing layer to their relationship.  \n   - The way they supported each other without trying to \"fix\" one another was refreshing. Sylvie didn‚Äôt position herself as Killian‚Äôs savior, and Killian had to do the work to heal himself, which felt realistic and empowering.  \n\n- **Mental Health Representation:**  \n   - The book doesn‚Äôt take a cookie-cutter or overly simplistic approach to mental health. Killian‚Äôs struggles are severe, and the story avoids the trope of ‚Äúlove saving him.‚Äù  \n   - Sylvie has her own emotional baggage, and the narrative doesn‚Äôt portray her as a savior but rather as someone who supports Killian while he takes responsibility for his own healing.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Experience):**  \n   - The audiobook narration was exceptional. Will Watt, one of my favorite Scottish narrators, and Kelli Tager delivered performances filled with depth and emotion, elevating the story to another level.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Nuance:**  \n   - The story is deeply emotional, with a lot of nuance and complexity. The characters‚Äô journeys felt visceral and real, making their eventual connection all the more beautiful.  \n\n- **Spice and Romance:**  \n   - As expected from Sara Cate, the spice was fantastic and added intensity to the story. The hate-to-love dynamic, including the ‚Äúhate s3x,‚Äù was executed well and contributed to the emotional and physical chemistry between the characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a deeply emotional and nuanced story with flawed, relatable characters who grow and heal together in a realistic and beautiful way.

            "I felt that the pivotal moment leading Killian and Sylvie to fall in love was somewhat elusive. Perhaps some scenes were cut? While we experience a year of their lives in the manor, I believe there were crucial moments that I needed to see to fully understand their connection.",
            "I adored Killian and Sylvie as a couple. Initially, their hate-to-love dynamic felt a bit exaggerated, but it became more understandable as we learned about their personal traumas. I appreciated their evolving connection and the ways they supported one another. Their selfish desires transformed into genuine efforts to improve each other's lives, which was truly beautiful to witness.",

It's always such a wonderful place for romance.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - I loved Killian and Sylvie. They were a great couple. The hate-to-love dynamic felt a tad over the top at first, but it made sense as we got to know their personal traumas and what bothered them.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationship Growth:**\n   - I really enjoyed their growing connection and how they found ways to support each other. Their selfish desires turned into efforts to better each other's lives, which was beautiful to see.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**\n   - I feel like I missed the tipping point that drove Killian and Sylvie into love. Maybe some of it got cut? We cover a year of their lives in the manor, but I feel like we missed more that I needed to see.\n\n- **Kink and Spice Level:**\n   - I do feel like the kink was played a little safe. We were teased with some really sexy things, but I expected a bit more pizazz from Sara Cate.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**\n   - I read a physical copy AND I was blessed with an ALC, which was narrated by Will Watt & Kelli Tager. Will Watt gave a wonderful performance, and Kelli Tager had a solid showing, though her Scottish performance was a bit off.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this was a really enjoyable story, and I can't wait for more. Despite a few minor issues with pacing and the spice level, the setting, characters, and their development made for a compelling read. The audiobook narration added an extra layer of enjoyment, with strong performances from both narrators.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 4 stars\n- 3 on the spice scale\n\n**Content Warnings:**\n- Parental neglect, PTSD, death, agoraphobia, alcoholism, elements of BDSM\n\n*Thank you to Dreamscape Media, Sourcebooks Casablanca, and Sara Cate for early copies of this book.*"

These are my honest thoughts.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows a stuck-up New Yorker whose parents cut her off financially.

The connection and bond that forms between these strangers-turned-enemies-to-lovers is beautiful. Both characters thrive on shock value, but their dynamic works because they feed off each other's energy. What starts as a one-year contractual marriage evolves into something much deeper.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The third act had me completely immersed in my feelings.

Both narrators delivered stellar performances, perfectly capturing the snotty New Yorker and the grumpy Scotsman. The drama, passion, and heartbreak were conveyed brilliantly, making the audiobook highly recommended.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a compelling and emotional read with well-developed characters and a unique premise.

The dual POV offers valuable insight into both characters, enhancing the emotional impact of the story.",
            "Killian and Sylvie's relationship begins tumultuously, marked by name-calling and verbal clashes, but it gradually transforms into a nuanced and engaging bond. Both characters carry trauma and past experiences that obstruct their chances for a fulfilling future, yet their growth and vulnerability inspire readers to root for them. Their journey from animosity to love is both authentic and gratifying.",
            "**Review:**\n\nThis story features several compelling tropes, including an age gap of over 11 years, a broody hero, and a grumpy x grumpy dynamic. It explores themes of hurt and comfort, loathe-to-love, and the complexities of tortured main characters, all while incorporating the unique element of writing novels on typewriters. \n\nHowever, readers should be aware of potential triggers such as absentee parenting, neglect, agoraphobia, alcoholism, explicit sexual content, implied debauchery, infidelity (not involving the main characters), panic attacks, and parental death. \n\nThe writing is immersive, with striking quotes that effectively convey the characters' emotions and the intensity of their relationship. The open-door spice, including BDSM elements, is seamlessly integrated, enhancing the intimacy between the characters.",

            "Set primarily in the Scottish Highlands, this story follows a grumpy, reclusive Scotsman and a newly single American woman. The plot centers on an arranged marriage of convenience aimed at enhancing the male lead's reputation. It weaves together themes of deception, emotional growth, and the tension between love and personal gain.",
            "Killian Barclay is a brooding Scottish highlander with a dark past and an Alphahole demeanor, making him a compelling and unique twist on the grumpy Scot trope. Sylvie Devereaux, a tough and independent New Yorker shaped by a neglected upbringing, undergoes significant growth as she connects with Killian. Their intense chemistry forms the emotional core of the story, driving the narrative forward. While the book promises steam and spice, it leans more toward angst than a constant barrage of explicit scenes. Although there are moments of BDSM and erotica, they are less frequent and intense than anticipated based on promotional material. A standout moment of tension and passion occurs in the stair scene, highlighting the depth of their relationship.",
            "The author's writing is clean and fluid, allowing me, as a first-time reader, to easily immerse myself in the story. The narrative flows seamlessly, striking a perfect balance of angst, romance, and character development."

        "conclusion": "*Keep Me* is a captivating romance set in the Scottish Highlands, featuring a grumpy, growly Scotsman and a strong-willed American woman. The author's writing is fluid and engaging, with well-developed characters and a compelling emotional arc. While the book delivers on steam and angst, it slightly underdelivers on the promised intensity of BDSM/erotica. The audiobook narration by Will Watt and Kelli Tager is exceptional, bringing the characters to life. Despite a few areas for improvement, the story is entertaining and leaves readers eager for more from this world.",

            "The first half of *Keep Me* unfolds slowly, as the characters take time to resonate with the reader. Their constant bickering and strong personalities can initially feel overwhelming. However, the second half becomes much more engaging, featuring satisfying character arcs and a heartwarming conclusion. Some aspects, such as time jumps and off-page character development, could have been better executed. \n\nThis intriguing enemies-to-lovers story centers on Sylvie, who breaks into the Scottish manor of the grumpy billionaire Killian, leading to a fiery confrontation. This encounter sparks a series of events that culminate in Sylvie, already feeling broken and alone, agreeing to a marriage of convenience with Killian for $10 million to help improve his reputation. The narrative weaves in themes of forced proximity, family drama, and secrets, all set against a backdrop of Scottish charm and kilts.",
            "Sylvie and Killian are initially challenging characters to embrace due to their strong, flawed personalities. Sylvie appears entitled and reckless, while Killian comes off as brutish with a tendency for outbursts. However, as the story unfolds, their complexities emerge. Sylvie's deep loneliness and yearning for love become apparent, while Killian's unaddressed trauma and insecurities are revealed. Their growth is compelling: Sylvie evolves into a more grounded and selfless individual, while Killian confronts his past and softens. \n\nThe romance is the story's highlight, featuring witty banter, palpable chemistry, and a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers dynamic. Their relationship transforms from hostility to a profound connection, making their marriage of convenience feel genuine as they navigate their unexpected romance, despite the angst and drama that accompany their journey. \n\nThe spice in this novel is lighter compared to the author's previous works. While there are references to kinky parties and BDSM, these elements are not central to the narrative and feel somewhat unresolved. Notably, the romance does not rely heavily on sexual tension for character development, marking a departure from the author's usual style.",
            "The Scottish setting and the manor lend a charming backdrop to the story; however, certain plot elements, such as the kinky parties, Sylvie‚Äôs family dynamics, and Killian‚Äôs past affair, feel underdeveloped or unresolved. The narrative also hints at potential spin-offs featuring Killian‚Äôs siblings, which could further enrich the world and explore more of Scotland beyond the manor."

        "conclusion": "*Keep Me* is a sweet yet turbulent romance with a strong enemies-to-lovers dynamic and compelling character growth. While the first half is slow and some plot elements feel unresolved, the second half shines with authentic chemistry and a satisfying resolution. The audiobook narration is exceptional, adding depth to the characters. Fans of the author will appreciate this softer, more romantic take, though it may differ from the usual spice-heavy stories they are accustomed to.",

The heroine, Sylvie, breaks into the Scottish manor of Killian, a grumpy billionaire, leading to a vitriolic meeting. This sets off a chain of events where Sylvie, already broken and alone, agrees to a marriage of convenience with Killian to help his reputation in exchange for $10 million.\n   - The story incorporates elements of forced proximity, family drama, and secrets, with a backdrop of Scottish brooding charm and kilts.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Sylvie and Killian are initially hard to love due to their strong, flawed personalities. Sylvie comes off as entitled and reckless, while Killian is brutish and prone to nasty outbursts. However, as the story progresses, their layers are revealed. Sylvie is deeply lonely and desperate for love, while Killian harbors unaddressed trauma and insecurities.\n   - Their growth is compelling. Sylvie becomes more grounded and selfless, and Killian softens and confronts his past. Their connection feels authentic and transformative, even if their love develops quickly.\n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**\n   - The romance is the highlight of the story, with sassy banter, kinetic chemistry, and a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers dynamic.

However, some elements, like time hops and off-page character growth, could have been better developed.\n\n- **Spice and Kink:**\n   - The spice in this novel is softer and lighter compared to other Sara Cate works. While there are mentions of kinky parties and BDSM, these elements are not central to the story and feel somewhat unresolved or unnecessary.\n   - The romance doesn‚Äôt rely heavily on sexual tension as a catalyst for character growth, which is a departure from the author‚Äôs usual style.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**\n   - Will Watt and Kelli Tager deliver outstanding performances in the audiobook.

Kelli brings empathy and gravitas to Sylvie, making her relatable even in her more petulant moments.\n\n- **World-Building and Loose Ends:**\n   - The Scottish setting and the manor add charm to the story, but some plot elements feel underdeveloped or unresolved, such as the kinky parties, Sylvie‚Äôs family dynamics, and Killian‚Äôs past affair.\n   - The story leaves room for potential spin-offs involving Killian‚Äôs brothers and sister, which could expand the world and explore more of Scotland beyond the manor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Keep Me* is a sweet yet turbulent romance with a strong enemies-to-lovers dynamic and compelling character growth. While the first half is slow and some plot elements feel unresolved, the second half shines with authentic chemistry and a satisfying resolution. The audiobook narration is exceptional, adding depth to the characters.

The novel effectively employs popular romance tropes, including \"touch her and die,\" \"sick bed,\" \"he falls first,\" \"possessive Scottish highlander,\" and \"enemies to lovers.\" Sylvie's return to Scotland to become the lady of Barclay Manor for a year, along with a lucrative divorce settlement, is both intriguing and well-executed.",
            "The palpable sexual tension between Sylvie and Killian is evident from their first encounter, where Sylvie breaks into Killian's Scottish manor. This initial meeting sets the tone for their dynamic, revealing Killian's vulnerability and the cracks in his stoic facade as their relationship deepens. However, his lack of remorse for past actions, including derogatory language directed at Sylvie, feels unresolved and detracts from his character development. While Sylvie's strength and assertiveness in the first half of the novel are commendable, her later passive acceptance of Killian's behavior and her subsequent moping after their separation seem inconsistent with her earlier characterization.",
            "The author's writing is captivating, offering a swoon-worthy depiction of a brooding Scotsman. The emotional vulnerability of Killian and the palpable romantic tension between the characters are standout elements of the novel."

However, the second half of the story felt weaker due to unresolved character growth and a somewhat inconsistent portrayal of Sylvie's strength. Despite these flaws, the book left me eager to explore more of the author's work and the potential stories of Killian's siblings.",

She is my least favorite narrator Sara Cate has chosen so far.  \n   - The male narrator, Will Watt, did a much better job overall, handling both characters‚Äô sections more effectively.  \n\n- **Romantic and Spicy Elements:**  \n   - The spice was good, but it only started around the 50% mark.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n   - I enjoyed the setting of the book‚Äîan old manor in the countryside.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book had some enjoyable elements, such as the pacing, dual POVs, and setting, it fell short in terms of character development and audiobook narration.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The book felt like it created a smokescreen for 70% of the story before delving into the heart of the relationship, which was initially frustrating. However, by the end, the resolution was beautiful and worth the wait, making it hard to imagine the story working any other way.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Killian and Sylvie are portrayed as nepo babies on the verge of being cut off by their families, which could make them seem unlikable at first. However, as the story progresses, they tear down each other's defenses, revealing their vulnerabilities and becoming each other's champions. Their journey is particularly rewarding for anyone who has felt like the black sheep in their circle.  \n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**  \n   - The book boldly explores untraditional spaces, such as Killian's past as a swinger party host and the complexities of consensual sharing versus cheating. This adds a fresh and scandalous layer to the story, which fans of Sara Cate will appreciate.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Representation:**  \n   - Killian's agoraphobia and nuanced anxiety triggers are a standout element. The care and mindfulness in portraying his struggles and Sylvie's role in helping him overcome them create a deeply fulfilling and emotional storyline.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - Kelli Tager's narration was enjoyable overall, but her attempt at Scottish accents for certain characters felt sharp and unnatural. Will Watt's narration of the male POV with a Scottish accent was more natural, but his portrayal of the female character was inconsistent, sometimes sounding American and other times Scottish. The audiobook production frequently pulled me out of the story, leading me to read most of the book myself and only switching to the audiobook for the final 25%.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some initial frustrations with pacing and audiobook narration, the book delivers a deeply emotional and rewarding story. The character development, exploration of unconventional themes, and the heartfelt resolution make it a standout read, especially for fans of Sara Cate.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Book: 4.5 stars  \n- Audiobook: 3 stars"

            "Both Sylvie and Killian begin as flawed, unlikable characters‚ÄîSylvie as an entitled brat and Killian as mean and brash. However, they undergo significant growth throughout the story. Killian confronts trauma from his parents' death and battles agoraphobia, while Sylvie grapples with the effects of her neglectful upbringing. Their transformation from mutual disdain to love is compelling and well-executed, evolving from a dislike-to-lovers trope where they initially insult and barely tolerate each other. The romance is rich with emotional depth, as both characters face their personal struggles and grow together.

            "The author tends to favor abrupt endings, which I find unsatisfying. For instance, after enduring mistreatment from her parents throughout the story, Sylvie's mother offers a sudden apology at the end. Additionally, the resolution following the Act 3 breakup feels rushed, with only about ten pages dedicated to Sylvie and Killian's reunion. Despite these issues, the book captivated me, and I finished it in just three hours.",
            "I truly appreciated the flawed nature of both Sylvie and Killian. In a genre often populated by one-dimensional characters, it's refreshing to encounter a male lead who is genuinely complex rather than just a typical dark archetype, like an overprotective mafia boss or a brooding bad boy. Sylvie captivated me with her depth; she was interesting and flawed, not merely a ray of sunshine. While Killian's imperfections made him unlikable at times, he ultimately redeems himself. Although I can't speak to the accuracy of the agoraphobia representation, I found it refreshing that it avoided stereotypical portrayals.",
            "This book may not appeal to all readers. If you dislike the MMC and FMC being unkind to each other and others, this story might not be for you. While it's marketed as Grumpy x Grumpy, I don't think that accurately reflects either character. However, the enemies-to-lovers trope is well-executed; their initial hatred for each other remains palpable even as they fall in love, adding an authentic touch to their relationship.",

In a genre often filled with copy-and-paste characters, finding a male lead (MMC) who is actually flawed and not just \"dark\" (e.g., an overprotective mafia boss or a bad boy who kills a person or two) is rare.  \n   - I loved Sylvie so much. She was interesting and flawed, not just sunshine personified, which was refreshing.  \n   - Killian‚Äôs flaws made him unlikeable at times, but he does make up for it.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - Sara Cate has a tendency to write very quick endings, which is not my favorite. For example, Sylvie‚Äôs parents treated her horribly throughout the book, and then her mom just randomly apologized at the end.  \n   - The resolution after the Act 3 breakup felt rushed, with only about 10 pages spent on Killian and Sylvie together.  \n   - Despite this, the book had me hooked, and I finished it in about 3 hours.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n   - This book is not for everyone.

            "The first 30% of the book introduces unremarkable characters, likely a deliberate choice to establish the grumpy x grumpy dynamic. The following 20% intensifies the tension with hate and toxic behavior, which can be difficult to endure. However, the next 30% shines with emotional depth, character development, and swoon-worthy moments. Unfortunately, the remainder of the book becomes a challenge to navigate due to the pervasive toxic behavior.",

The families of both leads are largely unlikable, particularly the male lead‚Äôs insufferable sister, which adds to the characters‚Äô struggles but doesn‚Äôt stand out as a highlight of the narrative. Initially, the main characters are hard to like: the female lead is reckless and selfish, while the male lead is grumpy and older. For much of the book, they mask their brokenness with immaturity, name-calling, and spite. However, as their complexities and emotional struggles unfold, they gradually become more relatable. Although their communication skills resemble those of 4-year-olds, they demonstrate significant growth by the end."

            "At the start of the book, I was uncertain about my enjoyment due to Sylvie, the main character, who initially came across as a spoiled brat. A 25-year-old living off an allowance without a job felt unrealistic. However, her behavior is understandable given her backstory: she has neglectful parents who prioritize their wealth and art over her. After discovering her boyfriend of three years cheating on her with her best friend, Sylvie faces a pivotal decision regarding a significant offer. I appreciated her character development as she learns to read between the lines when others cannot. Killian Barclay, a Scottish brute with a troubled past, quickly became a favorite. His experiences have shaped him, leading him to prefer solitude in his Scottish manor, where he resents his family's attempts to take it from him and initially finds Sylvie's vibrant presence unwelcome.",

            "The story centers on Sylvie, who is hired to marry Killian and deceive him into losing his manor, creating a compelling conflict. The narrative thoughtfully addresses mental health, particularly Killian‚Äôs anxiety, without overshadowing the main plot. The tension between Sylvie and Killian escalates gradually, culminating in explosive and emotional moments.",
            "Sylvie initially comes across as unlikable, with her rough edges and bratty demeanor. However, her poignant backstory and interactions with her parents reveal a more relatable and sympathetic side. Killian, a reclusive character with a traumatic past, grapples with anxiety in a way that feels authentic and adds depth to his persona. Both characters are headstrong, snarky, and sarcastic, generating intense tension and chemistry between them.",

            "The fake relationship trope was well-executed, and I appreciated the absence of forced conflict. The romance developed naturally over time, avoiding the pitfalls of insta-love, which added to the story's realism. However, the trust clause in the agreement felt a bit odd and could have been more believable. Around the three-quarters mark, some characters' inner dialogue came across as childish, particularly given that the male main character is 37. I'm not sure if this was a consistent issue or if it only became apparent later on. The ending felt rushed, and the pacing was uneven throughout the story, which spans roughly two years. As a result, the resolution lacked the emotional impact it could have had due to insufficient character development in the final chapters.",
            "The multiple perspectives were skillfully executed, with each character's viewpoint divided into distinct sections, allowing for an immersive experience over several chapters. This structure fostered a deeper connection with each character. However, the male main character could have benefited from greater depth.",
            "This book offers an enjoyable blend of steamy moments, witty banter, and a mostly believable plot. It flows effortlessly, drawing you in and making you root for the couple. I highly recommend it to fans of romance and the fake relationship trope."

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but the ending left me disappointed. The male protagonist, who owned a 60-acre manor in Scotland and struggled with agoraphobia, underwent eight months of therapy following his breakup with the female lead. Ultimately, he decided to give the manor deed to his aunt and moved to New York to be with her. However, just two months later, his aunt passed away and bequeathed the manor back to him. In a surprising turn, he declined the inheritance, fearing he might become trapped there again, and instead passed it on to his brother.",

To me, it didn't feel like a Sara Cate book. \n   - I might have liked it more if I didn't have the expectations set from her previous releases.\n\n- **Smut Scenes and Sexual Chemistry:**\n   - *Keep Me* was severely lacking in developed smut scenes. \n   - This isn't me saying that a book needs to have smut to be good, but when I'm reading a book from an established smut writer, that's going to be what I expect. \n   - There were a couple of scenes, but they weren't as intense or filled with sexual chemistry as I had come to expect. \n   - I also feel like she overlooked numerous instances for the scenes to go deeper when it comes to emotion or plot. \n   - A lot of those scenes felt free-standing, which isn't really a good thing because smut scenes operate to move your plot forward just as much as any other scene in the book.\n\n- **Emotional Depth and Personal Connection:**\n   - I will say that this book was much more emotional than any of her previous releases. \n   - All of her books deal with heavier topics, but I feel like this one was very emotional, and I know that Sara has stated that this book is very personal to her as well. \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**\n   - Killian and Sylvia were so hot and cold as a couple - and I know that's kind of the point of the plot, but it also resulted in me feeling distant from them. \n   - I didn't *really* care about them until like the 80% mark.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Lasting Impact:**\n   - I enjoyed my time listening to the audiobook, but unfortunately, I don't think this is a book that will stick with me past the week.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I was excited for Sara Cate's new series and appreciated the emotional depth of *Keep Me*, it fell short of my expectations compared to her previous works.

            "The central premise of the story‚Äîentering into marriages with virtual strangers for financial gain or to retain their homes‚Äîfelt implausible. Although the fake marriage trope is a staple in romance fiction, the rationale behind selecting Silvie for Killian lacked believability.",
            "In the first half of the book, I found both main characters, particularly Silvie, quite frustrating. She came off as a stereotypical \"poor little rich girl,\" leading me to sympathize with her parents when they cut her off. Silvie's behavior towards Killian, swinging between hostility and attraction, felt inconsistent and irritating. While Killian had his appealing physical traits, his character didn‚Äôt truly develop until later in the story. The constant bickering over trivial issues and Silvie's erratic emotions made this section hard to enjoy. The shift from ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm yours‚Äù felt abrupt and unrealistic.",

I was very excited about this new Scottish series.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The main concept of the story‚Äîagreeing to marry virtual strangers for money or to keep their house‚Äîdidn‚Äôt make much sense to me. While the fake marriage trope is a classic, their reasoning for choosing Silvie for Killian felt unrealistic, even for romance fiction.  \n\n- **Character Development and Likability:**  \n   - The first half of the book left me incredibly annoyed with both main characters, especially Silvie. She came across as a poor little rich girl, and I initially sided with her parents when they cut her off. Her behavior toward Killian, oscillating between hostility and attraction, felt inconsistent and frustrating.  \n   - Killian‚Äôs character, while physically appealing (with notable attributes), didn‚Äôt shine until later in the story.  \n\n- **Conflict and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n   - The constant arguing over trivial matters and Silvie‚Äôs hot-and-cold behavior made the first half of the book difficult to enjoy. The transition from ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm yours‚Äù felt too abrupt and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Second Half and Redemption:**  \n   - The second half of the book was infinitely better and redeemed the story for me. Once the characters realized their feelings for each other, their relationship became lovely and healing. I wished this development had happened sooner.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Entertainment:**  \n   - Despite its flaws, the book was spicy, sweet, and entertaining. By the end, I was rooting for the characters and appreciated their growth.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - The audiobook was a great listen, with Will M. Watt delivering a silky smooth performance as Killian. I wished he had been featured more.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n   - While I‚Äôm interested in seeing where the series goes, I‚Äôll need some convincing to pick up the next installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had its ups and downs. While the first half was frustrating due to unlikable characters and unnecessary conflicts, the second half redeemed the story with heartfelt moments and character growth. It‚Äôs a spicy and entertaining read, though not my favorite from Sara Cate.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "The MMC undergoes therapy for 3-6 months, but his decision to abandon his home and move to NYC for the FMC feels unrealistic. While distractions like intimacy can be enticing, they won't resolve deeper issues. I appreciated the plot, character dynamics, and the added spice. The audiobook was excellent, and the MMC‚Äôs Scottish accent was a standout. However, the book felt lengthy and didn't adequately explore the MMC‚Äôs trauma from isolating himself for 20 years. His parents' tragic death in a car crash caused by his drunk father is a significant event, yet it feels somewhat glossed over."

The explanation for his isolation‚Äîhis parents‚Äô death in a car crash caused by his drunk father‚Äîwas a huge trauma, but it felt glossed over.  \n\n- **Therapy and Resolution:**  \n   - The MMC goes to therapy for 3-6 months, but the resolution of him abandoning his home and moving to NYC to be with the FMC felt unrealistic. Eating pussy is a great distraction, but it won‚Äôt fix your life, my guy.  \n\n- **Cheating and Moral Ambiguity:**  \n   - The trigger warning mentioned cheating, but not with the main characters. The FMC‚Äôs boyfriend cheated on her, which led to her moving to Scotland to marry the MMC. However, the MMC drunkenly finger-blasted his ex in a closet during a swinger party, realized it wasn‚Äôt his wife (FMC), and stopped, but never came clean about it. He also admitted to sleeping with his ex while she was still married to his friend, outside their swinger arrangements, and never told his friend. His solution was to abandon Scotland and his friends to start over in New York, which felt like a shitty move, especially since the ex was still willing to cheat on her husband with him again.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works by the Author:**  \n   - This was my least favorite of the four Sara Cate books I‚Äôve read. I still think about *Eyes On Me* and *Give Me More* regularly since reading them in 2022. Even *Praise*, which scored lowest for me in that series, was still a great story with minimal issues.

            "Killian's early behavior, marked by name-calling and rudeness, painted him as a spoiled brat. However, his demeanor improved after he and Sylvie established a new type of relationship, though this transformation felt abrupt. Recognizing the underlying reasons for his prickliness allowed me to extend him some grace. Sylvie, too, demonstrated growth in how she allowed others to treat her, particularly her parents. Her time in Scotland contributed to her maturity, but she still had a long way to go. Her notions of self-care often seemed unrealistic, and her struggle to fully move on after returning home hindered her progress. While the initial agreement to a fake marriage was understandable, Killian's subsequent behavior was problematic. Sylvie should have demanded more effort from him to earn her forgiveness, especially considering his past actions. The resolution of their relationship felt rushed, and Sylvie didn't hold Killian accountable enough for his previous behavior. Additionally, her parents were thoughtless in their handling of her situation, though their disappointment in her lack of direction was understandable. The ex-assistant was unnecessarily cruel, relishing the power she held over Sylvie, and her apology felt inadequate."

Killian seemed like an irredeemable jerk, while Sylvie, despite her neglect, acted entitled and treated Enid, her parents' secretary, poorly. However, in the final quarter of the book, both characters underwent significant growth, which I appreciated. Their development felt realistic and satisfying, occurring independently of one another.

Killian came across as an irredeemable ass, and Sylvie, though neglected, behaved in an entitled and abominable manner, especially toward Enid, her parents' secretary.  \n   - However, in the last quarter of the book, both characters experienced significant growth and change, which I appreciated. Their development occurred separately, which felt realistic and satisfying.  \n\n- **Relationships and Interactions:**  \n   - The dynamic between Sylvie and Enid stood out as a highlight. Their frank conversation about their shared experiences with Sylvie's neglectful parents was one of the best moments in the book.  \n   - The romance between Killian and Sylvie was initially off-putting, but their growth made me glad they ended up together, as they seemed uniquely suited to tolerate each other.  \n\n- **Themes and Content Warnings:**  \n   - The book explores heavy themes, including ethical and non-ethical non-monogamy, grief, trauma, PTSD, panic attacks, agoraphobia, severe childhood neglect, emotional abuse, graphic sexuality, BDSM, alcoholism, blood, injury, and betrayal.  \n   - Most of the characters are deeply flawed, which might be challenging for sensitive readers.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The first three-quarters of the book were difficult to get through due to my dislike of the characters.  \n   - The final quarter, however, redeemed the story with its focus on character growth and resolution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book left me with mixed feelings.

            "The story gained momentum in the second half, particularly after the \"partner swapping\" scene, which, interestingly, did not involve the main characters. However, the pacing was uneven due to several time jumps that overlooked essential character development. The sudden transition from hatred to attraction and love felt contrived, lacking the necessary buildup for authenticity.",
            "From the outset, Sylvie, the female main character, was unlikable. She came across as self-centered, spoiled, and lacking self-awareness. Despite her backstory of being raised by wealthy but neglectful parents, her \"poor little rich girl\" attitude was frustrating. I hoped for significant growth, but it never materialized. Killian, the male main character, was equally unappealing. At nearly 40, he behaved like a teenager, and his entitlement mirrored Sylvie's. Both characters felt out of touch with reality and selfish, making it difficult to empathize with them. The hate-to-love trope fell flat; their animosity felt contrived, and the shift to attraction was too abrupt. I anticipated a slow burn, both sexually and emotionally, but their relationship lacked depth and authenticity. While the breeding kink was a highlight, I was disappointed that the story didn‚Äôt explore a role reversal where Killian might have submitted, even briefly.",
            "The Scottish setting and Killian‚Äôs nationality felt superficial. Aside from a few terms like ‚Äútrousers‚Äù and ‚Äúknickers‚Äù and a single Gaelic nickname, there was minimal authentic representation of Scottish culture.

However, the book felt misleading. Given the author‚Äôs previous work (*SPC*) and the series title (*Sinful Manor*), I expected something kinkier, but it didn‚Äôt deliver on that promise. The potential was there, but it wasn‚Äôt explored enough.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Sylvie, the FMC, was unlikable from the start. She came across as self-centered, spoiled, and lacking self-awareness. Despite her backstory (being raised by wealthy but neglectful parents), her ‚Äúpoor little rich girl‚Äù attitude was frustrating.

However, the pacing felt off due to several time jumps, which skipped over crucial character development. The abrupt shift from hatred to attraction and love felt forced and lacked genuine buildup.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**\n   - The hate-to-love trope didn‚Äôt work for me. Their animosity felt contrived, and their transition to attraction was too sudden. I expected a slow burn, both sexually and emotionally, but their relationship lacked depth and authenticity.\n   - The breeding kink was a highlight, but I was disappointed that the story didn‚Äôt explore a role reversal where Killian might have submitted, even briefly.\n\n- **Bully Romance Elements:**\n   - The book bordered on being a bully romance, with Killian repeatedly insulting Sylvie (e.g., calling her a ‚Äúcow,‚Äù ‚Äúcunt,‚Äù and ‚Äúbitch‚Äù). Some of his aggressive behavior, especially when drunk, felt non-consensual and should have been included in the trigger warnings.\n\n- **Cultural Representation:**\n   - The Scottish setting and Killian‚Äôs nationality felt superficial. Beyond a few words like ‚Äútrousers‚Äù and ‚Äúknickers‚Äù and one Gaelic nickname, there was little authentic representation of Scottish culture. As a Latina, I found this frustrating, as it felt like the culture was used as a selling point without meaningful integration.\n\n- **Inconsistencies:**\n   - There were several inconsistencies, such as Sylvie‚Äôs hair color, Killian‚Äôs age, and the timeline of events (e.g., the typewriter-to-laptop discrepancy). While these didn‚Äôt affect my rating (since it‚Äôs an ARC), they were noticeable and distracting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *Keep Me* had potential, it fell short of my expectations. The unlikable main characters, lack of genuine character development, and abrupt romantic progression made it hard for me to connect with the story. The kink elements were a highlight, but they weren‚Äôt enough to salvage the book for me.

The third act breakup is approached maturely, avoiding miscommunication and unnecessary drama.

Throughout their time apart, the couple maintains a respectful and supportive dynamic, which adds a refreshing and bittersweet touch to the story.",

Additionally, the characters' confrontations escalate to a level that makes it challenging to empathize with them early in the story.",

These insults are never apologized for, even when it's clear they hurt Sylvie deeply.  \n   - The fighting between the characters crosses a line, making it difficult to root for them early on.  \n\n- **Plot and Subplots:**  \n   - The inclusion of sex parties feels unnecessary and only serves to create drama. Killian's behavior during these scenes‚Äîoffering Sylvie to his friend and then acting possessively‚Äîmakes him appear inconsistent and unlikable.  \n   - The unresolved subplot involving Killian's past affair with his best friend's wife (Clara) is frustrating. The lack of resolution or accountability for this betrayal diminishes Killian's character and leaves a sour note.  \n\n- **Themes and Morality:**  \n   - The book's handling of cheating is problematic. While Killian doesn't cheat on Sylvie, his past affair with Clara shows a lack of moral integrity. This aspect is never addressed or resolved, which is disappointing.  \n   - Sylvie's confrontation with Clara is a positive moment, but the lack of closure on this subplot feels unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book has a strong and emotionally satisfying ending, with well-developed character arcs and mature handling of conflict in the latter half. However, the beginning is marred by degrading dialogue, unnecessary drama, and unresolved subplots involving infidelity. These issues significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Ending (last 60%): 4.5 stars  \n- Beginning (first 40%): 2 stars  \n- Overall Rating: 2 stars"

            "From the outset, the story felt disjointed. Sylvie breaks into a house to retrieve a picture of a typewriter that her boyfriend claims belongs to his family, yet there's no explanation for its presence in a random Scottish manor. The inclusion of the swingers group and the submission book seemed haphazard and irrelevant to the plot. However, the ending was surprisingly sweet and redeemed the overall experience. Reading the book felt like a surreal trip, akin to being on acid, with the swingers and submission elements feeling particularly forced and out of place.",
            "I struggled to choose between my disdain for Sylvie and Killian. From their first encounter, Killian came off as a complete creep, shattering any hopes I had of finding Mr. Tall, Dark, and Scottish appealing. Meanwhile, Sylvie was overly whiny and seemed entitled regarding her circumstances. Unfortunately, she lacked any meaningful character development‚Äîaside from her writing a book‚Äîwhich she desperately needed.",

            "I appreciate books with complex, flawed protagonists, as their development can be deeply rewarding. However, Sylvie's character fails to evolve throughout the story. She is messy and selfish, breaking into a house early on, yet there is no meaningful growth or resolution to her arc. As a writer who seemingly despises her craft‚Äîexcept for one unpublished story‚Äîher narrative thread remains unresolved. Similarly, Killian's character lacks depth; his guilt over past actions, such as sleeping with a friend's partner, is never fully explored or addressed.\n\nThe dynamic between Sylvie and Killian is troubling.

The author seems to challenge readers' tendency to judge female protagonists more harshly than their male counterparts.

His interests in exhibitionism, sharing, and swinging, coupled with his agoraphobia, complicate the traditional alpha male archetype.

He exhibited traits I wouldn‚Äôt tolerate in fictional men. His lack of genuine groveling until the very end, when he supposedly went to therapy, was disappointing.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship:**  \n  I don‚Äôt believe the MMC and the female main character (FMC) truly love each other. Their relationship feels unsustainable, and I predict they‚Äôll divorce within a year. A particularly troubling moment was when the MMC‚Äôs sister told the FMC, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not afraid to hurt your feelings because he knows you can take it.‚Äù  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The book had grammatical errors that made me cringe, detracting from the overall reading experience.  \n\n- **Smut/Intimacy:**  \n  The smut was good, which is likely why I gave the book 2 stars. However, I think the author‚Äôs other books, especially *Praise* from the Salacious Players Club series, handle this aspect better.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the smut was enjoyable, the MMC‚Äôs unlikable behavior, the lack of a believable romantic connection, and the grammatical errors significantly impacted my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2/5 stars."

While the prose is clear and straightforward, it often feels formulaic, missing opportunities for more vivid imagery or emotional depth.

It is also referred to as \"sappy,\" suggesting a sentimental and emotionally driven narrative.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around a girl traveling to Scotland, meeting a \"hot Scottish guy,\" and signing a contract, which hints at themes of romance, adventure, and possibly a contractual or arranged relationship. The plot includes the guy finding her after she leaves, adding an element of pursuit and reunion.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings:**  \n  The reviewer finds the trigger warnings unnecessary, comparing the book to *50 Shades* and stating that this story is \"tame\" in comparison. This suggests the content is mild and not as intense or explicit as other works in the romance genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book is a classic, predictable romance novel with a sentimental tone and a straightforward plot. While it includes some contractual and pursuit elements, the content is mild and lacks the intensity suggested by its trigger warnings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."
