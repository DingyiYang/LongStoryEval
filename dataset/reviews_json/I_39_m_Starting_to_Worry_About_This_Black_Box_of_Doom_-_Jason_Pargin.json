It’s a real place known for its pristine bathrooms, and I highly recommend stopping there if you’re driving through Texas. You can take a selfie with the beaver, fill up your gas or charge your car, use the restroom, shop for Texas souvenirs, grab Buc-ee’s branded snacks, and even enjoy a hot meal to go.

I anticipated a thriller, but it turned out to be more of a social commentary. While this was fine, I felt the pacing could have been quicker to match my initial expectations.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Most of the main characters were portrayed as pretty horrible for the majority of the book. However, by the end, they weren’t as bad as I initially thought (except for Abbott, whom I still struggle with). This made me question my own judgment and experience with the characters.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  I listened to the audiobook and read the Kindle version, switching between the two because I wanted to finish it. I thought the narrator did an excellent job.\n\n- **Humor:**  \n  The book was funny, but the humor was very dark—the kind that makes you question your morality when you find it amusing. This is something readers should be warned about.\n\n- **Use of Multimedia Elements:**  \n  I liked the inclusion of blog posts, Twitch chats, and Reddit posts throughout the story. These elements enhanced the narrative and helped underline some of the bigger themes.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The plot revolves around Abbott, who is offered $200,000 to drive a mysterious box to DC by the Fourth of July without knowing its contents. Small pieces of information leak and are twisted by social media, leading to public scrutiny and suspicions that Abbott and the girl, Ether, are transporting a bomb. Their five-day journey was chaotic, and the book also includes perspectives from other characters connected to them. I never would have guessed the contents of the black box in a million years.\n\n- **Impact and Reflection:**  \n  This was an interesting book. I’m not sure how it made me feel, but it did make me think about things I wouldn’t have considered otherwise.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book was bizarre and unexpected, blending dark humor with social commentary.

The story centers on Abbott, a Lyft driver, who is approached by a mysterious woman named Ether, who offers him $200,000 to drive from L.A. to D.C. with a set of stringent conditions: he must not open the black box she carries, ask about its contents, or inquire into her personal life. The surprising conclusion of their trip will leave even the most jaded readers astonished.",
            "In this story, Abbott emerges as a lonely outcast, potentially an incel, who harbors resentment toward women. Ether, a mysterious and manipulative figure, persuades Abbott to embark on a journey, despite his relentless grievances.",

Ultimately, it conveys that stepping away from screens and sensationalized news can uncover a world that isn't as dire as it appears."

I appreciate the opportunity to read and review it honestly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a brilliant blend of humor, speculation, and social commentary. It’s thought-provoking, entertaining, and perfect for fans of Jason Pargin’s unique style. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a smart, funny, and slightly unsettling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Structure and Ending:**  \n  The plot revolves around two characters traveling across the country with a mysterious box, unaware they are at the center of a massive online conspiracy. This creates a fun sense of dramatic irony, as the chaos around them shifts based on their mundane actions. The ending is wacky, surprising, and satisfying, which I truly enjoyed.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book is incredibly nihilistic, with the author using the story to express disdain for the world. The characters spend a significant portion of the book debating topics like gender roles, social media, and cancel culture. While these debates are thoughtfully written, they come off as hateful and one-sided. The author’s negative perspective on society is pervasive, with no positive views expressed throughout the book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters have warped, single-minded viewpoints, which could have been interesting if they had grown or changed. However, they remain static, never evolving or reconsidering their beliefs. There were moments where I was shocked by the heinous things the characters said, but they never showed any change of heart.  \n\n- **Portrayal of the Internet and Society:**  \n  The book portrays anyone who spends time online in a negative light, stereotyping them as porn addicts, trans individuals, swatters, or people crippled by anxiety. This disdain for internet culture feels exaggerated and one-dimensional, contributing to the overall negative tone.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Work:**  \n  I loved the author’s Zoey Ashe trilogy, which also addressed the dangers of social media and toxic masculinity but in a more fun and indirect way. The characters in that series grew and changed, making the stories enjoyable without feeling like a rant.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a satisfying ending and moments of brilliance, the overwhelmingly nihilistic tone, static characters, and one-sided portrayal of society made the majority of the book difficult to enjoy. The author’s negative perspective and lack of character growth overshadowed the clever plot structure and dramatic irony.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating score was mentioned in the review."

The characters felt unrelatable, and the heavy-handed commentary overshadowed the plot. Despite its thought-provoking nature, the book did not work for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story follows a Lyft driver tasked with transporting a mysterious young woman and a black road case across the U.S. As wild online conspiracies emerge about the box's contents, the plot escalates in a convincingly engaging manner. The author skillfully captures the chaotic energy of internet discourse, echoing the ADHD-fueled theories prevalent on Reddit and the sanctimonious tone of online mobs. The mystery of the box is maintained throughout, leading to a satisfying reveal that avoids anticlimax. Although the narrative is outlandish, it remains troublingly believable—typical of the author's best work. While lacking the eldritch horror found in some previous efforts, the story enriches the pop-culture commentary that defines his style, weaving it seamlessly into the plot. These reflections are more balanced and effective than the clumsy rants of earlier pieces, showcasing the author's evident growth in craft.",
            "This book's satirical take on contemporary online culture—incels, cancel culture, and viral events—is both brilliantly executed and refreshingly nuanced. The author skillfully critiques these phenomena, exposing their absurdities with precision rather than mere mockery. Additionally, the novel presents thoughtful reflections on escaping our self-imposed media prison, delivering these insights in an entertaining manner that never feels preachy.",

Each time I set it down, I was quickly pulled back into the story, and I could read for long stretches without losing interest—a rare experience for me lately. The nostalgic American road-trip setting adds an extra layer of charm."

After the disappointment of his *Zoey and the Suits* series, this standalone novel felt like a welcome revival of the qualities I loved in his *John Dies at the End* series.\n\n- **Storytelling and Concept:**  \n  The story is outlandish yet disconcertingly believable, a hallmark of Pargin’s best work. While it lacks the eldritch horror of the *John and Dave* series, it elevates the pop-culture lectures that are a signature of his writing, integrating them seamlessly into the plot. These soliloquies are more balanced and effective than the clumsy rants in the *Zoey* series, showing clear growth in Pargin’s craft.\n\n- **Satire and Themes:**  \n  The book’s satire of contemporary online culture—incels, cancel culture, viral events—is brilliantly executed and refreshingly nuanced. Pargin doesn’t just mock these phenomena; he roots out their folly and skewers them with precision. The novel also offers thoughtful ideas on breaking free from our self-imposed media prison, but it delivers these insights without being preachy, prioritizing entertainment and storytelling.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot follows a Lyft driver tasked with transporting a mysterious young woman and a black road-case across the U.S. As the internet spins wild conspiracies about the box’s contents, the story escalates in a way that feels both believable and engaging. Pargin masterfully mimics the chaotic energy of online discourse, particularly the ADHD-fueled theories of Reddit and the sanctimony of online mobs. The mystery of the box is maintained throughout, and the reveal is satisfying without being anticlimactic.\n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  The book is funny, engrossing, and well-paced. I found myself easily drawn back into the story whenever I put it down, and I could read for long stretches without losing interest—a rarity for me lately. The American road-trip setting was a nostalgic touch, adding to the overall charm.\n\n- **Emotional Connection:**  \n  Reading this novel reignited my affection for Pargin’s work, reminiscent of the joy I felt when I first discovered the *John Dies at the End* series. It’s a testament to his growth as a writer and his ability to craft stories that resonate deeply.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*I'm Starting to Worry About This Black Box of Doom* is a triumphant return to form for Jason Pargin, blending his signature wit, sharp satire, and engaging storytelling into a standalone novel that feels both fresh and familiar. It’s a funny, thought-provoking, and thoroughly enjoyable read that reaffirms my admiration for Pargin’s work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It may resonate more with his dedicated audience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to St. Martin’s Press and NetGalley for providing an advanced reader copy."

Thus, with the promise of a very large amount of cash, the road trip from hell begins.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  A good portion of the book is written in Reddit thread fashion, which started as an interesting concept, but it got old for me after a while.  \n\n- **Action and Characters:**  \n  There is a lot of action from a crazy tattooed man following trying to claim the box, a retired FBI agent trying to stop what may or may not be a potential act of terrorism, and about 20 or 30 side characters causing chaos online and in real life.  \n\n- **Humor and Social Commentary:**  \n  There were some rather funny parts, and it is without a doubt a brilliant commentary on the ills of social media and the toxicity of online culture.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  Overall, I liked the premise, but I think this could have been a good 100 pages shorter (with much of the Reddit thread posts edited out), and the storyline would have been stronger for it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book held my attention more than Pargin's previous works and offered a compelling premise with sharp social commentary, the overuse of Reddit-style writing and excessive length detracted from the overall strength of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.8 stars."

As they travel, rumors spread on social media that the box is part of a terrorism conspiracy. I found the premise to be fun and unique, serving as a clever parody of the perils of social media and how it shapes our perspectives.  \n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  The novel effectively critiques the influence of social media, illustrating how platforms like Reddit can distort information, akin to a modern-day game of telephone. It highlights how media controls our perception of events and people.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The array of characters was the best part of the book. Each character was distinct and memorable, adding depth and variety to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  While I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I felt it was a bit long and could have benefited from some trimming to tighten the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its length, I found the book to be a rare gem and really enjoyed it. The story was engaging, thought-provoking, and entertaining.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*I’m Starting to Worry About This Black Box of Doom* is a fun, unique, and thought-provoking novel that cleverly parodies the dangers of social media while delivering a memorable cast of characters. Though slightly overlong, it’s a rare gem that I highly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5)"

            "I appreciated the thought-provoking questions raised in these parts of the book, though I anticipate that many readers may not share my enthusiasm. While the book refrains from taking a definitive stance, the very existence of these discussions may alienate some audiences.",
            "While the sociological diatribes can slow some portions, the book's overall pacing kept me engaged enough to finish it in about three days. The mystery of \"what's in the box\" certainly drives the narrative forward.",
            "This book reads more like a Thriller/Blog (in a non-derogatory sense) than anything else. The author weaves substantial introspection about our society throughout, perhaps to an excessive degree. However, I'd much prefer these Socratic dialogues framed around bikers and mysterious black boxes than in a traditional blog format or delivered by yet another TikTok existentialist."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Style:**  \n  I think the real genre of this book would be Thriller/Blog (non-derogatory). Pargin wraps a lot of introspection about the current state of our society into this book, probably to a fault. Still, I would rather read those sorts of Socratic dialogues framed with bikers and big black boxes that might-contain-bombs than written on an actual, honest-to-god blog. It's also better than hearing them from yet another existential-hot-take-tik-toker.\n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  I personally enjoyed the types of questions those parts of the book brought up, but I imagine a lot of people won't. This book doesn't really try to persuade the reader towards any side of the discourse, but the presence of the discourse at all will probably turn a lot of people off.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  While the sociological diatribes do drag portions down, the rest of the book was paced well enough to get me to blitz this one out in ~3 days. I guess the question of \"what's in the box\" can do a hell of a lot of work.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book despite its heavy introspection and societal commentary, which might not appeal to everyone. The pacing and central mystery kept me engaged, making it a quick and thought-provoking read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

But I guess that’s what happens when you write a book about how deranged we all are now that the internet has metastasized inside our brains.  \n- **Themes and Philosophical Questions:**  \n  The book raises questions like: Is anything real anymore? What is authenticity anyway? Does anyone care? Is it all for the lulz? What are words for? Why does the axis of the world spin on suffering?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s dialogue felt unrealistic, it succeeded in entertaining me and capturing the chaotic, internet-driven zeitgeist of our times.

I was waiting for some point where he had to genuinely confront the harm he caused, but that doesn’t happen. It’s just kinda dropped in the end. Maybe now that he has \"real\" woman friends, he won’t be so violently misogynistic? Let’s hope, ig, because the story doesn’t show us.\n- **Moral Growth:** I didn’t want Abott to be punished, tbc. I wanted to see some kind of example that he had learned something from all this. Is it that during an emergency, he would stop to help a stranger in need, regardless of their politics? That doesn’t matter much if he’s out promoting violence against them the next day. So what did he actually learn? What was the point?\n- **Plot Development:** There were some thought-provoking threads laid out here, but it just ended up feeling overall underdeveloped.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book was undeniably funny and had some thought-provoking elements, it fell short in terms of character development and moral growth.

The plot centers on a deal between Cassandra and her former high school crush-turned-enemy, Seth Brubaker, as they unite against a common foe, reigniting their relationship in the process. I appreciated the exploration of Cassandra’s magical abilities and how the paranormal elements seamlessly blend into the small-town backdrop.",

While Seth, as a werewolf seeking Cassandra's help, introduces an intriguing dynamic, her hesitance to fully embrace their partnership can be frustrating.",

            "As a long-time fan, I found the story refreshingly original while still capturing the distinctive voice the author has developed over his seven previous works. His nuanced approach to complex issues continues to be a hallmark of his writing. The narrative kicks off with an enticing premise: rideshare driver Abbott Coburn is offered $200,000 to transport a mysterious woman and her box across the country. What follows is a suspenseful road trip filled with intrigue, especially as they head toward Washington, D.C. The book cleverly subverts expectations by presenting a grounded, real-world scenario, diverging from the fantastical elements characteristic of the author's earlier novels.",

The book subverts expectations by presenting a grounded, real-world scenario rather than relying on the fantastical elements typical of the author’s previous works.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  Unlike Jason Pargin’s other novels, which blend cosmic horror, sci-fi, and comedy, this book is set in a very real world without the usual genre trappings. This shift makes the story more uncomfortable and thought-provoking, as it directly addresses real-world issues without the filter of fantastical exaggeration.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters are compelling and nuanced. Every point-of-view character has a valid perspective but also makes flawed decisions. There are no clear heroes or villains—just people navigating life with the information and resources they have. This realism adds depth and relatability to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book delves into how humans interact, both in person and online, and explores the impact of online spaces on our lives over the past 30 years. It tackles difficult topics with nuance and provides an entertaining yet insightful approach to these discussions.  \n\n- **Author’s Voice and Consistency:**  \n  As a long-time fan, I appreciated how the story felt fresh while still maintaining the distinctive voice Jason Pargin has developed over his previous seven books.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel is a darkly funny and madcap adventure that delivers both humor and important themes. It explores loneliness, social media, and the tribes people form when traditional family structures fail them. The story follows Abbott, a ride-share driver with a large Twitch following, who is reluctantly drawn into a cross-country road trip with Ether, a mysterious fare carrying a large black crate. The plot escalates as the Internet becomes involved, with a sub-Reddit thread spiraling out of control, leading to both online and real-life pursuits. The novel also delves into the characters’ failure to communicate effectively, even when they are on the same side.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Abbott and Ether’s relationship is central to the story, marked by heated discussions and misunderstandings. For instance, Abbott criticizes attractive white girls for getting a pass on bullying, while Ether defends manipulation as a learned protective strategy against assault. These exchanges highlight the characters’ differing perspectives and add depth to their interactions.  \n\n- **Humor and Cultural References:**  \n  The book is filled with humorous elements, including jokes about Malort (the famously unpalatable Midwest liquor), bunny moms, and Bitcoin. These moments provide levity amidst the chaos and contribute to the novel’s unique tone.  \n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  The audiobook effectively voices both sides of the characters’ arguments, making them easy to follow and consistent with their personalities. The narration enhances the listening experience and brings the story to life.  \n\n- **Author and Context:**  \n  As a fan of the author’s previous work, *John Dies at the End*, I was excited to dive into this standalone novel. The book did not disappoint, living up to my expectations and delivering a fresh, engaging story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a darkly comedic and thought-provoking adventure that skillfully blends humor with themes of loneliness, social media, and human connection. The dynamic between Abbott and Ether, along with the chaotic yet entertaining plot, makes for a compelling read. The audiobook narration further enhances the experience, making it a standout choice for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing in the first two-thirds of the novel is strong, featuring a steady build-up of tension, humor, and absurd situations. However, the frequent inclusion of social media threads sometimes disrupts the narrative flow. The ending heavily emphasizes social commentary, which may come off as heavy-handed for readers more focused on the thriller aspects. The story opens with an enticing premise: 26-year-old Lyft driver Abbott Coburn is offered $200,000 to transport a mysterious woman, Ether, and a large black box across the country under strict conditions. As the journey unfolds, chaos ensues, fueled by social media speculation and conspiracy theories surrounding the box. While the central mystery—what's inside the box?—is brilliantly captivating, the resolution feels somewhat underwhelming after such a thrilling buildup.",
            "Abbott is a relatable protagonist—flawed, anxious, and decidedly unheroic—while Ether proves to be an enigmatic and sharp companion. Their interactions shift between laugh-out-loud humor and unexpected poignancy. The quirky secondary characters, such as the retired FBI agent and the ex-con biker, enhance the book’s chaotic charm and leave a lasting impression.",
            "In this absurd road-trip thriller, the author deftly examines modern society's relationship with the internet and social media. The incorporation of Reddit-style threads and online commentary introduces a humorous yet unsettling dimension that underscores the rapidity with which people craft and accept conspiracies. Through dark humor and insightful commentary, the novel critiques how digital lives distort reality and exacerbate anxieties.",
            "The novel masterfully blends dark humor with sharp social commentary, delivering moments that are often laugh-out-loud funny. However, some readers may find the plot's over-the-top absurdity pushes the bounds of believability, even for a fantastical tale."

        "conclusion": "*I’m Starting to Worry About This Black Box of Doom* is a darkly hilarious and highly original thriller that skewers our internet-obsessed culture with wit and insight. While the ending doesn’t quite deliver the explosive punch hoped for, the journey is wildly entertaining and filled with sharp social commentary. It’s a fun, chaotic, and thought-provoking ride that balances dark humor with a compelling mystery, though the resolution might not satisfy everyone. Perfect for fans of quirky thrillers and social media satire.",

            "The story centers on a young man in his 20s who, persuaded by a girl named Ether, sets off on a cross-country road trip from LA to DC. Their mission? To transport a mysterious black box while eschewing all technology and relying solely on a map. What begins as an adventurous journey quickly devolves into a chaotic manhunt, complete with absurd conspiracy theories, a relentless tattooed antagonist, and a whimsical anime-themed van.",

I appreciated the variety of characters and the contrast between Abbot’s anxiety and pessimism and Ether’s optimism and adventurous spirit. Pargin humanizes characters across political and cultural divides, making them flawed yet relatable.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The humor is well-balanced, with less reliance on bodily-function and sexual jokes compared to Pargin’s previous work, *Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits*. While there are still some elements of this type of humor, they serve the story rather than feeling excessive.  \n\n- **Social Commentary and Real-World Parallels:**  \n  The book effectively draws parallels to real-world events, particularly around political unrest and domestic terrorism. The spread of online conspiracy theories is both funny and sobering, reflecting current societal issues. Philosophical and historical discussions between Abbot and Ether add depth but occasionally slow the pacing.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is uneven at times due to detailed explanations of social media platforms and philosophical digressions. However, these elements are necessary for clarity and future relevance. The plot takes unexpected turns, and while the ending feels a bit too neat, the journey is engaging and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is a wild and reflective ride that balances action, humor, and social commentary. Despite some pacing issues and a tidy ending, it offers a compelling exploration of modern society and human connections.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the second half significantly improves, evolving into an engaging race against time to thwart a terrorist plot. This transformation allows for character development and a more compelling storyline. The narrative centers on Abbott Coburn, an online personality who is coerced by a stranger named Ether to deliver a mysterious package to Washington, D.C., before the Fourth of July. What ensues is a chaotic road trip involving Abbott’s Twitch followers, a meth dealer, an ex-Fed, his father, and Reddit, all intertwined in the mystery. Most believe the package is a bomb, fueling widespread speculation and paranoia.",

In contrast, Abbott’s dad and a felon provide some grounding, as they are self-aware and unapologetic about their shortcomings. However, as the story progresses and the characters distance themselves from the internet's influence, they evolve into more multidimensional figures.",

            "The plot is at times ludicrous yet strikingly relevant, particularly in its depiction of the internet era in 2024. Reddit emerges almost as a character, enriching the narrative with painfully accurate online discussions. Initially, the storylines seemed disjointed due to frequent character shifts, which interrupted the flow. However, as the connections among them became clearer, the pacing improved. By the end, it felt akin to parting from friends after a long cross-country journey.",
            "The characters in the story present a captivating blend of personalities. Abbott and Ether, the two main protagonists, are both infuriating and authentic. Although Abbott's actions can be quite off-putting, by the novel's conclusion, his flaws become somewhat forgivable. They may not be based on real individuals, but the characters are undeniably realistic and relatable.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  This book is significantly different from the *John Dies at the End* series. The irreverent, laugh-out-loud humor that defined those books is absent here. Instead, the humor is more introspective, often prompting internal laughter and a sense of recognition with its sharp commentary on society in 2024. Once I adjusted to this shift, the book became more engaging.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are a fascinating mix of personalities. Abbott and Ether, the two primary characters, are both insufferable and genuine. There are moments when Abbott’s actions evoke strong dislike, but by the end of the novel, his idiocy feels somewhat forgiven. The characters feel real and relatable, even if they aren’t based on actual people.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The plot, while ludicrous at times, feels eerily close to reality, especially in its portrayal of the internet age in 2024. Reddit plays a significant role, almost functioning as a character itself, serving as the backdrop for many embarrassingly accurate internet discussions. The storylines initially felt disjointed due to frequent shifts between characters, which disrupted the flow. However, as the relevance of each storyline became clearer, the pacing improved, and by the end, it felt like leaving behind friends after a cross-country journey.\n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  Jason Pargin’s writing is undeniably strong. The novel excels as a darkly accurate portrayal of the internet-driven world, often feeling like a reflection of real-life lunacy. While the humor is more subdued, there are still a few laugh-out-loud moments. The book’s strength lies in its ability to capture the absurdity and truth of modern society.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its differences from Pargin’s previous works, this novel is a compelling and thought-provoking read. It offers a sharp, accurate depiction of the internet age, with complex characters and a plot that, while initially disjointed, comes together beautifully by the end. Fans of Pargin’s earlier works should definitely give this one a try, even if the humor is more subdued.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4 stars)"

This approach renders the themes both accessible and impactful. Each time I finish one of his books, I'm left with a wistful yet optimistic perspective on life. Even in his David Wong novels, he highlights life's challenges while infusing a sense of hope. This particular book offers a profound exploration of social media and the human condition in a world closely resembling our own. Although the author notes that the events are fictional, the themes encourage meaningful reflection on our personal lives.",

Even in his David Wong novels, he doesn’t shy away from showing how challenging life can be, while still infusing a sense of hope. This book, more than his others, delves deeply into social media and the human condition in a world that feels adjacent to our own. Despite the author’s note that the events are fictional, the themes are worth reflecting on in our personal lives.\n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I expected a greater departure from the \"real world\" based on Jason’s past novels, which is why I didn’t rate this book higher. However, I recognize that some readers might see it as a significant departure from our current reality. Personally, I find the fictional world not too different from ours, as I prefer not to assume the worst about people.\n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  Many books that attempt to comment on social media echo chambers and the state of the world often come across as patronizing, bigoted, or overly simplistic. Jason avoids these pitfalls by having his characters engage in thoughtful conversations and philosophize about their world, which mirrors our own. This approach makes the themes more accessible and impactful.\n\n- **Impact and Reflection:**  \n  This book has left a lasting impression on me. I know I’ll be thinking about its themes and the conversations within it for a long time. The messages and questions it raises feel more relevant to our current world than some of Jason’s previous works, like the David Wong stories.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my initial expectations, this was a chaotic and exciting read, absolutely on par with everything else Jason has written. The depth of its themes and their applicability to our world make it a standout.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a thought-provoking and engaging exploration of social media and the human condition, presented in Jason Pargin’s signature style. While it didn’t fully meet my expectations for a departure from reality, its themes and messages are deeply relevant and impactful, making it a memorable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the reader implies a high rating, slightly lower than perfect due to unmet expectations."

These exchanges dragged the story down, undermining the development of their friendship and diminishing my investment in their relationship. My initial affection for Abbott waned as he treated Ether poorly and shunned meaningful dialogue.

            "The book begins with a strong opening and finishes impressively, but the middle portion—roughly 50-60%—is a challenging slog. The pacing suffers from excessive monologuing and repetitive discussions, which detracts from the overall engagement.",

        "conclusion": "While *Black Box* had its moments, particularly the strong start and thrilling climax, the middle section dragged due to excessive political monologuing and a lack of the author’s signature humor. It’s a decent read but doesn’t quite live up to his previous works.",

While I tried to approach *Black Box* as a separate work, I couldn’t help but compare it to his older books, and it didn’t quite measure up.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book starts strong, and the last 20% was excellent, but the middle 50-60% was a slog to get through. The pacing felt off due to excessive monologuing and repetitive discussions, which made it hard to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Political Commentary:**  \n  The book heavily features right vs. left-wing monologuing, which, while relevant to current events and the theme of misinformation, felt overwhelming and repetitive at times. The constant back-and-forth between characters like Ether and Abbot became tedious.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  Pargin’s unique sense of humor, which I love, was largely missing in the middle of the book. There were only mild glimpses of it until the final action sequence, where it finally shone through.  \n\n- **Setting and Climax:**  \n  The absurd and ridiculous setting of the final showdown was a highlight and exactly what I was waiting for. It saved the book for me and reminded me of why I enjoy Pargin’s work.  \n\n- **Character Perspectives and Narrative Devices:**  \n  The monologuing was occasionally interrupted by other character POVs and Reddit posts, which provided some relief but weren’t enough to fully balance the repetitive nature of the middle section.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Black Box* had its moments, particularly the strong start and thrilling climax, the middle section dragged due to excessive political monologuing and a lack of Pargin’s signature humor.

            "Initially, I felt a modicum of sympathy for Abbott, but my empathy soon dissipated upon encountering his incel-like views on women. This shift clarified his father's disappointment in him, though I questioned whether his father actually disapproved of the misogyny, given his own bitterness from divorce. Each character in the book is flawed, making it challenging to connect with them. For instance, the retired FBI agent who clings to an illusion of active duty and the gazillionaire, once his backstory unfolds, are particularly hard to relate to.",

It took me a while to connect the dots and realize he had switched to using his real name.\n\n- **Character Development and Empathy:**  \n  I was marginally sympathetic toward Abbott at first, but my empathy waned when he revealed his incel-like views on women. This made me understand why his father was disappointed in him, though I’m not sure his father would have objected to the misogyny, given his own bitterness from a divorce. Every character in the book is damaged in some way, which made it hard to feel empathy for them. For example, the retired FBI agent who still pretended to be on active duty was particularly difficult to connect with, as was the gazillionaire once his backstory was revealed.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The pacing of the book was excellent. Once the basic premise was established, the story moved quickly and kept me engaged. The author’s portrayal of how the internet reacts to crises—through Twitch chats and Reddit posts—was spot-on and added a layer of realism that I appreciated.\n\n- **Author’s Note and Meta Commentary:**  \n  The novel included a unique paragraph from the author at the end, essentially pleading with readers not to criticize the book online. He argued that while the events weren’t real, they were real within the fictional world he created. I found this meta commentary intriguing, though I’m not sure how effective it would be in deterring criticism.\n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  Despite the problematic views expressed by many characters, the book was thoroughly entertaining if you could let the nonsense slide off your back.

However, a lot of the monologues in the novel felt very familiar, as if they were directly lifted from his social media content. This made the book feel more recycled than fresh, with many asides, diversions, and flavor text seeming to mirror the cultural zeitgeist of the last year or two.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The book lacks the likable characters that grounded Pargin's other works. The two main leads—an indecisive incel and a disgraced former influencer turned manic pixie—are neither relatable nor likable. It’s hard to root for them, especially since they seem unsure of their goals or motivations.\n\n- **Plot and Tone:**  \n  There are a few amusing action sequences that lean towards the absurd, a hallmark of Pargin's style, but here they feel tonally dissonant. Additionally, long sections of Reddit posts are included, which are as tedious to read as actual Reddit threads. The book could have benefited from significant editing to tighten the narrative.\n\n- **Relevance and Timing:**  \n  The book warns heavily against being \"terminally online,\" yet it embodies the very thing it critiques. This irony, combined with the current political climate, makes the book harder to enjoy. It feels like a product of its time in a way that doesn’t resonate positively.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this novel, it fell short of Pargin's previous works. The recycled content, unlikable characters, and tonal inconsistencies made it a challenging read. The book’s critique of online culture feels hypocritical, and its timing in the current political climate further detracts from its appeal.

His decision to confront his fears and save lives, despite knowing it won’t change the world, adds depth to his character and highlights his humanity.",

            "The writing is tedious and self-indulgent, often feeling like a poor imitation of David Foster Wallace. The book sorely needs an editor to trim it by at least 30%. The dialogue is marked by a smug condescension, with characters delivering sophomoric lines that are overly structured and painfully verbose. Each character seems to speak as if they were a walking Cracked article, drowning in long, unbroken paragraphs. Ultimately, the story suffers from meandering observations that are unoriginal, uninspired, and repetitive.",

He has always been talented at delivering insightful observations slowly and carefully to keep you hooked. However, for the past few years, the returns have been diminishing, and this book represents the nadir of his work.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery Elements:**  \n  The story itself is not too bad, and the mystery box element is quite enjoyable. It feels absurd enough to feel fictitious, while forcing you to confront the fact that your understanding of ‘absurd’ might be outdated. It’s the kind of plot Ben Elton would have written if the internet was like this in 1996.\n\n- **Dialogue and Character Development:**  \n  The problem lies in the smugness and condescension built into the dialogue. The characters deliver sophistic dialogue that is excruciatingly structured. Every single character speaks like they are a human Cracked article, with long, unbroken, interminable paragraphs. The story is sacrificed at the altar of meandering observations that are unoriginal, uninspired, and repetitive.\n\n- **Originality and Insight:**  \n  Every piece of information that is supposed to be counterintuitive or insightful is already well known. It’s painfully clear that the reader is supposed to be wowed by this “amazing new knowledge,” but it’s nothing that hasn’t been covered extensively elsewhere, such as in countless YouTube video essays.\n\n- **Writing Style and Editing Needs:**  \n  The writing is tedious, self-indulgent, and windy. The book is in desperate need of an editor to cut it down by at least 30%. At times, it’s embarrassing to read, as it feels like an ersatz version of an ersatz David Foster Wallace.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the plot and mystery elements have some merit, the book is ultimately weighed down by its smug, condescending dialogue, unoriginal insights, and overly verbose writing style.

This new book by Wong/Pargin was also oodles of fun. It’s a standalone novel that looked like fun, and it delivered on that promise. The novel is entertaining, albeit somewhat manic, and I had a great time reading it.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Pargin’s writing is very hip, funny, and clever. He has a knack for witty quips and well-informed, convincing soliloquies that are so detailed he even spends pages in the afterword clarifying that he made it all up. While his style is engaging, it can occasionally feel over-the-top and self-indulgent.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The novel is essentially a wacky road trip that starts with an odd pairing: Ether, a progressive-minded woman, recruits Abbott, a pale, anxious incel, to be her driver. The arrangement seems impractical and quickly goes off the rails, with internet trolls exacerbating the chaos. On a basic level, it’s a comedy of errors, and it works well enough, though it’s very long and sometimes tiresome.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The clash between Ether’s Pollyanna-like optimism and Abbott’s paranoid worldview is central to the story. While Abbott’s paranoia is shockingly well-presented, the dynamic between the two characters can become tiresome over time.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  Where the novel truly shines is in its scathing critique of internet and social media culture.

            "This book ultimately feels like a regurgitation of the author's earlier articles on the subject. While it starts strong, it struggles with a central issue: its insights are wrapped in a hollow narrative devoid of a real storyline. The use of a Reddit post as a framing device fails; it resembles an IRC chat rather than a genuine Reddit experience. Although I found the mystery and its resolutions engaging, the approach taken detracts from the overall impact. The character of Malort resembles a villain from a Dan Brown novel, lacking the depth suggested by the ending. While I expect to pick up some nuances upon a reread, I don’t foresee revisiting the book anytime soon.",
            "The male protagonists, despite their flaws, are engaging enough to keep us invested in their journeys. In contrast, the female protagonists often feel like overly intellectual constructs. Their dialogue resembles monologues, as they lecture their oblivious scene partners about how the internet has distorted perception.",

This will come as no surprise to anyone who has read anything he has written.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Originality:**  \n  The problem with this book is that it reads like a regurgitation of his articles on the subject. It starts off very strong but faces a core issue where its insight is wrapped around a fairly hollow core of no real storyline. A Reddit post framing device has the problem where it reads less like a Reddit post and more like an IRC chatroom.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While his male protagonists are, overall, shitheads we can enjoy enough to follow, his female protagonists are just Pargin Thought Machines. Their dialogue is more accurately described as monologue as they explain to their dumbass scene partners how the internet has warped perception.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery and its solutions pretty much worked for me, though I think it's one place where playing it as a mystery harms the experience. Malort reads too much like a killer from a Dan Brown novel and not enough like what the end makes him out to be. There's some stuff I'm sure I'll pick up on a reread, but I don't expect to do one any time soon.\n\n- **Target Audience and Recommendation:**  \n  If you're a huge Pargin fan and need a fix, it'll do until the next Zoe or John releases. If not, I think you can safely pass.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel is insightful and showcases Pargin's expertise on the subject of how the internet has warped perception, it struggles with a lack of originality in its narrative structure and character development. The plot and mystery work to some extent, but the execution feels uneven. It’s a decent read for die-hard Pargin fans but may not appeal to a broader audience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Pargin’s goal is not to push an agenda or force a narrative but to encourage readers to think and consider different perspectives.  \n\n- **Impact and Reception:**  \n  Some parts of the book may provoke strong reactions from certain groups, but the author’s intent is not to antagonize. Instead, he invites readers to approach the book with an open mind, not necessarily to change their views but to engage in deeper reflection.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout in Jason Pargin’s body of work, blending entertainment with intellectual depth.

I was glad I read it.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story revolves around a couple tasked with delivering a black box without being allowed to look inside or use any trackable devices. The intrigue surrounding the box and the rumors that spread online added layers of suspense and mystery to the narrative.\n\n- **Author and Inspiration:**  \n  I was inspired to request this book after hearing the author, Jason Pargin, interviewed on *The New Abnormal* podcast. His discussion of the book piqued my interest, and I couldn’t resist giving it a read.\n\n- **Review Context:**  \n  While my blog, *Mr. Book’s Book Reviews*, primarily focuses on non-fiction, this fiction novel was an exception due to its compelling premise and my personal interest in the author’s work.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*I’m Starting To Worry About This Black Box Of Doom* by Jason Pargin is a gripping and intriguing novel that kept me engaged from start to finish.

While I probably wouldn’t read more of his books, as they’re not for me, I did finish this one, which makes it better than most out there.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book aims for something along the lines of *Dirk Gently*—absurd and farcical, culminating in a massive comedic farce showdown. However, it doesn’t reach the same levels of hilarity as Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett, largely because the plotting isn’t intricate enough.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main strength of the book lies in its character arcs. There are some very wholesome and sweet arcs here, including the father-son relationship, the anxious but soft-hearted homebody forced to take risks, the privileged brat trying to make amends, the lost love, and the bereft retired career woman.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The most interesting theme was about how quickly and crazily rumors can spin out of control, as well as the exploration of internet (and other) delusion bubbles.\n\n- **Content and Dialogue:**  \n  I found the porn and masturbation references gross and unnecessary. Additionally, I didn’t appreciate the constant use of “Jesus” as profanity in some of the dialogue, as I found it very offensive. While the progressivism/humanism espoused mainly by Ether was a little sad (like any non-Christian worldview, in my opinion), the book wasn’t preachy overall.\n\n- **Cultural References and Dialogue Style:**  \n  The book is super current with its references, which made me curious about the other books in the series—like whether I’d be able to guess when they were written. The Twitch dialogue and Reddit posts were amusing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its strengths, particularly in character development and its exploration of modern themes, it falls short in terms of humor and plotting compared to similar works.

As the driver uses his father’s car, the father grows worried about his son's sudden absence and begins investigating his digital life, unintentionally fueling internet and social media speculation.

I was eager to see his development, particularly as the story hints at the beginning of that transformation, especially through his evolving friendship with Ether. However, his rants made for uncomfortable reading, which I recognize is intentional, given his archetype.

I’m always drawn to the insanity of his stories. Abbott, the main character, is not a great person, but I found myself unexpectedly invested in his journey, especially after it’s revealed that he’s a major incel. I wanted to see him develop, and I think the book hints at the beginning of that change, particularly in his evolving friendship with Ether.

The depiction of Reddit and Twitch taking a small post and blowing it out of proportion to the point of it being labeled a Russian conspiracy to attack the capital was both ridiculous and unfortunately realistic. The transition of the “black box of doom” into a metaphor for technology and social media was unexpected but enjoyable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some discomfort with the main character’s worldview and rants, I found the book engaging and appreciated its unexpected emotional moments, large cast dynamics, and sharp social commentary.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n  - Speculative fiction is becoming my new favorite genre because it often serves as a commentary on our culture and explores \"what if\" scenarios, reminiscent of the classic show *The Twilight Zone*.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  - The story follows Abbott, who picks up Ether as a Lyft passenger, and they embark on a cross-country adventure. Ether carries a large black box that must remain unopened and be delivered to Washington, DC, in four days, with $200,000 at stake.  \n  - Abbott’s dad becomes worried when he realizes Abbott is gone, and the Reddit community gets involved, leading to dramatic developments.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Dialogue:**  \n  - My favorite part of the book is the conversations between Ether and Abbott during their road trip. Ether helps Abbott see things differently, particularly how we can be influenced by media propaganda and how we can become the product rather than the customer.  \n  - There were 3 or 4 conversations that were particularly intriguing and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  - The ending was...interesting. It left me with mixed feelings but certainly sparked curiosity.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  - I listened to the audiobook and found the narrator easy to follow and well-acted, which enhanced my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  - Thanks to @NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for providing the advanced review copy (ARC). The book is set to be published on September 24, 2024.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis speculative fiction novel offers a compelling blend of cultural commentary, thought-provoking dialogue, and an adventurous plot. While the ending was intriguing, the conversations between Ether and Abbott stood out as the highlight of the story. The audiobook narration was excellent, making it an enjoyable listening experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

And it was, for the most part! There were a couple bits that I think were supposed to be madcap antics but they fell flat for me, so they were just kind of stupid. For the most part, though, it was fast-paced and entertaining.\n\n- **Themes and Satire:**  \n  Beyond that, though, this novel is a blistering satire that skewers social media and the outsized role it plays in society and in many people’s lives. The out-of-control social media landscape was a character in and of itself, in which the mob mentality and sensationalist nature of the internet was both an oversized caricature and terrifyingly accurate.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Most of the major characters were complex, for all that they had some cartoonish aspects as a result of the satire. There were some dicey political rants delivered by one of the main characters, but for the most part, the person delivering them was presented as a complicated person who had been heavily influenced by the social media outrage machine, which led to their inclusion being more thought-provoking than annoying (usually.)\n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The novel includes POC characters, LGBTQ+ characters, and disabled characters, which added depth and diversity to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was a fast-paced and entertaining read with a sharp satirical edge.

Despite these issues, I found the plot compelling and was unable to put it down. I listened to the audio version, which features a great narrator.

I did not expect to grow such a soft spot for Malort.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  This is a very sad love story. The book explores themes like the dangers of blind bandwagon jumping, internet fury, how easily conspiracies are born, and how people take sides in problems because they want something to direct their anger and blame at. It’s a startling reminder of how we’re all getting (too) familiar with sharing/consuming aggressive opinions.  \n\n- **Controversy and Relevance:**  \n  I didn’t find this book to be half as controversial as I’ve seen some people say. I read nothing on these pages that I haven’t read in random strangers’ tweets on your typical Monday.

It has a unique style that might not resonate with all readers.\n\n- **Author's Style and Consistency:**  \n  I've never read Jason Pargin before, so I have no idea if this is what his books are usually like. However, I’m guessing they’re generally similar, as most authors tend to have a consistent style. It seems like if you're a huge Jason Pargin fan, this one might not be his greatest work.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  Just like I skipped *Ready Player One* and loved *Armada*, I skipped *John Dies at the End* and thoroughly enjoyed *Black Box of Doom*. This book stands on its own for me, even without prior exposure to the author’s other works.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  It’s a weird and wacky tale, blending elements of a road trip story, car chase antics, and a spy thriller. The tone feels like it was written by *South Park*—sharp, satirical, and often outrageous.\n\n- **Satire and Humor:**  \n  The book skewers everything—sometimes brilliantly and sometimes not. It’s hilariously on-point but occasionally crosses into bad taste. The humor is always weird, which I found both amusing and disorienting.\n\n- **Reader Experience:**  \n  I had many \"What am I reading??\" moments, similar to my experience with Terry Miles' *Rabbits* or Jeff Vandermeer's *Annihilation*. While these books aren’t the same type, they all left me feeling equally lost when trying to describe their stories.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I gave this book 4 stars because it was highly entertaining and kept me hooked, despite its weird and occasionally polarizing style. It’s not for everyone, but I personally enjoyed the unique blend of humor, satire, and genre-bending storytelling.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

The premise—a down-and-out individual paid $200K to transport a girl with a box labeled \"radioactive\" across the country—combined with the antics of online trolls and Redditors interpreting their social media posts, is both innovative and captivating. However, after trudging through over 300 pages, the contents of the box and the ending felt like a major anti-climax. Unfortunately, the buildup failed to provide a satisfying resolution.",

I’ve always enjoyed caper novels, and it was fun to take a wild drive across the country with Abbott and Ether, as more and more people chase them, largely due to social media spinning completely out of control with increasingly extreme claims about what they’re doing. The book is semi-epistolary, with Abbott and Ether’s story—and some other characters’—interspersed frequently with social media posts.\n\n- **Execution and Entertainment Value:**  \n  The book is well executed and entertaining. The narrative keeps you engaged as the chaos escalates, and the interplay between the main story and the social media posts adds a unique layer to the storytelling.\n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  The social media satire feels almost too true. It’s not at all far-fetched these days to think that wild accusations can be spun up out of whole cloth, posted on the internet, and energize hordes of people, some just to make themselves part of the supposed action, but others to deadly violence.

Given his previous work, I expected this book to be a comical, fun read.\n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The premise is straightforward: a man is hired by an unknown woman to transport her and a large black box across the country for a substantial sum of money. The catch? They have only four days to travel thousands of miles, and he cannot know what’s inside the box.\n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The events that unfold are a mix of hilarious, troubling, and eerily realistic, reflecting the complexities of the world we live in today. The book made me pause and reflect on my daily actions and perceptions, something few books have achieved.\n\n- **Impact and Reflection:**  \n  This novel changed the way I look at things and how I’ll react to future events. It far exceeded my initial expectations, delivering a profound and thought-provoking experience.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I can’t recommend this book enough. It’s a must-read that offers much more than it initially promises.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book surpassed my expectations, blending humor, realism, and deep reflection into a compelling narrative. It’s a transformative read that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a story that entertains and challenges in equal measure.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The author skillfully addresses heavy, difficult subject matter while maintaining a pleasant reading experience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Some characters are super unique, particularly GSG, whose evolution and over-the-top, therapy-filtered way of interacting with people were compelling and enjoyable to follow.  \n\n- **Humor and Style:**  \n  The Reddit commentary throughout the book was funny and added a layer of humor to the narrative.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narrator was excellent, with just the right amount of inflection and clear, easy-to-understand dialogue, which enhanced the story and made it more engaging.  \n\n- **Personal Impact:**  \n  While the book made me uncomfortable at times, I believe all good books should challenge readers in some way.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Support:**  \n  I purchased the book for my library and plan to share it widely, as I do with other books I love.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a thought-provoking and humorous exploration of contemporary issues, with memorable characters and excellent narration.

I’m definitely interested in reading more by this author in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book started strong with an engaging premise and well-developed characters, but the introduction of too many themes and plotlines made it feel chaotic. While I enjoyed it overall, the lack of focus detracted from the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 due to the chaotic nature of the plot.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to NetGalley and Macmillian Audio for the opportunity to read this in advance of the release."

It also serves as a cautionary tale about the snowball effect of social media, particularly relevant during events like elections.  \n- **Ending:** While the ending didn’t feel as meaningful as I had hoped, the book’s strength lies in the journey rather than the destination.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is one of my favorite books of the year, thanks to its unforgettable characters, sharp writing, and timely themes. Despite a slightly underwhelming ending, the journey it takes readers on is deeply engaging and thought-provoking. I’m eager to explore more of the author’s works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5 (I’d like to give it 5 stars, but the ending held me back slightly.)"

I still hold his other series in high regard and remain a fan of his work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to Netgalley and St. Martin's Press for the review copy."

This is his first non-science-fiction book, though not his first piece of social satire.  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  *Black Box of Doom* does a fantastic job of portraying the internet's way of catastrophizing events and dehumanizing people, while also humanizing every single character.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  I ended the story empathizing hard with characters who espouse things I find personally very hateful, even the villain of the book.  \n- **Narrative Style and Impact:**  \n  The book offers an exciting, absurd, and thought-provoking road trip that kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJason Pargin proves his ability to excel in realistic fiction with *Black Box of Doom*, delivering a compelling story that balances satire, empathy, and social commentary.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the ideas presented are insightful and come thick and fast, the pacing feels unbalanced. The last third, however, focuses more on the story and characters, making it a great ride and worth sticking it out to reach that point.\n\n- **Social Commentary vs. Storytelling:**  \n  The social commentary takes precedence over the story, which is a departure from the author's usual style. While the commentary is thought-provoking, it overshadows the narrative, making the story feel secondary.\n\n- **Dialogue Authenticity:**  \n  The dialogue, particularly in the monologues, doesn’t feel authentic. For example, the way characters talk in cars doesn’t seem realistic, which detracts from the immersion.\n\n- **Use of Foreshadowing:**  \n  The book employs foreshadowing to hint at future events, which serves as a hook to keep readers engaged. However, I personally don’t find this technique necessary if the storytelling is strong enough on its own.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book offers insightful ideas and a compelling final third, the heavy focus on social commentary and the lack of authentic dialogue in the earlier sections make it less enjoyable compared to the author’s other works.

The Zooey books do this more overtly than *John Dies at the End (JDATE)*, but the context is present in both.  \n\n- **Humor and Impact:**  \n  This book is maybe slightly less funny than his others but way more impactful in making you think.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending is perfect.  \n\n- **Character Engagement:**  \n  The only reason this is not 5 stars is that I just didn’t like some of the main characters. I don’t think the story would work any other way, but I wasn’t rooting for the people I should have.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a perfect ending to a zany ride, blending humor with thought-provoking themes. While slightly less funny than the author’s previous works, it makes up for it with its impactful message. The ending is flawless, though my lack of connection with some main characters kept it from being a 5-star read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot a 5-star read due to character engagement issues."

Its unconventional nature made it a memorable read, especially when paired with Naomi Alderman’s *The Future*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was a compelling read that kept me engaged throughout.\n- **Character Development:** There were sections where the argument, thinking, or rationale of characters was blatantly explained. I felt this was unnecessary and went on for too long, which detracted from the narrative flow.\n- **Pacing:** The over-explanation of character reasoning occurred in less than 1% of the book, but it was noticeable enough to impact my overall experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite the occasional over-explanation of character reasoning, I still found the book enjoyable. This minor flaw is the reason I rated it 3.5 stars instead of 4.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5 stars."

With unexpected twists and a fast pace, it keeps the reader engaged while skillfully blending dark humor throughout. I was consistently entertained from start to finish.",

Both works delve into themes of internet fame and the unsettling realities of the online world, which I found thought-provoking. However, the book's message lacked clarity; while it aims to critique the darker aspects of the internet, I was left unclear about its intended takeaway. My interpretation may have been influenced by my post-election mindset, but I found it challenging to fully engage with the story.",

The author attempts to critique the darker corners of the internet, but I was left confused about the intended takeaway. Reading it post-election may have influenced my perspective, but I struggled to accept the story at face value.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you’re looking for a comedic sci-fi novel that sparks discussion, this is a great choice.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Writing Style and Mastery:**  \n  Jason \"David the Wong\" Keith Pargin writes with the same level of mastery as Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald. His ability to capture the essence of his era is comparable to Fitzgerald's depiction of the 1920s.  \n- **Thematic Depth:**  \n  The novel delves into the degeneracy of American life in the 2020s, mirroring Fitzgerald's exploration of the decadence of the 1920s. This thematic parallel highlights the cyclical nature of societal issues.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a powerful and masterful portrayal of contemporary American life, drawing a compelling parallel to Fitzgerald's depiction of the 1920s. It effectively captures the degeneracy of the 2020s with the same depth and insight.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I wanted to know what was going on and what was in the box.  \n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  The book provided a lot of commentary on our reliance and addiction to technology, as well as the lack of true community in modern society. It gave me a lot to think about and would be excellent for book clubs, as there’s plenty to discuss and debate.  \n\n- **Execution of Themes:**  \n  While the themes were thought-provoking, they became exhausting over time. The heavy-handed 'lesson' within the storyline felt tiresome and overbearing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character (MC) wasn’t likeable, and the more I read and learned about him, the less I liked him. However, there was some growth by the end of the story.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending descended into chaos. I was hoping for more, but it veered into the realm of the ridiculous rather than being fun and entertaining.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had a strong start with an engaging hook and thought-provoking themes, but it became weighed down by its heavy-handed execution. The unlikeable main character and chaotic ending detracted from the overall experience, leaving me somewhat disappointed despite the initial promise.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I think the long, unwieldy title that continues to go on and worry me might be part of the irony/satire of the book.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The fast-paced plot was engaging, though I personally think it climaxed a little early and then stretched out the tiniest bit long. However, there is always lots happening, keeping the reader hooked.\n\n- **Creativity and Character Development:**  \n  The creativity in pulling this story together is impressive. The characters are interesting and have depth, making them memorable and relatable.\n\n- **Humor:**  \n  There are many laugh-out-loud (LOL) moments throughout the book. The humor flows easily and does not feel forced, making it a genuinely hilarious read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *I’m Starting to Worry…* is a fun and very funny book with a fast-paced plot, creative storytelling, and well-developed characters. While it may appeal more to younger readers, its humor and visual style make it an enjoyable read for a wide audience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4+ stars  \n\nThanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review."

            "The adventure concludes with a uniquely satisfying twist, though I'll refrain from revealing specific details. Fans of humorous novels and modern, adventurous tales will likely appreciate this book. The premise captivates: protagonist Abbott Coburn is offered $200,000 to drive a mysterious woman cross-country, abandon his phone, and transport a black box—without asking questions. What begins as a potential Bonnie and Clyde escapade evolves into a rich narrative featuring a variety of related and peripheral characters. Told from a third-person perspective, the story is enhanced by snippets of online conspiracies and commentary that add depth.",
            "Abbott Coburn, the protagonist, may not be particularly sympathetic, but he embodies a familiar archetype in 2024: a man in his early twenties living at home, struggling with job prospects, and consumed by online streaming. The supporting characters—Ether, who serves as a vehicle for the author's TikTok rants; Abbott's father, Hunter; retired FBI agent Joan Key; and ex-biker Malort—infuse the narrative with depth and complexity.",
            "As a longtime fan of the author, from his contributions to Cracked to the *John Dies at the End* series, I eagerly anticipated this standalone novel. He skillfully captures the internet zeitgeist, incorporating themes from popular TikTok commentaries into the narrative.",
            "This novel delivers incisive commentary, especially through Ether’s rants, which serve as a critique of isolated young men navigating the online world. Set against the backdrop of American attitudes in 2024, the story masterfully weaves humor, adventure, and social critique into a compelling narrative."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a compelling blend of humor, adventure, and sharp social commentary, reflecting the author’s signature style. With its unique premise, colorful characters, and timely themes, it’s a highly recommended read for fans of his previous works or anyone interested in a story that captures the spirit of 2024 America.",

Pargin’s ability to capture the internet zeitgeist is evident here, with themes from his Tik Tok commentaries woven into the story.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot Structure:**  \n  The premise is intriguing: the protagonist, Abbott Coburn, is offered $200,000 to drive a mysterious woman cross-country, ditch his phone, and transport a black box without asking questions. What starts as a potential Bonnie and Clyde adventure evolves into a unique narrative told through multiple related and peripheral characters. The story unfolds through third-person perspective, with snippets of online conspiracies and commentary adding depth.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Abbott Coburn, the main character, is not particularly sympathetic but reflects a common archetype in 2024: an early-twenties man living at home, lacking stable job prospects, and immersed in online streaming. Other characters, such as Ether (a mouthpiece for Pargin’s Tik Tok rants), Abbott’s father Hunter, retired FBI agent Joan Key, and ex-biker Malort, add color and complexity to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  The novel is packed with sharp commentary, particularly through Ether’s rants, which seem to address Abbott as a proxy for isolated young men living online. The story is keenly attuned to American attitudes in 2024, blending humor, adventure, and social critique.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  The adventure concludes in a uniquely satisfying way, though I won’t spoil the details. Fans of Pargin’s works, humor novels, or stories with a modern, adventurous edge will likely enjoy this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of humor, adventure, and sharp social commentary, reflecting Jason Pargin’s signature style.

She convinces him to drive to Washington, DC, for a delivery by the Fourth of July.  \n  - Beneath the surface, the novel explores the dangers of social media and mob mentality. A single post suggesting a bomb turns Abbot’s journey into a nightmare.  \n  - The story also includes elements of terrorism, explosions, references to real events, and even aliens (sort of).  \n\n- **Relevance and Impact:**  \n  - The book’s exploration of social media’s influence feels incredibly relevant and realistic.  \n  - I can see this novel being used in World History or Psychology classes to study the effects of online interactions, social media, and mob mentality.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - If you haven’t read anything by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), this book is a great starting point.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“I’m Starting to Worry About This Black Box of Doom” is a gripping, thought-provoking novel that masterfully blends psychological horror with social commentary.
