            "The romantic subplot between Tempe and Ryan is a recurring theme throughout the story. Although Tempe's professional commitments put their relationship on pause, it remains integral to her character development and the overall narrative. The story opens with Tempe Brennan eager for a break with her long-distance partner, Andrew Ryan. However, her skills as a forensic anthropologist are urgently needed after a fire in Washington, D.C., results in at least four unidentified victims and no leads on the cause.\n\nPersonally, I tend to favor stories set in Canada. I feel the narrative doesn't resonate as strongly when relocated to locations like Charlotte, NC, or Washington, D.C., but this is simply a matter of personal taste.",

These aspects felt tedious and didn’t contribute meaningfully to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Tempe and Ryan):**  \n  The dynamic between Tempe and Ryan, once a vibrant part of the series, has diminished.

This is a disappointing shift, as their interactions previously added depth to the series.  \n\n- **Series Expectations and Future Hopes:**  \n  I hope future novels return to the engaging forensic work and dynamic crime-solving that originally made the series captivating.

            "The book features multiple intertwining storylines, but ultimately feels underdeveloped. With so much happening—like Ben's affair leading to murder, the burning of a third house, and Ryan going off-grid—there’s little room for deeper, meaningful character development. The resolution to the crime relies on unproven assumptions, such as whether Sue was merely an eccentric grandmother or if the Warrings truly bullied their family. While the book is a quick read that offers familiar elements for long-time fans, it comes across as rushed and somewhat superficial for my taste.",
            "I appreciated Katy and Ryan's appearance, but their roles felt somewhat superficial. The introduction of new sidekicks, Ivy and Deely, along with the new setting in DC, was a refreshing touch.",
            "The story suffered from excessive repetition of phrases and scenarios, such as \"a shadow darkened her door,\" and the recurring imagery of Christ/Jesus on unconventional items like a pickle or toast. Additionally, the frequent opening of scenes with Tempe waking up confused about her surroundings became tiresome. I found myself rolling my eyes on multiple occasions."

        "conclusion": "While the book had some enjoyable elements, such as the return of familiar characters and a new setting, it felt under-developed and rushed. The plot was overly complicated with unresolved assumptions, and the writing suffered from repetitive phrases. Overall, it didn’t live up to the standards of the more recent works.",

The TV show includes a lot of exaggerated, made-for-TV science (like Angela's holographic reconstructions), which, while cool, isn't very believable. The books, on the other hand, focus on solid science and investigative work, which I prefer.\n\n- **Characterization of Dr. Brennan:**  \n  Book Dr. Brennan is much more likable than her TV counterpart. She's funnier, more relatable, and more human and emotional. TV Dr. Brennan, in contrast, wasn't particularly funny or relatable.\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  In the TV show, I loved the supporting characters, especially Angela, Jack, and Dr. Sweets. Angela's ability to create holographic reconstructions was fascinating, even if I didn't fully understand how it worked. However, the books don't rely on such over-the-top science or characters, which makes them feel more grounded.\n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  I started with book #23, which is unusual for me, but I enjoyed it so much that I plan to go back and read the earlier books, starting with #17. I don’t have time to read all of them, but I’m eager to continue the series from there.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe *Bones* TV show and the Dr. Temperance Brennan books are very different, and I prefer the books for their more realistic science, relatable characters, and better portrayal of Dr. Brennan.

            "The novel intricately weaves a complex main storyline featuring three threads: a local case involving bone fragments, the recovery and autopsy of arson victims, and the discovery of an older body in a subcellar. Brennan faces numerous challenges, including a retired detective, logistical setbacks like a flooded kitchen, and uncooperative officials. The plot is peppered with intriguing twists that held my attention until the end.

The blend of personal and professional obstacles in Brennan's journey adds depth to the reading experience.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Introduction and Development:**  \n  - This was my first novel with Tempe Brennan, the protagonist of 32 other books. I enjoyed reading about her.  \n  - Tempe Brennan is a character who is way too generous. She accepts work even when she shouldn’t and is deeply invested in helping solve the case, which I found admirable.  \n\n- **Technical Vocabulary and Detail:**  \n  - As Brennan is an anthropologist, the book includes a lot of technical vocabulary and processes. At first, I had to sort out all the terminology, which was a bit overwhelming.  \n  - I imagine that after reading a few more books in the series, the technical aspects might become less confusing.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  - The first part of the investigation focused on the discovery of multiple bodies. As someone who doesn’t read many thrillers, I found this part hard to follow. There were many characters introduced, and I struggled to remember their roles.  \n  - The second half of the book was more engaging. The pace picked up, there was more action, and the investigation felt like it was finally progressing. The increasing tension and threats made it hard to put the book down.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Genre Appeal:**  \n  - This is a “niche” thriller with a lot of detailed anthropologist technicalities. If you enjoy that level of detail, this book is for you!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed reading this book, especially the second half, which was more action-packed and engaging. While the technical vocabulary and the initial complexity of the plot were challenging, Tempe Brennan’s character and the thrilling conclusion made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐"

            "I’m beginning to recognize her tells more easily, which made the ending less thrilling than usual. It’s intriguing how a panic button in every room plays a pivotal role in the conclusion.

The author needs to make a decision here—either develop this relationship or let it go."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Series Context and Standalone Potential:**  \n  I randomly got hooked on *Bones* back in the early aughts and binged it like there was no tomorrow. I knew it was based on a book series, but I never read one until now. *Fire & Bones* is book 23 in the series, and while I think you could read it as a standalone (like I did), I’m not sure this was the best one to get a first look at the series. It was good, but it didn’t wow me. I’ve seen a lot of great reviews, but there are some that say this wasn’t a favorite, which made me feel better about trying another book in the series.\n\n- **Characterization (Temperance Brennan):**  \n  What I did enjoy was Temperance herself. She’s a quirky and very factual character who inserts herself into police investigations by utilizing her extensive forensic anthropology knowledge to help solve crimes. (I say “insert” because, yes, she is asked, but then she kind of wears out her welcome.) I thought her personality was well-portrayed, and the narrator did a great job of embodying her, bringing her sometimes abrasive traits to a warmer tone.\n\n- **Plot and Case Details:**  \n  The case itself was interesting, and because I’m reading another book set in Foggy Bottom right now (*The Briar Club*), there was a lot of overlapping history on the Waring Family from DC. That was extremely interesting and added depth to the book for sure.\n\n- **Format and Narration:**  \n  As far as format goes, either would be great. The narration was excellent and allowed me to listen at 2.0x with no problem. I thought the narrator did a great job of embodying Temperance and bringing her sometimes abrasive personality traits to a warmer tone.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Fire & Bones* was a decent read, but I won’t be able to form a true opinion on the series until I read another book.

            "The story features a brisk pacing that I found enjoyable; however, the ending struck me as awkward. Brennan resolves the case by addressing questions that should have been tackled earlier, which felt contrived. A dramatic, albeit unrelated, incident at the end—drawing on the foreshadowed panic buttons—adds a satisfying twist. The narrative centers on an arson case in Foggy Bottom that results in four deaths, and Brennan uncovers a sub-victim: a petite woman buried in a burlap sack, dating back nearly 80 years. Her relentless pursuit to uncover the truth about this victim propels the story, even as others exhibit indifference. This investigation leads her to the Foggy Bottom Gang, a group of Prohibition-era smugglers, intertwining historical grievances with the contemporary arson case.",
            "Detective Deery and Brennan's interactions lacked believability, especially when Brennan joined suspect interviews despite Deery's strict adherence to protocol. Additionally, Brennan's attachment to her boyfriend felt inconsistent, as she seemed ready to abandon him at the slightest opportunity. While I appreciated her sharp observations and forensic expertise, the main case didn't fully engage me. However, the subplot involving a victim consumed by his own dogs was intriguing enough to make me consider reading another book by the author.",
            "The diction is staccato and noirish, featuring a clipped and hurried tone that evokes the feel of text messages. Frequent foreshadowing, such as the line “If I’d known the answers then, things might have been different,” amplifies the noir atmosphere and aligns well with the gangster theme. However, the occasional use of French seems random and unnecessary. Overall, the story maintains an engaging and accessible tone, making it a swift and enjoyable read."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While I enjoyed Brennan’s character and the forensic elements, the case itself didn’t fully resonate with me. The pacing was brisk, and the historical integration was a strong point, but the ending felt awkward and disjointed. Despite these flaws, the novel was entertaining and has piqued my interest in exploring more of the author’ work.",

            "I expected more forensic anthropology based on the book’s blurb and my experience with the TV adaptation. The additional files I reviewed felt unnecessary, primarily revealing Ben’s modus operandi without contributing significantly to the plot. I initially hoped they would help in taking down a misogynistic detective, but this subplot remained unresolved.",
            "I found it challenging to connect with the characters in this story. Tempe, the protagonist, came across as dry and socially awkward, which made her unengaging for much of the book. I was disappointed by the heavy reliance on dreams and the subconscious in her character development, as it felt unrealistic. The depiction of law enforcement and other professionals was overwhelmingly negative, with even the most helpful characters being dismissed or irritating to Tempe, receiving only superficial acknowledgment. Additionally, Ivy, a character I anticipated would play a significant role based on the blurbs and reviews, ultimately faded into the background and had little impact on the plot's resolution.",

However, apart from the main character, Temperance Brennan, being a forensic anthropologist, the similarities with the series end there. This is actually a good thing, as the books offer a different experience away from the glitz and glamour of the show.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The story begins with Brennan being called to Washington, DC, to assist in identifying four bodies from an arson attack in Foggy Bottom. However, she soon discovers there’s more to the case than just arson. The history of the town and its inhabitants is intriguing, and the mystery deepens when Brennan finds the body of a woman wrapped in a sack in the building’s cellar—a victim unrelated to the arson. The question of who she was and why she was hidden becomes a central focus for Brennan.  \n\n- **Character Dedication and Relationships:**  \n  Brennan is deeply dedicated to her job, often putting her personal relationships on hold to pursue answers. This time, the case becomes even more complex as more people end up dead, and Brennan races to uncover the truth. Her stay with a friend of her daughter’s, who happens to be a journalist on the case, adds a unique perspective to the investigation.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Immersion:**  \n  Kathy Reichs excels at making the reader feel like they’re right there as the events unfold. There’s a sense of compassion and understanding for both the victims and the perpetrator, who are portrayed as multi-dimensional characters. The forensic details are present but not overwhelming, striking a balance that keeps the reader engaged.  \n\n- **Pacing and Twists:**  \n  The book is a compelling puzzle, with Brennan following clues and uncovering unexpected twists. While the arson case is resolved to some extent, the mystery surrounding the second body feels less conclusive, leaving Brennan—and the reader—with lingering questions.  \n\n- **Series Accessibility:**  \n  *Fire and Bones* is the 23rd book in the Temperance Brennan series, but it’s only the second one I’ve read (the other being book 19). The series is designed so that readers can drop in and out without feeling like they’ve missed crucial information, making it easy to enjoy each book independently.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Fire and Bones* is a gripping addition to the Temperance Brennan series, offering a fresh mystery, well-developed characters, and a writing style that immerses the reader in the story. While it differs from the TV series, it stands strong on its own, delivering a compelling blend of forensic detail, emotional depth, and unexpected twists.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This one was no exception.\n   - I liked the way that most of this book resolved.\n   - I wasn't particularly fond of the situation at the end.

Although I typically don't prefer first-person point of view, the author’s skillful execution won me over.

When Anne reached out to me, I seized the opportunity right away.  \n\n- **Grammar and Writing Style:**  \n  In terms of grammar and style, there is nothing to critique—only positive feedback. While first-person POV is not my preference, I have no qualms praising it when it’s done well, and Reichs knows how to handle it. Temperance doesn’t come across as odd or overly introspective; she’s well-balanced. In fact, the story worked so well that I only noticed the POV halfway through (though I obviously picked it up right away).  \n\n- **Rhythm and Flow:**  \n  The rhythm and flow are superb. I can’t stress enough how much this author makes me happy when it comes to technical details.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot is well-handled, which I expected, though there are a couple of loose ends. For example, what’s the real deal with Thacker and Burgos? I would have loved to find out more about their motives.  \n\n- **Character Development (Temperance Brennan):**  \n  Temperance is a great protagonist. Her voice is strong enough to carry the plot, and her personality is nicely developed. Do I agree with everything she does or all her decisions? No. But do I take enormous pleasure in following her throughout the story? Absolutely.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Reading *Fire and Bones* feels like slipping into your favorite sweater. Thank you, Kathy Reichs. Until next time!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel lived up to my high expectations, delivering a well-crafted story with excellent technical execution and a compelling protagonist.

            "The central mysteries of the fires and bones showed promise, but they were overshadowed by excessive historical backstory and an overwhelming number of past characters, making the plot difficult to follow. The frequent foreshadowing at the end of chapters became repetitive and cliched, reminiscent of suspense music in a low-budget film. Additionally, the subplot regarding the fifth victim felt unnecessary and confusing, ultimately detracting from the main narrative.",
            "In *Fire and Bones*, Tempe Brennan's behavior feels inconsistent with her established character. She too readily abandons her vacation, stays with a stranger, and meets a mysterious caller without hesitation. Her choice to ignore anonymous threats and avoid informing anyone is both frustrating and out of character. This portrayal departs from the assertive and independent Tempe I’ve come to admire. However, Fireman Burgos and Detective Deery are well-drawn characters who add depth to the story, even if their mistrust of Tempe is exasperating. On a lighter note, Chuck the chinchilla brings delightful levity to the narrative."

While this might reflect real-life scenarios, as a reader, I would have preferred a more satisfying or dramatic resolution, given that it's fiction.  \n\n- **Series Improvement:**  \n  This installment is an improvement over the previous one in the Brennan series, with a more compelling plot and a fresh setting that adds depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel offers an engaging mystery with a well-developed setting and intriguing character dynamics. While the ambiguous resolution of one storyline was a bit disappointing, the story as a whole is a step up from the previous installment in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The introduction of Ivy Doyle adds a new dynamic, but the new detective in DC feels like a rehash of previous characters, lacking originality.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story is set in Washington, DC, and incorporates historical elements, such as the Foggy Bottom Gang, which adds depth to the mystery. However, the setting does not significantly deviate from the usual environments in the series.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The pacing is steady, with the mystery unfolding gradually. The historical connections and the dual fires provide intrigue, but the predictability of the plot and the familiar tropes may reduce the sense of suspense for long-time readers.\n\n- **Originality and Creativity:**  \n  While the historical angle (Foggy Bottom Gang) adds a layer of interest, the overall story feels repetitive and lacks fresh twists. The formulaic nature of the plot, including Tempe's last-minute rescue, detracts from the novel's originality.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel adheres closely to the established formula of the series, offering a familiar but predictable experience. While the historical elements and the setting provide some intrigue, the lack of originality in character development and plot structure may leave long-time readers wanting more. It’s a decent read for fans of the series but doesn’t break new ground.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The protagonist has become abrasive, arrogant, and overly critical of others.  \n   - She consistently puts her boyfriend on the back burner and fails to understand his frustration.  \n   - There are too many asides where she expresses disdain for others and judges people primarily based on their looks.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n   - The primary mystery lacks resolution, ending with a vague \"oh well...maybe in the future something will turn up.\"  \n   - The 80-year timeline for the murder feels unrealistic and poorly thought out.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy:**  \n   - The depiction of fashion (e.g., garter belts and calf-length skirts) is inaccurate for the mid-'60s, as garter belts were no longer commonly worn by people in their twenties by that time, and shorter hemlines were more fashionable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a disappointment. The protagonist's unlikable personality, unresolved plot, and historical inaccuracies made it difficult to enjoy. It has reinforced my decision to avoid the author's newer works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She's competent in her field as she must be to carry on in this kind of novel... as she has done many times before.\"  \n  - \"Kathy Reichs has so many good reads out there.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I am a fan of Kathy Reichs and appreciate her expertise in her field, this particular novel fell short of my expectations. The story felt disjointed, likely due to its basis in real events, which seemed to hinder the narrative flow and entertainment value. Although there were some engaging moments in the crime scene analysis, the overall experience was marred by excessive, unrelated details. I remain hopeful that this was an outlier in her otherwise impressive body of work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Despite this, I’ve still found them enjoyable and looked forward to each new release.  \n- **Attempts at Innovation:**  \n  I didn’t really like the last book, but I appreciated that the author tried something new.  \n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  This is the first book where I felt the writing was poor, in addition to the plot being formulaic.  \n- **Future Engagement:**  \n  This might be the last book in the series I read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I’ve been a loyal reader of the Temperance Brennan series, this latest installment fell short for me. The writing quality declined significantly, and the plot felt overly formulaic. Despite appreciating the author’s attempt to innovate in the previous book, this one has left me questioning whether I’ll continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars."

Tempe is called to the scene by Ivy Doyle, an investigative reporter and a friend of her daughter's. The story unfolds as Tempe and Ivy investigate the four bodies found at the house, with Ivy providing historical context about the area and the house, which was once the base of operations for The Foggy Bottom Gang—bootleggers and smugglers in the 1930s and 1940s.  \n\n- **Forensic Investigation and Historical Connection:**  \n  When a small body is discovered in the subbasement, Tempe, a thorough and renowned forensic anthropologist, analyzes it and determines that the death occurred in the 1930s or 1940s, linking it to the Foggy Bottom Gang. The investigation deepens as Tempe and Ivy explore possible connections between the two cases, especially after another fire destroys another house in the area.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n  I loved the way the author described the autopsies and the evidence the remains provided, despite their gruesome appearance. The forensic details were fascinating and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Twist and Ending:**  \n  I did not see the conclusion coming, but it was a great ending to these cases. The resolution was satisfying and well-executed.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This book is a combination of a crime drama, a historical thriller, and a forensic investigation. While there is a high body count and the autopsies can be difficult to read about, the characters' dedication and intelligence only added to the genius of the book.  \n\n- **Personal Reflection and Future Interest:**  \n  I hope to read another book by this author, and I’ll have to check out *Bones* on streaming (if it’s still available).  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher, and the opinions expressed are entirely my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping blend of crime, history, and forensic science, with well-developed characters and a surprising, satisfying conclusion.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The story revolves around Temperance, who travels to Washington DC to investigate a murder as a favor for her daughter's friend. The premise is intriguing, but the mystery aspect fell short for me because I guessed the killer too early, which diminished the suspense and surprise.  \n\n- **Character Engagement:**  \n  Temperance is a compelling protagonist, and her involvement in the case feels personal due to her connection to her daughter's friend. However, the lack of deeper character development or emotional stakes made it harder to fully invest in her journey.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was steady, but the early reveal of the killer (at least to me) made the latter part of the story feel less engaging. The structure could have benefited from more twists or red herrings to maintain tension.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an interesting premise and a likable protagonist, the predictability of the mystery reduced its overall impact. It’s a decent read but could have been more gripping with a stronger, less predictable plot.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars."

            "The story of Temperance Brennan continues in book 23, and I have been hooked on this series since discovering \"Deja Dead.\" I was thrilled to receive an ARC of the latest installment. However, I found this book to be slower-paced than its predecessors. The mystery felt lackluster and seemed hastily constructed in the end.",

            "The chapter endings were rife with excessive foreshadowing, yet the development from one chapter to the next was minimal. The epilogue, set a year later, felt outlandish, and the four-month reveal that followed further contributed to the sense of disjointedness. Overall, this book only scratched the surface of the stories I remember from earlier works. Having read the 21st book in the series and rated it 2 stars, I can see a noticeable decline in quality over time.",
            "Tempe often came across as flat and somewhat oblivious. Her habit of questioning others' reactions and sharing her own peculiar thoughts became rather irritating."

        "conclusion": "While I once avidly followed this type of story, this book fell short of my expectations. Tempe’s characterization felt flat, the plot lacked meaningful development, and the pacing was disjointed. Despite my admiration for the author’s prolific career, this installment marks the end of my journey.",

Tempe’s characterization felt flat, the plot lacked meaningful development, and the pacing was disjointed.
