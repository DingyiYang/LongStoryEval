He is sophisticated, adventurous, and confident‚Äîqualities Evie wishes for in herself.‚Äù  \n  - ‚ÄúMany of us feel indebted to our parents, but the truth is, parenthood is a choice they took on.

Evie‚Äôs grief over her father‚Äôs death from cancer is more distant, while her softer grief over her aunt‚Äôs recent death is central to the story. Her journey is about learning to live as her aunt would have wanted her to.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The opposites-attract romance between Evie and the stern, laced-up Adam is engaging and adds a layer of charm to the story. The dynamic between them is fun and compelling, making their relationship a highlight of the novel.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The premise of a matchmaking tour, funded by Evie‚Äôs late aunt, is unique and intriguing. The idea of inheriting a multi-million dollar home in the Bay Area and an all-inclusive five-star tour adds an element of wish-fulfillment to the story.  \n\n- **Narration and Format:**  \n  The story would likely translate well to an audiobook format, as the engaging narrative and character interactions would make for an enjoyable listening experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut romance combines a delightful vacation setting in Vietnam with heartfelt themes of grief and self-discovery. The opposites-attract romance between Evie and Adam is charming, and the unique premise of a matchmaking tour adds an intriguing layer to the story. It‚Äôs a fun and emotionally resonant read that would also work well as an audiobook.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance between Adam and Evie lacked the depth one would expect in a love story. At times, I found myself uncertain about whether I wanted them to end up together, which is disappointing for a romance novel. Adam's inconsistent behavior, particularly his tendency to ignore Evie for days after their intimate moments, was both off-putting and frustrating.",
            "Evie's journey of self-discovery after quitting her job felt lackluster and unengaging. I struggled to understand her motivations for pursuing the project introduced at the end of the book. Adam's sister was particularly grating in her interactions with both Evie and Adam. Moreover, the incessant reminders from other characters that Adam still had feelings for his ex, Lana‚Äîdespite her infidelity‚Äîwere frustrating. The revelation that Lana had deceived Adam about the reasons for Evie's departure was particularly infuriating.",

There were moments where I wasn‚Äôt even sure if I wanted them to end up together, which isn‚Äôt ideal for a romance novel.

I didn‚Äôt fully understand or connect with her decision to start whatever little project she pursued at the end of the book.\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  Adam‚Äôs sister was incredibly annoying, both in how she spoke to Evie and how she interacted with her brother. Additionally, the constant reminders from other characters that Adam was still in love with his ex, Lana, despite her cheating on him, were frustrating. The revelation that Lana lied to Adam about why Evie left was infuriating.\n\n- **Highlights:**  \n  Despite my issues with the main romance, I enjoyed meeting the new characters introduced during the matchmaking trip. I would absolutely love to read a story about Fen and Mei‚Äîthey were intriguing and left me wanting more.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its strengths, particularly in its writing style and vivid setting, the romance and certain character dynamics didn‚Äôt work for me.

            "While I enjoyed the story overall, the miscommunication and lack of communication, particularly toward the end, were drawbacks. I needed more assurance that Adam and Evie's relationship could withstand challenges without crumbling after a single conflict. Additionally, the large cast of characters may be overwhelming for some readers, although it didn‚Äôt bother me. I thoroughly enjoyed the vibrant narrative of Adam and Evie's Matchmaking Tour, filled with culture, meddling families, unexpected loves, and newfound longings.

This tour not only offers matchmaking opportunities but also allows Evie to reconnect with her heritage and culture.",
            "Adam and Evie are well-crafted characters, each with their own flaws. Evie, aimless and a bit of a wanderer, is struggling to find her direction, especially after her aunt's death. In contrast, Adam is a rigid workaholic shaped by a strict upbringing, making him somewhat unapproachable. Their differing personalities‚ÄîEvie‚Äôs carefree spirit and Adam‚Äôs disciplined approach‚Äîcreate both tension and a magnetic attraction. I found them both compelling despite their imperfections. As an enemies-to-lovers story, the banter between them before they fall in love was delightful. I appreciated how their relationship deepened as they explored Vi·ªát Nam together, both on and off the tourist trail. The exploration of Adam‚Äôs family dynamics was both intriguing and frustrating; his patriarchal father and toxic family environment were vividly depicted, and I admired Adam's journey to assert himself against cultural expectations. However, I found his sister‚Äôs actions infuriating, even though she too was grappling with her own struggles. ",

            "I enjoyed this book, even though third-person narration isn‚Äôt my preferred style. The alternating chapters from Evie and Adam's viewpoints allowed me to connect deeply with their characters, making the story feel personal despite the perspective. The concept of a matchmaking tour intrigued me, and I found myself wishing I could experience something similar in real life, regardless of its romantic focus. It brought to mind my own Scotland/Outlander tour, which was both memorable and worth the expense.",
            "Evie is a relatable character, a poet grappling with her writing while trapped in a comfortable yet unfulfilling life. Her experiences, including her father‚Äôs passing and her mother‚Äôs disconnection from their cultural heritage, add depth to her journey. Auntie Hao plays a vital role in keeping Evie connected to her roots and nurturing her passions. In contrast, Adam hails from a wealthy, image-conscious family, evoking immediate dislike for his parents. His sister, though viewed as the golden child, struggles beneath a facade of perfection.\n\nInitially, Adam joins the matchmaking tour as the company‚Äôs face, but this leads to unexpected chemistry with Evie, even if their first encounter was less than ideal. I admired Evie for her kindness, creativity, and adventurous spirit, while Adam‚Äôs hot-and-cold behavior proved frustrating‚Äîthough his family expectations and personal conflicts offered some context. The third-act breakup felt realistic given their different backgrounds, but I appreciated how the story ultimately resolved, allowing Evie and Adam to find their way to each other.",
            "This book delves into themes of cultural identity, family expectations, and the courage to pursue love against all odds. Evie's innovative teaching methods and her struggles within a rigid education system underscore the difficulties of remaining authentic in a constrained environment."

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the witty banter between Adam and Evie, filled with heartfelt moments. Adam, the CMO of his sister's matchmaking cruise company, is focused on his predetermined path toward success and a stable family life. In contrast, Evie is hesitant about love and only agrees to go on the cruise to secure her inheritance, despite the puzzling insistence of her aunt, who never valued marriage. With her life in turmoil, Evie is ready for a change. \n\nAdam recognizes that Evie is a mess and lacks a clear future, making her everything he‚Äôs been advised to avoid. Yet, he finds himself irresistibly drawn to her. I appreciated Adam‚Äôs character development throughout the story, and Evie‚Äôs unexpected emotional connection to him added depth. The narrative beautifully illustrates that love isn't always practical; sometimes, a soulmate is not who you've been told to seek, but rather the one who captivates you.\n\nI truly enjoyed their unfolding love story and would love to see a tale centered on Adam's sister, Ruby. Although she frustrated me at times, I believe she also deserves her own happily ever after."

The story felt rushed, as if I was skimming through it rather than being fully immersed. The pacing made it difficult to connect with the narrative.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The insta-love between Adam and Evie was a major letdown. Their relationship went from strangers to head-over-heels without any meaningful buildup. The lack of depth in their conversations made it hard to believe their bond was more than physical attraction. The three- to four-week tour didn‚Äôt provide enough time for a believable relationship to develop.  \n\n- **Cultural Exploration:**  \n  On a positive note, I enjoyed the exploration of Vietnamese culture. The descriptions of iconic landmarks and the themes of heritage, legacy, and cultural differences were fresh and engaging. The perspectives on grief were also thoughtful and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both Adam and Evie lacked significant growth throughout the book. They remained largely unchanged, which made their insta-love feel even more unrealistic. Evie‚Äôs chaotic personal life overshadowed what could have been a deeper exploration of Vietnamese traditions and culture.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n  The book touched on important themes like grief, forbidden love, and self-discovery, but none of these ideas were given enough attention. The narrative felt unfocused, with too many elements crammed in, leaving little room for meaningful exploration.  \n\n- **Matchmaking Company:**  \n  The matchmaking company‚Äôs focus on wealthy clients felt off and detracted from the story.

The descriptions of the food, places they went, and activities they did were so vivid. It gave slight \"Crazy Rich Asians\" vibes, though it was more focused on the romance.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  I thought a matchmaking tour was a fun set-up for a romance, especially since the circumstances for both main characters sort of \"forced\" them to do it. This premise opened up a lot of self-reflection about what they wanted out of not only a relationship but also their careers and lives.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I was invested in Evie and Adam as individuals. I really related to Evie wanting to connect to her father's heritage and homeland. Their banter and tension were great, and I enjoyed their dynamic.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  My couple of cons: the family issues they both had felt like they wrapped up a little too quickly at the end.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Connection:**  \n  I think Evie and Adam could've had even more conversations that were rooted in showing their (not physical) connection.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its vivid setting, engaging premise, and relatable characters. While the resolution felt a bit rushed and I wished for deeper emotional conversations between the leads, it was a satisfying and immersive read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThank you to NetGalley and Avon for the e-arc!"

The middle of the book dragged a bit for me, but I blew through the beginning and ending in one sitting (or maybe two).  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I did find Evie somewhat mildly annoying, especially her time management, wandering around, and sometimes her thought processes. I also found it frustrating when Evie met Adam‚Äôs parents. I could relate to and understand what Adam‚Äôs parents said, even though I was rooting for Adam and Evie.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book was enjoyable, and I loved the heart-wrenching twist. I thought it was nicely done, even if it was a bit clich√©. The quote, ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôve sunk to your lowest, every step forward feels like an ascension,‚Äù really resonated with me.  \n\n- **Cultural Insights:**  \n  In Vietnam, we have a saying, ‚Äúm√¥n ƒëƒÉng h·ªô ƒë·ªëi,‚Äù meaning ‚Äú(partner who‚Äôs) equal in wealth and status.‚Äù While it‚Äôs not necessarily a good thing, it plays a big part in Vietnamese culture, as we believe that mindsets, personalities, and views on life, work, social interactions, and relationships differ vastly between people of different statuses and wealth. This cultural insight added depth to the story, even though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly asked for.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  We all need an Auntie H·∫£o and Adam in our lives. How I wished my life was like in the book!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable read that provided a vivid journey through Vietnam‚Äôs culture and landmarks. While the pacing had some uneven moments and the lack of a glossary for Vietnamese terms might frustrate some readers, the emotional twists, cultural insights, and relatable themes made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars, rounding up."

Adam, the seemingly grumpy and aloof guy, turned out to have a hidden heart of gold, and their hilarious meet-cute sparked an entertaining banter that was rich in both snark and chemistry throughout the story. \n\nI empathized with both Adam and his sister Ruby, who struggled under the weight of family expectations. I adored Evie's approach to dealing with their parents and was equally impressed by Adam‚Äôs reactions. Adam's grandmother was another standout character‚Äîwise, sassy, and hilarious, especially when she sent his mother outside, prompting a snort of laughter from me. \n\nEvie‚Äôs friendship with her cousin Lillian added depth, while other tour guests like Fen brought even more joy. Fen was a supportive friend to Evie, and I felt for her as she shared her reason for joining the tour. With her humor and great advice, she easily became a favorite. Talia and Pin were another delightful pair, exuding cuteness together. \n\nI admired Adam's open bravery regarding his feelings for Evie. Their moments of vulnerability made them an adorable couple, and the ending was simply perfect.",

From chapters 5-9, the narrative gained traction, showcasing a natural tension between the main characters. Although chapters 15-19 felt repetitive in the push and pull of Adam and Evie‚Äôs dynamic, this ultimately enhanced the emotional payoff.

            "In this story, the main characters, Adam and Evie, share a believable attraction and tension, though their bond leans more toward lust than genuine emotional connection. Adam's inner turmoil and gradual emotional growth are effectively portrayed; however, his relationship with Lana feels underdeveloped and is more told than shown. Side characters, such as Ruby, add depth, despite her unlikable behavior toward Evie. Meanwhile, the portrayal of Adam's parents is flat and stereotypical, lacking a dynamic relationship with their son.",

To claim her inheritance, she must embark on a matchmaking tour in Vietnam, where she reconnects with her father‚Äôs heritage. On this journey, she meets Adam Quy√™n, who, despite being pressured by his affluent parents, reluctantly joins the tour. Evie challenges Adam‚Äôs rigid worldview, creating a compelling dynamic between them. The premise is engaging, and the matchmaking tour provides a unique backdrop for the narrative. However, some plot elements, such as Evie‚Äôs ongoing contact with her ex‚Äîwho not only fired her but also lied about her job‚Äîfeel unnecessary and add little to the story. Additionally, the third-act breakup and the two-month communication lapse between Evie and Adam seem contrived and unrealistic, undermining the emotional authenticity of their relationship.",
            "Evie is a likable and adventurous character who embraces challenges, confronting her fears head-on. Adam, on the other hand, is complex and torn between parental expectations and his own desires. While their banter is enjoyable, their relationship occasionally lacks depth.

It's refreshing to see a Vietnamese lead, as Asian or half-Asian male protagonists are often underrepresented in romance novels. Evie, the female main character, is equally relatable, navigating feelings of apathy and identity crises stemming from her father's death and her mother's struggles to cope. The side characters, particularly Fen, enrich the narrative, adding depth and charm to the overall story.",

It becomes challenging to connect with characters when a narrator describes them rather than allowing us to experience their thoughts directly.",

This story, set in Vietnam, offered a refreshing departure from the typical Ireland and Scotland backdrops I often encounter.

Reading a book set in Vietnam was a fun and interesting change from the usual Ireland and Scotland settings I‚Äôve encountered. The premise of a matchmaking tour was great, though I wish we could have gotten more from the other characters on the tour and their love stories. We got a little bit, but I would have been happy with more.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  There were some major *Crazy Rich Asians* vibes, especially with Adam‚Äôs meddling family. I really liked the banter and the almost antagonistic relationship between the main characters at the beginning, as well as the fact that they‚Äôre opposites who complement each other. However, there were a few times I felt the plot pushed them together a little too conveniently, making it a bit unrealistic for me. I also wish they had spent more time together and had more conversations so we could see their chemistry and love grow, rather than just being told that it had.\n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Perspective:**  \n  Third person, present tense writing is always my least favorite and makes it harder for me to read smoothly. If this had been written in third person, past tense or first person, present tense, I think it would have worked better overall and felt less formal. I find it harder to connect with characters when a narrator is telling us about them instead of us feeling like we are in their inner thoughts.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Strengths:**  \n  Despite these points, I really enjoyed the premise of the book, and the writing was beautiful!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book enjoyable with its unique setting and premise, though I had some reservations about the character development, plot convenience, and narrative style.

            "Adam and Ruby's story lacked sufficient conflict resolution, particularly regarding Ruby's problematic behavior, which felt overlooked. The beginning and ending were a bit shaky, but the middle section, where Adam and Evie connect during the tour, truly shone. Their banter was delightful, and I craved more of those interactions. Unfortunately, there were many chapters where their exciting moments would fizzle out before reigniting again a chapter or two later.",
            "Fen was a standout minor character‚Äîfun, interesting, and the best friend we never knew we needed! However, Adam's dialogue felt distinctly American, which was surprising considering he only spent a year in the U.S., primarily focused on school and lacking many authentic experiences. While the novel features an open-door romance with a few steamy scenes, I‚Äôd rate the spice level at just 2/5.",
            "The book is written in third person, which took me a moment to adjust to, especially since I've been reading many first-person narratives recently.",
            "This book captivated me from the start with its engaging synopsis, compelling title, and beautiful cover. It was refreshing to read a romance novel featuring two Vietnamese main characters and set in Vietnam. I particularly enjoyed the journey they took together, exploring the vibrant locations and delicious foods of the region."

However, I felt like Adam spoke very American, which seemed strange for someone who only spent a year in America, primarily in school without many American experiences.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  Adam and Ruby needed way more conflict resolution than they got. Ruby‚Äôs behavior was straight foul, and it seemed to have been brushed under the rug.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The beginning and end were a bit shaky for me. The middle, when they‚Äôre on the tour and Adam and Evie make their way together, was so good. They had great banter, and I wish we got more of it. There were a lot of chapters where they would have an amazing time, and then it would cool off until another chapter or two.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book was written in third person, which took me a little while to get used to since I‚Äôve read a lot of first-person books lately.  \n\n- **Romance and Spice:**  \n  It‚Äôs an open-door romance novel with a few spicy scenes, but overall, I‚Äôd rate it a 2/5 on the spice meter.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the unique representation and setting, as well as some strong moments in the middle of the story, the lack of conflict resolution, uneven pacing, and lower spice level left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice Meter: 2/5"

Evie feels like a chaotic mix of tropes‚Äîmanic pixie dream girl, dark academia, bubblegum pop princess, feminist poet, recluse introvert, and college professor‚Äîall rolled into one. It‚Äôs like a tossed salad of heroine archetypes. Adam is the only consistent character, even if his emotions aren‚Äôt. At least Evie understands him.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story jumps around without smooth transitions. For example, Ruby encourages Adam to join the tour to ‚Äúexperience love,‚Äù but then immediately reminds him of his familial and ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù duties. Within the next sentence, they‚Äôre on another leg of their journey, with no transition. It feels abrupt and disjointed.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I picked this up after reading Helen Hoang‚Äôs books, hoping for a similar taste of Vietnam. Unfortunately, Hoang‚Äôs work overshadowed this one. While this book is cute with a little sweet and spicy, it‚Äôs like store-bought sweet and sour spring roll sauce‚Äîhomemade still reigns supreme, but it‚Äôs not bad either.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel has its charms, but it struggles with inconsistent characterization, abrupt pacing, and a lack of smooth transitions.

The other guests on the matchmaking tour added an entertaining element as they navigated their own romantic journeys, though there were almost too many side characters to keep track of effectively.

While this shift might reflect her self-discovery and growth, it occasionally pulled me out of the narrative.",

Evie and Adam didn't have believable character growth arcs to justify their deep love for each other.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the vivid depiction of Vietnam and the novel's ending, the lack of believable chemistry between Evie and Adam, along with forced plot elements and unconvincing character development, made the story feel predictable and unsatisfying.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

For a romance debut, this was very well done.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved the female lead immediately. The secondary characters were also great. However, the male lead‚Äôs mixed messages were frustrating for both the female lead and me as a reader. He ran hot and cold, which detracted from my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing was really good, and the author captured the complexities of life, which can sometimes be frustrating.  \n\n- **Setting and Descriptions:**  \n  I loved the trip the characters took through Vietnam. This was my first novel set in Vietnam, and the descriptions of the country were really beautiful.  \n\n- **Accessibility:**  \n  I wish the book had a pronunciation guide at the beginning. I frequently had to stop to Google how to pronounce names and places. Maybe I will listen to the audiobook next time to address this issue.  \n\n- **Author‚Äôs Potential:**  \n  I look forward to reading more by this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some frustrating elements, particularly with the male lead‚Äôs behavior, it was a strong debut with excellent writing, memorable characters, and vivid descriptions of Vietnam. I would recommend it with some reservations and am excited to see what the author writes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5‚≠ê"

            "The pacing of the story felt uneven, particularly in the back-and-forth between Evie and Adam, which lingered too long and could have benefited from more concise editing. The premise is both intriguing and unique: Evie inherits her aunt's San Francisco rowhouse but must participate in a matchmaking tour in Vietnam to officially claim it. This concept is cute and fun; however, the execution occasionally feels drawn out.",
            "Evie is a relatable and likable protagonist, and I enjoyed following her engaging journey throughout the story. Adam, the CFO of the matchmaking tour, was a mixed bag for me. He often appeared uptight and obnoxious, which made it difficult to connect with him initially. I nearly gave up on the book because of his character. However, his backstory and struggles with his upbringing resonated deeply, particularly as someone familiar with Asian culture. I found myself empathizing with both him and his sister‚Äôs experiences.",

Evie inherits her aunt‚Äôs San Francisco rowhouse but must go on a matchmaking tour in Vietnam to officially claim it.
