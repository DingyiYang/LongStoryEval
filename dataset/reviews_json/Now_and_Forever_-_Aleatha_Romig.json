The heroine's discovery of Josie's existence and her acceptance of Jasmine into their lives feels rushed and lacks emotional depth.

Cat's efforts to make her arranged marriage successful were commendable, and her surprising acceptance after the wedding was noteworthy. Dario also deviated from the typical “disgusting jackass” portrayal of mafia men, which was refreshing. While the ending was satisfactory, I would have preferred to see more, such as the birth of the baby or Cat further along in her pregnancy.",

Dario was in a committed relationship with his ex, Josie, for nine years and was deeply in love with her. Although he no longer loved Josie by the time he married Catalina, this backstory still bothered me. I prefer heroes who have only ever loved the heroine.",

Dario was in a committed relationship with Josie (his ex) for 9 years and deeply in love with her. By the time he married Cat, he wasn’t in love with Josie anymore, but it still bothered me. I prefer heroes who have only ever loved the heroine.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The book was okay overall but lacked the punch I was hoping for. It felt tamer compared to other books by Aleatha that I’ve read.  \n  - Cat tried to make the arranged marriage work and was surprisingly accepting after they got married.  \n  - Dario wasn’t a typical “disgusting jackass” like most mafia men, which was a plus.  \n\n- **Ending and Satisfaction:**  \n  - The ending was okay, but I would have liked to see more, such as the baby being born or Cat further along in her pregnancy.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  - Standalone but part of an interconnected series.  \n  - I won’t be reading the next book featuring Alejandro and Mia as the main characters, as I’m not a fan of either.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an okay book to pass the time. While it had some enjoyable elements, it didn’t fully meet my expectations, particularly due to the hero’s past relationship and the lack of emotional intensity I craved. The ending was satisfying but could have been more detailed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars."

            "The plot was underwhelming. The depiction of the Familia, its customs, and its struggles with the Cartel felt outdated, reminiscent of stories from the 80s or 90s rather than 2024. The wedding debacle echoed *The Godfather*, while the over-the-top narratives surrounding the crime organizations felt stale. Additionally, the predictability of Cat’s character arc and the pregnancy trope detracted from the overall experience.",
            "The characters were underwhelming. While Dario was kind to Cat, I found his personality unsatisfactory; he often came off as hypocritical and his character deteriorated significantly in the latter part of the story. Cat initially showed promise, but she quickly diminished into the role of Dario's wife, lacking spark, independence, and depth, which rendered her predictable and uninteresting.",

Dario's shock at learning about Mia's decade-long abuse by Rocco, which went unnoticed by the family, felt unrealistic and frustrating. Additionally, Cat's obsession with getting pregnant and producing an heir shortly after marriage seemed regressive, particularly for a character with a college degree."

            "Dario is a multifaceted character, navigating the tension between his ruthless, violent persona as a mafia boss and his gentle, understanding side toward Catalina. Meanwhile, Catalina transforms from a shy, timid woman into a confident partner who stands proudly beside her husband rather than behind him.
