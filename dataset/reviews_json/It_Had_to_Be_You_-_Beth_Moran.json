            "This second-chance romance features alternating chapters set in the past and present, allowing readers to explore the characters' backstories and their growth over the years. I appreciated this depth, as it enriched my understanding of their journey.",
            "I appreciated the novel's refreshing take on foster care, presenting it in a positive light, which is a welcome change from the often negative portrayals in thrillers. The story also features a rare and commendable representation of a single teenage dad stepping up to embrace his responsibilities. Among the characters, Nicky stood out to me; her unwavering support for her sister reminded me of my own sibling relationship. The protagonist, Libby, is a single mother navigating a chaotic life—balancing a messy household, running a charity, and being career-focused. While my boys are now 35 and 40, I could deeply relate to her struggles, recalling both the fondness and challenges of those busy days.",
            "I've enjoyed every book I've read by this author, including *Let It Snow*, *Take Me Home*, and *Because You Loved Me*, all of which earned four stars from me. Her works consistently deliver realism and attention to detail, and *It Had to Be You* is no exception."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*It Had to Be You* is a heartfelt and realistic novel that tackles tough topics with sensitivity and depth. The author delivers another compelling story with relatable characters, a well-structured narrative, and a refreshing perspective on themes like foster care and single parenthood. It’s a book about second chances, self-love, and the complexities of life and relationships.",

Her books, including *Let It Snow*, *Take Me Home*, and *Because You Loved Me*, were all four-star reads for me. Moran's books are always realistic and detail-oriented, and *It Had to Be You* did not disappoint.  \n\n- **Relatability of Characters and Themes:**  \n  The protagonist, Libby, is a single mother with a chaotic life—she has a messy house, runs a charity, and is very work-oriented. I could relate to her struggles, even though my boys are now 35 and 40. I remember those days with fondness, but they were also really hard.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  This is a second-chance romance with alternating \"now and then\" chapters. I enjoyed getting the backstory of the characters to see what they were like growing up.  \n\n- **Depth and Realism of Themes:**  \n  Though this is a romance, it is in no way a fluffy read. Moran tackles tough topics like mental health, parental abandonment, drugs, teenage pregnancy, divorce, and extramarital affairs. She writes about these issues in a realistic yet sensitive way.  \n\n- **Unique Perspectives and Representation:**  \n  I loved the foster care angle, as it was refreshing to see a positive spin on it. Many thrillers portray foster parents negatively, but this book offered a different perspective. I also appreciated the portrayal of a single teenage dad stepping up and taking responsibility, which is rare in literature.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The side character, Nicky, stood out to me the most. She reminded me of my own sister in the way she’s always there for her sister, no matter what.  \n\n- **Overall Message and Impact:**  \n  This is a wonderful book about second chances, what it means to be a success, and learning to love yourself.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*It Had to Be You* is a heartfelt and realistic novel that tackles tough topics with sensitivity and depth. Beth Moran delivers another compelling story with relatable characters, a well-structured narrative, and a refreshing perspective on themes like foster care and single parenthood. It’s a book about second chances, self-love, and the complexities of life and relationships.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Previous books by the author: 4 stars  \n- *It Had to Be You*: No specific rating mentioned, but it \"did not disappoint.\"  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Engagement and Tone:**  \n   - I loved Beth’s latest book, *It Had to Be You*. You can tell right from the beginning that the subject matter is very close to the author’s heart and firsthand experience.  \n   - I laughed a lot while reading, but I also cringed at some of the squeamish parts.  \n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n   - Beth included many difficult topics in the book, such as teenage pregnancies, parental abuse, and single mums and dads.  \n   - It was particularly interesting to read how a single teenage dad coped with being thrust into fatherhood, with no support from his partner.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n   - The book is a dual timeline story, flipping between present day and when our female protagonist, Libby, is sixteen and just about to sit her GCSEs.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - I enjoyed reading about Libby and her sister’s life growing up amongst the many foster kids who came through their home.  \n   - The rules set in place to keep everyone comfortable and safe within the home added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Personal Reflection and Connection:**  \n   - I’m not sure I’d be very good at delivering a baby—too much mess for me!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBeth Moran’s *It Had to Be You* is a heartfelt and engaging novel that balances humor, romance, and challenging themes. The dual timeline structure and well-developed characters, particularly Libby and her sister, make for a compelling read. While some parts were squeamish, the emotional depth and relatable struggles kept me invested throughout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This second-chance romance captivated me, compelling me to turn the pages in search of a hopeful ending. The narrative unfolds with precision, gradually revealing each detail and building toward a satisfying conclusion.",

As the narrative unfolds, it becomes clear that her struggles—evident in the chaos around her and her uninspired meals—are manifestations of a wounded heart. The book effectively reveals Libby’s past, shedding light on the events that led to her decline and hinting at her path to rediscovery and happiness. \n\nLibby’s sister, Nicky, plays a crucial role as they co-manage a center that prepares parents for their baby's arrival. Their shared healthcare background—Libby as a midwife and Nicky as a GP—adds depth to their mission. The story also explores their commitment to troubled teens, shaped by their parents' history of fostering children. While Libby’s ex-husband and absentee mother are less sympathetic figures, even these flawed characters are given a measure of redemption, contributing to the overall uplifting tone of the narrative.",

Libby’s evolving friendship with Toby is especially touching; he intuitively understands her needs and supports her selflessly. Additionally, her heartwarming relationship with her father is evident, as his influence helps her grow stronger and gain control over her life."

            "Libby, the protagonist, runs a commendable charity for young mothers, but her personal life is in turmoil. Her home is chaotic, and her children are struggling to adjust to their father's new life. In contrast, Toby, a young man caring for his baby daughter, is portrayed as thoughtful, organized, and proactive, making him a standout positive character. Meanwhile, Libby’s mother, who abandoned the family years ago to seek herself, returns with an unrealistic expectation of a warm welcome, rendering her unlikable and unsympathetic.",
            "The novel delves into themes of broken families and the financial and emotional challenges faced by single mothers. However, it disappointingly depicts women as passive and accepting of their exes' harmful behavior, which feels disempowering. The absence of uplifting or heartwarming moments contributes to a sense of tension, leading to relief when the story finally concludes."

The portrayal of women as passive and accepting of their exes' poor behavior was particularly disappointing, especially compared to the author’s earlier works.",
