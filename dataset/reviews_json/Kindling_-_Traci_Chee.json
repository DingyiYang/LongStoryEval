            "This book employs a rare second-person perspective in YA fantasy, adding a unique and poignant layer to the storytelling. This approach effectively captures the voices of deceased kindlings, evoking a sense of longing and melancholy. The prose is accessible and straightforward, with a brisk pacing that enhances the narrative flow.",
            "This book offers a compelling character study of each kindling, showcasing distinct personalities and clear arcs by the end. Leum emerges as the central figure—a jaded yet caring individual who clings to the kindling code. Emara is memorable for her easy-going demeanor and playful teasing, which are tempered by a serious side and haunting nightmares. Kanver's struggles with alcoholism and war trauma are pivotal to their character, with their friendship with Leum serving as a vital anchor. Amity is a powerful, maternal figure and a hardened veteran who occasionally clashes with Leum, despite their mutual respect. Siddie's naivete and exposure to violence make her a deeply sympathetic character as she breaks free from her shell. Ket's journey is largely defined by her relationship with Tana, prompting her to reevaluate her wandering nature. Ben is a complex character—a skilled killer whose trauma and defiance of the code add depth, though further exploration of her character would have been beneficial. The romance between Ket and Tana is passionate and beautifully executed, standing out as one of the best in YA fantasy. Contrary to another reader's expectations, only Ket is confirmed to be lesbian/sapphic, with no other kindlings expressing romantic or sexual interest. Emara's potential sapphic nature is hinted at but remains unconfirmed, while Leum appears to be asexual.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**\n   - The book is written in the second person, a rarity in YA fantasy, which adds a unique and poignant layer to the storytelling.\n   - The second-person perspective is used effectively to convey the voices of deceased kindlings, creating a sense of forlornness and longing.\n   - The prose is accessible and not overly ornate, with a pacing that is quick and aids the narrative style.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The book serves as a character study of each kindling, with distinct personalities and clear arcs by the end.\n   - Leum stands out as the main character, a jaded yet caring individual who clings to the kindling code.\n   - Emara is notable for her easy-going personality and playful teasing, balanced by a serious side and disturbing nightmares.\n   - Kanver’s alcoholism and trauma from the war are central to their character, with their friendship with Leum providing a crucial anchor.\n   - Amity is a powerful and maternal figure, a hardened veteran who occasionally clashes with Leum despite their mutual respect.\n   - Siddie’s naivete and exposure to violence break her shell, making her a deeply sympathetic character.\n   - Ket’s arc is primarily defined by her relationship with Tana, leading her to reconsider her wandering nature.\n   - Ben is a complex character, a skilled killer whose trauma and breaking of the code add depth, though more exploration of her character would have been beneficial.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The lesbian romance between Ket and Tana is passionate, beautiful, and well-executed, standing out as one of the best in YA fantasy.\n   - Contrary to expectations set by another reviewer, only Ket is confirmed to be lesbian/sapphic, with no other kindlings showing romantic or sexual interest in others.\n   - Emara’s potential sapphic nature is hinted at but not confirmed, and Leum appears asexual.\n\n- **Themes:**\n   - The main theme is the haunting of war and its lasting scars on both soldiers and civilians.\n   - The book explores the trauma of war, the perpetuation of violence, and the preciousness of what remains unbroken.\n   - The ending is bittersweet, emphasizing the cost of war and the realization of what is truly precious.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**\n   - The world is richly detailed, with a focus on the kindling code and the aftermath of war.\n   - The village of Camas and the threat posed by Adren provide a compelling backdrop for the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Kindling* is a deeply moving and unique YA fantasy that excels in character development, narrative style, and thematic depth. Traci Chee’s use of the second-person perspective adds a poignant layer to the story, while the exploration of war’s trauma and the bonds between the kindlings is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking. The bittersweet ending leaves a lasting impact, making this a memorable and emotionally resonant read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Narrative Style: 9/10\n- Character Development: 9/10\n- Romance: 8/10\n- Themes: 10/10\n- World-Building: 8/10\n- Overall: 9/10"

            "I was initially wary of the large multi-POV cast and the use of second-person perspective, but the author skillfully navigated these elements.

I truly felt their pain, which deepened my connection to the story.",

Such themes are rarely addressed in the YA genre, which makes this story particularly distinctive.

            "The novel captivated me with its unique narrative style. Much like *The Book Thief*, where Death takes on an unconventional role as the narrator, this story features a distinct narrator who remains absent from the plot. Through this narrator's perspective, we gain insight into the main characters—their pasts, the horrors of their present, and the inevitability of their fates. The narrative begins with the shadow of their impending demise, emphasizing that their futures have been stolen from them.",
            "While the novel shines in many aspects, some characters, particularly in the first half, lack distinctiveness. Without the chapter headings identifying them, distinguishing between characters would have been challenging, leading to a minor drawback as they occasionally blend together.",
            "The novel delves into profound themes, including the loss of childhood, the absence of family, and the stunted growth of individuals born into war. It focuses on child soldiers, taken from their families at five and trained for battle. Although they possess special powers, using them exacts a steep toll: years of their lives. Consequently, these children often burn out before reaching their twenties. The narrative captures their struggle to navigate a peaceful world they don't understand, as they confront PTSD, nightmares, alcoholism, and an inability to forge emotional connections beyond physical intimacy.",
            "The author skillfully depicts death with precise and evocative language that resonates deeply with readers. The emotional impact of the story is profound, especially in the final hundred pages, which brought me to tears. While the novel's heavy themes may not be suitable for everyone—particularly those sensitive to depictions of war—it offers a powerful exploration of found family, the transformation of enemies into allies, friendship, sacrifice, and the effort to shield a child from the traumas of former soldiering. This makes the book a compelling and worthwhile experience."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narrative Style and Perspective:**  \n   - The novel captivated me primarily with its unique narrative style. Similar to *The Book Thief*, where Death serves as the narrator in an unconventional and unexpected role, the narrator here is also a distinct character, though absent from the story itself. Through the narrator's absent perspective and words, we learn about the main characters—their past, the horrors of their present, and the inevitable end of their lives. The story begins with the looming conclusion of their lives, as their future has been stolen from them.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - The novel explores profound themes such as the loss of childhood, the absence of family, and the inability to grow old due to being born in a time of war. The characters are child soldiers, taken from their families at the age of five and trained in the art of war. They possess \"special powers,\" but using them comes at a high cost—years of their lives. These children burn out quickly, never living past their second decade. The story delves into their struggle to find a place in a peaceful world they do not know, grappling with PTSD, nightmares, alcoholism, and the inability to emotionally connect beyond physical intimacy.  \n\n- **Character Development and Distinction:**  \n   - While the novel excels in many areas, some characters lacked distinctiveness, especially in the first half. Without the chapter headings naming the characters, it would have been difficult to tell them apart. This was a minor drawback, as the characters occasionally blended together.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics:**  \n   - The author, Tracy Chee, deserves praise for breaking away from the paradigm that war is often associated with the male gender. However, the strong female presence sometimes felt excessive. Additionally, the inclusion of sex scenes felt unnecessary or poorly executed. In non-erotic plots, such scenes should either be written authentically or omitted entirely.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Writing Quality:**  \n   - The author masterfully portrays death, using precise and evocative language that deeply resonates with the reader. The emotional weight of the story is immense, and the final hundred pages brought me to tears. The novel is heavy and not suitable for those who cannot handle themes of war. However, the exploration of found family, enemies becoming allies for a common cause, friendship, sacrifice, and the act of protecting another child from the horrors of being a former soldier makes the book worth reading and experiencing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Кинглинг* is a powerful and emotionally charged novel that explores the devastating impact of war on child soldiers. While it has some minor flaws in character distinction and the handling of certain scenes, its unique narrative style, profound themes, and emotional depth make it a compelling read. The novel’s exploration of found family, sacrifice, and the struggle to find meaning in a stolen future is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "Initially, the second-person narrative was confusing, making it difficult to track which character's perspective I was following. However, as the story unfolded, each character's voice became distinct, and the narrative choice ultimately made sense. The revelation that the narrator is a deceased kindling observing and recounting the characters' stories added depth and clarity. While the pacing started off slow, it picked up significantly toward the end, becoming so intense that I was fully engrossed. Despite its heavy themes, the book skillfully balanced emotional weight with compelling storytelling, making it hard to put down.",
            "Emara's story, with its focus on her cultural heritage and her quest to reconnect with her family, resonated deeply with me, evoking the Palestinian diaspora. The evolving dynamic between Emara and Leon—particularly Leon's initial hatred followed by his recognition of their shared humanity—underscored the futility and tragedy of war. Additionally, depicting child soldiers as victims of circumstance rather than willing participants added depth to their characters and intensified the impact of their trauma.",
            "The absence of a map made it challenging to visualize the final battle, yet the vivid realism of the scene—violent, bloody, and heartbreaking—rendered it authentic. Phrases like \"Starvation may not be violent, but it still results in death\" and \"The invention of the handcannon changed everything\" contribute to the book's gritty, realistic tone.",

The parallels between the fictional nations of Vedra and Amerand and real-world conflicts, particularly Palestine and Israel, are striking and often overwhelming. Certain scenes, such as a character’s haunting recollection of killing civilians and facing a dying sister, resonate deeply and evoke poignant connections to current events in Gaza."

            "In *Kindling*, the standout feature is its use of the second-person perspective, which creates a deeply personal connection to each character's thoughts and actions. This narrative style immerses the reader in the characters' internal monologues, making it feel as though their reflections are our own. For instance, lines like, “Now you wear your sword across your back, for you no longer need it at your side. A less sentimental person would’ve sold it already, but you were always a sap, weren’t you?” invite readers to step directly into the character's shoes. \n\nInspired by *Seven Samurai* and its American remake, *The Magnificent Seven*, the plot revolves around a desperate small town seeking trained fighters to fend off destructive bandits. The author pays homage to these films while skillfully reimagining the characters, allowing the story to explore the harrowing experiences of traumatized children thrust into war.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and empathized with their individual struggles. Each character experiences the war differently and navigates the challenges of rebuilding their lives afterward. The author allows room for mistakes and personal growth within the group, resulting in meaningful relationships. The detailed portrayals of the seven main characters—Amity, Leum, Ket, Ben, Emara, Kanver, and Siddie—highlight their unique traits and struggles, making their journeys all the more compelling.",
            "Having read two vastly different books by the same author, I can confidently say I am now a devoted fan. \n\n*A Thousand Steps into Night* is a vibrant and adventurous tale, full of fun and excitement. In contrast, the author’s latest work, *Kindling*, takes a different tone yet remains equally captivating.",
            "*Kindling* is a young adult fantasy that delves into heavy and intense themes. Although the kindlings are aged 14 to 19, their experiences in war have forced them to mature beyond their years, training them to kill, lead battalions, and fight for survival. The narrative is steeped in sorrow and tragedy, exploring the aftermath of war as the kindlings grapple with abandonment and loss. This book is not an easy read; its slow and somber pace immerses us in the harsh realities of violence and grief. While the story evokes more pain than joy, I found each gut-wrenching moment to be uniquely powerful and deeply moving.",
            "*Kindling* is a remarkable addition to young adult fantasy, offering depth and nuance that sets it apart. The author skillfully examines the theft of youth, prompting readers to grapple with the complex emotions and consequences of a world that neglects its children. This powerful narrative will ignite your soul and linger long after the final page. Embrace the intensity—pick up this book now."

        "conclusion": "*Kindling* is a profoundly emotional and unique young adult fantasy that explores heavy themes of trauma, loss, and resilience through the lens of seven young warriors. The author’s masterful use of second-person narrative and deeply personal character development creates an unforgettable reading experience. Despite its somber tone, the story’s power and depth make it a must-read.",

But Chee’s newest book, *Kindling*, contains none of that and is still somehow amazing.\n\n- **Plot and Inspiration:**\n   - The story is inspired by the film *Seven Samurai* and its American remake, *The Magnificent Seven*.\n   - The plot is similar in that a desperate, small town seeks the aid of trained fighters to help them defeat bandits bent on destroying them.\n   - Chee honored the films that inspired her and altered her characters beautifully to allow the kindlings to take on the same battle but from a new perspective of traumatized children forced into war.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Perspective:**\n   - The first thing that will stand out in *Kindling* is that it’s written in the second person.\n   - This was a perfect style choice because it made each character’s thoughts and actions deeply personal.\n   - This perspective grounded me in each POV, and it felt like I became the character and their internal monologue was my own self-talk.\n   - Passages like, “Now you wear your sword across your back, for you no longer need it at your side. A less sentimental person would’ve sold it already, but you were always a sap, weren’t you?” made me feel like I was addressing myself, and I easily slipped into the character’s shoes.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - I adored all of the characters and shared in their individual pain and trials.\n   - Each one has a different experience in the war and how they’re picking up the pieces now that it’s over.\n   - Chee gives everyone space to make mistakes and grow in this group, and the relationships that develop between each person are special.\n   - Detailed descriptions of the seven main characters: Amity, Leum, Ket, Ben, Emara, Kanver, and Siddie, each with unique traits and struggles.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**\n   - *Kindling* is a young adult fantasy, but the themes are heavy and intense.\n   - The kindlings’ ages range from 14-19, but they don’t act their age because they were forced into war and trained to kill, lead battalions, and win a war.\n   - The story is full of sorrow and tragedy, detailing how the kindlings were abandoned after the war and left to cope.\n   - It’s truly heartbreaking and not an easy book to pick up and breeze through; it’s slow and somber, grounding us in the aftermath of intense violence and loss.\n   - The story generates more pain than smiles, but I loved each gut-wrenching moment because it’s truly unique and powerful in its own way.\n\n- **Overall Impact and Recommendation:**\n   - *Kindling* is a standout story that gives depth and nuance to young adult fantasy.\n   - Traci Chee stole youth from the young and made us confront the complex emotions and fallout of a world failing its children.\n   - This book will torch your soul and stay with you forever, but don’t be afraid of the heat—go buy this book now.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Kindling* is a profoundly emotional and unique young adult fantasy that explores heavy themes of trauma, loss, and resilience through the lens of seven young warriors. Traci Chee’s masterful use of second-person narrative and deeply personal character development creates an unforgettable reading experience. Despite its somber tone, the story’s power and depth make it a must-read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- *Kindling*: 8.5/10"

The overuse of em-dashes in the first 40% was challenging to adjust to, but it ultimately paid off. I appreciated how the prose evolved to reflect character development, though there was too much telling rather than showing, particularly concerning trauma. The tropes were well-integrated, and I enjoyed specific elements like kind-hearted characters with trauma, grumpy protagonists, and childhood friends reuniting.",

Juggling seven POV characters all told in second person became confusing quickly, making it difficult to establish a strong connection with each character. The constant switching disrupted the story’s flow and hindered my ability to fully immerse myself in the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Representation:**  \n  The book features a diverse cast, with nearly all important characters being women or nonbinary. There are strong sapphic vibes throughout, which added an interesting dynamic to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style (Use of Dashes):**  \n  The author’s excessive use of dashes was a stylistic issue for me. While dashes can be effective for emphasis or interjections, their overuse made sentences feel disjointed and disrupted the reading experience.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Themes:**  \n  The author successfully crafts an immersive atmosphere that draws readers in and keeps them engaged. The story, while nominally fantasy, primarily revolves around the theme of trauma. I appreciated the depth and exploration of this topic, as it added a layer of relatability and emotional resonance to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The plot reveals were somewhat predictable, but the story’s emotional depth and exploration of trauma made it worth reading.

The plot is a slow, emotional journey that pays homage to films, historical fiction, and anime, drawing inspiration from *The Seven Samurai* and echoing elements of Kenshin Himura and Hitokiro Battōsai.",

Their inability to adapt to a world that no longer needs them highlights their tragic circumstances and adds emotional depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel effectively critiques the societal treatment of soldiers, particularly those who are discarded after their usefulness has expired. It underscores the moral and emotional consequences of using children as tools of war and the lingering impact on both the individuals and society.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a compelling exploration of identity, purpose, and societal responsibility, framed within a reimagined \"Seven Samurai\" narrative. It thoughtfully addresses the fate of soldiers—especially child soldiers—after a war, blending action with poignant social commentary.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While it wasn’t terrible, it was a significant adjustment.  \n\n- **Character Descriptions:**  \n  The lack of detailed descriptions made it difficult to visualize the main characters. Their appearances were unclear, which made them feel less distinct.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, particularly Ket, felt underdeveloped. However, their handling of the aftermath of the war was portrayed decently.  \n\n- **Plot and Tone:**  \n  The plot was good, offering a chill fantasy vibe. It avoided the heavy political themes often found in other fantasy war books, which was a refreshing change.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building felt inconsistent. Terms like “jacket,” “gun,” and “bullet” seemed out of place, especially when compared to earlier references like “hand cannons.” This inconsistency disrupted the immersion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is decent for readers looking to explore semi-niche historical fantasy war books. While the second-person perspective and inconsistent world-building were drawbacks, the plot and tone provided an enjoyable, lighter fantasy experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/10 stars"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narrative Style (2nd Person POV):**  \n   - The 2nd person narration is a bold choice that permeates the entire book, and it will either make or break the reading experience for many.  \n   - While it effectively conveys emotion and focuses on the aftermath of war and trauma rather than the events themselves, it limits the story’s potential compared to a 1st or 3rd person POV.  \n   - The lack of distinctive markers between character POVs made transitions confusing, and the narration often felt like someone was simply telling me a story rather than immersing me in it.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Most characters were not particularly interesting, with the exception of one standout character who, unfortunately, was not the main focus.  \n   - The romances in the story felt very plain and lacked depth.  \n\n- **Premise and Themes:**  \n   - The premise of the book is strong, focusing on child soldiers and their journey to right the mistakes of the past.  \n   - The author’s love for *Seven Samurai* and *The Magnificent Seven* is evident, and the book feels like a love letter to these inspirations.  \n\n- **Author’s Signature Style:**  \n   - Traci Chee’s books are known for their boldness and uniqueness, and this one is no exception.  \n   - Her willingness to take unconventional narrative risks, such as multi-timeline storytelling or 14 POVs in previous works, is commendable, even if the execution doesn’t always hit the mark.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Storytelling:**  \n   - The book starts at the end of the story, which is a unique choice for a narrative about child soldiers.  \n   - While the emotional weight of the characters’ experiences is conveyed effectively, the storytelling often feels detached due to the 2nd person POV.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a bold and unique addition to Traci Chee’s body of work, with a strong premise and clear thematic inspirations. However, the 2nd person narration limits its potential, making the storytelling feel less immersive and the characters less engaging. While the emotional core of the story shines through, the execution falls short in some areas, particularly in character development and narrative transitions. Despite its flaws, it’s a testament to Chee’s willingness to take risks and her love for the stories that inspire her.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

            "The story employs a second-person point of view, addressing the reader as \"you\" and positioning them as the character. While this approach is unique, it results in a passive tone and emotional detachment, diminishing the impact of pivotal moments and hindering immersion in the narrative.",
            "The story features seven distinct characters, each with unique personalities shaped by their shared traumatic pasts. The author skillfully ensures that readers can easily follow the narrative despite the large cast. Notably, the majority of the characters are female or nonbinary, with only a few male characters, which feels somewhat unusual and lacks explanation.",
            "The world-building is compelling, vividly portraying the harsh realities of magic and war. However, the absence of an explanation for the predominantly female and nonbinary cast feels odd and undermines the story's plausibility, slightly detracting from the overall immersion.",
            "The story delves into the darker aspects of magic, presenting it as a deadly and costly force that shortens the wielder's lifespan with each use. It addresses the tragic impact of war, especially on child soldiers who endure deep physical and emotional scars, often failing to reach adulthood. Central themes include kinship, the repercussions of choices, and the quest for freedom after trauma."

        "conclusion": "*Kindling* is a beautifully tragic story that explores the devastating consequences of war and magic through the eyes of child soldiers. While the character development and themes are strong, the second-person narrative style creates an emotional disconnect, and the unexplained gender imbalance in the cast feels unusual. Despite these drawbacks, the novel remains a poignant and thought-provoking read.",

The second-person POV was an excellent choice, as it forced the reader to truly absorb and consider the extent of the losses these characters endured.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book edged me emotionally, which, for me, is harder to achieve than making me cry outright. This emotional depth made me respect the book ten times more.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I loved every single choice made in this story and believe it’s best to go into it blind. If you love fantasy and character-driven novels, please read this.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Kindling* is an incredible novel that masterfully explores themes of loss, war, grief, and healing through rich worldbuilding, a character-driven plot, and a unique second-person POV. It’s a must-read for fantasy lovers, and I cannot recommend it enough.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific numerical rating was mentioned in the review, but the reader’s enthusiasm and emotional connection suggest a very high rating.)"

            "The author portrays the trauma and PTSD experienced by child soldiers with striking realism. Each of the seven POV characters is distinct, featuring their own unique arcs and personalities. The author particularly excels in developing compelling character arcs, especially for Ben and Ket, which are executed beautifully.",
            "The prose strikes a delicate balance between beauty and brutality, evoking a sense of poetry reminiscent of a Greek epic like the *Odyssey*. The use of second-person perspective, while potentially off-putting to some, adds an intimate and intense layer to the narrative. Despite featuring seven POV characters, the author skillfully navigates the structure, providing clarity and depth for each character without causing confusion.",

At its core, the story highlights the power of found family, revealing the resilience and strength of teenagers who have been battling since the age of five.",

            "My primary concern is that this story, while substantial, feels underdeveloped and would benefit from a longer format to fully realize its potential.",
            "The story features a cast of seven main characters with alternating perspectives, but I found myself less invested in many of them than I expected. Amity’s tragic arc failed to resonate deeply, while Ben’s journey to prove herself felt repetitive and predictable. Emara’s character didn’t connect with me, although Siddie’s reaction to her death did evoke some sadness. Ket felt underdeveloped; her traits—such as a love for travel, commitment issues, and a promiscuous lifestyle—didn’t elicit sympathy when she chose to stay at the end.

I experienced it as an audiobook, which added to the novelty with several different narrators. It was fantastic and so cool!  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There were so many characters to keep track of, but by the middle of the book, I was in love with all of them (except one, but I think we can all agree on who that might be and why). Each character was deeply affected by war, and their personalities and perspectives were explained so well that I felt immense empathy for them. The characters were tragically written and so humanly flawed that they made me gasp and tear up at certain moments.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  There wasn’t much world-building, but the focus was more on character development and the theme of found family, which I really appreciated.  \n\n- **Romantic/Sexual Content:**  \n  There were two sex scenes written in the 2nd person POV, which felt a little odd to me, but overall, they were very mild and didn’t detract from the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book is long and has a lot of characters, so it requires some dedication to get through.

However, Traci Chee is a master storyteller, and she made this unique perspective work beautifully.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book had me feeling deeply for the characters. By the end, I was bawling on the couch, my heart gutted by what those kids had to go through. It got so intense that my family asked if I was okay. The story ripped my heart out, but it was so good.  \n\n- **Themes and Realism (PTSD in Soldiers):**  \n  I have never read a YA novel that so clearly demonstrates and shows the heartbreaking reality of PTSD in soldiers during a time of peace after a long war. It broke my heart in the most profound way.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  As she has done before, Chee masterfully fully develops the seven characters, making them feel real and deeply relatable.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I would've maybe loved some more world-building, but in such a character-driven narrative, it didn't seem to matter as much as it might in other novels.  \n\n- **Author's Skill and Future Works:**  \n  Once again, Traci Chee has knocked it out of the park.

Without a foundation laid for me as a casual fantasy reader, I struggled to understand what I should be prepared for. I often felt like I was catching up to what was happening and why. However, I deeply felt the emotional turmoil and trauma the characters brought to the table, especially during their one last epic battle. Chee is undoubtedly a character-driven storyteller, and this is on full display in the novel.\n\n- **World-Building and Accessibility:**  \n  As a casual fantasy reader, I found the lack of initial world-building challenging. I needed more context to fully immerse myself in the story and understand the stakes. The book felt like it required me to catch up rather than guiding me smoothly into its world.\n\n- **Target Audience and Appeal:**  \n  While I might not have connected with the story as much as I hoped, I recognize that there is a specific group of readers who will be swept away by the warrior/samurai fighters' swan song.

As a result, I was unable to finish the novel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

This was particularly problematic since the plot heavily relied on the characters and their backstories.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  While there was angst conveyed throughout the story, the writing style lessened its impact. It didn’t feel as heartbreaking or impactful as it could have been.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding was lacking, which was disappointing given the potential of the magic system and the intriguing concept of child soldiers. The ideas were there, but they weren’t fully realized.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite these issues, I still loved the story and found it interesting. I enjoyed my readthrough and would recommend it, especially to fans of Asian fantasy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had strong ideas and potential, particularly in its themes and setting, but the execution fell short in areas like character connection, emotional depth, and worldbuilding. However, it remains a worthwhile read, especially for those who enjoy Asian-inspired fantasy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars"

Each character is distinct and well-rounded, with unique voices and personalities that stand out.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author and Expectations:**  \n   - I hadn’t read anything by Traci Chee before picking up this book, so I had no idea what to expect. I’ve heard good things about her other books, so she’s been an author I’ve wanted to read for a while.  \n\n- **Opening and Hook:**  \n   - The very first pages absolutely hooked me. Right away, I knew I was reading about a character who’d survived a war and was traveling, trying to get to a particular, important place.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - As the setting and history of the world became clear, I couldn’t help needing to know more about these young warriors who’d been forced to use magic in a war they didn’t choose and then cast aside and forgotten after the war ended.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and POVs:**  \n   - The story follows seven points of view, which is pretty ambitious. That’s a lot of POVs to keep track of as a reader, and I’m sure it was a lot of details and backstories to keep straight as a writer– I’m in awe of Chee’s ability to do that.  \n\n- **Writing Style (Second Person):**  \n   - The book is also written in second person, using “you” pronouns. For the most part, I loved that. It made me feel like I was right there in the middle of the book. Like the narrator was talking directly to me, relating what was happening as it went down.  \n   - I think because the last quarter or so of the book is essentially an extended action sequence, this helped keep that from being exhausting or feeling like it dragged at all.  \n\n- **Character Development and Clarity:**  \n   - The only downside, to me, is that I had a really hard time keeping track of some of the characters. I didn’t feel like I got a lot of visual details about any of them, because it’s like, as the reader, you’re looking out through your eyes into the story, if that makes sense.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n   - I love that the author shared this reimagining of *The Seven Samurai*– and I especially love that she chose to recreate the story without male main characters. It’s so rare to see a cast like this, and I enjoyed that a lot.  \n\n- **Risk-Taking and Overall Impact:**  \n   - I think Chee took a lot of risks in the way she chose to tell this story, and for me, they really paid off. I think readers who enjoy fantasy inspired by Japanese history or folklore will enjoy this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a captivating and ambitious read, with strong world-building, a unique narrative style, and a refreshing take on a classic story. While keeping track of the characters was a bit challenging, the risks the author took in storytelling paid off, making it a memorable and enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)  \n\n**Note:**  \nI received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

While the second-person POV might feel unusual at first, it quickly becomes immersive. The romance is subtle, and the worldbuilding could have been expanded, but overall, it’s a remarkable read that left a lasting impression.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  - If you LOVE queer fantasy, like I do, this book is for you!  \n  - Reading this book was mind-blowing.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  - I don't think I've ever read anything in a second-person POV (y/n fanfics don't count).  \n  - While a bit weird at the beginning, you quickly get used to it.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - There are seven different characters, and while the book is only 400 pages long, everyone has a clear and distinctive personality.  \n  - I didn't get bored, and I genuinely liked all of them equally, which is pretty incredible since I often tend to like only 2/3 characters in a book with multiple POVs.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  - For being a YA novel, the themes are pretty deep.  \n  - Even though the characters are all in their teens, heavy themes like war and violence are discussed.  \n  - I really liked how the author depicted PTSD for the characters, keeping it, in my opinion, very realistic.  \n  - It's not common in fantasy books to see what happens after the conflicts and battles, so for once, actually reading about it felt nice, even though I probably cried my eyes out while reading.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - Most of the romance is not explicitly written but more off-screen or told from other POVs.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  - The only thing I would have loved to see more of is the worldbuilding, which, in my opinion, deserved some more pages, if not a whole chapter.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a deeply engaging and emotionally impactful queer fantasy novel with well-developed characters and realistic depictions of heavy themes like war, violence, and PTSD. While the second-person POV might feel unusual at first, it quickly becomes immersive. The romance is subtle, and the worldbuilding could have been expanded, but overall, it’s a remarkable read that left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The characters lacked depth and memorability. Each chapter was narrated in the first person from a different character's perspective, making it difficult to distinguish between them. They seemed to be drawn from a checklist of archetypes—such as the tough loner, the commitment-phobe, and the lovestruck individual—which I found both frustrating and distracting.",

The lack of memorable characters, combined with the disjointed narrative structure, made it difficult to stay engaged.

Each chapter was written in first person from a different character's perspective, which made it hard to keep track of who was who.
