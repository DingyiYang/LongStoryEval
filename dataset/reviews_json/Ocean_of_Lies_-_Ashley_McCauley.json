            "The book started off a bit choppy, but soon the story flowed smoothly, drawing me into the suspense and drama.

I was very much correct.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book is a slow-burn romance, as the author describes, and it is absolutely adorable.  \n\n- **Author’s Debut Performance:**  \n  This is a very good first book for an author, showcasing her potential.  \n\n- **Pacing and Flow:**  \n  The book feels a bit choppy at times, with some subjects briefly touched on but never fully explained or revisited. For example, a character who (I don’t believe) had anything to do with the crime on Lupris Island mentions her real name in the restaurant. I’m unsure if this was intentional or not.  \n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**  \n  Callie’s trauma and her differing behaviors could have been explored more deeply. If these aspects were discussed further, the story would have felt clearer and flowed better.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation for Future Work:**  \n  Despite these minor issues, I truly loved this book and can’t wait to see what else this author has in store.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis slow-burn romance is an adorable and promising debut, though it has some pacing and depth-related issues. Despite these, the book is highly enjoyable, and I look forward to the author’s future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
