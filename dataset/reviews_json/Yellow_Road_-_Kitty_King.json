            "The conclusion of the Color Series is satisfying, providing a delightful cherry on top with a well-earned happy ending for Mason and Briggs.",
            "Mason, the golden boy, grapples with feelings of inadequacy as he is constantly compared to Xavier. His journey to overcome these insecurities, bolstered by the support of Briggs and the love he receives, is profoundly moving. The story effectively illustrates that breaking free from a cycle of self-destruction often necessitates external encouragement. Caitlyn, however, is a poorly developed character with no redeeming qualities, save for her role in pushing Mason out of his negative mindset. I do not believe she deserves a redemption arc and rate her character 1 star.",

            "Mason is my favorite character. He's a bit lost, often speaks before he thinks, and sometimes makes questionable choices that leave you wondering, \"Why?\" Yet, he's also a total sweetheart searching for love and acceptance, all while being compared to his cousin, Xavier. I just wanted to jump into the book and give him all the hugs he needed. On the other hand, I absolutely detest Caitlyn—I've never hated a character as much as her. If I could, I'd give her negative five stars. If the author attempts to redeem her, I will be furious—please don’t! \n\nInitially, I was unsure about Briggs. I knew he would end up with Mason, but I found him somewhat unlikable. However, once the truth about his involvement with Caitlyn was revealed, my perspective changed, and I thought, \"Aww, you’re actually sweet.\"",

I love the men she writes and the dirty things they say.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Mason, the MMC in this book, broke my heart. I loved him and his story. Despite this book being a novella and only 10 chapters long, the characters develop, and I fell in love with them—well, all of them but one.  \n\n- **Romantic and Emotional Depth:**  \n  This book was spicy and hot. 🥵 It has moments of vulnerability and clarity. I can’t find a single thing bad to say, other than it was over too soon.  \n\n- **Connection to Other Works (Series):**  \n  I adored that I got to hear a little from another favorite character of mine in the Color Series. He came through for me when it mattered most, like he always does.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you have not started the Color series by Kitty King, I’m not sure what you’re waiting for exactly…do you need permission? You have it—go snag one or all of them, and you will not regret it. Start with *Red Night*, make sure to get the one with Xavier’s POV, then come back and thank me. 😉  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novella is a testament to Kitty King’s ability to craft compelling characters and emotionally charged stories, even in a shorter format. It’s spicy, heartfelt, and leaves you wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores mentioned, but the review is overwhelmingly positive."
