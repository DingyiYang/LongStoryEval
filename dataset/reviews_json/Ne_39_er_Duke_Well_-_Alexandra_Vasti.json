            "In this story, Peter enlists Selina's help to gain custody of his two younger siblings, who are illegitimate and unacknowledged by their father. Selina advises Peter to find a respectable wife to create a stable home for the children, knowing that the judge favors love matches. The conflict intensifies as Selina desires to be Peter's perfect match, but her scandalous lending library tarnishes her reputation in Society. One of my favorite elements is the courtroom drama finale, which adds both excitement and resolution to the plot.",
            "In this compelling story, Peter stands out as a radical hero who delivers a poignant speech in Parliament, urging for greater progress in the abolition movement. He ranks among the finest romance heroes I've encountered in recent memory. Selina, the heroine, presents herself as a Society Darling but is, in fact, a passionate Feminist Sex Educator. She is a remarkable addition to the pantheon of historical romance heroines who leverage their influence to advance feminist causes.",

Raised in America, he inherits the dukedom after the death of his older siblings and returns to England to claim his place in society and government, where he fights against slavery laws.  \n   - The blossoming romance between Selina and Peter, combined with their respective causes, makes the book special and engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Selina is portrayed as a strong, independent, and progressive character who challenges societal norms by educating women on taboo topics.  \n   - Peter is depicted as a principled and compassionate man, dedicated to fighting for justice and equality.  \n   - The author‚Äôs dedication to both characters‚Äô causes adds depth and authenticity to their development.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n   - Despite being Alexandra Vasti‚Äôs debut novel, the writing feels polished and mature, not at all like a first-time effort.  \n   - The historical details, such as the reference to contraception as the \"French Letter,\" are well-researched and add richness to the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I enjoyed the book immensely and found it to be a resounding success.  \n   - It‚Äôs a refreshing and engaging read that stands out in the HR genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a delightful and well-crafted historical romance that combines a compelling love story with meaningful themes of education, empowerment, and social justice.

It‚Äôs a must-read for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Great job üëèüèª  \n- 2024 Fun Reading Bingo[üî¥] [02] [03] [04] [05][06] [üî¥] [08] [üî¥] [üî¥][üî¥] [12] [üé∞] [14] [üî¥][üî¥] [üî¥] [üî¥] [üî¥] [üî¥][üî¥] [üî¥] [üî¥] [üî¥] [üî¥]"

            "Selena and Peter are compelling, well-rounded characters who hold their own in the narrative. Although I'm typically not a fan of the trope where one character plays matchmaker for another, it worked well here because it didn‚Äôt overshadow the plot and facilitated deeper introductions to other characters. However, keeping track of the numerous side characters and their roles proved challenging at times. The book has a strong introductory feel due to the many character introductions, but the ending, where all the characters converge, is satisfying and skillfully executed.",
            "The author‚Äôs writing is a standout aspect of this book. The narrative flows effortlessly, combining a fun, humorous, and romantic tone. While it features quirky moments reminiscent of Tessa Dare's style, the story maintains a sense of sophistication, ensuring the romance is both engaging and well-executed."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The author's traditional publishing debut is a delightful, well-written historical romance with a fun and romantic tone. The strong character development, engaging plot, and quirky moments make it a standout read. While the side characters were occasionally hard to follow, the book's potential is evident, and the ending tied everything together beautifully.",

The narrative flows well, and the tone is fun, funny, and romantic.  \n   - The lighter tone, with quirky moments, is reminiscent of Tessa Dare's style, but the story never feels silly, and the romance is well-executed.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n   - Initially, I wasn't a fan of the cover, but after reading the book, I felt the illustrated cover suited the story well, which is unusual for historical romances.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Selena and Peter are strong, well-developed characters who stand on their own.  \n   - The trope of one character setting up another with a partner usually doesn't appeal to me, but it worked here because it didn't dominate the plot and allowed for deeper introductions to other characters.  \n\n- **Use of Children in the Story:**  \n   - The portrayal of children in the story was chaotic but endearing, reflecting Vasti's personal experience with young kids.  \n\n- **Side Characters and Series Potential:**  \n   - I found it challenging to keep track of all the side characters and their roles at times.  \n   - The book has strong \"first in a series\" vibes, with many character introductions.

I had the chance to read her Halifax Helions novellas before they were published, and they were such a delight. (Warning: they are spicy!) When I learned Alexandra was going to be traditionally published, I was thrilled for her and immediately bought this book.  \n\n- **Reading Experience and Timing:**  \n  Like many books I buy, this one sat on my shelf for a while.

            "In \"Duke of Stanhope,\" Peter Kent has recently returned to England to claim his inheritance and title, only to discover he has two half-siblings he never knew about. His father failed to acknowledge them and left no provisions for their care. Determined to keep Lu and Freddie from being shuffled between neglectful relatives, Peter fights for their custody. Lady Selina Ravenscroft proposes a solution: if Peter marries, his case for custody would be stronger. However, marriage to Selina is complicated by her secret‚Äîshe operates a circulating library that distributes risqu√© literature exclusively for women. \n\nAlexandra Vasti skillfully plays with familiar tropes, transforming the single parent role into that of an older brother who deeply loves his siblings but struggles to connect with them. The American-born duke bumbles through English customs while showing respect for the title he now holds and understanding the political power it provides. Selina emerges as a refreshingly modern character‚Äîprioritizing her literary pursuits over traditional feminine duties. Energetic and sympathetic, she is a gossip, do-gooder, and problem-solver, making her a delightful figure in this Regency-era tale. Vasti‚Äôs writing brings Selina vividly to life, ensuring she is a character readers will remember fondly.",
            "I anticipated a spectacular full-length debut from Vasti, given the joy her novellas bring. This book captures a range of emotions‚Äîfrom laughter to tears‚Äîwith a delightful blend of fun, sweetness, sensitivity, and a touch of heat. Vasti consistently delivers the right level of passion. The curious yet nervous virgin heroine navigates her desires with both sensitivity and creativity, questioning the boundaries between fiction and reality in the bedroom. I appreciate well-matched couples, and Peter and Selina's evolving relationship is a testament to their supportive and loving bond.",
            "**Genre:** Historical Romance  \n**Setting:** England, 1815  \n\nThis captivating historical romance transports readers to England in 1815, immersing them in a world of passion and societal intrigue. The characters are well-developed, each navigating the complexities of love and duty against the backdrop of a richly detailed historical setting. The author skillfully weaves together themes of class, ambition, and the constraints of society, creating a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking. The romance unfolds with a perfect blend of tension and tenderness, making it a delightful read for fans of the genre. Overall, this story is a beautifully crafted exploration of love in a time of rigid social expectations."

Little did he know that this also included two half-siblings.  \n   - Peter‚Äôs father never formally recognized them and left no provision for them in his will. But Lu and Freddie are family, and Peter will stop at nothing to gain custody rather than seeing them passed amongst poor relations.  \n   - Lady Selina Ravenscroft has a brilliant idea: if Peter marries, he‚Äôll have a stronger case for custody. But he can‚Äôt marry her. Selina carries a secret that could bring down even the most respectable of dukes: she owns a circulating library that distributes explicit books catering exclusively to ladies.  \n   - Alexandra Vasti plays with familiar tropes, tweaking them slightly for her purposes. Single parent becomes older brother with siblings he doesn‚Äôt quite know how to handle but who he loves with all his heart.  \n   - The American-born duke charmingly bungles English manners but is respectful of the institution he now occupies, recognizing the power he can wield in parliament.  \n   - Selina is a forward woman who prefers many things over needlework, but those things include running a library of explicit literature.  \n   - Vasti writes an energetic and yet sympathetic heroine well situated within the Regency era. Selina is a gossip, a do-gooder, staunchly loyal, a problem solver, and a delight to read.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n   - I knew this would be a spectacular full-length debut from Vasti because her writing in her novellas is a joy to read.  \n   - Every moment‚Äîfrom laughter to tears‚Äîin this book is fun, sweet, sensitive, and caring. And more than a little bit horny.  \n   - I can count on Vasti to bring the right level of heat. With a curious but nervous virgin heroine, there‚Äôs both sensitivity to her needs and creativity as she questions what she‚Äôs read on pages and what‚Äôs physically possible in the bedroom.  \n   - I love seeing well-matched couples on page, and it's clear to me that Peter and Selina evolve together to have such a supportive and loving relationship.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments and Release Information:**  \n   - Thank you to @stmartinspress and @smpromance for an eARC for Review.  \n   - *Ne‚Äôer Duke Well* hits your shelves 7/23/24, and if you haven‚Äôt preordered it yet, what are you waiting for?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis historical romance is a delightful blend of humor, heart, and heat, with well-developed characters and a fresh take on familiar tropes. Vasti‚Äôs writing shines in this full-length debut, offering a story that is both entertaining and emotionally resonant.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Since then, I have been incredibly excited to get my hands on this book, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint!  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationship:**  \n  I loved Selina and Peter as a couple. Peter is so incredibly good at getting himself into scandalous situations, and Selina is very talented at getting him out of them. While this could be a burden for Selina, instead, she gets to enjoy the freedom of Peter's impulsivity and helps him manage the consequences. They both make each other better and happier. They also share a determination to help people regardless of the cost. I think shared values of that sort are truly what makes a relationship work long-term.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Relatability:**  \n  One thing that was beautifully well done about this book is that it is a historical romance that deals with the politics and rules of a completely different society, yet it is still relatable to modern readers. When Selina talks about the consequences that women face from living in a society with unequal rules for women and men, I thought about ways I have seen women hurt by the inequality of our society. I loved that Selina took this pain and did something with it to make her world better.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  On top of these qualities, *Ne're Duke Well* is sexy and incredibly funny. It is also beautifully written. Alexandra Vasti has a real gift for creating lovable characters and getting into their different headspaces to understand how they see the world and react to different situations.  \n\n- **Steamy Content:**  \n  üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è - *Ne're Duke Well* has several open-door steamy scenes, as well as a heroine who runs an erotic library. Things she has learned from the library are mentioned.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Ne're Duke Well* is a delightful historical romance that combines humor, relatability, and steamy scenes with a beautifully written narrative and lovable characters.

Georgiana's storyline stands out as a favorite.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis historical romance was a perfect read for me, blending humor, relatable characters, and a unique premise.

            "The pacing of the story is excellent, though it did slow a bit in the middle before quickly picking up again, ultimately leading me to finish it in just one day. I often wish I could read more slowly to savor the narrative. Peter's defiance of the status quo alienates him from government officials, complicating his efforts to secure a better life for his siblings. Enter Selina, who empathizes with Peter and devises a plan to marry him off to a respectable woman to boost his image. The twist? Peter is in love with Selina, and her hidden secrets render her a poor match. As she attempts to play matchmaker, comedic chaos ensues, making it increasingly clear that the only woman Peter truly desires is Selina.",
            "The main characters are endearing, and the supporting cast is diverse and well-developed. Peter, the Duke of Stanhope, and Selina, the sister of a duke, have long been acquaintances but have kept their distance since Peter arrived in England two years ago. He has been busy adjusting to his new role and seeking guardianship for his half-siblings. Selina is a rebel like Peter, though she operates in more subtle ways, making her impact felt from the shadows. Their chemistry is undeniable, and I was pleased that it didn't take the entire book for them to recognize their connection. As for his siblings, they are absolutely lovable‚Äîadorable in every way!",

The author's writing style is phenomenal; the prose flows effortlessly, and the humor is consistently present without being overdone. Reading this book is truly a delight.",

It's such a delight reading a book where things just flow so naturally and the humor is constant but not overdone.\n\n- **Historical Setting and Accuracy:**\n   - The historical setting felt accurate and fascinating.\n   - Part of why I love historical romance so much is that you get the love story and the history lesson all in one enjoyable package.\n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**\n   - I look forward to reading whatever she writes next, as well as diving into her backlist!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a delightful historical romcom with lovable characters, a well-paced plot, and a rich historical setting. The dual POV added depth to the story, and the humor was perfectly balanced.

            "The story captivates with its focus on family and love, offering a refreshing modern interpretation of Regency England.

Lu, Peter‚Äôs spirited 12-year-old half-sister, consistently steals the spotlight with her vibrant personality. Each character is richly nuanced and relatable, making them captivating.\n\nThe romance between Peter and Selina is beautifully developed, marked by strong chemistry and a natural progression. The matchmaking element adds depth to their relationship as both characters come to realize their desire for one another. The sexual tension is expertly crafted, resulting in swoon-worthy, emotional moments. Their love is expressed through actions as much as words, making their relationship feel genuine and heartfelt.",

            "In the first 30% of the book, the focus is on finding the perfect bride, which I found a bit frustrating as I was eager for Selina and Peter to spend more time together. This pacing may stem from my previous experience with the author's faster-paced novellas. The conflicts and angst arise primarily from external sources, which I appreciated; I prefer the 'us against the world' dynamic to 'us against each other.' It was heartwarming to see Selina and Peter grow closer as they faced their challenges together. The story follows Lady Selina and Peter, the Duke of Stanhope, who has recently inherited the dukedom, property, and two half-siblings after moving from New Orleans to England. Seeking Selina's advice on securing custody of his siblings, he is advised to find a respectable wife. However, Peter is only interested in Selina, despite her reluctance stemming from her secret life running an erotic library for women.",
            "The romance between Selina and Peter unfolds gradually but is immensely rewarding. Their relationship exudes sweetness, passion, and genuine emotion, grounded in love and care. Peter remains steadfast in his desire for Selina, supporting her as she navigates her emotional challenges. Additionally, the heartwarming connections Peter shares with his siblings, Lu and Freddie, and the bond Selina fosters with them further enrich the story.",

However, his status as a newcomer to the ton, his single status, and his strong abolitionist views render him an unlikely candidate in the eyes of the 1815 Parliament.

As a trailblazer in 1815, she has opened her own library, Belvoir, which features a secret section called Venus, where women can explore topics about their bodies and sexuality that were considered taboo for men to discuss. The side characters enhance the story with their charm, and the found family dynamic is beautifully depicted.

Five-star books are special to me; they offer something different in a genre that can tend to be formulaic.\n\n- **Comedy and Writing Style:**  \n  I was impressed by how much I enjoyed the comedy. Often, I find comedy in historical romance (HR) to be cringy, but the difference here is that the manner of writing itself was comedic, not just the exchanges between characters. The inner monologue of the main character (MC) was really organic and self-aware, which made the emotions translate well.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  It's one thing to create two MCs who are likable and easy to root for, but it's another feat altogether to create a world and multiple characters that are interesting in their own way. I particularly liked Georgiana; her empty-headed routine was perfection. Some might find this distracting and argue that the novel should concentrate more on the MCs, but I disagree. I appreciate a fully developed cast and setting.\n\n- **Romance and Intimacy:**  \n  I don't think the intimacy and romance suffered at all. There are a number of encounters between the MCs that we never see, which does leave me wanting a little, but it doesn't spoil anything for me.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The book has heart, comedy, a great cast, and sex. I laughed and I cried‚ÄîI couldn't have asked for more!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations with its unique blend of comedy, well-developed characters, and heartfelt romance.

We can only hope!  \n- **Reader Commitment:**  \n  I‚Äôve already preordered this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis full-length novel by Alexandra Vasti lived up to my high expectations, delivering lovable characters, emotional depth, and a well-executed plot. The author‚Äôs ability to handle tropes creatively and her potential for future stories with side characters have solidified her place as a must-read author for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story is filled with delightful hijinks, pining, and the charm of opposites attracting.

While Peter initially tries to court a \"suitable\" bride (not Selina, due to her scandalous library), it becomes clear that they are actually in love with each other.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Relationships:**  \n  The banter between the characters is excellent, and the supportive side characters add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  The novel strikes a great balance between internal and external conflict.

The emotional depth and pacing make it a standout read, and I‚Äôm eagerly looking forward to more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated that the author chose not to drag out Selina's secret identity as the owner of Belvoir, allowing her and Peter to collaborate on resolving the main conflict. This decision added a refreshing dynamic to their relationship. The story was filled with unexpected plot twists that kept the adventure engaging. I particularly enjoyed how the author cleverly played with familiar tropes, especially the classic scenario of only one bed being available in the sparsely furnished family home.",

The male lead, Peter, is the newly appointed Duke of Stanhope and an American whose past misadventures have brought scandal to his name, jeopardizing his custody of his younger half-siblings, Lu and Freddy. Selina's interactions with her family and best friend Lydia are delightful, and her realization that her social circle has become too small over the years adds depth to her character.

Selina tried so hard not to fall for Peter, but she just couldn‚Äôt help it. Peter had me swooning‚Äîhe was so gone for Selina and so determined to support her no matter what. I loved how they built a family together.\n\n- **Plot and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story revolves around Selina‚Äôs plan for Peter to wed a respectable bride to improve his chances in an upcoming custody hearing. There were moments that had me crying and others where I was laughing out loud. The emotional depth and humor were perfectly balanced.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  Peter is from Louisiana and has only recently moved to England to assume his title of Duke. The contrast between his background and the English aristocracy added an interesting layer to the story.\n\n- **Narration and Performance (Audiobook):**  \n  I adored the narration by Mhairi Morrison, especially her voice for Peter. Her performance added an extra layer of enjoyment to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute delight from start to finish. The characters were compelling, the plot was engaging, and the emotional moments were perfectly balanced with humor. The narration by Mhairi Morrison was exceptional, making this one of my favorite historical romances in a long time. I‚Äôm eagerly looking forward to more books from Alexandra Vasti.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Selina's motivation for starting her secret library was a strong aspect of her character development, though I found it puzzling that she chose to hide it from her loved ones. Peter's pride in Selina when she reveals her secret was heartwarming and highlighted his depth. Their romance was both lovely and steamy, filled with great chemistry and adorable moments. While I‚Äôm not a fan of the jealousy trope, it was handled well here, especially since Peter's affections were clearly focused solely on Selina. Their journey to becoming a couple was satisfying, particularly with Selina's heartfelt confession before the wedding. The side characters, including Peter‚Äôs siblings and Selina‚Äôs support system, added delightful depth to the story. Selina‚Äôs twin brother's storyline was particularly heartbreaking, and I hope he finds a happy ending. However, some side characters hinted at richer backstories that felt a bit unresolved.",

            "The story employs the matchmaking trope, which can be hit or miss for me. However, I appreciated how the author clarified early on that Peter wasn't genuinely invested in dating other women; he was merely going along with it for Selina's sake. This early revelation of Peter's feelings for Selina made the matchmaking element more tolerable.",

His commitment to ensuring a better life for them, shaped by his past regrets regarding his own brother, adds significant depth to his character. Unlike many child characters in historical romances, who can often be off-putting or distracting, the siblings in this narrative are seamlessly integrated into the plot, enhancing the overall story without becoming overwhelming.",

The author delivered exactly what I was looking for. The story was entertaining, with a lot happening, and it wrapped up quickly at the end.  \n\n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  The female main character (FMC), Selena, gave me Penelope x Eloise vibes, which I absolutely adored. She is independent, caring, and co-owns a library with her brother that includes an erotic catalog‚Äîa detail I found intriguing and fun.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was mostly good, though it felt a bit slow around the 75% mark. However, it picked up again after 85%, keeping me engaged until the end.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance between the two main characters was well-developed, and their feelings for each other were clearly portrayed. However, I would‚Äôve liked to see their first meeting included in the story.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The spice level was moderate, around 2.5 üå∂Ô∏è. There weren‚Äôt many explicit scenes, but the emotional connection between the characters was vividly depicted.  \n\n- **Potential for a Series:**  \n  I hope the author, Vasti, turns this into a series. I would love to see other characters‚Äô stories continue and explore more of this world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable and engaging read with a strong, likable protagonist and a well-developed romance. While the pacing had a slight dip, it recovered well, and the story left me wanting more. I‚Äôm excited about the potential for a series and would gladly read more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice Level: 2.5 üå∂Ô∏è"

The dual POV and moderate open-door scenes effectively deepen the emotional and physical bond between the characters. Lady Selina's struggle to match Duke Peter Kent of Stanhope with other women while grappling with her own feelings for him is particularly engaging. The story centers on Peter's quest for custody of his half-siblings after their mother's death, and to bolster his reputation, he seeks Selina's assistance, who advises him to marry a respectable woman. The plot stands out for its focus on their evolving connection and the external challenges they navigate together."

Their chemistry and individual growth arcs are compelling.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The book is infused with smart and fantastically ridiculous humor, which adds a delightful layer to the story. The tone balances romance, wit, and emotional depth effectively.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is refreshingly different from typical romances. The main couple‚Äôs relationship resolves earlier than usual, allowing the third-act crisis to focus on external challenges rather than relationship drama. This structure provides more time to explore their happy ending together.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance is a blend of ‚Äúidiots to lovers‚Äù and ‚Äúhe falls first,‚Äù with no third-act breakup. The dual POV and moderate open-door scenes enhance the emotional and physical connection between the characters.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The story touches on themes of family, societal expectations, and women‚Äôs empowerment, particularly through Selina‚Äôs secret library. The focus on Stanhope‚Äôs guardianship case and Selina‚Äôs entrepreneurial spirit adds depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis historical romance is a delightful and unique read, combining humor, heart, and a refreshing plot structure. The characters are lovable, the romance is satisfying, and the themes add depth to the story. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5‚≠êÔ∏è, 3üî•"

            "While the plot occasionally stretches believability, it does so in an entertaining manner. If you're willing to suspend disbelief, you'll find the experience quite enjoyable.",
            "Peter, the unconventional duke, instantly won me over with his passion for abolition and his dedication to his half-siblings. His bumbling charm and impulsive nature only added to his appeal. In contrast, Selena is initially more reserved and difficult to connect with. She's whip-smart and often directs Peter, becoming frustrated when he disrupts her plans. However, as the story unfolds, she gradually won me over. Georgianna stands out with her clever deceptions, while Lydia and Iris are equally captivating; I hope they receive their own spinoff novels, as they would be highly entertaining. The children are adorable and enrich the narrative, though I wished they had a more prominent role in the middle of the book rather than just at the beginning and end.",

She is whip-smart and spends much of the novel ordering Peter around, only to get annoyed when he ruins her plans.

In the majority of her books, I really love the relationship development.\n\n- **Backstory and Context:**\n   - I did wish a tiny bit that there were some flashbacks or more details about Selina and Peter's previous interactions. To me, this felt like book 2 of a series (which, as far as I know, it isn't?). \n   - It mentions the Halifax sisters in passing, but I think that's it. In just the way they were mentioned, it seemed like Selina's brother (Nicholas) and SIL would have been Book 1 (with how casually their courtship was mentioned, like we already knew what happened) and the super briefly talked about previous interactions between Selina and Peter that happened during said courtship. In those moments, I really felt like I missed something.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**\n   - I enjoyed the pace and semi-intrigue and the communication between the main characters once they figured out their own feelings.\n\n- **Series Potential and Future Books:**\n   - I look forward to the rest of the series and can't wait to learn more about Will! I kept going back and forth about who he'd end up with, so I'm excited to see if any of my theories are correct!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this was another great showing from Alexandra Vasti.

            "The insta-love and rapid progression of the romance were minor drawbacks, as it felt like the most captivating moments of their relationship were overlooked. However, the absence of a third-act breakup was a refreshing change that enhanced the overall enjoyment of the story. The novel follows Peter Kent, who unexpectedly inherits a dukedom and must navigate scandalous politics and courtship to gain custody of his younger siblings. Selina Ravenscroft, a proper lady with a hidden life, offers to help Peter find a wife, but their undeniable chemistry complicates matters. The intertwining plots of Peter‚Äôs custody battle and Selina‚Äôs secret life create a compelling narrative. Selina‚Äôs secret‚Äîdeveloping educational materials about sex for women‚Äîadds depth to her character and enriches the story‚Äôs themes of empowerment and societal expectations.",
            "Peter and Selina are masterfully crafted characters, with their perspectives thoughtfully explored. Their shared experiences of loss and societal pressure create an authentic bond. The side characters, especially Peter‚Äôs siblings Lu and Freddie, inject humor, heartbreak, and warmth into the narrative. Their initial wariness of Peter and gradual acceptance heighten the story‚Äôs tension and contribute to character development. Selina‚Äôs unwavering dedication to her secret project, which she refuses to abandon for love, showcases her strength and independence. The romance between Peter and Selina is both steamy and engaging, embodying a delightful ‚Äúidiots in love‚Äù dynamic. Although their relationship feels swift due to their prior acquaintance, their chemistry is undeniable. The portrayal of their married life adds depth, illustrating that marriage introduces its own challenges rather than resolving all issues. The intimate scenes transition from innocent to steamy, enhancing the book‚Äôs appeal for fans of passionate romance.",

            "The pacing of the story is generally strong, but the middle section loses focus on Peter's siblings, which weakens the narrative. Additionally, the repeated emphasis on Selina's internal conflict becomes tedious and disrupts the overall flow. The plot centers on Peter, an American who inherits a dukedom, and Selina, who assists him in securing guardianship of his half-siblings through a marriage scheme. Their mutual respect and hidden crushes develop into a passionate romance. The premise is unique and engaging, skillfully blending historical romance with political and familial stakes.

            "This novel is a delightful romance that effectively addresses themes of censorship and sex education. Selina operates a clandestine erotic library aimed at educating women about sex, pregnancy, and female pleasure, but her endeavor becomes jeopardized when its ownership is threatened. Meanwhile, Peter, a well-meaning but somewhat disorganized duke, struggles to gain custody of his siblings amid opposition from the Lord High Chancellor due to his progressive views. The narrative skillfully weaves together Selina's mission to empower women and Peter's custody battle, ultimately leading to their marriage as both conflicts intensify.",

The inclusion of diverse characters, such as Selina's aunt Judith and her partner Thomasin, along with Mohan Tagore and Faiza Khan, enriches the story. The romance between Selina and Peter is sweet and light-hearted, characterized by mutual attraction and admiration. The intimate scenes are well-crafted and enjoyable, particularly the memorable wedding night. A recurring theme is Peter's attraction to Selina's competence, which leads to some steamy moments. While the representation of characters of color is appreciated, there is a desire for even more diversity in future works.",

            "The story begins with a fast-paced plot but loses momentum towards the end due to repetitive insecurities and an overabundance of romantic sentiment. Certain elements, such as Selina‚Äôs twin brother and her past encounter with Peter, feel underdeveloped and may serve as setups for future installments. The narrative centers on Peter, who, newly appointed as a Duke, must secure guardianship of his siblings while grappling with his feelings for Selina. Meanwhile, Selina, harboring a scandalous secret, assists Peter in finding a suitable wife to bolster his case, all while wrestling with her own emotions. Although the novel touches on themes of found family, loss, and fate, its execution falters with excessive detail and heavy-handed sentimentality in the latter half.",

The siblings bring both charm and chaos to the narrative, while Lydia emerges as a standout character with potential for future installments.",

            "The pacing in the second half of the story feels uneven, disrupting the overall flow. Centered on Peter Kent, an outsider who inherits a dukedom and aims to gain custody of his half-siblings, the narrative explores his quest to improve his reputation. Selina Ravenscroft, a proper debutante with a secret, agrees to assist him in finding a suitable spouse, resulting in humorous and chaotic matchmaking scenarios. The premise is engaging, particularly with the unique twist of Peter being an American navigating British society.",
            "Peter and Selina share fantastic chemistry, and their evolution from friends to lovers is well-developed. The presence of children as side characters adds depth without overshadowing the main plot. However, Selina's persistent concern about damaging Peter's reputation becomes repetitive and detracts from the romance.",
            "The historical fiction elements are skillfully crafted, providing a fresh perspective through Peter‚Äôs American background. Additionally, the subplot featuring the grandmothers‚Äô romance adds both charm and depth to the narrative.",
            "This book is a delightful blend of humor and romance, especially in its entertaining matchmaking mishaps. The steamy romance and sharp dialogue further elevate the reading experience."

            "The central conflict in *Ne‚Äôer Duke Well* lacks conviction; it‚Äôs hard to believe a duke would struggle to gain custody of his half-siblings. Much of the narrative revolves around Peter being pushed into a hasty, loveless marriage, which feels unnecessary. The pacing drags in the middle but picks up significantly toward the end. I appreciate that the conflict avoids clich√©s, which I initially feared. The resolution is clever and charmingly executed. The story follows Peter, an American duke, and Selina, the sister of a duke who manages a secret erotic library. Peter must establish himself as a respectable duke to secure custody of his half-siblings, and Selina is determined to assist him in this endeavor.",

For example, Peter openly tells Selina that it‚Äôs okay not to want a child, which feels anachronistic for an early 18th-century duke.  \n   - I like historical romance for the extremely limiting social confines and seeing how characters maneuver around them. Without these limitations, the appeal and stakes feel lower for me.  \n\n- **Central Conflict and Plot Execution:**  \n   - The central conflict isn‚Äôt very convincing. I don‚Äôt think a duke would have problems gaining custody of his half-siblings.  \n   - A good portion of the book is dedicated to circumventing this by pushing Peter into a hasty, loveless marriage, which I don‚Äôt think is necessary.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n   - The pace dragged a bit in the middle but improved as the story progressed toward the end.  \n   - I appreciate that the conflict doesn‚Äôt resort to clich√©s, as I initially dreaded. The resolution was quite smart and written charmingly.  \n\n- **Characters and Side Characters:**  \n   - I really enjoyed most of the characters. The side characters especially shine for me, and I look forward to Selina‚Äôs friends‚Äô books!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Ne‚Äôer Duke Well* is a delightful story and serves as a great introduction to a new series.

While \"Ne'er Duke Well\" was fun and deliciously spicy (some of the sexiest romance I‚Äôve read all year), I think I liked her novellas a bit better. They were tighter and more well-crafted, whereas this novel felt a bit bloated and untidy in comparison.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n   - The premise is intriguing: Peter Kent, a New Orleans-raised duke with radical abolitionist views, struggles to fit into English nobility. Lady Selina Ravenscroft, who secretly runs an erotic circulating library, devises a plan to help Peter secure his guardianship of his half-siblings by marrying a respectable Englishwoman. The early scenes, particularly Peter‚Äôs interactions with potential brides like Georgiana Cleeve, were hilarious and reminiscent of the best parts of the \"Halifax Hellions\" series. However, the second half of the book dragged, with the plot feeling stretched thin. The final trial scene, especially with the kids riding in on a horse, was too ridiculous and cringe-worthy, even for historical fiction.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The characters are extremely likable, and I particularly enjoyed Peter and Selina‚Äôs dynamic. The supporting characters, like Georgiana and Lydia, were also engaging, and I‚Äôm curious if their romantic journeys will be explored in future books.  \n\n- **Spice and Tone:**  \n   - The spice was definitely on point‚Äîsome of the sexiest romance I‚Äôve read this year. The tone of the book was sweet, spicy, and a little silly, making it a frivolous and fun read.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n   - While the book was enjoyable, I felt it could have ended 50 pages sooner. The pacing in the second half slowed down, and the plot felt unnecessarily prolonged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, \"Ne'er Duke Well\" is a sweet, spicy, and slightly silly historical romance that delivers on fun and frivolity.

However, it fell slightly short of my expectations in terms of tone and sparkle, particularly in the dialogue and pacing. Despite this, the intriguing secondary characters leave me hopeful for future stories in this universe.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Seeking assistance, Peter turns to Selina Ravenscroft, the most intelligent person he knows. Selina advises him to marry before the hearing, but her plan requires him to court three other women instead of her.

            "The story starts off slowly, likely due to my expectations of the author's typically faster-paced novellas. However, the pace picks up significantly when Peter confesses his feelings for Selina, although their relationship solidifies before the halfway mark. The second half shifts to a custody battle for Peter's children, which, while engaging, left me craving more romantic tension between the couple. There are several subplots that I felt could have been developed further; for instance, Selina's role in running an erotic library is introduced but not explored in depth. I also enjoyed the storyline involving one of Peter's love interests, even though it was somewhat predictable. The narrative centers on Lady Selina Ravenscroft, who acts as a matchmaker for Peter Kent, the unconventional 9th Duke of Stanhope from Louisiana. Recently inheriting the title, Peter has embraced his father's illegitimate children as siblings. Selina's goal is to help him find a suitable match to better care for them, but she is taken aback when Peter reveals his feelings for her instead.",
            "I appreciated the matchmaking efforts and the revelation of Peter's feelings, but I found the romantic tension between him and Selina to be underdeveloped. The second half of the book shifted its focus to the custody battle, which overshadowed their love story and diminished the romance.",

Ne‚Äôer Duke Well is set in the same universe as Matilda and Margo, taking place just before their stories.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story follows Lady Selina Ravenscroft, who plays matchmaker for Peter Kent, the 9th Duke of Stanhope. Peter is an unconventional Duke from Louisiana who recently inherited the title and has accepted his father‚Äôs illegitimate children as his siblings. Selina aims to help him secure a match that will elevate his ability to care for his siblings, but she‚Äôs surprised when Peter reveals his feelings for her instead.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The pacing felt slow at the start, possibly because I was expecting the faster tempo of Vasti‚Äôs novellas. The book picked up when Peter confessed his feelings for Selina, but the couple got together before the halfway point. The second half shifted focus to a custody battle for the children, which, while not bothersome, left me wanting more romantic tension between Peter and Selina.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Romantic Tension:**  \n   - I enjoyed the matchmaking attempts and the reveal of Peter‚Äôs feelings, but I felt the romantic tension between Peter and Selina was underdeveloped. The second half of the book focused more on the custody battle than their love story, which detracted from the romance.  \n\n- **Subplots and Missed Opportunities:**  \n   - There were many subplots, some of which I wish had been explored more. For example, Selina runs an erotic library, but the fun and scandalous aspects of this were barely touched upon. I also appreciated the storyline involving one of Peter‚Äôs love interests, though I saw it coming early on.  \n\n- **Memorability and Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n   - While I enjoyed the book, it wasn‚Äôt as memorable as Vasti‚Äôs earlier works. The steamier scenes didn‚Äôt leave a lasting impression, and overall, the story felt somewhat forgettable.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n   - Mhairi Morrison‚Äôs narration was excellent, as always.

            "This delightful Regency romance follows Peter Kent, a newly appointed Duke, as he grapples with his responsibilities and seeks to mend his scandalous reputation.

However, the chemistry between Peter and Selina is undeniable, featuring several well-crafted passionate scenes that stand out as a highlight of the story.",

Instead, Peter and Selina are not just falling in love but also building a family together.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Ne‚Äôer Duke Well* is a delightful historical romance with a modern twist. The characters are well-developed and relatable, the relationship is heartwarming, and the plot is engaging without relying on overused tropes. It‚Äôs a story about love, family, and mutual support, making it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 STARS"

The story begins with Selina and Peter already established as friends, leaving me with a sense of having missed their friendship's development. This narrative choice made me feel that it would have been better suited as a second book in a series, as I longed for more context at the start.",

The romance unfolds as a slow burn, with 35% of the story dedicated to developing their relationship. I was pleasantly surprised by the book's spiciness, featuring several open-door scenes that are engaging without being overly explicit. Notably, chapters 14, 17, 18, 19, and 24 contain these spicy moments. Despite this, the content remains suitable for readers who prefer closed-door romances.",

I really enjoyed this one, so I‚Äôll be moving those books to the top of my reading list. (I already bought them before reading this one, her first full-length novel!)  \n\n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n  - I enjoy adding a historical romance into my contemporary reading now and then, and this one was a perfect pick. It‚Äôs definitely unique, featuring a newly inherited duke who has to come to England from Louisiana.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The duke‚Äôs first task is to petition for guardianship of his younger half-siblings, who had been given to a distant, elderly, and uncaring relative. Second, he aims to fight to abolish slavery. Third, he must win over the girl he made a bad first impression on years ago when he first came to England. He has his priorities straight, but life has other plans.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Chemistry:**  \n  - I really enjoyed the chemistry between the main characters, Peter and Selina. They were a great pair and complemented each other‚Äôs qualities‚Äîher with her library endeavors and him with his siblings and specific demands in parliament. The banter, steam, and overall dynamic were excellent.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  - The side characters, especially the children, added depth and charm to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - I‚Äôm looking forward to more from the author. I definitely recommend this book!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a delightful historical romance with a unique premise, engaging characters, and a well-balanced mix of banter, chemistry, and meaningful themes. It‚Äôs a strong debut full-length novel, and I‚Äôm excited to explore more of the author‚Äôs work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated the concept of the new Duke, burdened by a tarnished reputation, teaming up with a proper debutante who harbors her own secrets to improve his image and secure guardianship of his half-siblings.

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the story, but I felt that at times, there was an overload of side plots that detracted from Peter's relationship with the children. Striking a balance between subplots and the central relationship is challenging, and the narrative would have benefited from greater emphasis on this key aspect.",

There's something irresistibly charming about a flirtatious, slightly chaotic character like Peter stepping up to take responsibility, especially when it involves caring for two children.",

There‚Äôs something incredibly appealing about a flirtatious, slightly chaotic character like Peter taking on responsibility, especially when it involves caring for two children.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The \"reformed rake\" and \"accidental baby acquisition\" tropes are executed well here. I particularly enjoyed the dynamic of Peter becoming the guardian of two children‚Äîa sweet, quiet boy and a rowdy, adventurous girl. It‚Äôs a familiar setup, but it works because of the emotional depth it adds to Peter‚Äôs character.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Representation:**  \n  The \"radical American duke\" aspect of the story was a standout for me. When Nicholas recalled Peter‚Äôs maiden speech in favor of abolition, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by how seamlessly this historical context was woven into the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**  \n  While I loved the story, there were moments when I felt like too much was happening on the side, and not enough focus was given to Peter‚Äôs relationship with the children. Striking the right balance between subplots and the central relationship is tricky, and I think the story could have benefited from a bit more emphasis on this aspect.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre Expectations:**  \n  The court scene at the end was a bit silly, but I recognize that historical romance wouldn‚Äôt be the same without a touch of ridiculousness.

            "The story begins with a compelling enemies-to-lovers dynamic between Selina and Peter. However, their relationship quickly settles into a more subdued rhythm, leading to a slower pace that lacks significant conflict or tension. The most emotionally impactful moment comes later in the book, centered around one of Peter's younger siblings.",
            "In this story, Peter embodies the quintessential cinnamon roll hero‚Äîsweet and kind‚Äîwhile Selina is smart and straightforward without being abrasive. Their fears and anxieties are resolved rather quickly, which can make them seem almost too perfect at times. I found Selina's reaction to the dog in the Serpentine to be a minor point of uncertainty. The secondary characters are delightful and engaging, especially Georgiana, who is poised to have her own book.",

The narration by Mhairi Morrison was spectacular, as ever. She‚Äôs done all of Alexandra Vasti‚Äôs books so far, and they are such a soothing listen.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Chemistry:**  \n  The chemistry between the main characters is delightful. He‚Äôs trying to get custody of his two half-siblings and needs to scheme to get his custody agreement approved. She wants to marry him off, but he just wants her. I love them.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  They blessedly get together fairly early in the book, and the plot shifts to how they‚Äôre going to get these children into their home. However, the story lost me a little bit toward the end because everyone has like three names, and I got confused.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel, particularly the narration and the chemistry between the characters.

Their dynamic is adorable, especially since they are past acquaintances brought together by a chance meeting.  \n  - Selena‚Äôs meddlesome nature and Peter‚Äôs rule-breaking tendencies add depth and humor to their interactions.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n  - The dialogue is sparkling and consistent with the author‚Äôs previous novellas, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The plotting is engaging, and I appreciated how the story developed initially.  \n  - However, the pacing slowed significantly after Peter and Selena got together, and the final third of the book felt like it introduced unnecessary obstacles just to extend the story.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre:**  \n  - The novel is a solid historical romance with a strong comedic tone, which I found damn funny and entertaining.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a delightful and humorous historical romance with charming characters and sparkling dialogue. While the pacing faltered in the latter part of the story, it remains an enjoyable read, especially for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I appreciated how the main characters (MCs) genuinely fell for each other‚Äôs character and personality, not just their physical chemistry.  \n\n- **Plot and Tension:**  \n  Vasti masterfully balances dramatic tension throughout the story without relying too heavily on the overused miscommunication trope.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a highly recommended read for romance lovers. Alexandra Vasti‚Äôs debut full-length novel showcases her storytelling prowess and ability to craft a compelling, well-balanced romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The premise involves Peter, a newly minted Duke who discovers he has a brother and sister not claimed by his father.

The casual mentions of characters from Vasti's novellas added depth and continuity to the story.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Vasti really excels in world-building. I wasn't sure how a Louisiana Duke would work, but it was executed well.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  This was an easy read, and I couldn't wait to dive into the next book in the series.

This added depth and variety to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The protagonist defied traditional regency romance tropes by not wanting to marry, which was a refreshing change. Additionally, the Duke was portrayed as the \"sunshine\" character, a role reversal from the usual depiction of the female lead.

His vulnerability during his brother's illness is particularly heart-wrenching. The secondary characters are strong and memorable, enriching both Selina‚Äôs and Peter‚Äôs arcs with depth and levity.

I was hopeful and ultimately not disappointed.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The story introduces Peter Kent, a newly minted duke from Louisiana, who is reluctantly drawn to his newfound half-siblings and determined to become their guardian. Selina Page, a proper debutante with an unconventional vocation as a publisher, adds depth to the plot. Her attempts to help Peter find a suitable duchess are continually thwarted by their mutual attraction.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - I enjoyed both the main characters and the supporting cast. Peter's struggle with his new title and responsibilities, combined with Selina's defiance of societal norms, made them compelling and relatable.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Experience):**\n   - I listened to the audiobook and appreciated Mhairi Morrison's narration. However, as a native of the southern U.S., I found the Louisiana accent could have been more authentic, though I acknowledge it's easy to overdo.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Series Potential:**\n   - Overall, I found the novel enjoyable and look forward to more installments in the Halifax series. The blend of romance, humor, and character dynamics kept me engaged throughout.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel delivered on my expectations, offering a delightful mix of romance, humor, and well-developed characters. Alexandra Vasti's storytelling, combined with the engaging premise and strong character dynamics, made this a memorable read. I eagerly anticipate future books in the Halifax series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The custody battle plotline failed to resonate, perhaps due to my recent exposure to similar stories. The pacing felt uneven, with some scenes abruptly cut or missing, disrupting the overall flow.

Selina, smart, witty, and good-natured, evokes a lighter version of Austen‚Äôs Emma, while Peter, earnest and hardworking, grapples with self-imposed pressure. Their undeniable chemistry shines through in their steamy scenes. I appreciated Selina‚Äôs confidence in her sexuality and her understanding of intimacy, which sets her apart from the typical virgin FMC trope. However, I found myself curious about Peter‚Äôs past experiences with women, particularly his life in New Orleans, as this aspect remains unexplored. \n\nThe side characters, especially Lu and Freddie, add charm and humor, with Lu‚Äôs fencing aspirations and playful teasing standing out. Together, the four main characters create a delightful family dynamic. Selina‚Äôs group of friends is intriguing, and I look forward to exploring their stories, especially Lydia‚Äôs in the next book.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Characters:**  \n  - Selina and Peter are well-developed characters with depth and humor. Selina is feisty and driven to help other women, while Peter is likened to a \"big golden retriever,\" making them a perfect match.  \n  - I enjoyed their dynamic, but I wished for more insight into Peter‚Äôs perspective to better understand his character.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  - The friends-to-lovers trope is executed well, but Peter‚Äôs attraction to Selina feels underdeveloped, almost like \"instalust.\"  \n  - Their relationship is largely backstory, and I needed more on-page moments to see their connection grow.  \n\n- **Plot and Historical Accuracy:**  \n  - The custody plot felt unrealistic for the time period, particularly regarding how the Court of Chancery would handle the case of two natural children without money or property.  \n  - The resolution to both the library and custody plots was anticlimactic, lacking tension and feeling too convenient.  \n\n- **Author‚Äôs Voice and Writing Style:**  \n  - The author‚Äôs voice is engaging and enjoyable, with a great balance of humor and depth.  \n  - The side characters are well-set-up, and I‚Äôm interested in seeing their stories unfold in future works.  \n\n- **Additional Content:**  \n  - Some backstory and character development, particularly Peter‚Äôs perspective, are apparently available in the author‚Äôs newsletter, which feels like a missed opportunity to include in the main narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the characters, the author‚Äôs voice, and the friends-to-lovers trope, the underdeveloped romance, unrealistic historical elements, and anticlimactic resolutions held the story back from being a full 4 or 5-star read. Despite these flaws, I appreciated the humor and setup for future stories and would return to see what happens next with the side characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "The story follows Peter, an American Duke who inherits a Dukedom in England and seeks custody of his younger half-siblings. His friend Selina devises a plan to enhance his reputation through a marriage with an English girl, which unexpectedly sparks romantic feelings between them. The book refreshingly explores themes of family, equality, and feminism within a historical romance context. However, the plot feels overcrowded, with some side characters, like Faizah and Will, introduced without significant impact. Selina's library storyline, initially sidelined, becomes central halfway through the book. While the narrative is sweet and enjoyable, the pacing is uneven, with too many elements crammed into the story. The introduction of certain characters and subplots feels abrupt, as if the reader is dropped into the middle of an ongoing narrative.",
            "Peter is a charming and well-crafted romantic hero, enriched by a compelling backstory that shapes his character. The Ravenscroft family dynamics are warm and endearing, highlighting themes of loyalty and acceptance. While Selina is a strong character, her personal storyline involving the library feels underdeveloped in the first half. Additionally, some side characters, like Will, are introduced but fail to make a significant impact, which is somewhat disappointing.",
            "The historical setting and themes of equality and feminism are skillfully portrayed, offering a refreshing perspective. However, additional details about Belvoir and the setting in the book's opening would have enriched the narrative."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a sweet and heartwarming historical romance with likable characters and strong themes of family, equality, and feminism. While the plot felt a bit overcrowded and some side characters were underutilized, the Ravenscroft family dynamics and Peter‚Äôs character development were highlights. The book has potential as the start of a series, and I look forward to reading more from this author.",

            "*Ne'er Duke Well* is a delightful historical romance that centers on Selina and Peter. Selina, the sister of a Duke, secretly manages a library that features the Venus Catalog, a collection designed to provide women with sexual education through personal accounts, erotic novels, and anatomy books.

This story left me looking forward to more from the author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the audiobook narration was disappointing due to poorly executed accents, the novel itself was a cute and fun read. The pacing had its flaws, but as a debut full-length novel, it showed promise. I‚Äôm eager to see what the author does next, especially with Lydia‚Äôs story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt meet those expectations. While I liked the story, it didn‚Äôt impress me as much as her other work.\n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**\n   - The plot itself wasn‚Äôt bad, but the world-building had issues. It felt incomplete, and I think adding a novella could help address these gaps. The story had potential to be a strong series opener, but some elements didn‚Äôt work well.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Selina Ravenscroft was a well-rounded character with clear motivations. However, Peter Kent felt one-dimensional. The story focused more on Selina, making Peter seem like a secondary character in her narrative rather than an equal protagonist. His custody battle, which drives the plot, was often forgotten.\n\n- **Pacing and Context:**\n   - The first 40% of the book felt like it was the second in a series, as if I was missing context from a previous installment. References to characters like the Earl of Clermont and Faiza Khan, as well as Peter and Selina‚Äôs first encounter, were mentioned but not explored, leaving me feeling uninformed.\n\n- **Stakes and Emotional Impact:**\n   - The stakes, such as Selina‚Äôs secret library potentially ruining her reputation, weren‚Äôt built up enough to feel impactful, especially compared to Peter‚Äôs custody battle. The emotional weight of these conflicts felt unbalanced.\n\n- **Strengths and Highlights:**\n   - I enjoyed the overarching plot of Peter fighting for custody of his siblings. His interactions with them were heartwarming, even when they resisted him. The cast of characters was large but well-managed, and Thomasin was a standout. The kids were written well, except for one overly cheesy final scene. I also appreciated the departure from the typical \"I‚Äôm not good enough for you\" trope in the male lead.\n\n- **Future Books and Series Potential:**\n   - I‚Äôm looking forward to the next book, *Earl Crush*, featuring Lydia as the heroine. I‚Äôm also hopeful for Georgiana‚Äôs sapphic story and Will Ravenscroft‚Äôs eventual happy ending. Ivy Price seems like a potential love interest in one of these future books.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *Ne'er Duke Well* had its strengths, such as an engaging plot and a well-rounded heroine, it fell short in areas like world-building, character balance, and providing sufficient context. The story often felt like it assumed prior knowledge, which detracted from my enjoyment.

            "The story follows Peter's quest for guardianship of his siblings, supported by Selina, who grapples with her feelings for him. Themes of societal expectations, scandal, and progressive views on women's education and autonomy are intricately woven into the narrative. While the plot is engaging and the themes compelling, I believe the story could have delved deeper into Selina's character and her relationship dynamics with Peter.",
            "Peter, a newly minted duke from New Orleans, struggles to find acceptance in English society due to his radical views on the slave trade and his unconventional behavior. Unfazed by societal judgment, he is determined to gain guardianship of his younger half-siblings, who were left without support after their father's death. I found Peter to be a compelling character; his support for Selina's women-only erotic library and his belief in the importance of sex and anatomy education for women showcased his progressive values. His love for Selina and commitment to protecting his siblings made him particularly likable.\n\nSelina, who harbors feelings for Peter, aims to help him secure guardianship by suggesting he marry to avoid scandal. She curates a list of three potential brides, despite her own love for him and the potential fallout from their connection as the owner of the erotic library. While I appreciated Selina's support for Peter and her forward-thinking views, I felt her character lacked depth. There were opportunities to explore her personality and motivations more fully, but these moments never materialized, leaving her feeling somewhat two-dimensional.",
            "I initially thought this book was part of a series or a companion novel, but it turns out to be a debut. This was disappointing, as we never get to see how Peter and Selina met or their initial impressions of each other. While the story hints at their first meeting, it feels like it belongs to another book, which detracts from the narrative and the characters. I found it hard to invest in their romance from the start; I would have been more engaged had I experienced their meet-cute firsthand."

        "conclusion": "This debut novel offers a charming and progressive romance with likable characters and engaging themes. While the story could have delved deeper into Selina‚Äôs character and the origins of Peter and Selina‚Äôs relationship, it remains a fun and enjoyable read overall.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I assumed this book was part of a series or at least a companion novel to another series, but it turns out this is a debut novel. This was a little disappointing because we never get to read about how Peter and Selina met or what they thought of each other initially. The story alludes to their first meeting, but it feels like it was already covered in a different book. This approach took something away from the story and the main characters, as I wasn‚Äôt invested in their romance from the beginning. I would have been more engaged had I been able to read about their original meet-cute.\n\n- **Character Development (Peter):**  \n  Peter is a new duke who recently inherited the title from his father and grandfather. He‚Äôs not endeared himself to English society, especially since he‚Äôs from New Orleans. He holds radical opinions on the slave trade and behaves differently from what the aristocracy is used to, but he‚Äôs not particularly bothered by anyone else‚Äôs opinion of him. However, he‚Äôs determined to take guardianship of his younger brother and sister, his father‚Äôs illegitimate children, who were left with no provisions after their father‚Äôs death. I loved Peter as a character. He was supportive of Selina‚Äôs women-only erotic library and agreed with her that it was important for women to have access to sex and anatomy education. His love for Selina and his drive to protect his siblings made him a compelling and likable character.\n\n- **Character Development (Selina):**  \n  Selina wants to help Peter gain guardianship of his siblings and realizes the best way to ensure he avoids scandal is for him to take a wife. She creates a list of three women for him to court and choose from, even though she‚Äôs in love with him herself. However, as the owner and curator of a women-only erotic library, she fears the scandal that would arise if her involvement with Peter were discovered. While I appreciated Selina‚Äôs support for Peter and her progressive views, I felt her character lacked depth. There were moments where it seemed like we might delve deeper into her personality and motivations, but this never fully materialized, leaving her feeling somewhat two-dimensional.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Peter‚Äôs quest to gain guardianship of his siblings and Selina‚Äôs efforts to help him while navigating her own feelings for him. The themes of societal expectations, scandal, and progressive ideas about women‚Äôs education and autonomy are woven throughout the narrative. While the plot was engaging and the themes were interesting, I felt the story could have explored Selina‚Äôs character and the dynamics of her relationship with Peter more thoroughly.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some shortcomings, I found this to be a fun and enjoyable read. The characters, particularly Peter, were likable, and the story had a good mix of romance, drama, and progressive ideas. I appreciated the opportunity to read and review this ARC, thanks to NetGalley and Atlantic Books.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel offers a charming and progressive romance with likable characters and engaging themes. While the story could have delved deeper into Selina‚Äôs character and the origins of Peter and Selina‚Äôs relationship, it remains a fun and enjoyable read overall.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot fell flat for me, particularly regarding the custody battle. The notion that a Duke could be denied guardianship of two orphaned children during that era is illogical. The involvement of a political rival in such a low-level case is also unrealistic, given his high social standing. Additionally, the central conflict‚Äîwhere the Duke must marry to demonstrate his commitment to family life‚Äîfelt weak. If the rival's actions stemmed from pettiness, a wife wouldn't change his mind; if he was judging on merit, the Duke's financial support should have sufficed. Overall, the story's conflicts seemed contrived and lacked historical plausibility, as the societal norms and power dynamics of the time were not accurately portrayed, making the plot and character motivations difficult to believe.",
            "The characters, especially Lu, come across as exaggerated. While her actions as a pre-teen grappling with abandonment issues are relatable, her outright rejection of the Duke‚Äôs generous support‚Äîfood, shelter, education, and a dowry‚Äîfeels unrealistic given her societal status. Additionally, the Duke's speech at the end, where he attempts to justify his ability to balance parenting with his responsibilities, seems unnecessary. In that era, aristocratic men were not expected to be hands-on parents, and sending a child to Eton was standard practice.",

Selina's interactions with her friends are enjoyable but unfortunately fade in the second half, where her focus shifts entirely to Peter, which is a letdown.

The lending library subplot, in particular, added unnecessary chaos and didn‚Äôt support the main relationship.  \n  - The book leaned more toward a new adult contemporary romance dressed in historical costume, rather than a cohesive historical romance.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Authenticity:**  \n  - The historical setting and cultural context (e.g., New Orleans society, abolitionism) were underutilized, which could have enriched the story and characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its charming moments, including decent banter and some chemistry between the leads, it struggled with balancing its multiple plotlines and deepening its characters. The romance often took a backseat to other subplots, and the historical context felt underdeveloped. Overall, it was an enjoyable but uneven read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 ‚≠êÔ∏è"

The premise is inventive, especially with the hero being from Louisiana, which adds a unique twist to the \"fish out of water\" tale.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The story is described as witty, fast-paced, and packed with steam, making it an engaging read.

Alexandra Vasti shows promise, and with refinement in these areas, she could deliver an exceptional novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Relatively low rating due to plot and pacing issues (exact score not specified)."

It seemed like the book started halfway through the story, and I didn‚Äôt feel there was a proper buildup. The story maintained the same level for many chapters, which got a bit boring.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The storyline felt middling to me. While the last chapter was very fun, the overall plot didn‚Äôt fully engage me.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements (Spice):**  \n  The spice was fine, but it felt a bit overpowering for a storyline that was already just okay.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a promising premise and some enjoyable moments, particularly with the character Lu and the final chapter, the pacing and plot development left me wanting more. The story lacked a strong buildup and became monotonous over time, with the romantic elements overshadowing the already middling plot.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 (Three stars seem too few, but four seems too many.)"

The male protagonist is an abolitionist from New Orleans who unexpectedly becomes a Duke, and the female protagonist is a society lady who runs a circulating library filled with suggestive books. This setup intrigued me and set high expectations for the story.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  Unfortunately, the story fizzled out after the initial setup. The potential of the premise was not fully realized, and the plot failed to maintain the momentum or depth I had hoped for.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started with an engaging and unique premise, it ultimately fell short in delivering a compelling and well-developed story. The initial promise was not sustained, leaving me disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

However, her full-length novel did not resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments, particularly with the side characters, the lack of engaging main characters, underdeveloped romance, and excessive \"telling\" made it difficult to finish. Despite appreciating the writing style, the story ultimately fell short of my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (for the writing).  \n\nThank you to the publisher for the ARC via Netgalley.

Additionally, the portrayal of the Regency bra as shorter than Victorian styles is incorrect, and the heroine's inability to lace her stays without assistance is historically implausible.",

While both characters are likable and their chemistry is evident, their dynamic lacks depth due to their pre-existing relationship.

I appreciated Peter Kent‚Äôs calm demeanor.  \n  - Lady Selina‚Äôs desire to be selfless and sacrifice her own happiness to find Peter the perfect wife was an interesting trait.  \n  - I wish there had been more focus on Peter and Selina‚Äôs relationship and development.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  - Peter and Selina got together quickly, but their chemistry didn‚Äôt feel entirely convincing to me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**  \n  - The story moved fast, but the pacing sometimes made it feel like the main characters were overshadowed by other events.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this historical romance had an intriguing premise and some likable character traits, the crowded plot and lack of convincing chemistry between the main characters made it less engaging than I had hoped. I appreciated the opportunity to read this ARC and share my honest thoughts.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n   - Everyone in the story made things way more complicated than they needed to be, which seems to be a standard trope in romance novels.  \n\n- **Setting and Era:**  \n   - I enjoy giving Regency-era novels a chance, hoping they evoke the same feelings as *Bridgerton*, but this one didn‚Äôt succeed in doing so.  \n\n- **Character Chemistry:**  \n   - Selina and Peter lacked real chemistry, and their relationship felt forced. The narrative seemed to insist that they were perfect for each other without convincing me to root for their love.  \n\n- **Character Development (Selina):**  \n   - I appreciated the attempt to portray Selina as an original feminist, but her characterization felt overdone and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n   - Overall, the book didn‚Äôt resonate with me, and it reinforced my hesitation about continuing to read romance novels.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the effort to create a feminist lead and explore a Regency-era romance, the lack of chemistry between the main characters and the overly complicated plot left me unsatisfied. Despite my reservations, I‚Äôll likely still give romance novels a chance in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The Venus library served as an overused plot device to create conflict between Selina and Peter, feeling more like a flimsy excuse to keep them apart while emphasizing feminist themes. The heavy focus on issues like misogyny, sexism, and slavery felt out of place in a romantic comedy, detracting from the lighthearted romance I anticipated. Additionally, the first kiss and marriage proposal occurred too early (around 36%), leaving little room for yearning or emotional buildup. Overall, the story lacked the slow-burn tension and emotional depth that make romances truly compelling.",

Numerous characters, terms, and locations felt like they should be familiar, yet they weren‚Äôt. I even checked Goodreads to see if there was a prequel I had overlooked. This lack of clarity hindered my ability to fully engage with the story.",
