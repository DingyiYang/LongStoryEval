            "The story opens with the male protagonist, a teenager, playfully flirting with the female protagonist, who is unresponsive. A turning point occurs when he is caught kissing her cousin, leading to an engagement with the cousin and his enlistment in the navy. After being presumed dead for five years, he returns to a changed world where his former fianc√©e is married with a child. His attempts to reconnect with the female protagonist are met with resistance, as she feels like a second choice. \n\nThe first half of the book suffers from repetition, with the male protagonist continually asking to speak with her privately, only to be rejected, resulting in a monotonous and tedious reading experience. His backstory includes a harrowing experience of being captured by pirates, yet the female protagonist fixates on his secrecy instead of empathizing with his trauma. This misalignment leads to the central conflict: her inability to trust him due to his past, which, despite being understandable, unintentionally portrays her as selfish.\n\nFortunately, the resolution in the final quarter is satisfying, as it brings closure to the various conflicts. However, the overall length of the book feels excessive, with minor conflicts and repetitive internal monologues that could benefit from being streamlined. A more concise narrative would enhance cohesiveness and mitigate the focus on the female protagonist‚Äôs less endearing qualities.",

            "The story had promising foundations but ultimately missed the mark. The pacing and emphasis on subplots diminished the emotional impact of Eli‚Äôs return and the central romance.",
            "The childhood friendship and unresolved feelings between Eli and Jane enrich their dynamic. However, Jane's response to Eli's reappearance is frustrating; she prioritizes his secrets over empathizing with his struggles. Additionally, the subplot involving Eli‚Äôs past engagement to Jane's cousin adds an awkward layer, particularly with the later revelation of a secret that complicates their relationship further.",
            "The premise of a historical romance featuring a presumed-dead man returning after two years is intriguing and filled with potential. As a fan of the \"missing and presumed dead\" trope, I anticipated a greater emphasis on Eli's return. While the plot does explore his attempts to rebuild his life, it often diverts to the heroine‚Äôs quest for financial independence and her gambling club, which felt like a detour from the main storyline."

While that section felt slightly rushed, I was ultimately satisfied with how everything was resolved, so it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment!",
            "I absolutely adored Jane, a determined woman striving for independence by running a ladies‚Äô gaming club. Eli, on the other hand, has faced a tumultuous past; everyone believed he was dead after his ship sank two years ago, but he was actually held captive by Greek pirates for most of that time. I enjoyed unraveling the mystery of his disappearance, as it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs not sharing everything initially. \n\nWhat I loved most was Eli‚Äôs deep understanding of Jane. He not only supports her club but actively encourages her to expand it, willing to step back and let her take the lead in their relationship. The secondary characters also added richness to the story. Jane‚Äôs friend and gaming partner, Della, was a standout, and I hope to see more of her. Uncle Bertie is another gem‚Äîsweet and well-meaning, even if his choices sometimes clash with Jane‚Äôs wishes. I also hope Eli‚Äôs sister, Hannah, gets her own happily ever after after enduring their difficult upbringing.\n\nIf you‚Äôre seeking the perfect ‚Äúit‚Äôs always been you‚Äù romance, *The Lady He Lost* is it. This book delivers an emotional gut punch, filled with heartache and longing. The chemistry between Jane and Eli is palpable; they are deeply in love, yet must navigate their shared hurt and history to reach their happily ever after. The unspoken feelings between them add incredible depth to their romance, and the pining is simply delightful. And when they finally kiss‚Äîin the rain, no less‚Äîit‚Äôs electric. Their true emotions come alive in those intimate moments, making for a truly captivating read.",

Overall, the book is a delightful read, and the tongue-in-cheek humor enhances the fun."

I loved all the hints that there was more to Eli‚Äôs story than he was letting on.\n   - The ending was a bit wild as a lot happened in the last 10%. That‚Äôs the only part that felt a tad rushed, but everything was resolved in a way that left me satisfied and happy, so I didn‚Äôt mind!\n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**\n   - This was such a beautiful debut. I swear I highlighted like half of it as so many of the passages, particularly when it came to Eli or Jane talking about the other, were so beautiful and just hit right in the emotions!\n   - I also loved the humor Delacour wove into this. I seriously found myself chuckling so many times, including at the opening line. Overall the book felt so fun, and the tongue-in-cheek humor really added to it!\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*The Lady He Lost* is a beautiful debut historical romance filled with richly nuanced characters, a fun and engaging plot, and a swoonworthy, hot romance. It delivers on emotional depth, humor, and a satisfying happily ever after. I had a blast reading it and cannot wait to see what Faye Delacour writes next. Highly recommended for fans of historical romance!\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 4.5 Stars"

            "The story follows Lieutenant Eli Williams, who returns home after being presumed dead for two years, only to find his life in shambles. His finances are depleted, his fianc√©e has moved on, and his former friend Jane still holds a grudge against him. While the themes of unfinished business and second chances are compelling, the execution falls short, lacking the depth and seriousness the premise suggests. The marketing and cover design hint at a more intense narrative, but the story ultimately fails to fulfill that promise.",
            "Eli is a sweet and patient character, but his tolerance of Jane‚Äôs behavior feels one-sided, undermining the enemies-to-lovers trope. He lacks the assertiveness needed to create a more balanced tension between them. Jane‚Äôs anger toward Eli often seems unjustified, especially with her possessive \"I had dibs on him\" attitude. While her role as a card sharp adds some intrigue, her motivations and personality don‚Äôt leave a strong impression. On a positive note, the inclusion of a supporting queer character is a thoughtful addition, especially within the typically conservative historical romance genre.",

I expected longing and angst, but instead, I found Eli to be frustratingly passive, mistaking ‚Äúsupportive hero‚Äù for ‚Äúpassive do-nothing.‚Äù He lacks reflection, and his internal monologues are repetitive and unhelpful. His claim to be unaware of Jane‚Äôs feelings feels disingenuous, as if he‚Äôs blaming her for not expressing them sooner. While Jane‚Äôs ambition and resourcefulness are commendable, her character lacks depth. She mainly revolves around her skills with numbers, her desire for independence, and her endless thoughts about Eli, which become tiresome.

            "This novel is a fast-paced Victorian romance, rich with events in a short span, which at times can feel overwhelming but ultimately keeps the reader engaged. While the quick progression may seem rushed to some, it effectively maintains interest throughout. The story follows Lieutenant Eli Williams, who, presumed dead after a shipwreck, returns to London only to discover that his family has squandered his fortune and his fianc√©e has married another man. He reconnects with Jane Bishop, an old friend who once harbored feelings for him but stepped aside when he became engaged to her cousin. Set against the backdrop of a house party at Ascot, their rekindled relationship unfolds as they navigate intimate moments alongside societal and personal challenges.",
            "Eli and Jane are well-developed characters facing relatable struggles. Eli confronts the threat of a court martial for his absence, while Jane is determined to carve out her independence by opening a gaming club for women. Their lack of experience in love adds authenticity to their romance. The tension between them is palpable throughout the first half of the novel, with their interactions brimming with chemistry and their kisses feeling both meaningful and heartfelt. The obstacles they encounter, including societal expectations and financial constraints, enrich their relationship. The heat level is medium, emphasizing emotional intimacy over explicit scenes, which aligns perfectly with their inexperience and the novel's overall tone.",
            "The Victorian setting is vividly portrayed, immersing readers in the time period. The Ascot house party provides an ideal backdrop for the unfolding romance. The societal norms and restrictions of the era, like Jane's inability to have her own bank account, enhance the story's authenticity."

        "conclusion": "This debut Victorian romance novel offers a compelling mix of tension, chemistry, and authentic character struggles. While the pacing is brisk and the plot is packed with events, the emotional depth and well-captured setting make it an engaging read. The medium heat level and focus on inexperienced love add a unique touch to the story. I look forward to future installments from this promising new author.",

He reconnects with Jane Bishop, an old friend who once had feelings for him but gave up when he became engaged to her cousin.\n   - The story revolves around their rekindled connection, set against the backdrop of a house party at Ascot, where they share intimate moments and face societal and personal obstacles.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Eli and Jane are well-developed characters with relatable struggles. Eli is grappling with the possibility of a court martial for being missing, while Jane is determined to achieve independence by opening her own gaming club for women.\n   - Both characters are inexperienced in love, which adds a layer of authenticity to their romance.\n\n- **Romantic Tension and Chemistry:**\n   - The tension between Eli and Jane is palpable, especially in the first half of the novel. Their interactions are filled with sparks, and their kisses are described as meaningful and heartfelt.\n   - The obstacles they face, such as societal expectations and financial constraints, add depth to their relationship.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - The story moves quickly, with a lot of events packed into a short time frame. While this can feel overwhelming at times, it also keeps the reader engaged.\n   - The pacing is effective in maintaining the reader's interest, though some may find the rapid progression of events a bit rushed.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - The Victorian setting is well-captured, with details that immerse the reader in the time period. The house party at Ascot serves as a fitting backdrop for the romance to unfold.\n   - The societal norms and restrictions of the era, such as Jane‚Äôs inability to have her own bank account, add authenticity to the story.\n\n- **Heat Level and Intimacy:**\n   - The heat level is described as medium, with a focus on emotional intimacy rather than explicit scenes. This approach suits the characters' inexperience and the overall tone of the novel.\n\n- **Series Potential:**\n   - The review hints at potential future books in the series, possibly focusing on Jane‚Äôs best friend or Eli‚Äôs sister. This adds an element of anticipation for readers who enjoy interconnected stories.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis debut Victorian romance novel offers a compelling mix of tension, chemistry, and authentic character struggles. While the pacing is brisk and the plot is packed with events, the emotional depth and well-captured setting make it an engaging read.

            "The conclusion of Eli and Jane's romance felt a bit anticlimactic given their tumultuous journey together, highlighting that it's often more about the journey than the destination. However, I found the resolutions to the side plots, such as Eli‚Äôs desertion trial and Jane‚Äôs attempts to secure funding for the club, were wrapped up too quickly and easily in the final act. While I appreciate that this is a historical romcom and not intended to be fully realistic, I wished for more believable resolutions.",
            "I adored the chemistry between Eli and Jane. The dual POV was fantastic, capturing their delicious pining and the tension as they circled around each other. It was entertaining to watch Jane resist Eli while he relentlessly pursued her. However, I wished for a more satisfying resolution to Cecily's storyline, as she was such a despicable character.",
            "As a devoted fan of the friends-to-lovers trope, I often find it lacking in historical romance. That's why I was excited to discover this book focusing on that theme; I couldn‚Äôt resist reading it. It has quickly become my second favorite historical romance, with *A Lady for a Duke* still holding the top spot. Both stories center around the friends-to-lovers dynamic and feature a protagonist returning from presumed death during military service."

Her character evokes some of my favorite heroines from historical romances like *Faro's Daughter* and *Devil in Winter*. Eli, her love interest, is equally intriguing, although both characters grapple with miscommunication and poor timing. Jane holds onto grudges stubbornly, yet she softens during moments of intimacy‚Äîonly to suddenly get cold feet. Eli shares the struggle; he often dwells on his circumstances and overlooks his younger sister's sage advice. The romance between Jane and Eli is rife with tension, openness, and frustration. They connect deeply during intimate moments but falter when it truly matters. Their dynamic, both frustrating and charming, gives their relationship an authentic and engaging feel.",

            "The plot takes a wild turn when Eli is captured by pirates who don't demand a ransom, adding a unique twist to the story. The historical details, like the onset of the Opium Wars and the opening of the Ascot racecourses in 1839, are seamlessly woven into the narrative, enhancing the setting's depth.",
            "In the early Victorian era, Jane emerges as a refreshing and independent young woman. Eli, steadfast and honorable yet somewhat foolish in love, is a good listener who strives to improve Jane's life, even if she often overlooks his efforts. The side characters are well-developed, particularly Uncle Bertie, who serves as a devoted father and guardian eager to see Jane married. The relationship between Jane and Eli is intense, marked by numerous hot-and-cold moments that, while a bit overdone, still deliver plenty of steam. Their strong attraction ultimately leads them to realize their need for one another, especially as Eli's mysterious disappearance comes into play.",
            "The historical details, especially regarding the horseraces and Eli's experiences as a sailor, are seamlessly integrated into the narrative. The author skillfully provides clues to establish the timeline, such as the young age of the new queen and the mention of the Ascot racecourses in 1839."

        "conclusion": "*The Lady He Lost* is a strong historical romance debut by the author, featuring a charming yet tumultuous relationship between Jane and Eli. While the romantic dynamics lean heavily on hot/cold moments, the chemistry between the characters is undeniable. The plot is unique, if a bit wild, and the historical details are well-researched and integrated. The narration of the audiobook, however, falls short of capturing the humor and joy of the text, so I recommend reading the book instead. Overall, it‚Äôs an enjoyable read with well-developed characters and a vivid historical setting.",

Her life changes dramatically when Eli, her presumed-dead former love, returns with secrets and offers to help her pursue her dreams. The narrative weaves together themes of love, betrayal, heartache, and redemption, culminating in a satisfying ending that leads the characters toward a happily ever after (HEA).

            "At the beginning of the story, Jane Bishop comes across as unlikable due to her judgmental and rigid demeanor. However, by the halfway point, she becomes more relatable and engaging. Eli, on the other hand, is a well-developed character whose backstory‚Äîhaving been presumed dead and taken prisoner by pirates‚Äîdeepens his narrative as he returns to a life in disarray.

            "This novel is a friends-to-lovers romance infused with themes of unrequited love. The story follows Jane, who secretly loves Eli, convinced their feelings are mutual. Her heart shatters when he is seen with her cousin and later becomes engaged to her. Eli's disappearance and presumed death at sea, followed by his surprising return, heightens the tension and resentment. While Jane's venture into starting a ladies' gambling club offers an intriguing subplot, it ultimately takes a backseat to her complicated relationship with Eli.",
            "In this compelling story, Jane grapples with deep resentment and insecurity, often measuring herself against her cousin and questioning Eli's feelings for her. Eli, despite his past, does not owe Jane anything and is unjustly targeted by her bitterness. Meanwhile, Jane's cousin is portrayed as manipulative, consistently undermining Jane and exacerbating her insecurities. The romance unfolds as a slow-burn, with Jane and Eli entering a no-strings-attached affair midway through the narrative. Jane's belief that she will always be second best to her cousin heightens the emotional tension. The novel also features male masturbation scenes and unexpected depictions of virginity, providing a fresh perspective within the historical romance genre.",
            "The narrative skillfully balances humor and emotional depth, especially in moments where Jane's spiteful questioning of Eli results in serious consequences, like his court-martial. The tone is both candid and reflective, allowing me to recognize my biases toward unlikable heroines."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The novel is a friends-to-lovers romance with elements of unrequited love.  \n   - The story revolves around Jane, who harbored feelings for Eli, believing they were mutual, only to be heartbroken when he was caught with her cousin and later engaged to her.  \n   - Eli's disappearance and presumed death at sea, followed by his unexpected return, adds a layer of tension and resentment.  \n   - The plot includes a subplot about Jane starting a ladies' gambling club, though it feels sidelined as her relationship with Eli takes center stage.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Jane is portrayed as a deeply resentful and insecure character, often comparing herself to her cousin and doubting Eli's feelings for her.  \n   - Eli is depicted as a man who, despite his past actions, does not owe Jane anything and is unfairly targeted by her resentment.  \n   - Jane's cousin is shown as manipulative, constantly undermining Jane and fueling her insecurities.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n   - The romance is a slow-burn, with Jane and Eli engaging in a no-strings-attached affair midway through the book.  \n   - Jane's belief that she will always be second-best to her cousin creates emotional tension.  \n   - The inclusion of male masturbation scenes and surprise virgin representation adds a unique touch to the historical romance genre.  \n\n- **Writing and Tone:**  \n   - The narrative balances humor and emotional depth, particularly in scenes where Jane's spiteful questioning of Eli leads to unintended consequences, such as his court-martial.  \n   - The tone is candid and reflective, with the reader acknowledging their biases regarding \"unlikeable\" heroines.  \n\n- **Strengths and Weaknesses:**  \n   - Strengths: The humor in Jane's spiteful actions, the rare inclusion of male masturbation scenes, and the slow-burn romance.  \n   - Weaknesses: Jane's constant insecurity and comparison to her cousin can be frustrating, and the gambling club subplot feels underdeveloped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this debut novel by Faye Delacour offers a unique take on the friends-to-lovers trope with its slow-burn romance and moments of humor, it also has its flaws, particularly in the portrayal of Jane's insecurities and the underutilized subplot. Overall, it‚Äôs a solid recommendation for fans of historical romance looking for something different.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: 3.5/5  \n- Heat Level: 3.5/5"

            "The first half of the book is compelling, featuring a well-structured plot, vibrant characters, and engaging dialogue. However, the second half falters with pacing and plot development, lacking a strong overarching theme or new conflict after Eli and Jane begin their affair. The revelation of Eli‚Äôs whereabouts during his absence feels underwhelming given the buildup. Additionally, Jane‚Äôs brother‚Äôs abrupt transformation into a negative character at the end is both unnecessary and confusing. The conclusion is anti-climactic, leaving me wanting more. Despite these issues in the latter half, the novel remains an enjoyable read overall.",
            "The author excels in character development, creating Eli and Jane as compelling and relatable figures. Jane's independence and her initiative to establish a women's gambling club, which challenges societal norms, are particularly noteworthy. Additionally, the rivalry between Jane and her cousin Cecily enriches the narrative, providing a strong counterpoint to the romance arc.",
            "Chapter 1 serves as an engaging hook that immediately draws me in. The first half of Chapter 2, which showcases the humorous meeting between Eli's family and Mr. Filby, is exceptionally well-written. The library reunion between Eli and Jane is particularly memorable, filled with tension and chemistry.",

However, their constant back-and-forth about feelings and trust becomes tiresome and detracts from the enjoyment of their relationship.

He had been rescued by pirates and eventually escaped with the help of a pirate friend.  \n   - Eli reconnects with his childhood friend, Jane, after his fianc√©e, Cecily, married someone else and had a child.  \n   - Jane, hurt by Eli‚Äôs previous engagement to her cousin, had decided to become a spinster and is working on establishing a ladies‚Äô gaming hell.  \n   - The plot is thin but enriched by Cecily‚Äôs manipulative and intriguing behavior, which adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - Jane is a well-developed character with justified anger, though her resentment is more directed at her cousin, Cecily, than at Eli.  \n   - Eli is a decent character, and his reconnection with Jane is central to the story.  \n   - Cecily is portrayed as manipulative and not always likable, which makes her a compelling antagonist.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n   - The narrator, Blythe Fortune, has a strident and childish voice, which detracted from the listening experience.  \n   - The narration made me want to finish the audiobook quickly rather than savor the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite the thin plot, the story is engaging and fun, especially due to Cecily‚Äôs escapades.  \n   - The characters and their dynamics make the book interesting, though the audiobook narration was a drawback.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Lady He Lost* is an enjoyable Regency romance with a unique premise and well-developed characters. While the plot is somewhat thin, the interactions between the characters, particularly Cecily‚Äôs manipulative behavior, add depth and intrigue. However, the audiobook narration was disappointing, making the listening experience less enjoyable than reading the book might have been.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "This novel offers a captivating historical romance reminiscent of *Persuasion* and *Poldark*. The narrative features a satisfying groveling arc from Lieutenant Eli Williams, whose motivations are well-explained, and introduces Jane Bishop, a strong and admirable character. Jane's ambitious plan to establish a gambling ring among the wealthy ladies heightens the tension, as she risks everything with little to fall back on if it fails.",
            "Lieutenant Eli Williams is a complex and reserved naval officer with an intriguing backstory. Jane Bishop emerges as a resourceful and determined heroine grappling with societal constraints and financial challenges. Her uncle, a nuanced, closeted queer character, adds depth to the narrative, with hints of his relationship subtly woven throughout. Meanwhile, Jane's frustrating brother evokes strong emotions from the reader. The inclusion of Jane's uncle enriches the story with representation, even as his queerness remains subtly implied rather than explicitly stated.",
            "The story adeptly explores themes of angst and emotional turmoil, particularly through the trope of a character's unexpected return from the dead to confront his former fianc√©e, who has since married someone else. It also delves into the financial struggles faced by the characters, as Eli's inheritance has dwindled due to his presumed death, while Jane navigates her vulnerability as a woman dependent on her uncle. Additionally, the narrative addresses the horrors of war and military service, adding significant depth to the overall story.",

The well-developed characters, financial struggles, and exploration of war's impact make it a standout. The subtle queer representation and satisfying romantic arc further enhance the narrative.

This additional detail would have enriched the narrative and provided more context for his transformation.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending is satisfying and heartwarming, tying up the central romance beautifully. However, I wished for more descriptive details about Eli‚Äôs past two years to fully appreciate the intensity of his survival and the impact it had on his character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a charming friends-to-lovers romance with a strong premise and engaging character dynamics. While the story is enjoyable and emotionally resonant, it could have benefited from more in-depth exploration of Eli‚Äôs past to enhance the narrative‚Äôs richness and complexity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüí´"

            "This book is a quick read that immerses the reader in its unfolding narrative. While the plot is engaging, its pacing could be improved; there are moments where it feels slow, and the ending rushes to a conclusion. The unresolved subplot regarding Jane's gambling club hints at potential for further exploration. Centered on Jane Bishop, an orphan intent on creating a ladies' gambling club and remaining a spinster despite societal expectations, the story takes a dramatic turn with the return of her presumed-dead best friend and secret crush, Eli Williams, who has escaped from pirates. The trial where Eli faces accusations of desertion injects tension and emotional depth into the narrative. Overall, the premise effectively blends romance, personal ambition, and external conflict.",

While the plot introduces a rivalry among women, the comedic depiction of the FMC‚Äôs cousin's cruelty keeps the tone from becoming too intense.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Romantic Moments:**  \n  The novel features several memorable romantic scenes, such as the hot first kiss in the rain and the hero carrying the heroine across a field. Their first intimate moment is intense, with the hero being so excited he can barely wait, but he compensates for it later, making the experience satisfying.\n\n- **Character Development (Hero):**  \n  The hero is portrayed as someone who works hard to rebuild trust and friendship after making a significant mistake. His efforts to redeem himself are a strong point in the story.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The pacing of the story feels uneven at times. Specifically, it takes too long for the big secret to be revealed and for the hero to explain his actions, such as why he went out into the garden. This delay detracts from the overall flow of the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has its flaws, particularly in pacing and the delayed revelation of key plot points, it excels in creating romantic and emotionally charged moments. The hero's journey of redemption and the chemistry between the characters are highlights, making it an enjoyable read despite its imperfections.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her strong personality added depth to the story and made her relatable.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The story includes a lot of mix-ups and confusion, which kept me intrigued. While it took some time, all the questions were eventually answered, providing a satisfying resolution.  \n\n- **Pacing and Action:**  \n  I felt the book could have used a bit more action or additional events to keep the momentum going. However, despite this, the story remained fun and enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a delightful read that helped me out of my post-Bridgerton slump. While it could have benefited from more action, the independent heroine, engaging plot twists, and satisfying resolution made it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this story, Jane comes across as frustratingly immature, and her plan to establish a ladies' gambling club lacks the realism even historical romance allows. While we are meant to sympathize with her when her family undermines her efforts, I found their concerns more justified. Eli, on the other hand, appears painfully oblivious; he gets entangled with Jane's spiteful cousin, becomes engaged to her, and then disappears into the Navy without informing Jane of his survival. His excuse about protecting the Greek pirate who rescued him feels weak, and his decision to keep secrets from Jane only exacerbates the problem. Ultimately, I found it difficult to care about Jane and Eli's relationship. However, I enjoyed the character of Jane's friend and partner in her gambling venture; if she becomes the focus of the next book, I would be interested in her story.",

We are supposed to feel sympathetic for her plight when her family members try to frustrate those plans, but mostly I agreed with them.  \n\n- **Character Development (Eli):**  \n  Eli was painfully oblivious about what he did wrong by getting caught with Jane's spiteful cousin despite their close relationship, getting engaged to the cousin, then running off to the Navy and not bothering to tell Jane that he was alive and not drowned, as everyone thought. His excuse about protecting the Greek pirate who saved him was weak, and continuing to keep everything from Jane was not a good choice.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  In the end, I didn't really care much about Jane and Eli's relationship.  \n\n- **Secondary Characters:**  \n  I liked Jane's friend and partner in her gambling club scheme.
