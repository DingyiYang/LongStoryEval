            "The friendships in the story were beautifully portrayed, creating an intimate atmosphere. The relationships were well-crafted, and I appreciated the inclusion of bisexual and lesbian representation. The coming-of-age theme and the nostalgic vibes of a last summer vacation were enjoyable. While I liked Callie’s perspective, I felt that Polly’s viewpoint could have added depth, particularly regarding her feelings about her body. Polly didn’t have the opportunity to fully articulate the complexities of her experience. In contrast, Callie’s perspective offered a positive take on body image, but it didn’t fully address the broader topic.",
            "The themes in the story could have been explored more effectively. While the initial premise showed promise, it ultimately felt constrained, likely due to its classification as a young adult novel.",
            "The novel was captivating and kept me eagerly turning the pages."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, the novel was engaging and had some strong elements, such as its portrayal of relationships and friendships, as well as its representation of diverse identities. However, the thematic depth and character perspectives, particularly Polly’s, felt underdeveloped. While the story had potential, it could have delved deeper into its themes and characters to create a more impactful narrative.",

The story excels in LGBTQ+ representation, highlighting healthy relationships and strong female friendships. However, I found Callie’s reaction to Mackenzie troubling; I didn’t agree with her choices, which led me to worry more about Mackenzie than Talia.

The lack of backstory made it hard to fully understand or empathize with their struggles.  \n\n- **Execution of Concept:**  \n  While the idea behind the book was interesting, the execution fell short.

It also addresses heavy themes such as eating disorders, emotional abuse, loss/grief, mentions of sex (off-page), and underage drinking.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story is set in a beach town and has a summer read vibe, with scenes like trips to the beach, trying on bathing suits, roller skating, and falling in love.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The pacing is slow and thoughtful, particularly after the girls complete the invisibility ritual. This slower pace may not appeal to middle school readers as much as high school readers.  \n\n- **Symbolism and Depth:**  \n  Invisibility serves as a metaphor for addiction and, in some ways, parallels suicidal ideation. This is especially poignant for the character with an eating disorder and an unstable home life, who decides to give up her body completely.  \n\n- **Characterization and Relationships:**  \n  The friendships between the girls are unique and touching. The author beautifully captures first love as well as the difficulty of ending a bad relationship that was once good. Callie’s characterization stood out as particularly well-done.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a thoughtful and emotionally resonant novel about friendship, acceptance, and the complexities of relationships.
