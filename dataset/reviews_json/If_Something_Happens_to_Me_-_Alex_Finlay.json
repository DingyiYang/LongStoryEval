        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Writing Style:**  \n   - Alex Finlay is an author I’ve come to love for his fast-paced thrillers. This book was no exception to what I love about his writing style.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n   - The story is told from a rotating group of POVs (three for the most part). You know each individual story will eventually intertwine with the others, but you don’t know how.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n   - The end of each chapter had me craving the next. It was so hard to put down!  \n   - Overall, this was a revolving door of goodness in a book, and I devoured it in two sittings.  \n\n- **Medium of Consumption (Ebook vs. Audio):**  \n   - The hang-up I’ve had with a previous Finlay book was the difficulty in keeping up with everything that’s happening—all the layers, characters, and how it’ll all come together—on audio.  \n   - Reading this story as an ebook really helped me keep everyone straight. I would’ve had a very hard time following all of this on audio and felt (for me) it would’ve taken away from my overall rating.  \n   - That said, the narrators for past Finlay books have been terrific, but if you have a hard time keeping all the little details straight, I’d recommend this as a physical copy.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments and Recommendations:**  \n   - Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Publishing Group for the advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.  \n   - Be sure to pick this one up when it releases in May!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a fast-paced, engaging thriller with a well-structured narrative that keeps you hooked. While I found it easier to follow as an ebook, the story itself is a compelling read that I highly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story wasn’t filled with twists and turns like an Alice Feeney or Freida McFadden book, but it was nonstop craziness nonetheless.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The book’s crazy description made me add it to my list months ago, and while it wasn’t a huge surprise, it delivered on its promise of wildness.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book for its relentless energy and the way the characters’ lives intertwined, though I felt the characters could have been more developed. The plot was unconventional and kept me engaged, even if it didn’t follow the typical twist-filled structure of other thrillers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.75/5"

            "The story is filled with shocking twists that kept me engaged until the final page. The cryptic note titled \"If Something Happens to Me\" introduces an emotional and mysterious element to the narrative. The author skillfully builds suspense by intertwining plotlines that traverse from a small town in Kansas to a mob family in Philadelphia, and across Europe to England, France, and Italy. The narrative centers around a five-year-old missing person cold case that is reignited when a true crime podcast team discovers the submerged car of the missing girl in a Kansas lake. Inside the car are two executed men and a cryptic waterproof note, but the girl, Ali, remains unfound. The plot is packed with action, assassins, hidden identities, and shocking revelations, making it an irresistible page-turner.",

Meanwhile, Poppy, the newly appointed sheriff in Kansas, takes on Ali's case. She navigates old case files, leans on her KBI contact, and wrestles with whether to trust a mysterious FBI agent offering information. Her determination and resourcefulness make her a captivating character.",
            "The story’s settings span from the eerie stillness of a small-town in Kansas to the gritty mob underworld of Philadelphia, and the vibrant locales of Italy, France, and England. This rich and immersive atmosphere effectively enhances the tension and appeal, as the contrast between the tranquil small town and high-stakes international intrigue keeps readers engaged.",
            "The book was so gripping that I found myself staying up late to finish it. It was an engaging read that I couldn't put down. The short chapters, varied perspectives, and fast-paced plot kept me hooked, seamlessly intertwining the characters and storylines."

            "The revelation tying Shane O’Leary’s story to Michael Harper and Alison Lane was a compelling twist. The flashbacks were skillfully executed, and the absence of timestamps heightened the suspense. Taylor’s (Alison's) bullying of Shane’s son was a shocking and effective addition, enriching the narrative. From the start, Fincher's untrustworthiness was evident, making her ultimate reveal satisfying. The ending with Chaz delivered a sense of poetic justice, bringing the story full circle. Michael's sacrifice to break the cycle of violence was a poignant moment, and while I empathized with Shane and Gina—whose tragic actions were understandable—it underscored the weight of their choices.",
            "Poppy is a well-crafted character—young, trusting, and relatable. However, her choice to converse with Fincher despite Ken's warning ultimately leads to Michael's tragic death. Ryan's character intrigued me, but I wished for a more satisfying resolution with Alison; their ending felt unfinished, leaving me wanting closure. Alison herself is a complex figure; while I empathize with her, I can't label her a good person, especially considering her troubling childhood actions.",

            "The novel's opening was initially perplexing due to its three timelines, numerous names, and intricate character details. It wasn't until the final chapter that everything cohesively fell into place, delivering a satisfying and cleverly crafted twist. The jumbled timelines kept me guessing, and I appreciated how they ultimately converged. The story exuded strong Harlan Coben vibes, making it easy to envision as a successful Netflix adaptation.",
            "At first, I saw Taylor as a little sister figure, but the twist revealing her true identity as Alison in the last chapter of Part 1 was brilliantly executed. While I predicted the connection between Michael and the other characters, it was still handled effectively. However, I was disappointed that Ryan didn’t pursue a relationship with Alison after everything he went through to find her.",
            "In Parts 2 and 3, some suspension of disbelief is necessary, particularly regarding the characters' ability to track individuals across vast countries or cities with minimal clues. At times, this aspect felt rather exaggerated.",
            "The story embodied significant emotional depth, especially through the mobster character. Although he met a deserved end, I still felt a pang of sadness for him and wished that he and his grandson could have enjoyed a serene life together."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a highly engaging and twisty novel that kept me guessing until the end. While some parts required suspension of disbelief, the well-crafted plot, surprising twists, and emotional depth made it a memorable read. It has the potential to be a huge hit, especially as a Netflix adaptation.",

It was hard to see how everything would tie together until the last chapter, which delivered a satisfying and well-written twist.  \n   - The timelines were jumbled in a way that kept me guessing, and I loved how they eventually came together.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - I initially thought Taylor was like a little sister, but the revelation about her true identity (Alison) in the last chapter of Part 1 was a brilliant twist.  \n   - The connection between Michael and the other characters was something I saw coming, but it was executed well.  \n   - I was disappointed that Ryan didn’t try to get together with Alison after everything he went through to find her.  \n\n- **World-Building and Realism:**  \n   - Part 2 and Part 3 required some suspension of disbelief, especially with the characters being able to track people down in large countries or cities with very little to go on. It felt a bit of a stretch at times.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement and Themes:**  \n   - The story had a lot of emotional depth, particularly with the mobster character. While he deserved his fate, I couldn’t help but feel sad for him and wish he and his grandson could have lived out their days peacefully.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Adaptability:**  \n   - The novel gave me strong Harlan Coben vibes, and I could easily see it being adapted into a successful Netflix show.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a highly engaging and twisty novel that kept me guessing until the end.

            "The first 5-10% of the book felt slow, bogged down by too many perspectives and seemingly unrelated storylines, which made it difficult to connect with any particular character. However, the pacing picked up significantly after the initial chapters, transforming the narrative into a fast-paced and exciting read. Although the multiple perspectives were initially overwhelming, each character's active role justified their inclusion. \n\nThe ending was realistic and fitting for the characters, with Ryan's conclusion being particularly satisfying. While the resolution was well-executed, some characters, like Poppy, could have benefited from more emotional depth in their arcs. The plot, although over-the-top and sometimes unrealistic, offered a delightful escape, enhanced by its international settings and time jumps. The twists were effective and well-crafted, culminating in a truly surprising moment when the characters' connections were revealed. The mystery itself was thoughtfully constructed, featuring cleverly placed Easter eggs that made the eventual reveals rewarding.",

The female characters, in particular, were well-crafted and stood out as a highlight.

Poppy and Ryan were memorable, though Poppy's emotional journey following her experiences felt somewhat rushed.",

It's not too far from where I live.  \n   - It's rare that Missouri and Kansas are used as locations, so when an author uses them, it always interests me and makes me want to keep reading.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and POVs:**  \n   - The story is told from different points of view (POVs), and as it progresses, we slowly find out how they are all intertwined.  \n   - The author did a good job at getting each character's story to become one. I was never confused, which can sometimes happen with multiple POVs or storylines.  \n   - He kept everything going and made sense of the connections, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Predictability:**  \n   - I did predict the twists, but only a few pages before they were revealed.  \n   - In some thrillers, I’ve figured out the twist way too early, which can be disappointing. The fact that I didn’t predict the twists early on in this book was a plus for me.  \n\n- **Overall Impression and Recommendation:**  \n   - Overall, I thought this was a really good book. I don’t want to say much else to avoid spoilers, but I really enjoyed it a lot.  \n   - I enjoyed it so much that I’m going to check out his other books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a highly enjoyable read with a compelling narrative structure, well-developed characters, and a setting that resonated with me personally. The twists were satisfyingly timed, and the author’s writing style kept me engaged throughout. I highly recommend it and look forward to exploring more of Alex Finlay’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel showcases the author's trademark fast-paced style, employing multiple character perspectives across interwoven timelines. While this technique keeps the narrative engaging, it sometimes detracts from the overall experience, leaving me yearning for a deeper exploration of certain events and characters. The story centers on the kidnapping of Alison Lane and the lingering suspicion surrounding her boyfriend, Ryan Richardson, who changes his identity to evade public scrutiny. The tension escalates when Ryan, now a law student in Italy, encounters one of the kidnappers and discovers Alison's car submerged in a lake, alongside two dead men and a cryptic note in her handwriting. The central theme of uncovering the truth about that fateful night is compelling but perilous.",

Despite some repetitive chapter endings and a minor issue with the epilogue, I highly recommend it for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Alison Lane and Ryan Richardson, a couple attacked on “Lover’s Lane.” Amidst the chaos, Ali is abducted, leaving Ryan under a cloud of suspicion. Five years later, Ali's submerged car is discovered, containing two dead men and a cryptic note from her. This note includes a “book cipher” that Ryan may be able to decode. The narrative alternates between Ryan, Poppy McGee (the new Deputy Sheriff), and Shane O’Leary (a hitman from Philadelphia), whose paths intersect later in the book. I found the first half, focusing on the mystery and character development, more enjoyable than the second half, which shifts to assassins and international chases. Despite requiring some suspension of disbelief, the pacing kept me engaged, and I eagerly picked it up whenever possible. The conclusion is fitting and realistic, tying up the story satisfactorily.",

            "This novel opens with a gripping premise: a law student in Italy encounters a man from his nightmares—one with missing pinkies—who is linked to the long-unsolved disappearance of his high school girlfriend, Ali. Alex, the student, was once accused of her murder. The plot thickens with additional storylines that aren't highlighted in the summary: \n\n- Poppy, a new Leavenworth Deputy Sheriff managing the tipline after Ali’s car is discovered.  \n- Jane, a former FBI agent who believes the Sheriff is concealing vital information about the case.  \n- Shane, a Philadelphia mobster dealing with his son Anthony's bullying at a new private school.\n\nThe narrative shifts between these three perspectives, with interludes featuring Shane's accountant, Michael. The pacing is exhilarating—fast and action-packed. Although I had a hunch about what happened to Ali, Ryan, and Anthony early on, the plot masterfully weaves in red herrings, keeping me guessing. By the halfway mark, my suspicions were all over the place, and connecting the dots became a challenge. As the storylines converge in the second half, it culminates in a shocking and explosive finale.",

While some parts were confusing due to unreliable narration, the fast pacing, well-developed main characters, and excellent audiobook narration made for an engaging read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author Familiarity and Expectations:**  \n   - This is only the second book I’ve read by Alex Finlay. I really enjoyed *Every Last Fear*, so when this one became available, I knew I wanted to check it out.  \n\n- **Plot Summary and Structure:**  \n   - The book summary introduces how the story starts: Alex, a law school student, is in Italy on a school break when he spots a man he’s been seeing in his nightmares for the past five years—a man with missing pinkies on both hands. This man is connected to the disappearance of his high school girlfriend, Ali, for which Alex was accused of murder.  \n   - The summary doesn’t mention the other storylines:  \n     - Poppy, a new Leavenworth Deputy Sheriff, assigned to man the tipline after Ali’s car is found.  \n     - Jane, a former FBI agent who worked Ali’s case and believes the Sheriff is hiding something.  \n     - Shane, a Philadelphia mobster whose son, Anthony, is being bullied at his new private school.  \n   - The story flips between these three storylines, with additional chapters from Shane’s accountant, Michael.  \n\n- **Pacing and Suspense:**  \n   - The pacing was great—fast-paced and action-packed.  \n   - Early on, I suspected what might have happened to Ali, Ryan, and Anthony, but the story kept me guessing with red herrings. By the halfway point, my suspicions were all over the place, and I struggled to connect the dots.  \n   - The storylines begin to merge deep into the second half, leading to an explosive and shocking finale.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The main characters were well-developed, though I wished a couple of the ensemble characters had more depth. However, I understand that too much development might have given away some of the twists.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - I alternated between the ebook and audiobook. The narrators—Helen Laser, John Pirhalla, and Paul Dateh—were excellent and added to the thrills and suspense of the story.  \n\n- **Confusion and Unreliable Narration:**  \n   - The storyline was confusing in some parts, likely due to unreliable narration, but the ending tied everything together well.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Rating:**  \n   - The finale was explosive and shocking, just as I expected from Finlay.  \n   - I’m giving this an overall rating of 4.1, rounding down to 4 stars.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAlex Finlay delivers another gripping thriller with multiple interconnected storylines, red herrings, and a shocking finale. While some parts were confusing due to unreliable narration, the fast pacing, well-developed main characters, and excellent audiobook narration made for an engaging read. Fans of *Every Last Fear* will not be disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: 4.1 (rounded down to 4 stars).  \n\n*Thank you to NetGalley, St. Martin’s Press, and Macmillan Audio for providing this eARC in exchange for my honest review.*  \n#NetGalley #StMartinsPress #MacmillanAudio #IfSomethingHappenstoMe"

            "I enjoy mystery/thrillers that unravel old crimes or secrets long after they occurred. This story spans a decade and features intriguing twists, especially enhanced by its skewed timelines. However, some plot points felt overly convenient—like a character miraculously producing solutions while on the run—which strained credibility. Additionally, the near 60-day gap between reading the first 70% and the conclusion dampened the thriller’s intensity, compounded by my poor timing in starting the book just three days before it was due back.

This one spans about 10 years, and the twists and turns were pretty good.  \n   - The skewed timelines made some of the reveals even better.  \n   - However, the convenience of certain plot points (e.g., rabbits being pulled out of a character’s top hat while on the run) felt far-fetched and preposterous, pushing the story into the realm of \"isn’t that convenient?\"  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The author may have traded shallow characterization for the thrills, but that worked for the most part.  \n\n- **Pacing and Timing:**  \n   - A near 60-day wait between reading the first 70% and the ending killed some of the thriller vibes.  \n   - My bad timing (starting the book three days before it was due back) also affected my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - Despite the criticisms, the ending was pretty good, and justice was served.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Future Interest:**  \n   - I will definitely read another Alex Finlay book, as I enjoyed the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its flaws, particularly in terms of convenient plot points and pacing issues due to my reading schedule, it delivered a satisfying mystery with clever twists and a good ending. Despite some preposterous moments, I found it enjoyable and would read more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 (lost a star for far-fetched plot conveniences and half a star for pacing/timing issues)."

            "The story follows Ryan and Alison, young lovers whose lives are upended when Alison vanishes after a traumatic incident. Five years later, her car is discovered containing two dead men and her purse, but Alison’s body remains missing. Determined to uncover the truth and clear his name, Ryan embarks on an investigation into her disappearance. The premise is intriguing, supported by a solid storyline and strong writing. However, the plot suffers from a lack of cohesion due to frequent shifts between various subplots in Philadelphia and France. Although everything eventually connects, the resolution feels forced. The narrative lacks flow, with abrupt transitions that disrupt its momentum and make it challenging to remain engaged.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story begins with a tragic event—Ali being taken from Ryan at Lovers' Lane—and picks up five years later, with Ryan having changed his name due to rumors of his guilt. The narrative follows three seemingly unrelated characters: Ryan, Poppy McGee (a small-town deputy sheriff), and Shane O’Leary (a Philly mobster). The connection between these characters remains unclear for a significant portion of the book, which kept me intrigued and compelled to keep reading. When their stories finally intersect, the pacing picks up, and the book becomes hard to put down. The twists were well-executed, and the plot was engaging overall.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While the plot was interesting, I never fully connected with the characters. Something about them felt flat, and I didn’t feel as invested in their journeys as I had hoped. This lack of emotional connection impacted my overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n  I went into the book expecting more of a thriller, but it leaned more toward a crime drama. While it was entertaining, it wasn’t the right fit for my current reading mood. Fans of crime novels involving mobsters or readers who enjoy Finlay’s previous works might find this to be a quick, enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had an intriguing plot with well-timed twists and a compelling pace, especially as the characters’ stories began to intertwine. However, the lack of emotional connection to the characters and the genre mismatch with my expectations left me feeling somewhat underwhelmed.

            "The book, while short—a quality I appreciated—felt drawn out due to its repetitive elements. As a crime thriller, it fell short, lacking a true sense of mystery. The plot often rehashed the same events, such as Anthony's death, wearing thin the narrative's intrigue. The resolution came across as overly simplistic, with Ryan conveniently locating key characters like Alison and the eight-fingered man with little effort. Additionally, several plot points strained credulity, such as the sheriff's awareness of foul play despite the bodies being submerged for years. The portrayal of the Irish mobster felt outdated, reminiscent of a 1940s or 50s setting. The inclusion of an 8-year-old genius solving cold cases and starting a podcast stretched believability to its limits.",
            "In the book, the children often behaved like adults, which felt unrealistic and detracted from their authenticity. Poppy, in particular, was a frustrating character who was slow to grasp the unfolding events. Additionally, the multiple perspectives were overwhelming and took away from the overall experience.",
            "The author's writing style is commendable, showcasing a talent for crafting well-structured sentences. However, the story ultimately feels dull and lacking in depth and complexity.",

            "The story suffers from a lack of cohesion and engagement, largely due to its three divergent points of view. A more compelling narrative would have emerged from focusing solely on the female deputy's perspective as she navigates the case. Centered around a missing teenage girl, the plot introduces her high school boyfriend, accused of her murder, and a mysterious figure with missing fingers. However, the narrative frequently shifts timelines and locations, even transporting the boyfriend to Italy, where he faces the enigmatic man. The connection between the missing girl and a mafia family's son, who ultimately takes his own life, feels overly complicated and unnecessary. Additionally, the pacing is sluggish, with crucial details about both the girl and the mafia son's death being revealed in a laborious manner. The resolution arrives abruptly and lacks emotional impact, merely suggesting that \"things work out\" without offering clarity or satisfying closure.",
            "The female deputy sheriff is a compelling character; however, her involvement in the case feels forced and convenient. The boyfriend is underdeveloped, with actions like deciphering a coded note and traveling across Europe lacking depth and believability.

While it was a quick read, the writing style, plot, and characterization were major letdowns. The over-explanation, shallow characters, and irrelevant tangents made it difficult to enjoy. The book's attempt to address social and cultural issues felt forced and detracted from the story.

            "The plot is overly complex, making it necessary to use a spreadsheet to track characters and events. With too many points of view and settings, the story never comes together cohesively. It takes me through various locations across Europe without a clear purpose. The book lacks suspense, and the outcome is predictable from the start. There is also an abundance of extraneous information that fails to advance the plot, along with frustratingly repetitive explanations of the same events. Overall, the pacing feels slow and weighed down by irrelevant details.",

Additionally, the use of multiple names for characters creates unnecessary confusion without clear context. As a result, I found it difficult to connect with or invest in any of the characters.",
            "The book's description was misleading, touting a thrilling, fast-paced narrative with multiple viewpoints and settings. However, the actual emphasis on organized crime and the mobster's tragedy should have been more clearly stated. The initial excitement sparked by the description soon dissipated due to the book's execution."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Complexity and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The novel is a complex and intricate mobster story that delves into the murky world of organized crime. It features a wide array of characters and intertwining timelines, offering a detailed and multifaceted narrative. While this adds depth to the story, it also makes it challenging to follow at times.  \n\n- **Character Development and Moral Ambiguity:**  \n  The large cast of characters and the blurred moral lines between protagonists and antagonists made it difficult to discern who to root for or connect with on a deeper level. This ambiguity, while adding to the story's complexity, hindered my ability to fully engage with the characters.  \n\n- **Audiobook Production and Narration:**  \n  The audiobook version presented some challenges. Some characters were voiced similarly, leading to occasional confusion about who was speaking. The use of both a male and female narrator added variety but sometimes disrupted the continuity of character voices established earlier in the story.  \n\n- **Appeal to Target Audience:**  \n  Despite the challenges, the book's intricate plot and detailed exploration of the mobster world will likely appeal to readers who enjoy richly woven narratives and morally complex characters. The audiobook format, while not without its hurdles, offers a unique dimension to the storytelling that some listeners may appreciate.  \n\n- **Personal Suitability:**  \n  Ultimately, this book wasn't quite suited for my demographic, but it has qualities that will resonate with fans of complex crime stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"If Something Happens To Me\" is a richly detailed and morally complex mobster story that will appeal to fans of intricate crime narratives. While the audiobook format and large cast of characters presented some challenges, the novel's depth and complexity make it a compelling read for its target audience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story began with great potential but ultimately fell short of my expectations. The pivotal moment was when Allison escaped after dragging Anthony to the room where he had been brutally bullied, which led to his tragic suicide. I anticipated a gripping revenge plot, but instead, the narrative became predictable, dampening my hopes for suspense and excitement.",
            "Allison, the central character, is uninteresting and lacks depth. Her redemption arc feels insignificant, and her confused nature renders her unlikable. Supporting characters like Dash, Poppy, and O are one-dimensional, serving merely as pawns in the story without making meaningful contributions.",

            "I found the mobster elements unappealing. I'm not a fan of gangster or mafia storylines; they feel outdated and tedious. I came for a tale about a man framed for murder after his girlfriend's kidnapping, not more mob drama. Please keep the focus away from that."
