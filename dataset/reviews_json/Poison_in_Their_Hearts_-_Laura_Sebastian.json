            "The pacing of *Stardust* and *Poison* is excruciatingly slow, with each book exceeding 500 pages. I had hoped *Poison* would quicken the tempo, but it felt even more sluggish than its predecessor. For most of the narrative, very little occurs, and the climactic showdown arrives abruptly in the final chapters, only to be over in an instant. The resolution feels rushed and leaves me unsatisfied, as the plot remains stagnant for much of the story, lacking action and progression. Ultimately, I didn’t feel rewarded for the time I invested in reading.",
            "I was disappointed by the lack of character growth, particularly for Daphne and Beatriz. After being apart for three books and losing their sister, I anticipated a reunion filled with emotional depth and meaningful interactions. Instead, their reunion felt underwhelming and barely impactful. The romance and relationships throughout the story also felt underdeveloped. I craved more significant moments between Daphne and Beatriz, as well as stronger connections with the supporting characters. Overall, these elements were lacking and detracted from the story's impact."

            "The story was compelling, featuring intricate plotting and unexpected betrayals that kept me thoroughly engaged. The main villain consistently appeared several steps ahead, making the challenges feel genuinely insurmountable. However, the ending fell flat, particularly with the implausible scenario of the sun going dark for two days and everything returning to normal.",
            "Daphne emerged as a standout character, particularly in her efforts to outsmart her mother. The intense scene where her mother compelled her to witness the poisoning was especially gripping. While Beatriz was my favorite character, her return to Cellaria lacked the excitement I had hoped for. I appreciated her portrayal of the saintly role, but her interactions with Giselle, Nicolo, and Enzo felt drawn out. Violie's character arc was decent, but I found her quick romance with Leopold after Sophie’s death unconvincing. A slower build-up or a strong friendship would have been more satisfying.",
            "The story's suspension of disbelief faltered when the sun went dark for two days without any catastrophic consequences, which felt implausible. Additionally, the unresolved issue of the Stardust vials represented a missed opportunity for deeper exploration.",
            "The story explores intriguing themes, particularly the hypocrisy surrounding King Cesare's tantrums being tolerated while Giselle's manipulations are labeled as hysterical. This contrast is a compelling aspect of the narrative. Although the idea that magic carries consequences is introduced, the resolution—where Sophie replaces Beatriz and becomes the sun—feels like a missed opportunity, undermining the potential for a more bittersweet ending.",
            "The emotionally charged moments, particularly Daphne’s confrontation with her mother, were executed effectively. However, the story missed an opportunity for a more impactful ending; Beatriz’s death could have added a bittersweet layer to the narrative."

Its uneven pacing led to a prolonged wait for the final showdown, diminishing the buildup's intensity.

It feels like the series could continue, and I remain invested in the universe.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The plot is rich and complex, brimming with political intrigue, which is commendable. However, the unresolved frivol rebellion fiasco was disappointing. The finale felt rushed, leaving character arcs incomplete; an epilogue showcasing the characters' futures would have offered better closure. While the story began strong, it concluded with an unsatisfying whimper. Additionally, Sophie's death served as a plot catalyst, which felt unjust given her potential for growth.",
            "The plot overshadowed the characters, resulting in underdeveloped individual arcs. Bairre's character was inconsistent and did not meet initial expectations. Most relationships, both platonic and romantic, fell flat, with the exceptions of Beatriz/Pas and Daphne/Bairre. The dynamics of Cliona/Daphne and Beatriz/Nico were particularly disappointing, as Nico failed to meet expectations. Despite being a central character who experienced significant betrayal, Beatriz lacked closure in her personal life. Violie's character grew on the reader, but her arc felt incomplete and lacked depth. Although Daphne's arc was the most resolved, it still felt minimal and unsatisfying, especially concerning her role as a double agent in Friv."

        "conclusion": "This trilogy excels in delivering a complex and engaging political drama, but it falls short in character development and resolution. While the plot is intricate and filled with scheming, the characters and their relationships often feel neglected. The ending, though rushed, still leaves room for imagination. Despite its flaws, it was enjoyable, earning a final rating of 3.75 stars.",

The extensive buildup of recruiting armies and earning trust seemed wasted, as there were no battle scenes, and the climax—defeating the mother with a dagger—was underwhelming and anticlimactic. The final confrontation lacked satisfaction, as a simple solution like stabbing her could have been executed much earlier. However, Daphne's poignant moment of telling her mother she would never think of her again before killing her was deeply satisfying and reminiscent of a similar scene in *Ever After* (1998).",

            "This story centers on Daphne, Beatriz, and Violie as they confront Empress Margaraux in a climactic showdown. The narrative style remains consistent with previous installments, which I appreciated. I particularly liked the focus on quiet, desperate moments rather than grand battles, as illustrated by Beatriz’s reflection: “It strikes her as almost funny that the fates of countries aren’t always decided on the battlefields or in throne rooms, but in quiet hallways like this, between desperate women with everything to lose.” However, the slow passage of time felt disorienting; I initially thought years had elapsed when it was only a few months, making character reunions seem awkward. The ending felt rushed, leading me to believe there might be a fourth book. Additionally, the final confrontation with Empress Margaraux could have been more fully developed.",
            "Empress Margaraux's characterization felt inconsistent; while depicted as a cunning old woman, she is only slightly older than the sisters. Her villainous actions are evident, but the story would benefit from more depth, potentially through chapters focusing on her perspective. In contrast, the distinct personalities and behaviors of Daphne, Beatriz, and Violie added enjoyment to the narrative. Beatriz’s line, “I would just do what I wanted–become who I want to be.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Anticipation and Series Context:**  \n   - I’ve been eagerly waiting for *Poison in Their Hearts* since finishing *Stardust in Their Veins*.  \n   - It’s rare to find a political fantasy series with mostly female leads and minimal romance, which made this series stand out for me.  \n\n- **Plot and Story Structure:**  \n   - The story focuses on Daphne, Beatriz, and Violie in their final showdown with Empress Margaraux.  \n   - The narrative format and writing style remain consistent with the previous books.  \n   - I appreciated the emphasis on quiet, desperate moments over grand battles, as highlighted by Beatriz’s reflection: “It strikes her as almost funny that the fates of countries aren’t always decided on the battlefields or in throne rooms, but in quiet hallways like this, between desperate women with everything to lose.”  \n\n- **Pacing and Timeline:**  \n   - The slow passage of time within the story felt jarring. I thought years had passed, but it was only a few months, which made character reunions feel odd.  \n\n- **Character Development (Empress Margaraux):**  \n   - Empress Margaraux’s characterization was confusing. She’s portrayed as a shrewd old woman, but she’s only slightly older than the sisters.  \n   - While her actions are clearly villainous, I felt the author could have fleshed her out more, perhaps with dedicated chapters to her perspective.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Political Focus:**  \n   - The focus on character conversations and dialogue made the series feel more political than typical YA fantasy.  \n   - The minimal romance was consistent with the previous books and worked well for the story.  \n\n- **Sister Dynamics and Characterization:**  \n   - The distinct behaviors, attitudes, and personalities of Daphne, Beatriz, and Violie made the series enjoyable.  \n   - Beatriz’s line, “I would just do what I wanted–become who I want to be. Isn’t that what anyone wants from life?” resonated with me.  \n\n- **Ending and Final Showdown:**  \n   - The ending felt rushed, and I initially thought there would be a fourth book.  \n   - The final showdown with Empress Margaraux could have been more developed.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Stories:**  \n   - I might return to this universe if the author explores new characters set in a future after Beatriz and Daphne’s rule.  \n   - The world-building, with Bessemia, Cellaria, Temarin, and Friv, leaves room for many possibilities.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I was satisfied with *Poison in Their Hearts* as the conclusion to the *Castle in Their Bones* trilogy. While it had some pacing issues and underdeveloped elements, the strong focus on political intrigue, minimal romance, and well-defined sister dynamics made it a memorable read. The ending felt a bit rushed, but the series as a whole was enjoyable, and I’d consider revisiting this world if the author expands on it in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This made it easy to dive back into the story without feeling lost.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n   - I thoroughly enjoyed rediscovering the characters, whether it was the princesses or those around them.

The sisterly bond at the core of the story was particularly well-executed and surrounded by equally captivating dynamics.  \n\n- **Critique of Simplifications and Ending:**  \n   - As a YA novel, there were some simplifications in the plot, and the ending felt a bit disappointing. However, these minor flaws didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - I didn’t feel bored even once, and the book brought me immense happiness. This universe is highly underrated, and I wholeheartedly encourage others to discover it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a few minor flaws, *Castles in their Bones* delivered a captivating and cohesive story with well-developed characters and strong relationships.

            "The three POVs in the first book worked well as we followed the sisters, but I found Violie's perspective less engaging. While I understand the need for three viewpoints to represent the three kingdoms, I believe Leopold would have offered a more compelling male perspective. I really enjoyed Beatriz, Daphne, Bairre, Gisella, and Cliona, with Daphne and Bairre standing out as my favorites. I wish we had delved deeper into their relationships, particularly the dynamic between Daphne and Bairre.

However, in this book, the author completely butchered his character to the point of him being unrecognizable and frankly, giving me the ick.\n   - All could have been saved if it was her plan to have Beatriz and Gisella be endgame all along (we want a Sapphic betrayal-redemption plot even more), but no. The tension was there but it went nowhere.\n   - I'm not even going to talk about the 3rd pairing because it sucks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe book was a letdown, especially as a finale.

I also find myself feeling a bit too old for her books, which may reflect a shift in my personal preferences rather than a flaw in her storytelling.

With minimal dialogue, he primarily served as emotional support for Daphne, which was disappointing."

While I enjoy this style, I expected more growth from her as an author by now. Additionally, I’m starting to feel too old for her books, which might indicate a shift in my preferences rather than a flaw in her writing.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  The book was a smooth and fast read, which I appreciated.

In many scenes, it seemed like even the characters around him forgot he existed. He had minimal dialogue and primarily served as emotional support for Daphne, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  I was particularly invested in the potential romance between Nico and Beatriz, as they had great chemistry and could have added depth to the story. However, their relationship didn’t get the attention it deserved. On the other hand, Violie and Leo’s romance felt underdeveloped and lacked screen time. Their chapters were my least favorite, and I found myself disinterested whenever their POV came up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book mostly lived up to my expectations and was an enjoyable, fast-paced read, it fell short in certain areas.

The story wrapped up in a satisfying way, and there were quite a few emotional scenes that added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  This is very much a YA book, so a lot of what happened was predictable. However, this predictability did not take away from my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The book excelled in exploring sister bonds, enemies-to-lovers romance, and political intrigue. If you enjoy these elements, this is a series you should definitely pick up.  \n\n- **Series Consistency:**  \n  I really enjoyed book 1, but book 2 fell flat for me. This book, however, was a pleasant surprise and brought the series back to a level I appreciated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a satisfying conclusion to the series, with emotional payoffs and engaging themes. Despite its predictability, it remained enjoyable and delivered on the elements I love in YA fiction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There were moments when it seemed like a lot was happening, yet ultimately, nothing significant occurred, which detracted from the overall momentum.",

The reunion between Beatriz and Daphne felt emotionally hollow and like a mere fleeting moment.

However, the constant shifting loyalties of secondary characters, particularly on Daphne's side, became tiresome and difficult to engage with.",
