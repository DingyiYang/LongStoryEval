Her resilience shines through—after being dumped in the previous book, she takes charge of her life by traveling to Paris alone and savoring exquisite red wine. Gabriel's character introduces depth to the narrative, as his darker backstory contrasts beautifully with Jess's sweetness. Their relationship evolves satisfyingly, illustrating how two genuinely good, yet wounded individuals can find solace in each other. Additionally, Gabriel's sister, Elodie, stands out with her candid nature, infusing the story with levity and humor.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Context and Standalone Potential:**  \n   - This novella is a spin-off from \"The Photographers Trilogy.\" While it doesn’t feature cameos from the main characters of the first two books, it’s not entirely a standalone read. I recommend reading \"Shooters\" and \"Chasing the Light\" first, as they provide context and are enjoyable, smart reads.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story follows Jess, who, after being dumped by Krish in \"Chasing the Light,\" decides to extend her Paris trip. There, she meets Gabriel, a charming Frenchman living in the same building. The setting in Paris adds a romantic and vibrant backdrop to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Jess transforms from a rule-following, risk-averse side character in \"Chasing the Light\" to a bold, adventurous protagonist. Her personal growth is central to the romance, as she steps out of her comfort zone with Gabriel’s encouragement.  \n   - Gabriel is a compelling love interest with his own depth, including a grumpy demeanor, an age gap dynamic, and PTSD representation.  \n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**  \n   - The romance between Jess and Gabriel is electric and heartwarming. Their connection is built on mutual growth and understanding, making their happily-ever-after (HEA) deeply satisfying. The dual POV adds depth to their relationship.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - The first few chapters felt reminiscent of \"Emily in Paris,\" with Jess being a bit intoxicated and silly. However, the story quickly picks up pace as Jess and Gabriel’s relationship develops, becoming utterly engrossing.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - This was a delightful, feel-good read—perfect for a beach day or a cozy escape. The series continues to improve, and I’m thrilled to have gotten to know Jess better. Gabriel’s story and their HEA left me giddy and eager for more (I’m already craving a second epilogue!).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Chasing the Light\" spin-off is a charming, character-driven romance set in the enchanting city of Paris. Jess’s personal growth and her chemistry with Gabriel make this a standout read. While it’s best enjoyed after reading the first two books in the series, it’s a rewarding addition that leaves you smiling and wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars."
