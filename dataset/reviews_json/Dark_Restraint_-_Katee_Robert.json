            "The story captivates with its twists and turns, blending romance, political intrigue, and Greek mythology into a rich narrative. Brief insights into other characters further enhance its depth, keeping me thoroughly engaged.",
            "Ariadne, a princess confined to her tower for most of her life, finally escapes into a treacherous world of politics. The Minotaur, tasked with her assassination, secretly harbors a lifelong love for her. This stark contrast between his tenderness toward Ariadne and his brutality toward others creates a captivating dynamic. Their journey—navigating sexual tension and exploring their feelings—drives the story forward. While the romance has a slightly stalkerish quality, it enhances the intensity of their relationship as they grapple with what they are willing to risk for happiness.",
            "This dark romance weaves in elements of Greek mythology, centered around a morality chain, a childhood crush, and the recurring theme of \"it's always been you.\" The narrative unfolds with political intrigue and highlights a single act of kindness that fuels the protagonist's obsession."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This is the darkest romance so far, blending intense romantic tension with political intrigue and Greek mythology. The dynamic between Araidne and the Minotaur, with its mix of softness and violence, is particularly captivating. The story’s twists and turns, along with the exploration of their relationship, make it a compelling read.",

            "The political tension in Olympus is palpable, heightening my curiosity about the developments in book eight. However, the focus on secondary characters like Ariadne and the Minotaur felt somewhat out of place, as they are not central to the main narrative.",
            "Ariadne's character development in book six added depth to her, making her even more engaging. It was enjoyable to immerse ourselves in her perspective. The Minotaur's point of view, however, did little to alter my negative impressions of him, as he has consistently been a nuisance. Still, I appreciated how he embodied the \"beast to sweetheart\" trope for Ariadne. Their love story is possessive, long-building, and undeniably steamy. Though the spice level remained consistent, the intimate scenes felt somewhat vanilla compared to others."

His willingness to go to extreme lengths to protect her, even against her father’s wishes, made me feral for him.  \n   - The raw, overwhelming love between the characters, where they can’t control their actions when together, is incredibly sexy and compelling.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity and World-Building:**  \n   - The intricate dynamics between the Thirteen and Olympus itself are fascinating and leave me craving more from this series.  \n\n- **Quotes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The quotes, such as “You’ve been mine from the moment I saw you” and “I’ll claim this püşșy, claim you, where everyone can see it,” highlight the intensity and passion of the relationship.  \n   - The emotional depth of the Minotaur’s love for Ariadne, described as pulling his heart out with her bare hands, adds a layer of vulnerability and strength to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a dark, spicy, and addictive addition to the Dark Olympus series. The intense romance, complex characters, and intricate world-building left me utterly captivated. I’m already eager for more stories in this universe.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Hermes stood out as a favorite of mine, and this book made her even more formidable. However, I'm still curious about her ultimate goals. Dionysus also captured my attention—I admired how he sought to protect Ariadne when no one else did, adding complexity to his character. \n\nAsterion's backstory was a highlight; it was refreshing to see him evolve beyond his previous depiction as a brute. His redemption arc was well-executed and satisfying. The romance between Ariadne and Asterion was well-developed, adding emotional depth to the story. However, I was disappointed that Dionysus, Ariadne, and the Minotaur didn't become an endgame throuple, as that dynamic could have added an intriguing twist.\n\nAriadne's passivity was a drawback for me. While she demonstrated her hacker skills a few times, these moments lacked a significant impact on the story's outcome. Similarly, I found Icarus lacking; he came across as whiny and passive.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The book is set in an alternative world where Olympus is a city-state ruled by avatars of Greek gods, such as Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. The Underworld is separated from the main city by the River Styx, adding depth to the setting. While it’s helpful to start the series from the beginning, each book can be read as a stand-alone.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  This installment is the darkest in the series so far. It follows Ariadne, who is on the run from her father, Minos, and his top enforcer/assassin, Asterion (The Minotaur). Asterion is a brutal character who leaves destruction in his wake, but his bond with Ariadne is complex and includes a brief, intense sexual encounter in the labyrinth on Minos' estate. Their relationship may not lead to a happily ever after (HEA) but could result in a happy-for-now (HFN) if they survive.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ariadne and Asterion are compelling characters with a deep, complicated connection. Asterion’s ruthless nature contrasts with the emotional and physical bond he shares with Ariadne, making their dynamic intriguing.  \n\n- **Romantic and Erotic Elements:**  \n  The book delivers steamy, erotic scenes, consistent with the series' tone. It explores themes like polyamory, non-binary relationships, plus-size heroines, and D/S dynamics, catering to fans of diverse and inclusive erotic romance.  \n\n- **Series Appeal:**  \n  I’ve grown to love this series for its rich world-building, engaging storyline, and the hot, steamy scenes. Fans of erotic romance with diverse characters and themes should definitely check out Katee Roberts' novels, especially this series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a dark, steamy addition to the series, with compelling characters, intricate world-building, and a gripping storyline. While it may not offer a traditional happily ever after, it provides a satisfying and intense journey for fans of erotic romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She didn’t just sit around waiting for someone to help her; she actively made deals and used her hacking skills to ensure her own safety.  \n\n- **Plot and Relationships:**  \n  - I feel like Asterion and Ariadne could have been friends with the Olympians if it hadn’t been for Minos and the nefarious plans of Circe and Minos that brought them there in the first place.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Books:**  \n  - I can’t wait for the next book, which, from the epilogue, seems like it could be Poseidon’s book. I’ve already preordered a physical copy of this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was another hit for Katee Robert!

Key elements include dual perspectives, an unexpected pregnancy, an arranged marriage, and a captivating dystopian backdrop. As Ariadne flees her father for sanctuary with Hades and Eurydice, Asterion is determined to win her back, even as she is promised to Dionysus. Their journey becomes a battle of love amid war and political intrigue as they strive to survive and escape the city.",

Hermes shines as a standout character, taking on a pivotal role in saving the day. Meanwhile, Icarus’s subplot—focused on his feelings of inadequacy and his exploitative relationships for information and blackmail—adds complexity to his character. The epilogue with Icarus and Poseidon builds excitement for the next installment.",

Additional chapters focusing on both characters' emotional growth would have enriched the narrative.

Although the book is shorter than anticipated—just under 300 pages—the pacing complements the dynamic between Ariadne and Asterion. The narrative is well-crafted, blending intrigue, casual murder, and the deterioration of power dynamics.",
            "Ariadne and Asterion’s relationship is thoughtfully developed, marked by a long history and genuine mutual feelings that avoid the pitfalls of insta-love. Asterion, while possessive, is also protective, and his love for Ariadne is both sincere and reciprocated. Ariadne, portrayed as a plus-sized virgin with agency, offers a refreshing and well-handled representation. Asterion’s backstory as an abuse survivor adds emotional depth to both his character and their relationship.\n\nThe dynamic between Ariadne and her brother, Icarus, is heartfelt, enhancing the story's emotional stakes. The romance is steamy and well-executed, characterized by clear consent and a compelling mix of danger and desire. Their first sexual encounter, along with subsequent scenes, is charged with emotion, highlighting both characters' virginity in different ways. Asterion’s admiration for Ariadne’s curves and his attentiveness to her needs create a satisfying and sexy dynamic. The inclusion of birth control and protection is a thoughtful detail that adds realism.\n\nDionysus stands out as a character, providing humor and intelligence while being protective of Ariadne. Hera’s scheming and cold-blooded nature set the stage for intriguing future conflicts, particularly regarding her pregnancy and plans against Zeus. Hermes’ morally ambiguous actions and enigmatic motives enrich the narrative and hint at future developments. Minos’ death is a satisfying resolution, given his abusive and power-hungry nature, and Ariadne’s involvement in it is empowering.\n\nAriadne’s plus-sized representation is authentic, addressing her body’s realities without glossing over them. The handling of her abortion is respectful and integral to her character arc, free from guilt or regret. Asterion’s exploration of trauma and his journey to reclaim his body and choices add significant emotional weight. Finally, the setup for a queer romance between Icarus and Poseidon in the next book is exciting and well-foreshadowed.",

While some repetitive phrases, such as “that’s a joke” and “if I were a better man,” can be a bit annoying, they don't significantly detract from the overall experience. The world-building and overarching plot are exceptional, making this installment feel like a true return to form."

While it’s shorter than expected, the pacing and character dynamics work well, and the stakes feel real. The spice is hot, the humor is on point, and the setup for future books is exciting. Despite some minor writing quirks, this entry delivers a satisfying and thrilling read.",

            "This installment takes a slower, more focused approach, centering on the couple and their relationship, a change in pacing that I appreciated. The significant political maneuvering woven throughout enhances the buildup to the conclusion, leaving me eager to see how the storyline unfolds.",

            "The book employs several compelling tropes, including taboo (foster siblings), forbidden romance, an unconventional arranged marriage, virginity, possessiveness, and the “good girl” archetype. I particularly appreciated the fresh take on the arranged marriage and the dynamic between Ariadne and her husband (who is not the Minotaur). However, I felt that the exploration of the taboo element could have been more nuanced.",

The romance felt rushed and lacked depth; despite the characters’ shared history, their relationship was underdeveloped and came across as superficial. They seemed one-dimensional, adding little to the story.

It had the potential to be a compelling slow-burn with more angst, but it felt rushed, prioritizing quick smut scenes over meaningful connection—something I'm growing weary of. On a more positive note, I appreciated the distinct character chapters. The author successfully gives each character their own voice, ensuring they stand out rather than blend together.",

The characters lacked depth, and their relationship felt rushed and overshadowed by physical intimacy. Despite these flaws, the series remains engaging, and I’m eager to see how the overarching story unfolds, particularly in the upcoming books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There was nothing really wrong with them, and there were some nice moments, but I couldn’t connect with them deeply.  \n- **Romance:** I couldn’t connect with the romance. The communication was nonexistent in the first half, but they slowly started to understand each other more as the story progressed.  \n- **Anticipation for Future Work:** I can’t wait for the next book in the series!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was good but not exceptional. While the writing quality remains strong, the characters and romance didn’t fully resonate with me.

The series is starting to feel a bit draggy, but I'm still invested in the story and committed to seeing it through to the end.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I still don't understand the reason behind Hermes' \"betrayal,\" and it will take a lot of convincing for me to like her again. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting to enjoy Ariadne and The Minotaur's story, especially since I initially thought of him as half-monster. However, I ended up appreciating their dynamic more than I anticipated.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story is starting to feel a bit slow, but I'm still all in for the ride. I wished there were more flashback scenes from when the characters were younger, as it would have added depth to their development.  \n\n- **Series Continuation:**  \n  There are still three more books before the series ends, and I'm curious to see how everything will wrap up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the pacing of the series is beginning to feel a bit slow, I remain engaged with the overarching plot and the characters' journeys.

Ariadne’s character arc is particularly intriguing; initially engaged to Dionysus to escape the Minotaur and Minos, she ultimately betrays the Thirteen, Minos, and Dionysus, only to discover that Dionysus is part of a scheme to overthrow the Thirteen. The plan to blow up Dodona Tower, involving Circe, Hera, Dionysus, and Hermes, adds complexity to the narrative. Ariadne’s hacking skills, which she uses to provide blueprints, stand out as a highlight. Additionally, Minos’ decision to escalate the plan, prioritizing destruction over casualties, shifts the focus to dismantling the barrier, which ultimately falls as Ariadne and the Minotaur escape Olympus.",

The author depicted him as crass and uneducated, which contradicts his established background of having received the same education as Theseus and Pandora. Additionally, his initial obsession with Ariadne felt inconsistent and quickly transformed into a love match, undermining Ariadne's earlier fear of him and her decision to abort his child. Overall, the character dynamics lacked credibility, especially considering their established backstories from previous books.",

She lacked a distinct personality compared to other characters in the series, which might have been intentional due to her upbringing.\n   - The Minotaur's obsession with Ariadne was evident, but there was a lack of depth in their relationship. The \"I've loved you since I was a teen\" trope was used, but without meaningful flashbacks or development.\n\n- **Romantic and Spicy Scenes:**\n   - The spicy scenes were fine but didn't stand out as particularly special or overly hot compared to what we've seen in other books in the series.\n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**\n   - My favorite part of the book was the overarching plot involving the downfall of Olympus. The tension and anticipation of what's to come kept me engaged.\n   - I'm excited to see how the series progresses, especially with three or four more books left. The big plot developments are intriguing, and I can't wait to see what happens next.\n\n- **Series Comparison:**\n   - This book didn't live up to my expectations compared to other books in the series. The characters and romantic elements felt weaker, though the overarching plot remained compelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile this book didn't become my favorite in the series due to weaker character development and less impactful romantic scenes, the overarching plot involving the downfall of Olympus kept me engaged. I'm looking forward to seeing how the series progresses and what twists lie ahead.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Their dynamic revolved around misunderstandings, such as Ariadne believing Asterion's loyalty was to her father rather than her, and Asterion finding it strange that she thought that way. This repetitive tension didn't add much depth or appeal to their relationship for me.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, the book wasn't my cup of tea. The heavy focus on politics and the exhausting plot twists made it difficult for me to stay engaged. I simply didn't care enough about the story or its characters to find it enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has a plot-driven narrative with intricate twists and political intrigue, it failed to capture my interest due to its heavy focus on Olympus politics and the exhausting nature of its storytelling. The character dynamics, particularly between Ariadne and Asterion, were underwhelming and repetitive.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "I eagerly pre-ordered this latest installment right after finishing the cliffhanger of the previous book, demonstrating my investment in the series. The novel begins ten weeks earlier at a house party hosted by Minos of Aeaea, overlapping with events from books five and six, told from the perspectives of Ariadne and Asterion. The use of MuseWatch headlines to recap significant plot points from previous novels was both necessary and helpful for grasping the context of the story.",
            "This installment focuses on character development beyond the central Ariadne-Asterion relationship. Hermes, a recurring character, has her motives and methods explored in depth, positioning her as a key player in future narratives. Her interactions with Asterion (the Minotaur) often outshine those with Ariadne, as she engages him in clever banter while Ariadne reduces him to basic sounds. Callisto, a background character from previous books, emerges as a distinct individual, setting the stage for her own future significance. Dionysus and Icarus also play notable supporting roles, though only one of them will feature in an upcoming novel. \n\nLike earlier installments, *Dark Restraint* includes raw and passionate open-door sex scenes that are more intense than before. These intimate moments are essential to the story, and omitting them would hinder a full understanding of the narrative. Readers should note several trigger/content warnings related to the sexual content before diving in.",
            "The *Dark Olympus* series offers a loose retelling of mythology, retaining some traditional pairings and roles, such as Zeus and Hera's marriage, Poseidon's control over sea trade, and Hephaestus's inventive prowess. However, the narrative allows for creative reinterpretation of most elements, which may not satisfy readers looking for a more faithful adaptation of the myths."

New readers should start with *Electric Idol* (the first book in the Dark Olympus series), *Learn My Lesson* (from the Wicked Villains series), or any of the Touch of Taboo novellas.\n   - This book is unlikely to convert readers who haven’t enjoyed the Dark Olympus series or Katee Robert’s work in general.\n   - For readers seeking a more faithful mythological retelling, I recommend authors like Natalie Haynes or Jennifer Saint.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Dark Restraint* is a solid addition to the Dark Olympus series, with strong character development for supporting characters like Hermes and Callisto, and engaging dynamics such as the Hermes/Minotaur banter.

            "The plot follows Ariadne as she seeks refuge and an abortion from Minos's enemies, ultimately leading to her betrothal to Dionysus. Minos commands Asterion to kill her, but Asterion’s motivations and actions feel inconsistent. The political landscape of the story is disjointed, despite some escalation as the narrative unfolds. While the final set piece is exciting, it fails to salvage the overall experience for me.",
            "In this story, Ariadne is portrayed as the constrained daughter of Minos, her value tied solely to her potential as a marriage prospect. Asterion, known as “The Minotaur,” is one of Minos's adopted children who idolizes Ariadne, devoting his life to carrying out Minos's violent tasks to be near her. Unfortunately, both characters lack depth, making it challenging to connect with them. The transition of Asterion's character from threatening to nurturing is jarring, and his caregiving gestures—like dressing Ariadne in his sweats and feeding her pasta—feel minimal.\n\nDionysus is kind to Ariadne but remains underdeveloped and lacks a clear role in the narrative. The relationship between Ariadne and Asterion raises significant concerns. Asterion's belief that Ariadne's body conveys consent, despite her lack of verbal agreement, and his disturbing comments—such as expressing a desire to make her cry—add an uncomfortable layer to their dynamic. While Ariadne initially seems compliant with Asterion’s advances, his actions, including biting her to the point of scarring, complicate their relationship further. Asterion's frustration and threats when Ariadne fails to grasp his intentions, paired with his violent background, create an unsettling atmosphere that detracts from the story.",

The lack of character development, problematic relationship dynamics, and inconsistent plot pacing made it difficult to fully engage with the story.

            "The story truly excels in offering a captivating perspective on its expansive world, anchored by a compellingly corrupt political landscape—one of the author’s greatest strengths. While we initially encountered this world through the lens of Minos' household with Theseus in \"Cruel Seduction,\" this installment provides a deeper exploration of the abuse endured by its characters and the high stakes that lie ahead.

Most of the time, she appears anxious and reactive, especially around Asterion, where her intelligence seems to fade. Asterion, on the other hand, is a morally ambiguous and possessive character, whose pining for Ariadne does not resonate with me. Although he asserts he would never physically harm her and looks out for her in his own way, he emotionally manipulates her in toxic ways. Their relationship feels superficial and lacks depth, rooted in miscommunication and an inability to engage in mature discussions about their feelings.

Nothing significant happens until the 75% mark, and then it descends into often confusing madness. The book focuses heavily on the political landscape of Olympus, which overshadows the central relationship.  \n\n- **Character Development (FMC - Ariadne):**  \n  Ariadne has a good heart but lacks a strong personality. While she is repeatedly described as intelligent, this is only briefly shown through her hacking skills. Most of the time, she comes across as anxious and hormone-driven, especially around Asterion, where her intelligence seems to vanish.  \n\n- **Character Development (MMC - Asterion):**  \n  Asterion is a morally gray, possessive, and pining character, but I am not a fan of him. While he claims he would never physically hurt Ariadne and watches out for her in his own way, he has no qualms about emotionally manipulating her in abusive ways.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship between Ariadne and Asterion feels surface-level and underdeveloped. Their conflict is rooted in miscommunication and an inability to have mature conversations about their feelings. Instead, their interactions are dominated by threats and sex, with little meaningful connection. Much of their \"relationship\" plays out through repetitive inner monologues, where Asterion assumes Ariadne understands his intentions, while she remains conflicted and fearful.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  This installment is the darkest in the series, which I was prepared for, but it didn’t resonate with me. The themes of fated mates, biting, praise, and degradation are present, but they don’t elevate the story in a way that feels compelling or satisfying.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is uneven, with the majority of the plot unfolding in the last quarter of the book. This makes the story feel disjointed and rushed toward the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was fine but disappointing, especially since I loved the series up to this point. It’s my least favorite installment so far, primarily due to the underdeveloped relationship, lack of meaningful character growth, and chaotic plot. While it’s not a bad book, it doesn’t live up to the expectations set by the earlier entries in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot: 3/5  \n- Spice: 3/5  \n- FMC (Ariadne): 3/5  \n- MMC (Asterion): 2.75/5"

The non-romantic elements were particularly engaging, though there were notable plot holes, especially concerning the barrier and its mechanics.

Despite not being blood relatives, their shared upbringing under the same father made their relationship feel awkward and unappealing.

Ariadne stood out as a relatable yet strong-willed character with firm beliefs, and I appreciated her plus-sized representation. While Dionysus proved to be a generous and supportive partner, his role felt underutilized. I found Asterion unengaging and uninspiring in the romance, but I was pleasantly surprised by Icarus's character growth.",

It definitely moved the story along.  \n   - I am excited for more Hermes. She has been one of my favorite characters from the get-go, and I am so excited to see where that goes.  \n   - Dionysus and Hera were also really intriguing characters, so I am curious to see more about where their stories lead.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n   - I enjoyed the narrators overall. I feel they did a good job expressing the characters throughout the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the overarching themes, politics, and plot progression, I found the romantic development between the Minotaur and Ariadne lacking. The book heavily relies on references to prior events, making it less effective as a standalone. However, the intriguing characters like Hermes, Dionysus, and Hera, along with the strong narration, kept me engaged and excited for future installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall: 3/5 ⭐️  \n- Spiciness: 4/5"

            "This story expertly weaves together themes of politics and family trauma. At its core are the Minotaur (Asterian) and Ariadne, with the Minotaur initially sent by Minos to kill her but ultimately sparing her life out of love. The engaging narrative offers deeper insight into Dionysus, which I found particularly rewarding. Hermes shines in key moments, highlighting her increasing significance, while Icarus makes a strong presence, building anticipation for his forthcoming book.",
            "In this story, Ariadne is portrayed as intelligent and resourceful, having courageously defected from her father, Minos. The central theme revolves around the Minotaur's love for Ariadne, but their childhood connection feels lacking in depth. Hera plays a substantial role, driven by her own agenda, though I find both her and Zeus less compelling characters. The dynamic between the Minotaur and Ariadne is engaging, particularly the contrast between his fearsome reputation and his tender feelings for her.",
            "Betrayal is a central theme in this story, as both the Minotaur and Ariadne turn against the morally reprehensible Minos. It emphasizes the significance of following one's heart and making tough choices, exemplified by the Minotaur's protective instinct for Ariadne.",
            "The romance in this installment is less central than in earlier entries. While explicit content exists, it remains mostly tame, with the exception of a scene in Chapter 1 that includes biting and blood, which I found unsettling. The Minotaur's long-standing love for Ariadne is referenced, but the emotional depth of their relationship feels rushed given the book's brevity."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was an enjoyable and easy read, with a strong focus on plot and political intrigue. While the romance took a backseat, the dynamic between the Minotaur and Ariadne was engaging, even if their emotional connection felt underdeveloped. The book successfully sets up future installments, particularly Icarus’s story, which I’m looking forward to. However, the explicit content in Chapter 1 was a bit off-putting, and I remain uninterested in Hera and Zeus’s arcs.",

While the Minotaur was presented as a formidable and relentless force, his intensity felt superficial rather than deeply affecting. I craved more layers, tension, and complexity.

Ariadne dreams of traveling the world with Asterion and reading fanfics, while his only wish is to be by her side.",

I love a good forbidden romance with mutual pining.\n\n- **Character Development and Motivation:**\n   - In the previous books, the main characters (MCs) were often treated as pawns by others, only for them to find their own power, even if they ultimately abandoned it. This book was interesting in that both Ariadne and Asterion were Midas’ pawns but had zero desire for power. They only wanted to be together and escape from under Midas’ thumb. Ariadne just wanted to travel the world with Asterion and read fanfics, while he simply wanted to be with her.\n\n- **Plot Relevance and Impact:**\n   - I feel like I was left hanging when it comes to these two more than any other characters in this series. I can’t decide if I’m disappointed by that or if I even care enough about them to want to know more about their future. This felt a bit like a filler book with filler characters. Very little happened that these two characters were needed for. Yes, something massive happened, but in the end, it probably could have been accomplished without either of them.\n\n- **Series Continuity and Future Books:**\n   - However, each book makes me more and more excited for Hermes’ book and Zeus and Hera’s books.\n\n- **Narration and Performance:**\n   - The highlight of this book was the beautiful narration by Zara Hampton-Brown and Alex Moorcock. I love these two so much! Zara brings such sweetness to the female main characters (FMCs), and Alex is amazing at brooding, growling male main characters (MCs). I think I would have been even more disappointed in this story if I hadn’t been listening to their amazing performance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, while I was excited for Ariadne and Asterion’s story, I found it somewhat underwhelming.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Books in the Series:**\n   - This book wasn’t my favorite of the series; in fact, it might be my least favorite so far. While it wasn’t necessarily bad, it fell a little flat compared to the last few books, which I personally thought were much better. My preference for the poly situations in those earlier books might have influenced this feeling.\n\n- **Character Development (Minotaur/Asterion):**\n   - The Minotaur was previously portrayed as *so* cruel and inhuman that I’m struggling to see him as a real “person” in this book. This made it harder for me to fully buy into his character arc. However, the backstory about how and when Ariadne and Asterion met, and how they were each other’s firsts in many ways (both literally and in spirit), was sweet and tender AF. That said, there were some moments of questionable consent early on that felt off.\n\n- **Romantic and Spicy Elements:**\n   - The spicy scenes were as strong as ever, which is expected at this point in the series. However, the flavor of the romance and spice here wasn’t my favorite. It felt more like the romance was convenient to moving the story arc forward rather than being a central focus.\n\n- **Plot Progression and Story Arc:**\n   - This book did an excellent job of moving the overall story arc forward. It pushed the bigger narrative into the next steps, which was much needed. While the romance felt secondary, the plot progression was well-executed and satisfying.\n\n- **Setup for the Next Book:**\n   - I really enjoyed the setup for the next book, which has me much more excited and hyped for what’s to come. I’m ready for it!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile this book wasn’t my favorite in the series, it still had its strengths, particularly in advancing the overarching plot and setting up the next installment. The character development for Asterion was a mixed bag, but the backstory with Ariadne added a tender and sweet layer to their relationship. The spicy scenes were consistent with the series, though not my preferred flavor.

The book feels more like a necessary bridge than a standalone narrative, lacking depth and originality.",
            "In \"Asterion (The Minotaur),\" Asterion embodies a classic villain with a desire to wreak havoc, which makes him quite unlikable. Dionysius is an interesting character, perhaps even ace, yet his struggle with alcoholism detracts from his appeal. Ariadne's character could have been more compelling had her computer skills been better explored. Asterion’s thought patterns often feel repetitive, and sadly, Ariadne’s potential remains largely untapped.",

Additionally, the potential appearance of Dionysius in Hermes' story is captivating, though the emphasis on erotica may overshadow other important elements.",

You cannot skip this one if you’re following the series, as it ties into the larger narrative that connects all the books.  \n\n- **Character Pairing and Dynamics:**  \n  Ariadne and Asterion were not my favorite pairing in the series. Their relationship felt very dark, and while it may not fit the perfect definition of dubcon, it was dubious enough to make me uncomfortable. Ariadne seemed willing to step aside and let others control the situation, which was a departure from the brilliant, self-assured femmes typically featured in the series. Asterion, the Minotaur, was brutal with everyone, including Ariadne. His threatening demeanor and the way he spoke down to her were intense and not my cup of tea.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The series as a whole features a wide variety of couples, themes, and tropes, and *Dark Restraint* is no exception. It leans heavily into dark romance, which may appeal to some readers but wasn’t for me.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Series Appeal:**  \n  Despite my reservations about this particular book, I still recommend the series as a whole and plan to continue reading it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Dark Restraint* wasn’t my favorite in the Dark Olympus series due to its dark and intense character dynamics, it plays a crucial role in advancing the overarching plot.

The subplot involving Ariadne and the Minotaur is pivotal in advancing the plot, providing rich detail about the political machinations among The Thirteen, Minos, and Olympus. Major revelations concerning loyalties and shifting motivations add depth, illustrating that characters' intentions often exist in shades of gray. As multiple characters pursue their own agendas—some aligning, others conflicting—the potential for interesting and violent outcomes grows. The cliffhanger was expertly executed, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next installment. Additionally, the setup for Icarus and Poseidon's story is tantalizing, and I can't wait to see how it weaves into the larger narrative.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Every series I love has one book in it that I really just don’t love. I have a feeling this one is it. I don’t know why, but I just didn’t like it much.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I felt like I was reading *Haunting Adeline* but not as thrilling. I get that *Haunting Adeline* is not a healthy relationship, but this one is beyond me.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  I don’t see the relationship in this book as healthy, especially at first. CNC (consensual non-consent) is a weird one for me, and I don’t really love the stalker trope.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ariadne drove me crazy at the beginning with the damsel in distress act, but the character development is pretty good overall.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The political background is the most interesting part for me in this one (minus a couple of very hot scenes anyway).  \n\n- **Romance and Repetitiveness:**  \n  The romance aspect missed the mark for me, and I didn’t like the repetitiveness of a few lines. This might be because I listened to it as opposed to reading it.  \n\n- **Smut and Sensuality:**  \n  The smut is smutting. Fantastic.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Specific):**  \n  The narration was great. I really liked the choice in both narrators. Even the lines from the opposite sex sounded good, which is hard to pull off.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some strong points, such as the political background, character development, and excellent narration, the romance and relationship dynamics didn’t resonate with me. The repetitiveness and certain tropes also detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75⭐️"

            "The story felt flat and devoid of depth. The chemistry between Ariadne and the Minotaur was unconvincing, as the Minotaur's possessiveness and obsessiveness came off as forced rather than indicative of a well-developed character. Additionally, the main plot and side characters overshadowed the central couple, detracting from their narrative. Overall, I would rate the story a 3."

For example, his affectionate use of “sweetheart” for Adriane didn’t align with his cold and ruthless persona.  \n   - His physical description, particularly the long red hair, didn’t appeal to me and broke the immersion.  \n\n- **Imagery and Tone:**  \n   - The imagery at the beginning of the book didn’t match the descriptions of the characters or the tone of the story, almost implying a different kind of experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book was an improvement over the previous one, it still fell short of being great. The plot felt directionless, the characterization of Asterion was inconsistent, and certain elements, like his description, didn’t work for me. The series has had its highs (*Neon Gods* and *Radiant Sin*), but overall, it’s been mediocre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The story dives into the relationship between Ariadne and Asterion (the Minotaur), which was intriguing and well-executed.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Romance:**  \n  Ariadne and Asterion were raised together in a dysfunctional, adopted sibling/childhood friend dynamic, which evolved into a \"friends to lovers\" relationship as adults. Their romance was steamy, full of tension, and had a strong sense of possessiveness. However, I felt their relationship was almost given too easily to them, lacking some of the emotional depth or struggle I expected.  \n\n- **Plot and Stakes:**  \n  While the stakes were high, I never truly felt like anything terrible would happen to the main characters. The plot felt like it was missing something bigger or more impactful to elevate the tension and emotional investment.  \n\n- **Series Potential and Future Books:**  \n  The ending of this book left me ecstatic for the next installment, *Sweet Obsession*. Poseidon and Icarus’ chemistry in just a few pages was off the charts, and I have a feeling it might become a series favorite for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Dark Restraint* was an enjoyable read with a strong mythological foundation and a steamy romance, though it lacked some emotional depth and higher stakes. The ending, however, has me eagerly anticipating the next book in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 🌟"

It has a distinct middle-book vibe, with only a handful of key events propelling the story forward, which makes it feel somewhat flat in comparison to earlier entries. However, the setup for the next book, centering on Icarus and Poseidon, is intriguing, leaving me eager for what's to come. I expect the plot will gain momentum in the next installment.",

He’s possessive, morally ambiguous, and fiercely protective of Ariadne, ready to do anything for her. Ariadne, a sweet and sheltered character, undergoes significant growth throughout the story. Despite her challenges, she proves resilient, making her more likable than I anticipated. The romantic tension between the Minotaur and Ariadne is palpable; his unwavering devotion to her is striking, even declaring that he would kill for her. The spice in the book is well-crafted, although it appears less frequently than in earlier works. While the quality of the intimate scenes remains high, they do taper off in the latter half.",

On the other hand, I do appreciate the unique direction the story took. Hera, typically so strategic and insightful, seemed surprisingly blindsided by the unfolding events.

The MMC was very aggressive, which normally I do not mind in dark romances, but this one just felt off. The FMC, while marginally better, just did not get enough backstory for me.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Themes:**  \n  The \"SHE IS MINE\" language felt a bit forced to me.  \n\n- **Ending and Future Setup:**  \n  The ending of this book did set up what I believe will be a very interesting set of circumstances in the future.  \n\n- **Series Continuity and Reading Order:**  \n  I will definitely still be continuing this series. I do recommend to my followers that you do not read these books out of order. While each book is a separate pairing, there is a throughline story that will make events in this story very confusing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book had some strong elements, such as the political intrigue and the setup for future installments, it fell short in character development and dialogue execution.

This alignment makes their personal journey feel somewhat secondary to the main plot.  \n- **Pacing and Efficiency:** The story could have been more concise, as the central conflict and resolution could have been summarized more efficiently. The prolonged focus on Ariadne and the Minotaur’s relationship feels unnecessary given its limited impact on the overarching narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers a romantic and engaging side plot centered on Ariadne and the Minotaur, but their story feels disconnected from the larger events of the main plot. While the forbidden romance is compelling, the narrative could have been more streamlined to better integrate their journey with the broader storyline.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Despite this, I remain a fan of Katee Robert’s work and look forward to the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The pacing felt rushed, and the story didn’t do justice to the characters or their potential.  \n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  This book fell short compared to my expectations, especially after some disappointing previous installments. It seems the series declines in quality as it progresses, which is disheartening.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  Katee could have done so much more with these characters and their story.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Romance Dynamics:**  \n  I appreciate a romance where the love interest is willing to go to extreme lengths, such as killing, for the main character. However, this novel leaned too heavily into the \"dark romance\" trope, which made it less appealing to me.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  I found myself more invested in Ariadne's relationships with characters like Dionysus, Hera, Icarus, and her father, as well as Asterion's relationships with Minos and Theseus. These dynamics added depth and intrigue to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Focus:**  \n  While the \"macro-plot\" developments were engaging and well-executed, I felt the romance overshadowed other important elements of the story. This focus on the romance detracted from the overall narrative and left me wanting more balance.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The novel was good, particularly in terms of its broader plot developments, but it was only okay overall due to the imbalance in focus.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had strong elements, particularly in its broader plot and character relationships outside the central romance. However, the heavy emphasis on the dark romance aspect diminished its overall appeal for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

The relationship felt flat, the pacing was rushed, and the spicy elements lacked originality. It’s a decent read but not my favorite in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

It felt like \"hurry up and wait... for nothing.\"  \n- **Pacing:** The book dragged on because the couple's relationship felt so inevitable.  \n- **Recommendation:** I would still recommend reading it to keep up with the series, but it's not my favorite Katee Robert's book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this installment of the Neon Gods series maintained a great story and strong characters, its pacing and lack of significant plot progression left me somewhat disappointed. Despite this, it’s worth reading for fans of the series, though it doesn’t stand out as my favorite from Katee Robert.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "This book explores the complex relationship between Ariadne and Asterion, the Minotaur. Asterion, an enforcer for Ariadne’s father, Minos, is ordered to kill her but is unable to do so because of his love for her. While the premise is intriguing, I initially struggled to visualize their relationship, particularly due to Asterion’s depiction as a giant with long red hair. After overcoming this hurdle, I found the constant miscommunication between the two frustrating. It seemed evident that Asterion would never harm Ariadne, yet he failed to express this clearly, making the trope feel tiresome. However, once this issue was resolved, I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic.",
            "Ariadne and Asterion are well-crafted characters, and their emotional journey becomes compelling once the miscommunication is resolved. Dionysus also shines as a likable and honorable figure, further enhancing the story.",

Asterion, a hired enforcer for Ariadne’s father, Minos, is ordered to kill her but cannot bring himself to do so because he loves her. While the premise is intriguing, I initially struggled to picture their relationship due to Asterion’s portrayal as a giant with long red hair. Once I moved past this, I found the constant miscommunication between the two frustrating. It felt obvious that Asterion wouldn’t kill Ariadne, yet he refused to communicate this clearly, which made the trope feel grating. However, once this issue was resolved, I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic.  \n\n- **World-Building and Storytelling:**  \n  The book continues the Dark Olympus series with its rich world-building and engaging storytelling. The author, Katee Robert, maintains the series' high standards, creating a vivid and immersive setting. The inclusion of familiar characters and the overarching Olympus narrative adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Ariadne and Asterion are well-developed characters, and their emotional journey is compelling once the miscommunication is resolved. Additionally, Dionysus stands out as a particularly likable and honorable character, earning my appreciation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some initial challenges with visualizing the relationship and the frustrating miscommunication trope, *Dark Restraint* delivers a captivating story with strong world-building and character development. The emotional payoff between Ariadne and Asterion, along with the continuation of the Dark Olympus series, makes this a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5 stars)  \n\nThank you to NetGalley, the author, and the publisher for providing me with an ARC of this title for review."

            "I believe this book would have been more effective as a novella. The story contained repetitive elements, such as characters frequently visiting each other's homes, which felt unnecessary and slowed the pacing.",
            "The relationship in the story develops from friendship to a tense vow of vengeance, ultimately blossoming into romance. The characters’ poor choices heighten the tension throughout the narrative. Ariadne's involvement in an arranged marriage introduces an additional layer of complexity. Notably, the concept of a \"Morality Chain\" is woven into the plot, showcasing a character who helps keep another grounded in their moral compass.",
            "This story presents a dark romance with elements of light stalking, creating a compelling yet unsettling narrative.",
            "I had been eagerly anticipating the story of Ariadne and the Minotaur since *Radiant Sin* (Book 4, Apollo and Cassandra). I was excited to see how Olympus's new fate would unfold, particularly with the addition of captivating new characters."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Depth**  \n   - I didn’t feel connected to the characters at all. Ariadne is portrayed as a damsel in distress, and Minotaur is reduced to a brute. Even Dionysus, who was supposed to be a main character, remained enigmatic and underdeveloped.  \n   - Eurydice from *Midnight Ruin* was a stronger character who took initiative, which made Ariadne’s portrayal even more disappointing.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity and Focus**  \n   - The plot was overly convoluted with too many subplots, such as Hera/Callisto’s coup, Hermes’ return, and the conflicts surrounding the barrier and Dodona tower. These detracted from the main story and made it hard to stay engaged.  \n   - The repetitive conflicts between Ariadne and Minotaur (e.g., “he doesn’t love me” and “she doesn’t trust me”) felt frustrating and unnecessary.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mystery**  \n   - The world-building still holds some intrigue, like the revelation about the barrier being mechanical rather than magical. This keeps me curious about the series, even though this book fell flat.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment**  \n   - This book was a letdown compared to others in the series. I didn’t feel the usual excitement or satisfaction I’ve come to expect from KR’s books.  \n   - Despite my disappointment, I’ll continue reading the series because it’s always a little fun, and I want to see how the overarching story unfolds.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis installment was a dud for me. The lack of character development, overly complex plot, and repetitive conflicts made it hard to enjoy. However, the series still has its charm, and I’ll keep reading to uncover more about the world and its mysteries.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Book 1, *Neon Gods*: ⭐⭐⭐  \n- Book 2, *Electric Idol*: ⭐⭐⭐⭐  \n- Book 3, *Wicked Beauty*: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  \n- Book 4, *Radiant Sin*: ⭐⭐⭐  \n- Book 5, *Cruel Seduction*: ⭐⭐  \n- Book 6, *Midnight Ruin*: ⭐⭐⭐⭐"

            "The first two acts of the book felt slow and drawn out, making it challenging to stay engaged with the narrative and the characters' relationship. However, the final act picked up considerably, brimming with action and tension, particularly in gripping moments like Ariadne sneaking out of Dionysius' penthouse. The main plot, focused on Ariadne's task to retrieve blueprints for Asterion, lacked urgency and felt weightless due to the absence of real consequences for failure. Additionally, the engagement between Ariadne and Dionysius, intended to be a pivotal plot point, was underdeveloped and barely addressed public opinion or the MuseWatch commentary. Nevertheless, the introduction of Circe at the end teases potential excitement for the next installment.",
            "Ariadne's fear of Asterion comes across as inconsistent and unconvincing, especially given her bold and combative demeanor during their encounters. Asterion's character trajectory follows a familiar trope (the threatening protector who is secretly gentle), which diminished the intrigue of their relationship after the initial chapters. In contrast, Hera and Hermes emerge as the most engaging characters, and their potential storylines are eagerly anticipated. Ariadne's interactions with the other members of the Thirteen are minimal, with Hera being the only significant exception.",
            "The portrayal of Olympus and its societal dynamics, including public opinion, was largely overlooked, resulting in a less immersive setting."

To uphold public appearances, she is compelled to marry Dionysus, while the Minotaur is assigned to kill her. I found the plot, particularly Ariadne’s quest to assist Hera in dismantling the wall separating Olympus, to be engrossing. The ending was both captivating and shocking, leaving a lasting impact.",
            "The relationship between Ariadne and the Minotaur transitions from friendship to romance, which I found uncomfortable. Their dynamic feels problematic, as they grew up together, resembling siblings. A particularly disturbing scene depicts the Minotaur in a way that echoes sexual assault, followed by his anger over Ariadne's decision to have an abortion. In light of today's societal issues, the romanticization of their relationship feels both inappropriate and unsettling."

        "conclusion": "While the plot and Ariadne's role in the overarching story were engaging, the romantic relationship between Ariadne and the Minotaur was deeply uncomfortable and problematic. This installment, despite its strong ending, is one I would advise skipping.",

            "The plot ultimately felt underwhelming, lacking the emotional depth necessary for key moments, such as the abortion scene. I anticipated more angst and conflict, but the storyline concluded too neatly, which clashed with the character's unsettling nature. While the concept of advanced technology as the barrier was intriguing, its resolution seemed rushed and unsatisfying. Although the individual scenes were well-crafted, they felt disconnected from the overarching narrative and characters, diminishing their overall impact.",
            "I found the pairing unconvincing. The main character's drastic actions, such as killing three innocent people on Ariadne’s doorstep, made it difficult to believe in his capacity for love. The relationship lacked emotional depth, particularly with the abortion subplot treated so casually—it felt unrealistic and forced. Initially, I intensely disliked the main character, envisioning him as a grotesque figure based on his descriptions and past actions in earlier books. His near-domestic-terrorist act further diminished my view of him, and although he didn't go through with it, I still found him unlikable. A black-and-white illustration of him with Ariadne slightly shifted my perspective, making him appear less monstrous, but I couldn’t overlook his prior behavior across four books. His emotional detachment regarding Ariadne's abortion was a major turn-off; I expected depth or conflict, but his indifference only made him seem more unlikable. Similarly, Hermes’ actions in this installment worsened my feelings toward her—the cold execution of innocent guards felt unjustified and out of character.",

She supports the tower's destruction as long as Zeus is the only one inside.\n   - Asterion makes a deal with Hermes, which accelerates the barrier's collapse.\n   - Ariadne, Asterion, and Icarus attempt to escape but are trapped by Minos. Ariadne shoots Minos to save Icarus, and Poseidon arrives, capturing Icarus while the other two escape.\n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**\n   - The majority of the book (3/4) focuses on obtaining the blueprints, which feels drawn out and lacks significant progress.\n   - The final 1/4 of the book contains most of the action, making the earlier sections feel like filler.\n   - The overall pacing gives the impression that the story is merely killing time rather than advancing meaningfully.\n\n- **Romantic and Sensual Elements:**\n   - There are some smutty scenes, but they are relatively tame compared to previous books in the series.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**\n   - The book feels like a filler installment, lacking substantial plot development or meaningful progression.\n   - Despite some engaging moments, the story fails to deliver the depth or excitement expected from the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book offers interesting character dynamics and a few engaging scenes, it ultimately falls short due to its slow pacing and lack of significant plot progression. The majority of the story feels like filler, and the action is concentrated in the final quarter, leaving the reader somewhat disappointed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2/5 stars."

The first half focused heavily on the main couple, Ariadne and the Minotaur, but it didn’t hold my attention as well as the other books in the series.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ariadne):**  \n   - Ariadne felt weak to me. It seemed like everything was happening *to* her, and she rarely made decisions for herself. The introduction of her \"hacker\" aspect gave me hope for more personality, but it still fell flat.  \n\n- **Character Development (The Minotaur):**  \n   - The Minotaur lacked depth. His emotions were limited to grumpy or annoyed shades, and while I enjoy possessive male leads, it felt unbalanced because Ariadne didn’t seem to reciprocate his feelings until much later. This made their dynamic feel a bit creepy at times.  \n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Scenes:**  \n   - The smut scenes were okay, but they didn’t stand out as much as I’d hoped.  \n\n- **Plot Development (Macro Plot):**  \n   - The second half shifted focus to the overarching plot involving the threat to Olympus. Hermes, Hera, and Dionysus were highlights for me, but their motivations remained unclear. I’m still unsure about their allegiances and why they’re acting the way they are.  \n\n- **Series Consistency and Re-readability:**  \n   - While I love this series, I’ll likely skip this book during future rereads.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Dark Restraint* didn’t live up to my expectations compared to the other books in the series.

            "The plot felt scattered, with moments that seemed forced or illogical. The subplot involving Hera was distracting, and the modern references to places like Brazil and Canada disrupted my immersion in the story. The abrupt shifts between real-world settings and the mythology of Olympus were jarring and hard to follow. Although the ending wrapped up reasonably well, I am eager to see where Hera and Hermes' stories lead. Overall, this book felt like filler, and I hope the next installment offers more excitement. The final act did pick up in action, particularly when Ariadne sneaks out of Dionysius' penthouse, adding some much-needed tension.",
            "I struggled to connect with Ariadne and The Minotaur, as their relationship often felt weak and inconsistent. Ariadne's characterization was particularly problematic; while her actions were bold and confrontational, her inner thoughts portrayed her as fearful of Asterion, creating a contradiction. Asterion’s character relied on the clichéd tough exterior, soft interior trope, which didn't lend much depth to their dynamic. It was hard to believe Ariadne genuinely feared Asterion after they had shared intimate moments and spent time together in his home. The resolution of her fear—him serving her dinner—came across as rushed and unconvincing.",

Despite these issues, the series has a gripping quality that keeps me coming back for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It wasn't an enemies-to-lovers trope but rather a lovers-acknowledging-they're-lovers dynamic. The relationship between Asterion and Ariadne was cute, though not particularly spicy. Their scenes were sweet and endearing, but the overall tone felt lighter than expected.\n\n- **Series Consistency and Plot Development:**  \n  This book didn't do much to advance the macro plot of the series, which was disappointing. The previous book also lacked significant plot progression, which left me wanting more in terms of overarching story development.\n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The series started with a strong focus on Hades and Persephone, which set certain expectations for the tone and depth of the story. This book, however, felt more lighthearted and \"cute,\" which didn't fully align with what I was hoping for.\n\n- **Reader Commitment:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I am still invested in the series and plan to buy the next book when it comes out. The story and characters have enough charm to keep me engaged, even if this installment didn't fully meet my expectations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the romantic angle was refreshing and the relationship between Asterion and Ariadne was cute, the book fell short in advancing the series' macro plot and didn't fully meet the expectations set by earlier installments.

It was one of the stronger elements of the novel, though it leaned heavily into explicit content.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance aspect was underwhelming, scoring only 2/5. It lacked depth and emotional connection, making it hard to invest in the relationship.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was the weakest part, with a rating of 1/5. It was bland and confusing, making it difficult to stay engaged or even keep track of the characters.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, the book was disappointing, earning a 2/5. It felt like a shallow mix of explicit scenes and a poorly developed story, akin to a \"very dark flavour\" of \"porn ice cream.\"  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The tone was dark and unsettling, described as \"nutty\" and \"a very fucked up beauty and the beast.\" This darker approach didn’t resonate well with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some spice, it failed to deliver a compelling romance or plot.

Additionally, the portrayal of a boy claiming ownership over the protagonist from the age of 13 felt problematic and unsettling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I approached the novel with an open mind, the dynamics between the characters, particularly the sibling relationship and the possessive behavior, made it difficult for me to fully engage with the story. These elements overshadowed my reading experience and left me feeling uneasy.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I was thrilled to receive an ARC of *Dark Restraint* and started it almost immediately. However, this book fell short of my expectations compared to the others in the series.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The pacing was a major issue for me. I wanted to DNF this book multiple times because I found it so boring. It took me over a month to finish, whereas I usually finish the series' books within a week. The story only became truly interesting in the last 10%, which was frustrating.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters, Ariadne and Asterion, felt like a forced couple. Ariadne came across as one-dimensional and underdeveloped. I wanted to see more of her hacker side, but it was only briefly mentioned and didn’t add much depth to her character. Asterion, the Minotaur, was equally uninteresting. His overprotectiveness felt overdone and made me roll my eyes multiple times.  \n\n- **Emotional Connection:**  \n  I didn’t care about the main characters at all. Their relationship lacked chemistry, and I found it hard to connect with them emotionally. This made the story feel flat and unengaging for most of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Dark Restraint* was a disappointing addition to the Dark Olympus series.

Initially, there is little chemistry between them, and the abrupt transition to love feels unearned and unrealistic. The Minotaur's character arc is both inconsistent and disappointing, as he never apologizes or learns from his abusive tendencies, despite moments of potential self-awareness.

He literally murders two people very early on in the book, and it's just sort of glossed over. Ariadne has a two-sentence breakdown about it, and then she's back to, \"I guess that's just how he is!\"\n   - Even if the initial premise of Asterion being ordered to murder Ariadne had been explored further, I think it could have added more depth to both characters. Instead, they just jump each other's bones within minutes of being in the same room every time they meet up, and the reader is just expected to believe that their relationship has developed off-page.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**\n   - There was more politics, which is exciting, even if they were pretty clumsily done.\n\n- **New Characters and Engagement:**\n   - I don't know if I can struggle through another entry in this series centered on characters introduced too late in the game for me to care about.\n\n- **Future Interest in the Series:**\n   - I really want the ZeusxHera book though 😭\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe latest entry in the series was a disappointing read, lacking the depth and development needed to make the characters and their relationships compelling.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Cover Design and Book Quality:**\n   - The new EU covers are visually appealing, but as a fan from the start, I now have a mismatched set of the Dark Olympus series, which is disappointing for someone who values complete collections.\n   - The publishing team's decision to change the covers feels like a disservice to original fans, forcing them to either rebuy the first six books or deal with inconsistent cover themes and uneven book sizes.\n   - The physical quality of the book has declined: the paper is of lower quality, the cover started peeling after just two days, the print is poorly centered, and the edges are unevenly cut.\n\n- **Plot and Character Dynamics:**\n   - The relationship between Ariadne and Minotaur, who are adoptive siblings, feels uncomfortably close to incest. I believe the author could have chosen a different background story to avoid this.\n   - The inclusion of cold-blooded murders by the male main character (MMC) is disturbing and not aligned with my preferences. It’s jarring that murder isn’t listed among the trigger warnings, while other violent acts like stabbing, shooting, and beatings are described in detail.\n   - Minotaur’s obsession with Ariadne’s virginity and her “purity” (with a body count of one—him) feels regressive and out of place for a self-proclaimed progressive writer. This made his character even harder to tolerate.\n\n- **Setting and Cultural Representation:**\n   - The decision to place Olympus and the Greek Gods in the USA feels unnecessarily self-centered and reflects a lack of global awareness. It reminded me of the scene from *Bolt* where Penny points at a USA map and says, “Behold, the whole world.” This choice was disappointing and frustrating.\n\n- **Writing Style and Content Choices:**\n   - The inclusion of the code “69420” felt juvenile and unnecessary, detracting from the story rather than adding value.\n   - The smutty scenes were underwhelming, especially compared to the detailed descriptions of violence and murder, which felt disproportionate and unsettling.\n   - Compared to *Neon Gods*, which initially hooked me on the series, this installment felt like a decline in quality, both in writing and content.\n\n- **Engagement and Suspense:**\n   - Despite my frustrations, the plot was suspenseful and kept me engaged, even if my primary motivation for finishing the book was to be done with it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book had its moments of suspense and kept me turning the pages, the overall experience was marred by disappointing choices in character dynamics, cultural representation, and writing quality. The decline in physical book quality and the mismatched covers added to my frustration. I’m left questioning whether I’ve outgrown the series or if the author’s writing has genuinely declined.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "Ariadne first appeared in Apollo's book and had a brief presence in Eurydice's story. Initially, based on her actions in the latter, I assumed her relationship with the Minotaur was not entirely consensual, but I was relieved to learn that this wasn't the case. Nonetheless, calling their connection a \"relationship\" seems exaggerated; unspoken attraction and a single encounter do not constitute a meaningful bond. I struggled to believe they genuinely liked each other as individuals, which made it difficult for me to engage with the story. Ariadne came across as whiny, and her familial issues felt less relatable since many characters share similar burdens. My primary concern, however, was the Minotaur. The author's choice to repeatedly refer to him simply as \"The Minotaur\" throughout the book felt excessive and awkward. Overall, I couldn't find myself invested in these characters or their journey.",

Initially, I was hesitant about this book, as I wasn't particularly invested in these characters and felt that other couples deserved their own stories first. However, I decided to give it a chance."

The lack of investment in the characters, the underdeveloped relationship between Ariadne and the Minotaur, and the repetitive naming choice made it difficult to engage with the story.

The subplot of a marriage of convenience is introduced without sufficient motivation, which hinders investment in the characters' choices and development. While the book does deserve credit for its representation, particularly in its respectful handling of gender identity—such as the Minotaur’s acknowledgment of pronouns—this positive aspect is ultimately overshadowed by the plot and character development's overall lack of substance.",
