            "The plot is both nonsensical and underdeveloped, centered around a marriage of convenience that lacks thoughtful execution. Angelo's forced marriage to inherit his family's wealth feels contrived and unrealistic. The resolution is rushed, with Olivia abruptly realizing her love for Angelo in just a few pages, resulting in an unsatisfying and hasty happily-ever-after.",

            "Angelo is a thoughtful and affectionate character whose love for Olivia is both evident and well-developed. He has quietly nurtured his feelings for her over the years, illustrated by gestures such as bringing her favorite cake for her birthday. In contrast, Olivia is more complex, having experienced multiple relationships, including a toxic one with Darrell. Her sudden realization that Angelo is the perfect match for her feels abrupt and somewhat unconvincing, particularly given her recent involvement with Darrell. This shift makes her feelings for Angelo appear more like infatuation than deep love, raising questions about her emotional stability.\n\nWhile Angelo and Olivia are portrayed as “frenemies,” their interactions lack genuine tension or conflict, resembling a deep friendship with playful banter rather than a true enemies-to-lovers narrative. Additionally, Olivia's transition from Darrell to Angelo seems rushed and casts doubt on her emotional commitment, suggesting potential emotional cheating since she wasn't entirely invested in her past relationship.",
            "The story presents an engaging premise centered around the Bernardi Brothers and their late grandfather's clever scheme: each brother must marry within six weeks to secure their inheritance. This charming plan encourages the brothers to confront their feelings for the significant people already in their lives."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The novel has a charming premise and a sweet central romance, particularly with Angelo’s well-developed character. However, Olivia’s emotional journey feels inconsistent and rushed, which detracts from the believability of her relationship with Angelo. Despite these flaws, the story is enjoyable and leaves me eager to explore the other brothers’ tales.",
