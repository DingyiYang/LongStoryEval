However, conveying the intricacies of complex family relationships through one-sided phone calls proves challenging. In fact, it hinders the story overall.",

            "The story unfolds through one-sided telephone conversations between Luciana and her older sister, Mari, which takes some adjustment. Essentially, the narrative consists of Luciana's monologue, interspersed with brief real-life interactions. The blending of calls and conversations within the same chapters can initially be confusing, especially since italicized text signifies off-phone exchanges, requiring readers to infer the speaker based on context. Even by the conclusion, I often found myself pausing to determine who was speaking.",

A fiery figure with an impressive knack for holding grudges, her backstory sheds light on her compelling personality. The narrative intertwines Abue's experiences with Luciana's own journey, revealing profound tragedies that shape her life. Through her conversations with Mari, Luciana discovers Abue's past and grasps the importance of living fully, independent of others’ approval.",

It only took me one chapter to get into it.  \n   - This style felt intimate, as if I were listening to someone’s private phone call, which added a layer of authenticity to Luciana’s character.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n   - This coming-of-age story shattered my preconceived notions of how a story can be told.  \n   - I would pick up Luciana’s call in a heartbeat—she’s that compelling.  \n   - Melissa Mogollon’s debut is unforgettable, and I’m grateful to Hogarth for the ARC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*OYE* is a heartfelt, humorous, and deeply moving coming-of-age story that explores family, duty, and self-discovery through the lens of a unique narrative style. Luciana and Abue are unforgettable characters, and their journey left me both laughing and reflecting on the complexities of family. Melissa Mogollon’s debut is a triumph.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story is conveyed through Luciana's one-sided phone conversations with her sister Mari. While this approach feels authentic, it can also be repetitive and disjointed. The narrative shifts between past events and the ongoing call, occasionally disrupting the flow. Family history is revealed in segments that risk info-dumping, which detracts from the narrative's natural feel. Ultimately, this experimental format functions more as a plot device than as an organic means of unfolding the story.",
            "In this novel, the main character, Luciana, feels one-dimensional and lacks significant development. Any glimpses of change in her character come off as superficial, and the phone call format creates a disconnect between the reader and Luciana. Most characters, aside from Abue, the grandmother, remain static and underdeveloped. Abue stands out as a vibrant and humorous presence, carrying the story with her larger-than-life personality and quick wit. Overall, the novel leans more toward plot-driven storytelling, with interconnected phone calls prioritizing events over character exploration. While the themes of family secrets and intergenerational trauma are poignant, they are ultimately overshadowed by a lack of character depth.",
            "The story's exploration of intergenerational trauma and familial expectations is powerful, yet the narrative format detracted from my emotional engagement. While Abue's humor and vibrancy created memorable and engaging moments, other characters fell flat and failed to elicit the same connection.",

            "The main character was insufferable, her dialogue and mindset reflecting a sanitized perspective reminiscent of the disdain some Americanized relatives have for Colombian culture. In contrast, the grandmother offered a critique I appreciated, particularly regarding the obsession with plastic surgery. While the mother was somewhat reasonable, her homophobia rendered her irredeemable. The older sister faced constant scolding from the main character and was punished for distancing herself from such toxic dynamics, and I empathized with her struggle.",
            "The book reads more as a critique of Colombian culture than a celebration of it. While the exploration of family secrets and the challenges of being gay in a homophobic household offer some intrigue, the main character's frustrating personality detracts from the overall enjoyment of these themes.",

It just took some getting used to.  \n\n- **Characters**  \n   - The main character was unbearable. Her dialogue and mindset were extremely whitewashed, resembling the disdain some of my Americanized relatives have for Colombian culture.  \n   - The grandmother, central to the story, embodied a critique of Colombian culture I could agree with: the obsession with plastic surgery.  \n   - The mother was one of the more reasonable characters, but her homophobia made her irredeemable.  \n   - The older sister was constantly yelled at by the main character and punished for distancing herself from the family, which I understood given the toxic dynamics.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation**  \n   - The book felt like a series of criticisms of Colombian culture rather than a celebration.  \n   - The only somewhat interesting aspects were the uncovering of family secrets and the exploration of being gay in a homophobic household. However, the main character’s annoying personality made even these parts hard to enjoy.  \n\n- **Overall Impression**  \n   - This is not my favorite Colombian book—far from it.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**\n   - The book is incredibly funny, and I found myself laughing constantly while reading it. Luciana, the main character, is hilarious and can't go a page without making jokes, even about serious topics. While a few jokes didn’t land, the vast majority were laugh-out-loud funny.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Format:**\n   - The story is told through Luciana’s phone calls to her sister, Mari, who is studying abroad. This format creates a unique and engaging way of storytelling, as Luciana shares her life updates and experiences with Mari (and, by extension, the reader). The narrative feels like a friend sharing gossip, complete with phrases like “You won’t believe what she said next” or “Wait until you hear what happened next.”\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Luciana is a well-developed and entertaining protagonist. Her interactions with her mother, grandmother, father, and others add depth to her character and provide context to her life. These moments, presented as memories, complement the phone call format nicely.\n\n- **Subplot and Pacing:**\n   - The subplot involving the grandmother’s past is intriguing and adds an interesting layer to the story. However, it becomes somewhat overwhelming toward the end, consuming too much of the narrative and losing some of its initial appeal. Despite this, it remains a strong part of the book.\n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**\n   - Listening to the audiobook enhanced the experience significantly. The format of the book, with its conversational tone, lends itself perfectly to an audiobook, making it feel even more real and engaging. I believe the humor and storytelling wouldn’t have been as impactful without the audiobook.\n\n- **Engagement and Repetitiveness:**\n   - The book starts strong and remains captivating for about 80% of the story. However, toward the end, it becomes slightly repetitive and less addictive, which slowed my progress. Despite this, the overall experience was fantastic.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**\n   - Despite its light and simple format, the book manages to tackle delicate topics effectively. It balances humor with moments of depth, making it a well-rounded read.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this is a quick, light, and highly entertaining read. The unique phone call format, combined with Luciana’s humor and the engaging subplot about her grandmother, makes for a memorable experience. While the ending felt a bit repetitive, the book remains fantastic for the majority of its length. I highly recommend experiencing it as an audiobook for an even more immersive and enjoyable journey.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Humor and Tone: 9/10  \n- Narrative Style and Format: 10/10  \n- Character Development: 8/10  \n- Subplot and Pacing: 7/10  \n- Audiobook Experience: 10/10  \n- Engagement and Repetitiveness: 7/10  \n- Themes and Depth: 8/10  \n\n**Overall Rating:** 8.5/10"

The witty and entertaining narrative style makes it hard to put down, and it can easily be read in one day.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The story is told in a unique format: a first-person narrative via one-way telephone conversations. Once you get into the groove of this style, it becomes an engaging and immersive experience.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The novel is a multigenerational coming-of-age telenovela that explores the realities of being a second-generation Colombian-American teen. It delves into themes like patriarchal Colombian society, toxic masculinity, sexuality, and complex family relationships. The story also highlights the granddaughter’s immense love and adoration for her grandmother, a vivacious and larger-than-life character.\n\n- **Cultural Resonance:**  \n  Luciana’s frustration with her appearance-obsessed culture resonated deeply with me. I, too, grew up in a generation of women who placed excessive value on looks, material things, and reputation as measures of success and happiness. Like Luciana, I found conversations with such women superficial and daft.\n\n- **Advocacy and Autonomy:**  \n  I strongly related to Luciana’s advocacy for her grandmother’s health autonomy. She consistently championed her grandmother’s right to receive information and make informed medical decisions. This mirrors my own cultural experience, where sickly elderly relatives are often infantilized, and adult children take over decision-making, even when the patient is of sound mind.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this warm, lighthearted, and highly relevant read.

As Luciana becomes the sole family member able to support Abue during her health crisis, she earns her grandmother’s deep trust. This relationship not only deepens Luciana’s understanding of Abue’s past but also sheds light on the intricate dynamics of her family.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**\n   - The novel is a zany coming-of-age story where the protagonist, Luciana, is unexpectedly thrust into adulthood as she becomes a caretaker, translator, and secret keeper for her eccentric grandmother, Abue.\n   - The story is structured to feel like overhearing a series of conversations, reminiscent of a telenovela family drama, primarily between Luciana and her perpetually absent sister, Mari.\n   - The plot revolves around a family crisis triggered by Abue's refusal to leave her Miami home during Hurricane Irma, leading to various antics and emotional moments.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Luciana is portrayed as the overlooked baby of a large Colombian-American family, yearning for a normal teenage life but forced into adult responsibilities.\n   - Mari, the favorite child, is often absent, creating a dynamic that highlights Luciana's struggles and feelings of neglect.\n   - Some characters, however, are flattened to one-dimensional roles due to the repetitive nature of the one-sided conversation structure.\n\n- **Themes and Issues:**\n   - The novel addresses relevant issues faced by immigrants and their second-generation children, blending personal and socio-political themes.\n   - The author uses cutting sarcasm, humor, and heart to explore these themes, making the narrative both engaging and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The conversational style, while unique and fitting for the story, may tire some readers due to its repetitive nature.\n   - The humor and sarcasm are well-executed, adding depth and entertainment to the narrative.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - The book is an entertaining read, though its unique structure and character development may polarize readers—some will love it, while others may not.\n   - Despite minor flaws, the novel leaves a positive impression, and the reviewer looks forward to the author's future works.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOye is a humorous and heartfelt coming-of-age novel that delves into the complexities of immigrant family dynamics and personal growth.

It often makes the scenes feel staged and the emotions hard to connect with. However, this book completely defied my expectations. The story is told as Luciana’s side of phone calls with her sister who has left for college, which I think works particularly well as an audiobook once you understand the format.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book gripped me early on, and I could not put it down. The pacing was excellent, and the story kept me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Everyone in the story is so vivid. The characters felt real and well-developed, making it easy to connect with them.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  There is so much passion behind the humor and the drama.

It was hard to read how Nana was infantilized so much, stripped of her agency and voice, even though she carried a significant burden.  \n   - I loved the grandmother and how she lived her life on her own terms.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The story made me cry, and it gave me \"caracol-vibes\" (snail vibes) because of the granddaughter-grandmother relationship.  \n\n- **Innovative Format:**  \n   - The format felt fresh and innovative, though I think the author could have delved deeper into Nana’s mom and her relationship with the grandmother. That said, the mom didn’t feel like a necessary character to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was emotionally impactful, with a unique format and strong themes of family and agency.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story revolves around a young Colombian woman/teenager whose grandmother falls ill. It is told through one side of a phone conversation—the narrator speaking to her sister—which was a unique storytelling style. While it took me some time to get into this format, it eventually became engaging. The narrative evolves to include the stories of her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, adding depth and richness to the plot.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book felt a little long, and I believe it could have been perfect if shortened by about 25%. Some sections seemed to drag, which slightly affected my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The major theme of the novel is how experiences and relationships shape us—our personalities, choices, and understanding of others. The book explores this idea in a heartfelt and meaningful way, emphasizing that knowing someone’s story helps them make more sense. It was both funny and touching, leaving a lasting emotional impression.  \n\n- **Originality and Style:**  \n  The storytelling style was unusual and refreshing, though it took some adjustment to fully appreciate. The humor and emotional depth made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a heartfelt and unusual book that explores the profound impact of family history and relationships on personal identity. While the pacing could have been tighter, the unique narrative style and emotional depth made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

            "The novel employs a unique structure, presenting a series of one-sided phone calls from Luciana to her older sister, Mari. While this literary approach is inspired, the narrative rhythm and style may not resonate with everyone; some readers might find it joyful, while others could see it as frustrating. The story evolves significantly throughout the book, necessitating a complete read for a comprehensive review. Central to the narrative is Abue's serious medical diagnosis and Luciana's transition into a caregiving role during her senior year of high school. The novel thoughtfully explores themes of family, responsibility, and the complexities of caregiving, all set against the looming threat of a hurricane.",
            "Luciana, the vibrant narrator, captivates with her spunky and engaging voice. Her relationship with her grandmother, Abue, is both warm and occasionally tense, adding depth to the narrative. The portrayal of family dynamics, including the absent sister Mari and Luciana's mother's increasingly erratic behavior, is vivid and compelling.",

The visual storytelling and the engaging character of Luciana suggest it could be a strong candidate for an indie film, especially considering the scarcity of Latino-centered films featuring positive characters."

The author skillfully established their distinct personalities, making it easy to identify who was speaking—whether it was Abue, Mari, Carmen, or the great Auntie. The only confusion arose between Carmen and Mari, but it was minor and didn’t detract from the story. I found Luciana’s sassiness and Abue’s sharp tongue thrilling, as they reminded me of my own experiences in a toxic family. While I wouldn’t want to spend too much time with them, I could easily imagine being entertained by their banter at a family reunion. Initially, I sided with Luciana and felt frustrated by Mari’s absence. However, as I reflected on the novel, I began to appreciate Mari’s character more.

I was thrilled and a little jealous about the first published novelist in my semi-immediate family, so I was already prepared to love it.  \n   - While I didn’t love it, I didn’t hate it either. I was initially caught up in the excitement of reading a book by a family member, even though I’ve never met Melissa. Knowing her father, my first cousin, made it super exciting to see our shared surname on the cover of a book.  \n\n- **Character Development and Identification:**  \n   - I found it difficult to identify with most of the characters initially, but I eventually found some appreciation for them.  \n   - Melissa did a great job of establishing the personalities of the characters. Even if not immediately, I was always able to discern who was speaking—whether it was Abue, Mari, Carmen, or the great Auntie. The only time I questioned was between Carmen and Mari, but at those times, it didn’t really matter.  \n   - I found a thrill in Luciana’s sassiness and Abue’s sharp tongue, having grown up in a fairly toxic family myself. While I wouldn’t want to hang out with them much, I could picture encountering them at family reunions and being entertained by their banter and bickering.  \n   - At first, I was on Luciana’s side and annoyed at the absent character of her older sister, Mari. However, as I reflected more on the novel, I found myself appreciating and identifying with Mari much more. Her desire to escape the drama and toxicity resonated with me, reminding me of aspects of my own family.  \n\n- **Plot and Format:**  \n   - Unlike other reviewers, I did not find it terribly difficult to follow the plot or distinguish which characters were speaking.  \n   - The dialogue style was fun for the first 30 pages, but after that, it became a chore that got in the way of appreciating the story. The format made it harder to fully engage with the narrative.  \n   - I feel like the book dives into family dynamics unapologetically, which I appreciated. However, I also feel like it could have been so much more if it had been written in a better format.  \n\n- **Potential for Further Exploration:**  \n   - I would have liked to get more insight into Carmen, the father, or even Mari. Perhaps these could be explored in follow-up books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I liked the book for its unapologetic exploration of family dynamics and its relatable characters, particularly Mari. However, the format and dialogue style hindered my full enjoyment of the story. While I didn’t love it as much as I initially hoped, I appreciated the experience and the thrill of reading a book by a family member.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- \"I liked it\" (implied but not explicitly rated)."

            "Luciana's perspective as a Colombian-American teenager navigating family dynamics, her grandmother's illness, and her future aspirations is both well-developed and engaging. In contrast, Mari's voice feels underrepresented, with only one section dedicated to her, leaving me craving deeper insight into her experiences and emotions. The storyline about their great-grandmother Fernanda is more compelling than the present-day narrative, and I would have preferred a novel centered on that historical aspect.",

            "Luciana's character is introduced in a heavy-handed manner, making it difficult to connect with her perspective. As the family's emotional anchor at a young age, she often feels overwhelmed, and her growth can seem stagnant due to repetitive grievances. However, the second half of the story reveals a softer side of Luciana, making her journey of self-discovery and healing her inner child both endearing and relatable. The novel explores the complexities of family dynamics, particularly the contrast between Luciana's responsibilities and her sister Mari's freedom. While Luciana's evolving understanding of her grandmother's choices adds depth, her harsh judgments of Mari's behavior remain unresolved and problematic. Mari is frequently depicted as the target of jokes, which undermines the potential for deeper sibling reconciliation. The story also addresses internalized misogyny through Luciana's lens, highlighting her struggles with femininity and her judgments of others. Although Luciana learns to empathize with her grandmother, her lack of grace toward her sister represents a missed opportunity for broader character development.",

This tumultuous event sets the stage for the revelation of Abue's illness and the emotional impact it has on Luciana."

            "The story centers on Luciana, an 18-year-old high school senior who has come out as a lesbian, except to her grandmother. Family dynamics play a crucial role, with her sister Mari away at college, her father frequently absent, and her mother revealing the darker aspects of their family history during a hurricane evacuation. The narrative unfolds through one-sided phone conversations, capturing Luciana's anger and edginess as she navigates her coming-of-age journey and uncovers her grandmother’s past in Colombia.",
            "Luciana's character is both raw and relatable, marked by her frequent use of profanity and her challenges with family dynamics. I was particularly struck by the warmth and complexity of her family, despite their imperfections. Luciana's journey focuses more on finding her place within the family and learning to prioritize herself, rather than solely on her sexual identity, which I found refreshing.",
            "The book's style, reminiscent of one-sided phone conversations, initially required some adjustment but ultimately added a unique flavor to the storytelling. The humor, while occasionally grim or insulting, felt authentic and enriched the characters. However, the frequent use of modern slang, such as referring to women as \"Bro\" or \"Dude,\" felt excessive to me.",

I empathized with Luciana, just beginning her adult life, and her grandmother, nearing the end of hers. The gradual unfolding of family history allowed both Luciana and the reader to process these revelations in a realistic manner.",

            "The book unfolds entirely through phone conversations between 17-year-old Nana and her older sister, Mari, who is away at college. We only hear Nana's side of the dialogue, yet through her sarcastic jabs at her sister, we discover themes of empathy, identity, and personal growth. In a poignant juxtaposition, Nana reflects on her grandmother's passing, describing it as both romantic and a tribute to Bad Bitch Incorporated.",

Nana's dialogue is so genuine that it feels as if I were on the other end of the call, rather than merely eavesdropping.

This work serves as a masterclass in crafting dimensional young characters that resonate with their time period, avoiding clichés and absurdity.",

It wasn't like I was listening in on their conversation but like I was the one on the other end of the call.\n   - It's unreal to me how much depth Mogollon gave to her characters without ever breaking from the phone call structure.\n   - It's a masterclass in how to write dimensional, young characters true to their time period without being trite or ridiculous.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Style:**\n   - The entire book is told through phone conversations between 17-year-old Nana and her older sister, Mari, who is away at college. We only hear Nana's side of the call.\n   - Somehow, while Nana is sarcastically berating her big sister, we're also uncovering empathy, identity, and growth.\n   - In the same breath, she talks about the end of her grandmother's life as being both romantic and a \"nod to Bad Bitch Incorporated.\"\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**\n   - This book is about the women in our families, our matrilineal lines. It's about the weight women carry from their pasts and their mothers' pasts.\n   - It's about the pain we hide from one another and the way it shows up without our permission.\n   - It's about the capacity for love and understanding that we don't always expect to see in our foremothers but that is, more often than not, there.\n   - The end of the book tore my heart to pieces but promptly put it all back together. It was tragic but cathartic and hopeful.\n\n- **Personal Connection and Relatability:**\n   - I connected to Nana and Mari's story more than I'd like to admit.

            "Luciana’s voice is brilliantly frantic, perfectly embodying her hypochondriac tendencies, queer identity, second-sibling challenges, and the pressures of senior year alongside an overbearing mother. The character development of all the women in the story is impressively nuanced and well-crafted. Luciana’s perspective, rich with fear, grief, and confusion, resonates deeply and feels genuinely authentic.",
            "This novel beautifully explores the complexities of female family relationships, encompassing both intergenerational and international dynamics. The sisterly bond is portrayed with authenticity, capturing its flaws while revealing a tender core. The relationship between Luciana and her grandmother, Abue, is a poignant depiction of complexity and humanity, leaving a lasting emotional impact. The narrative illustrates how each woman navigates challenging situations and emotions in distinct ways, often overlooking the validity of one another's struggles.",
            "The one-sided phone conversation is a remarkably creative and compelling narrative. Its stream-of-consciousness style, filled with random connections, memories, and anecdotes, feels both authentic and engaging. This approach evokes a modern-day *Mrs. Dalloway*, which I found truly captivating."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a phenomenal coming-of-age story that combines a unique narrative style, rich character development, and deeply moving themes. The exploration of female family relationships, particularly the sister and grandmother-granddaughter dynamics, is both authentic and emotionally resonant. The plot is entertaining and melodramatic in the best way, and the audiobook experience is highly recommended. Overall, this is a standout read that I thoroughly enjoyed.",

            "The book is structured entirely around one-sided phone calls between the main character, Luisa, and her older sister, who is away at college. The narrative begins with the evacuation for Hurricane Irma and unfolds through their conversations.",
            "The blend of Spanish and English in the narrative immerses readers, evoking personal memories of family interactions. The story unfolds like a telenovela, rich with scandalous and somber family secrets, while also celebrating the resilience of its women.",
            "This novel intricately examines the lives of the women in Luisa’s family, beginning with her orphaned great-grandmother from Colombia. It vividly portrays her grandmother's traumatic childhood, which molded her into a dramatic, beauty-obsessed, and spirited woman. The narrative also highlights their mother’s immigration journey, showcasing the stark contrast in opportunities available to the sisters compared to previous generations.",
            "I empathized with Luisa’s frustration as a translator and mediator, particularly her struggle to accept her grandmother’s declining health and refusal of treatment at just 17. Her fear and anger at facing this challenge alone resonated deeply with me. As a mother and a descendant of resilient women, I understood the choices made by the older sister. The story evoked strong emotions, making me long to hear the voices of my own grandmother and aunt one last time. Through Luisa's phone calls, we experience her emotional journey as she shares updates about their grandmother's health, the arrival of visitors, her frustration with being left to manage their mother, and her hesitance about being openly gay. This narrative beautifully captures the strength, struggles, and dreams of women across generations in their family."

However, listening to the audiobook in the car made it click for me. The story is told through a series of phone calls between Luciana and Mari (the reader), and we only hear Luciana’s side. Over time, I found myself responding and reacting to her words, which made the experience feel more conversational and immersive.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Relatability:**  \n   - I didn’t expect to get so emotionally invested in the storyline, but it resonated deeply with me. It brought back memories of similar events in my own life, especially as a Latino in the U.S. The book captures the challenges of translating important life moments to our parents while staying neutral, even when we’re the ones asking tough questions. It also highlights the added difficulty of navigating these responsibilities while in high school.  \n\n- **Personal Reflection and Healing:**  \n   - When I went through similar experiences, I didn’t have an older sister figure like Luciana to turn to, and I think having someone like her would have made a big difference. By the end of the book, I felt like I had processed some of my own experiences through Luciana’s perspective, which helped heal old wounds.  \n\n- **Themes of Identity and Struggle:**  \n   - The book provides a poignant glimpse into the struggles many Latinos face in the U.S., particularly the pressure to balance family responsibilities with personal aspirations. Luciana’s internal conflict about applying for college—wondering if it’s even worth it when life feels like it’s falling apart—hit close to home. It reminded me of my own struggles with focusing on essay questions and choosing a major during difficult times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was unexpectedly impactful, blending a unique narrative style with deeply relatable themes. It not only immersed me in Luciana’s story but also helped me reflect on and heal from my own experiences.

            "The story unfolds at a moderate pace, emphasizing character development and depth.",
            "The character development in this story is outstanding, especially for Abue, the protagonist's grandmother. By the end, I found myself truly loving Abue and felt the profound bond between her and Luciana. The author adeptly illustrates how the main character recognizes the flaws in her family while remaining blind to how those same traits appear in herself.",
            "The book presents itself as an overheard telephone conversation between Luciana and her sister Mari, capturing only Luciana's side. This dialogue-driven format resembles a play, which initially took some time to get used to. However, once I adjusted, I found myself fully immersed in the story.",
            "The story delves into intricate family dynamics and the effects of unresolved emotions, particularly suggesting that Abue’s cancer may stem from her unaddressed childhood feelings. As someone who has lost a parent to cancer, I found this notion troubling, as it implies that illness arises from an inability to cope with negative experiences."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a compelling and unique novel with strong character development and emotional depth. While the writing style is initially challenging, it becomes immersive, and the portrayal of family relationships is both touching and thought-provoking. However, the handling of certain themes, such as the implications about cancer and the main character’s judgmental behavior, detracted slightly from my enjoyment.",

            "I appreciated the inventive framing of this story as a phone call between sisters, which made me feel like a participant in their intimate family conversations. However, the narrative flow was uneven. It began with the promise of a mother-daughter tale, particularly with Luciana and her mom fleeing Hurricane Irma, but quickly shifted to themes of generational trauma and the challenges of being the family black sheep. This abrupt change left me expecting a reconciliation that never materialized, which felt misleading.",

Initially, it seemed like a mother-daughter tale, but it sharply shifted to focus on generational trauma and navigating family as the black sheep.  \n   - The beginning, with Luciana and her mom fleeing Hurricane Irma, set up expectations for a reconciliation or understanding between mother and daughter, which never happened. This felt misleading.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The central theme is Luciana learning not to carry the burdens of her family and embracing herself. While this is powerful, the setup could have been handled differently to align better with the story's direction.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Strengths:**  \n   - Despite the pacing issues, *Oye* is a wonderful story with layers, and I really enjoyed reading it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt exploration of family, identity, and generational trauma, framed in an inventive and engaging way.

            "The novel features a distinctive narrative style, unfolding through voicemails left by the main character. Initially, it took me a few chapters to acclimate to this format and understand that the story is conveyed through these messages.

It examines the complexities of their relationships, including an absent sister at college, a mother who views the disaster as a chance for travel, and a grandmother grappling with health issues while confined to her apartment. As the protagonist shares her experiences through voicemails, layers of her life are gradually unveiled, offering insights into her struggles and adventures, such as getting lost on a Florida highway or encountering an alligator after visiting a gay bar.",

As someone with Mexican lineage and married to a Honduran, I found the emotional conflicts, especially around the medical aspects and end-of-life care of one of the characters, incredibly relatable.  \n\n- **Humor and Bilingual Elements:**  \n  The humor in this book had me laughing out loud! At times, I even made my bilingual husband read parts so he could understand why I was cracking up. The author nailed the use of Spanish and Spanglish, and some things are just funnier in those languages.

            "In this poignant story, Luciana, a gay teen, grapples with her identity within a conservative Colombian immigrant family in Miami. Tension simmers between her and her older sister, Mari, who is away at school and seemingly avoiding the family during a crisis. The beloved grandmother, whose illness becomes a focal point of the family drama, adds depth to the narrative. The relationship between Luciana and her grandmother is particularly touching and well-developed. Through Luciana's perspective, the novel delves into the complexities of being the family's sole voice of reason amid turmoil. Her phone conversations with Mari reveal the family's unusual history, enriching the story's emotional landscape. I appreciated the exploration of family dynamics and history, which beautifully enhances the overall narrative.",

While this approach is intriguing, it sometimes undermines Luciana's credibility as a high school student applying to colleges. Her voice often comes across as childish and immature, making it challenging to fully connect with her character. I found myself oscillating between annoyance and admiration for her commitment to supporting her grandmother during a difficult time.",

The conversations between Luciana and her sister, Mari, vividly echoed my family's experience during my Abue's illness.

While this approach was interesting, I found it hard to believe that Luciana, a high schooler applying to colleges, was the narrator.

The plot culminates in a satisfying, bittersweet ending that hints at a possible continuation from Mari's viewpoint.",

The lack of quotation marks made it difficult to discern who was speaking, and I wished to “hear” voices other than Luciana’s.  \n   - Luciana’s rants and soliloquies felt overwhelming, akin to a marathon of words without punctuation, reminiscent of some of my students’ text messages. This made the reading experience exhausting at times.  \n\n- **Authorial Intent and Impact:**  \n   - In retrospect, I considered that the author might have intentionally crafted the narrative this way to immerse readers in the nuances of Luciana’s life rather than simply describing it.

            "The novel employs an unorthodox structure, consisting of one-sided phone conversations between Luciana and her sister Mari, with other voices indicated in italics. This format often left me confused about who was speaking, and I believe it would be more effective as an audiobook with skilled readers or as a stage production. The conversations tend to meander, contributing to the cumbersome nature of the format. The story begins with Luciana and her mother preparing to evacuate due to a hurricane, while Abue stubbornly refuses to leave her home. As the plot unfolds, they return to find Abue in a serious health crisis, leading to revelations about her past and impending death. The pacing is uneven, with some sections feeling slow due to the rambling dialogue.",
            "Luciana is a relatable teenage protagonist navigating family issues, her coming out as a lesbian, and feelings of neglect from her sister Mari, who is preoccupied with college life. Abue, their grandmother, plays a pivotal role as her past and present struggles unfold, shedding light on her behavior and attitudes toward the family. The story delves deeply into the relationships between Luciana, her mother, and Abue, highlighting the generational conflicts and emotional bonds that shape their lives.",
            "The novel explores universal themes of family dynamics, personal identity, health, wellness, death, and religion. The deep-rooted family issues, tracing back to Abue’s ancestors, add complexity to the narrative. Additionally, the Spanish chapter titles enrich the story with cultural depth.",
            "Marketed as a “coming-of-age comedy,” the humor is initially limited, with the first genuine laugh coming when Luciana likens the governor to Voldemort. The tone fluctuates between serious and comedic, capturing the complexities of the characters' lives."

        "conclusion": "Initially, the novel’s unconventional structure and format made it challenging to engage with, but the depth of its themes and character development ultimately won me over. The story’s exploration of family, identity, and generational trauma is both poignant and thought-provoking. Despite its flaws, I’m glad I gave this book a chance.",

Initially, the dialogue and setup were confusing, but once I got used to it, the narrative flowed smoothly.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story follows Luciana as she tries to escape a hurricane and faces numerous obstacles during and after the event. It explores deep themes such as the meaning of life, death, and coming of age, while also incorporating abstract ideas and ideals through character interactions.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The characters are well-developed, with strong family ties and dynamic relationships. I particularly loved the cultural elements woven into their personalities and interactions.  \n\n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n  Despite its heavy themes, the book includes comedic relief with several laugh-out-loud (LOL) moments that keep the tone light and airy.  \n\n- **Ending and Story Resolution:**  \n  If you prefer a book with a clear storyline and a definitive conclusion, this might not be the best choice, as the narrative is more abstract and open-ended.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel takes readers on a unique journey through the eyes of Luciana, blending deep philosophical themes with humor and cultural richness.

This format provides insight into Luciana’s life with her mother and grandmother, as well as her emotional struggles. However, the monologue becomes repetitious, making it challenging to stay engaged with the storyline.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, including Luciana, her mother, and her grandmother, are portrayed as lovable and humorous. The reader learns about the grandmother’s tragic history, which adds depth to her character and the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Melissa Mogollon’s use of italics to designate specific conversations is confusing at times. While the characters are endearing, the stylistic choices can be distracting and detract from the reading experience.  \n\n- **Plot Engagement:**  \n  The storyline, which includes an auto trip to escape a hurricane and the subsequent discovery of the grandmother’s cancer diagnosis, has potential. However, the repetitive nature of the monologue made it difficult for me to maintain interest in the plot.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  Despite my personal reservations about the writing style and narrative structure, I believe this novel could resonate with a specific audience who appreciates its unique approach and character-driven focus.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel features lovable and humorous characters, the repetitive monologue and confusing stylistic choices made it challenging for me to stay engaged. Nonetheless, the story’s emotional depth and unique narrative format may appeal to certain readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Most of the narrative unfolds through Luciana's phone conversations with Mari, interspersed with italicized snippets of dialogue between Luciana and her Abue or mother.

Most of the book consists of Luciana talking to Mari over the phone, with occasional snippets of conversation between her and Abue or her and her mother. These other conversations appear in italics, while the phone call itself is in regular print. While it is an unusual format, it works well for this story. At first, it was a little confusing, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes engaging and effective.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  My favorite characters are Luciana and Abue. Abue is eccentric and has a backstory that feels like a telenovela. She lives life fully rather than just existing. Unfortunately, she faces a difficult situation when she turns yellow while Luciana and her mother are evacuating from Hurricane Irma, requiring a hospital visit. This is where Luciana truly shines. While she was already a good character, the situation pushes her to rise to the occasion, showcasing her strength and depth.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The story moves at a decent pace, keeping the reader engaged throughout. The characters are likable and interesting, which adds to the overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I gave this book 5 out of 5 stars.

Luciana's wit and the unique conversational style make it a memorable read, though the writing style may not appeal to all readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I was so invested in the story and could not put it down.  \n  - It was hilarious and a perfect family drama. I ate it up!  \n  - I laughed so much and felt like I was actually on the phone with Luciana myself.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - Luciana was hilarious. If you enjoyed *Never Have I Ever* and the snarky, quick-witted teenage storytelling along with the eccentric family, this is for you!  \n  - All I could think about while reading was how much Luciana reminded me of Devi.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Format:**  \n  - The story is written in a one-sided phone conversation between Luciana and her sister Mari.  \n  - Imagine you’re walking around Target and a stranger is on their phone having a very detailed, family drama-filled conversation (not on speaker)—that was this book.  \n  - I won’t say I didn’t like the format, but I do think it would have delivered better via audio. (I will definitely be giving the audiobook a listen after pub date!)  \n\n- **Author’s Skill and Potential:**  \n  - I am genuinely blown away that this is a debut. It was so incredibly clever and brilliant.  \n  - I can’t wait to see what the author comes up with next!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its humor, engaging family drama, and brilliant characterization.

Tension arises with her older sister, who is absorbed in college life and does not return home to assist with their grandmother's declining health. The drama within Luciana's extended Colombian family enriches the narrative, emphasizing cultural and generational differences.",

It felt very YA (Young Adult), which shaped the overall tone and style of the novel.  \n\n- **Narrative Format:**  \n  The story is told through phone calls, which made it a great audiobook experience.

These themes were well-executed and resonated deeply.  \n\n- **Depth and Complexity:**  \n  While the story was enjoyable, I could’ve used a little more depth. This is sometimes a challenge in YA novels, and the phone call format further restricted the opportunity for deeper exploration.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a great read with beautiful themes and uplifting moments. The YA tone and phone call format made it unique, though they also limited the depth of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars rounded up to 4."

It felt like listening to someone talk on the phone without hearing the other person’s responses. While this took some getting used to, it was incredibly original and refreshing.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book is both hilarious and dramatic, blending humor with emotional depth. The conversational style adds a unique charm to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The story revolves around two sisters discussing family secrets, their dramatic grandmother, and their journey of self-discovery. The characters are well-developed and drive the narrative forward.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  At times, the book felt a bit long, likely due to its format and the fact that it is primarily character-driven rather than plot-driven.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a highly original and engaging read, blending humor and drama through a unique one-sided conversational format. While the pacing occasionally felt slow, the strong character development and witty dialogue make it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars"

However, the grandmother, Abue, refuses to leave with them. The narrative unfolds through phone conversations between Luciana, a high school senior, and her older sister Mari, who is away at college.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  The story is told through phone conversations, which I found very confusing at first. I had to read the beginning multiple times to grasp the style and understand how the story was being presented.  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  I was recommended this book as a sister story, but I struggled to connect with the characters, Luciana and Mari. Their personalities and interactions felt distant, and I couldn’t fully engage with their experiences.  \n\n- **Language and Tone:**  \n  The coarse language and the portrayal of teenage angst were off-putting for me. It made it harder to enjoy the story or feel invested in the characters’ journeys.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the story—a family navigating a hurricane and personal dynamics—was intriguing, the narrative style and my inability to connect with the characters made it a challenging read. The coarse language and teenage angst further detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Readers only see Luciana's side of the conversation, accompanied by italicized \"flashbacks\" interspersed throughout.\n   - Initially, I struggled to adapt to this style. The italicized flashbacks were confusing, and the absence of Mari's voice created a sense of \"emptiness.\" However, after a few chapters, I found myself settling into the rhythm and appreciating the creativity behind this approach.\n\n- **Characterization and Voice:**\n   - Luciana's voice is vibrant and colorful, making her perspective engaging and relatable. Over time, I was able to visualize her world more clearly through her eyes, which enhanced my connection to the story.\n   - The emotional depth of Luciana's experiences felt palpable, to the point where I could almost imagine myself living through the events alongside her.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**\n   - The novel explores complex themes, such as family dynamics, the challenges of growing up, and the tension between familial roles and personal identity. These themes are thoughtfully unpacked, offering plenty of material for reflection.\n   - While the narrative style imposes certain limitations, it also encourages readers to think deeply about the story and its underlying messages.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - Despite the initial challenges, I found the book to be a worthwhile and relatively quick read. Its unique approach and emotional resonance make it a memorable experience.\n   - I would recommend giving *Oye* a chance, though I acknowledge that its unconventional style may not appeal to everyone. It has significant potential and offers a fresh perspective on storytelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Oye* is a novel that stands out for its innovative narrative style and emotional depth. While it may take some time to adjust to its unique structure, the effort is rewarded with a compelling story and rich thematic exploration. Melissa Mogollon's creativity and Luciana's vibrant voice make this a book worth experiencing, even if it isn't for everyone.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"
