Although Eva, the main POV character, is the most developed, her motivations remain ambiguous. The absence of background information about the friend groups and their history renders relationships, such as the one between Eva and Colton, underdeveloped and unconvincing. Their chemistry is minimal, with their connection feeling forced and only justified by their mutual interest in surfing. Additionally, the potential for tension among characters is underutilized; there could have been more mistrust and conflict following the murder. Eva's immediate acceptance of Colton's suspicion regarding Miles also feels implausible.",

The abrupt chapter endings and a lack of deeper conflicts between characters diminished the overall stakes. While the premise of a classic murder mystery set in a secluded beach house during spring break was intriguing, the erratic cell service (e.g., with group chats functioning normally) detracted from the potential suspense.

            "The decision to delay the present-day events until about 120 pages in is a clever choice, allowing flashbacks to enrich the reader’s understanding of the characters. The varied fonts used for flashbacks within flashbacks effectively distinguish the timelines. The book is astonishing, with surprising twists, such as Danny's involvement and the revelation about the papers. The interview scenes, particularly those following Piper’s death, are captivating and skillfully written, keeping me engaged as I tried to discern who was lying and who might be guilty. The cliffhangers at the end of nearly every chapter are masterfully executed, making it nearly impossible to put the book down and leaving me constantly guessing at what would happen next.",
            "The use of flashbacks effectively develops the characters, making them feel like real individuals rather than mere plot devices, which is particularly impressive given the large cast of nine. These flashbacks also provide insight into Colton’s character and his secrets without compromising his authenticity. Eva’s choice to keep Piper’s phone instead of turning it in to the police feels genuine and adds depth to her character. The relationship between Eva and Colton is well-crafted, showcasing great chemistry that complements rather than overshadows the main plot. Additionally, the varied ways and timings of the couples' unions throughout the book add intrigue and keep the relationships engaging.",
            "The dialogue and behavior of the teens feel genuine and effortless, steering clear of the pitfalls of trying too hard to be modern or relatable. The inclusion of technology like Instagram and TikTok is present but not excessive, allowing the book to age gracefully without leaning too heavily on current trends.",
            "The iconic setting, coupled with the storm following the climax, enriches the atmosphere and elevates the overall experience."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a standout in its genre, with a gripping plot, well-developed characters, and authentic dialogue. The suspense is masterfully maintained through cliffhangers and unexpected twists, while the relationships and setting add depth and atmosphere. Despite a minor critique about Noah’s involvement, the book is a favorite and highly recommended, with the potential to become an all-time favorite upon re-reading.",
