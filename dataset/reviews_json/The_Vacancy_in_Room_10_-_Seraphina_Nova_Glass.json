            "This book's twists and ending were simply perfect. I enjoyed every moment of it. Since discovering Seraphina Nova Glass with *Such a Good Wife* in 2022, she has become an auto-buy author for me. In *The Vacancy in Room 10*, she dives into the action much earlier than in her previous works, which often feature a slower burn. However, I wasn't complaining; I was instantly captivated by the stories of Anna and Cass.",

The pacing takes a bit to warm up due to the number of characters, but it ultimately builds to a thrilling and satisfying \"WTF\" ending.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The characters are well-crafted and memorable. Anna's journey of uncovering the truth about Henry is compelling, but Cass, the jaded motel manager, steals the show. Her sarcasm and determination to keep Anna in the dark make her a standout. Her character arc is fascinating, and her evolution by the end is deeply satisfying. I loved her chapters and would love to revisit her in the future. The \"pool girls\" add some fun levity to the story, balancing the darker themes.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Version):**  \n  The audiobook version is fantastic. The narrators do an incredible job of conveying emotion and nuance, enhancing the overall experience.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  Seraphina Nova Glass's writing keeps the reader engaged with its suspenseful and layered storytelling. The themes of revenge, deception, and uncovering hidden truths are explored in a way that feels fresh and intriguing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a gripping thriller with a complex plot, well-developed characters, and a shocking ending. Cass's character arc is particularly satisfying, and the audiobook narration adds an extra layer of immersion. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful read with plenty of twists and a big \"WTF\" ending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nHighly recommended (no specific numerical rating provided in the review)."

The protagonists, Cass and Anna, reside in the Sycamores, a dilapidated motel converted into small apartments, symbolizing their bleak realities. Cass's husband was a cheating jerk who abandoned her financially, while Anna grapples with the aftermath of her husband's suicide, desperate to comprehend his last days. The supporting cast, including the pool girls and some unsavory characters, echoes the humorous, oddball figures found in *My Name is Earl*.",

The second is Cass, the handyman/manager of The Sycamores, a run-down motel turned low-rent apartment complex.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This was a fun popcorn thriller, but you definitely need to throw plausibility out the window and just go with the flow in order to enjoy it.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The atmospheric setting of The Sycamores was so well-written, and I LOVED the Pool Girls and Little Frank.  \n\n- **Ending and Pacing:**  \n  The biggest issue I had was the ending, which was so over-the-top (OTT) that it caused me to drop half a star.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book despite its implausible moments and the overly dramatic ending. The engaging setting and unique characters made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars."

The story wound down to a satisfying enough conclusion.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Cass is an interesting character—a \"handy ma'am\" who is rough around the edges but has a good heart. Rosa also stood out and didn’t disappoint. The characters' development and unpredictability added to the suspense, making it enjoyable to be proven wrong while reading.  \n\n- **Title and Setting:**  \n  The title felt misleading. There isn’t a vacancy, no Room 10, and the setting is an apartment community, not a motel. This disconnect was a bit jarring.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book often felt over-the-top, which, while fitting for the freedom of fiction, sometimes came across as more crass than necessary to emphasize the \"rough around the edges\" characterizations. Despite this, it was kind of fun.  \n\n- **Themes and Elements:**  \n  The found family theme, along with references to tools, Frank Sinatra, and Junior Mints, added charm and personality to the story.  \n\n- **External Critique (Goodreads Blurb):**  \n  The Goodreads blurb focused heavily on Anna, a character who was easy to forget when reviewing the actual book. This misalignment between the blurb and the story was disappointing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was an entertaining, albeit erratic, read with a satisfying conclusion. While the pacing started slow and the title felt misleading, the characters—especially Cass and Rosa—were compelling and added depth to the story. The over-the-top tone and crass moments were balanced by the fun elements and themes, making it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded up for the found family theme and charming details like tools, Frank Sinatra, and Junior Mints."

However, it felt like a bit of a slow burn for a short time in the second half, though the pace picked up again, and I was busily reading.  \n\n- **Narrative Perspective:**  \n  I particularly enjoyed Anna's narrative point of view the most, finding it the most interesting perspective between the two main female narrators.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  I had the \"who\" and \"why\" figured out by the middle of the book, but I was still curious about how the big reveal would play out. The suspense kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  All the characters are unreliable, which added to the intrigue. If you enjoy books with plenty of unreliable people, I recommend this one.  \n\n- **Secondary Characters:**  \n  There were a few parts with secondary characters that didn’t feel as essential to the story, but this didn’t detract significantly from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author's Work:**  \n  I enjoyed this suspenseful read and will look into reading backlist titles and future books by Seraphina Nova Glass.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Vacancy in Room 10* is a suspenseful and engaging novel with intriguing unreliable characters and alternating perspectives. While it had a brief slow section, the pacing picked up, and the mystery kept me hooked. I particularly enjoyed Anna's narrative and would recommend this book to fans of unreliable characters and suspenseful stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story is strong, and the dual perspectives of Anna and Cass are intriguing, even if their connection remains unclear initially. The mystery surrounding Henry's death effectively maintains engagement, though its resolution takes too long. Unfortunately, the final reveal is underwhelming and lacks believability, offering no hints about the killer's identity in advance. Cass's effort to frame Callum for multiple deaths feels rushed and is riddled with plot holes, while the police’s inability to see through her story strains credibility. The ending features excessive action and unresolved plot threads, detracting from its overall satisfaction as a thriller.\n\nThe mystery centers on Henry's death and a disturbing phone call he made to Anna shortly before he died. While the connection between Anna and Cass is gradually uncovered—with Cass possibly holding secrets about Henry’s death—the resolution feels overly simplistic and hastily executed. Furthermore, Anna's lack of proactivity diminishes the impact of the reveal.",
            "In this poignant narrative, Anna grapples with the grief of losing her husband, Henry, often overlooking the emotional turmoil he faced before his death. Cass, the strong-willed caretaker of The Sycamores, adds complexity with her manipulative tendencies. Meanwhile, Callum, Henry’s colleague, is also in mourning, having lost his wife, Lily, which establishes a parallel between him and Anna. The intricate relationships among the characters—particularly between Anna and Callum, and Cass and Eddie—enrich the storyline and deepen its emotional resonance.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Clarity and Flow:**  \n   - The beginning was a little confusing, but once I understood the story, it flowed smoothly from there.  \n   - The ambiguity in the plot was well-written and kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Character Development and Suspicion:**  \n   - I was NOT expecting the character to be involved until the book intentionally made me suspect him.  \n   - Looking back, there were subtle hints in his actions that should have made him suspicious earlier.  \n\n- **Realism and Logical Consistency:**  \n   - The idea of a petite woman digging a grave, burying a body, and then digging it up alone within 24 hours seemed unrealistic, especially for a grave that deep (9-11 feet).  \n   - If the body had been found in the original burial site, her DNA would likely have been discovered under his fingernails, which she didn’t consider.  \n\n- **Character Decision-Making:**  \n   - I felt she should have called 9-1-1 after figuring out his lies, as self-defense could have resolved the situation legally.  \n   - However, I understand she didn’t have all the information at that point, which influenced her decisions.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite some logical inconsistencies, I thought the book was written very well and was a GREAT read overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an engaging and well-written story with a few moments of confusion and some unrealistic elements. However, the plot’s ambiguity and character development kept me hooked, making it a highly enjoyable read despite its flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.4 ⭐️"

The strong female lead and the dual points of view (Cass and Anna) added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The sarcastic and humorous tone, especially from Cass, made the story enjoyable. The themes of secrets, relationships, and personal struggles were well-explored.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and engaging read with a fast-paced plot, complex characters, and a unique setting.

            "The story leaned heavily into the unrealistic, which is usually acceptable for me, but it felt excessive this time. Cass, an inexperienced serial killer, relied on a series of improbably lucky breaks that strained believability. However, the ending, while also far-fetched, was both surprising and impressive. The introduction of another strong female character at the conclusion served as a great twist and significantly enhanced the book.",

One of my favorite quotes from the book captures its essence perfectly: “But I do tell the important pieces — how you don’t always end up with the love of your life, but how they can still breathe new life into you and teach you forgiveness and grace.”",
            "While it's an enjoyable read, I wouldn't consider it particularly memorable. It’s entertaining enough, but if you choose not to read it, you won't feel like you’ve missed out on much. The story captured my attention throughout, and I found it easy to progress through. However, there was a sense that something essential was lacking."

If she believed it was merely Henry's drunken ramblings, why confront someone accused of murder instead of waiting to discuss it with Henry when he was sober?\n\nThe timing of the events was also unclear. How did Callum kill Henry before alerting the police? What was the time gap between Henry passing out in front of Cass’s apartment and his death?\n\nAdditionally, the narrative lacked clarity regarding how Callum killed Henry. The phone call to Anna suggested that Henry died during the call, yet it remained puzzling why he didn't cry out for help if he was being attacked.\n\nAnother inconsistency arose with Rosa’s knowledge of Cass taking the money after moving the body. Although Rosa tracked Cass’s location, it remains unclear how she specifically knew about the money. Overall, these gaps weakened the story significantly.",

How much time passed between Henry passing out in front of Cass’ apartment and his death?  \n  Additionally, we get no insight into how Callum killed Henry. The phone call to Anna made it seem like Henry died while on the phone, but why didn’t he cry for help if Callum was attacking him?  \n  Another inconsistency was Rosa knowing Cass took the money when she moved the body. While Rosa tracked Cass’s location, it’s unclear how she could have known about the money specifically.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  This was my first book from this author, and despite the issues, I found enough to enjoy that I’ll definitely check out more of their work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was engaging and offered a unique setting and characters, certain plot points felt messy and inconsistent, particularly around the confrontation with Callum, the timing of events, and Rosa’s knowledge of the money.

            "The story is well-paced and easy to read, providing a quick and enjoyable experience. However, some plot points, such as Henry's affair and the identity of the killer, were too obvious, diminishing the suspense. The book successfully blends elements of suspense and murder mystery, making it an engaging read. While the narrative is straightforward and entertaining, keeping me hooked, the mystery surrounding Henry's death felt intriguing yet ultimately predictable, stretching the reveal longer than necessary. Additionally, the ending was excessive, and the twist regarding the killer's identity didn't resonate with me.",
            "Cass is a relatable character whose struggles resonate with readers; however, her decision-making often seems irrational despite the explanations given. In contrast, Anna's quest to uncover the truth about her husband's death is compelling, and her storyline is more engaging than Cass's. While Cass's implicit class commentary adds depth, it occasionally feels judgmental, and the theme itself remains underdeveloped.",

To make ends meet, she takes a job at The Sycamores, an old motel converted into an apartment complex, in exchange for free rent. The plot escalates when Henry, a resident using his room as an art studio, confesses to his wife Anna that he has killed someone before taking his own life. This prompts Anna to seek answers at The Sycamores. As the narrative unfolds, Henry's murder becomes a central focus.

            "This story employs a dual POV, centering on Anna and Cass, residents of the Sycamores—a former motel converted into apartments. The plot unfolds around Anna’s husband, Henry, an artist who took his life after confessing to murder. As Anna settles into the Sycamores, she begins to suspect that Henry’s death may hold darker secrets. The initial third of the book feels sluggish, with the relevance of the hotel’s inhabitants not immediately apparent, but ultimately, the narrative comes together in a gratifying manner.",
            "Anna's nosiness, though somewhat off-putting, plays a crucial role in advancing the plot. Cass, the resourceful \"handy ma'am\" at the Sycamores, engages in shady dealings to make extra cash, adding complexity to her character. Additionally, the found family dynamic among the hotel residents is unexpectedly heartwarming and stands out as a highlight of the story.",
            "The novel delves into dark themes like domestic abuse, suicide, infidelity, and murder, all treated with sensitivity that heightens the story's tension. Despite these heavy subjects, the tone strikes a balance between intrigue and warmth, especially in the relationships among the characters.",
            "The book offered an intriguing mystery that kept me engaged throughout. Although the pacing began slowly, the satisfying payoff in the latter part of the story justified the wait. Overall, it was a solid and enjoyable read."

While there were some editing and timeline issues that were distracting, they didn’t overshadow the book’s strengths.

The characters, drawn from society’s marginalized groups—welfare mothers, elderly women raising grandchildren, and socially awkward individuals—bring depth to the narrative.

Each character is so well-developed that it’s impossible not to form a deep attachment to them.",

            "The story unfolds steadily, maintaining an intriguing sense of uncertainty regarding the connections between Cass, Anna, and Room 10. However, several storylines remain unresolved or disappear without explanation. The pacing feels imbalanced, with character development overshadowing the darker, suspenseful elements. Additionally, the ending comes across as rushed and poorly executed, missing the palpable excitement and danger that the buildup had promised. Some plotlines are wrapped up too conveniently, leaving certain aspects feeling unsatisfactorily underdeveloped.",
            "In this story, Cass, embittered by betrayal, transforms into a self-serving vigilante who blackmails unfaithful husbands for financial gain. Initially, her actions may seem unlikable, but her backstory and personality ultimately make her a more sympathetic character and vital to Anna's journey. Anna's desperate quest for answers regarding her husband's apparent suicide and her longing for closure resonate deeply, adding authenticity to her emotional turmoil and determination to uncover the truth. Both protagonists are flawed women who make impulsive, emotion-driven choices while resolutely pursuing their sense of justice, even at great personal risk. However, while the author attempts to flesh out the tenants of The Sycamores, they largely remain underdeveloped, serving merely as brief plot devices rather than significant contributors to the narrative. The blending of personal issues with the suspenseful mystery feels disjointed, detracting from the overall cohesion of the story.",
            "The novel delves into themes of loneliness, loss, and betrayal, highlighting the lengths to which people go to fill the void left by loved ones. Cass's bitterness and Anna's grief add emotional depth to the narrative, elevating it beyond a typical thriller.",
            "This novel captivated me until the very end, largely due to the intertwined lives of Cass and Anna and their connection to The Sycamores—a haven for those who are struggling. The alternating perspectives enriched the story, revealing their pasts and providing insight into their motives. This depth made it compelling to witness the convergence of their paths."

I will continue to read anything Seraphina Nova Glass writes because I love her work.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and Harlequin for providing me with an ARC in exchange for my honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Vacancy in Room 10* didn’t quite meet the high expectations set by Seraphina Nova Glass’s previous books, it was still an enjoyable read. The setting and character dynamics were engaging, but the mystery lacked the depth I was hoping for. Nonetheless, I remain a loyal fan of the author and look forward to her future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Henry's choice to hide crucial files in a bathrobe, which Anna fails to discover during her search, feels unrealistic. Additionally, the absence of any consequences for Cass, despite clear evidence linking her to Eddie's death, is frustrating. It also seems implausible that a terminally ill character like Henry would have the opportunity to cheat, especially given his condition and the public nature of his actions. Furthermore, Callum's attempt to resuscitate Eddie while he is bleeding out contradicts the story's overall logic.",
            "Cass's actions often come across as illogical, such as her failure to show up for her new job without even a phone call to explain her absence. Her misplaced anger toward Kimmy is frustrating, especially since she continues to blame Kimmy even after realizing that Reid is the real issue. Additionally, Cass's choice to accept Reid's dinner invitation, despite knowing he isn't good for her, feels redundant and unnecessary. Her awareness of Henry's affair with Callum's wife, combined with her failure to inform Anna, seems inconsistent with her character. The lack of communication among characters—like neighbors not telling Anna about Henry and Lily's affair—strikes as unrealistic. Lastly, Callum's decision to help Cass, even when he knows she has evidence against him, defies logic, especially given his assertion that there's no evidence linking him to Eddie's death.",
            "The opening chapters were captivating, but as the story unfolded, it became increasingly confusing. Much of the book centers on Cass and Eddie, which feels disconnected from Henry’s narrative and leaves critical questions about him unanswered. Several plot elements appear unnecessary and fail to advance the story, leading to frustration.",
            "The introduction of a cop questioning Cass introduced unnecessary complexity without any payoff. A more effective tension-building moment, such as the passing of a car, would have sufficed. Additionally, the video of Henry's confession and his subsequent suicide were not sufficiently explored, leaving Cass's lack of suspicion and inaction unaccounted for."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n   - The first couple of chapters were attention-grabbing, but the story became confusing as it progressed.  \n   - A large chunk of the book focused on Cass and Eddie's storyline, which felt disconnected from Henry's story, leaving key questions about Henry unresolved.  \n   - Many parts of the story seemed unnecessary and went nowhere, contributing to frustration.  \n\n- **Character Development and Decisions:**  \n   - Cass's actions often felt illogical, such as not showing up to her new job without even calling to make an excuse.  \n   - Her misplaced anger towards Kimmy was frustrating, especially since she continued to blame Kimmy even after realizing Reid was the problem.  \n   - Cass's decision to accept Reid's dinner invitation, despite already knowing he wasn't good for her, felt redundant and unnecessary.  \n\n- **Plot Coherence and Logic:**  \n   - Several plot points were introduced but never resolved, such as the cop taking Cass's information and her DNA being all over Eddie's body.  \n   - Henry's decision to hide important files in a bathrobe and Anna never finding them during her search felt unrealistic.  \n   - The lack of repercussions for Cass's actions, despite clear evidence linking her to Eddie's death, was frustrating.  \n\n- **Suspense and Tension:**  \n   - The introduction of a cop questioning Cass added unnecessary complexity without payoff. A simpler tension-building moment, like a passing car, would have sufficed.  \n   - The video of Henry's confession and his subsequent suicide were not explored deeply enough, leaving Cass's lack of suspicion and inaction unexplained.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n   - Cass's knowledge of Henry's affair with Callum's wife and her failure to share this information with Anna felt inconsistent with her character.  \n   - The lack of communication among characters, such as neighbors not informing Anna about Henry and Lily's affair, was unrealistic.  \n   - Callum's decision to help Cass, despite knowing she had evidence against him, was illogical, especially since he claimed there was no evidence tying him to Eddie's death.  \n\n- **Realism and Consistency:**  \n   - The idea of a terminally ill person like Henry having the opportunity to cheat, given his condition and the public nature of his actions, felt implausible.  \n   - Callum's attempt to resuscitate Eddie, despite the latter bleeding out, was inconsistent with the rest of the story's logic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel started strong but quickly became frustrating due to its lack of coherence, unresolved plot points, and illogical character decisions. While some elements, like the initial intrigue around Henry's story, showed promise, the overall execution fell short, leaving many questions unanswered and creating a sense of dissatisfaction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The frustration caused by the lack of editing made it impossible to continue.  \n- **Disappointment and Regret:**  \n  I was deeply disappointed by this book and regret purchasing it. The quality was so subpar that I wish I could get a refund for my purchase.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a significant letdown due to its terrible editing and lack of professionalism. The repetitive errors and overall poor quality made it impossible for me to finish, leaving me frustrated and wishing I hadn’t spent money on it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It lacked the engaging elements I look for in a novel, and I found it unmemorable overall.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book did improve slightly in pacing as it progressed, it ultimately fell short for me.
