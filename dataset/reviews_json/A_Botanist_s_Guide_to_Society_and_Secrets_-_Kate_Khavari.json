            "I struggled to get through the first 200 pages, but once I did, the characters and plot finally drew me in. The story only began to showcase the distinctive elements I enjoyed in the first two books after this point. The pacing felt slow, likely due to the introduction of numerous new characters and a more complex storyline. The investigative aspect was not what I expected; it wasn't until halfway through that the characters made any real progress in their search. Prior to that, events seemed more like irrelevant distractions than key plot points. Discoveries often felt random, as if the characters stumbled upon them, which undermined the story's credibility. However, the final 70 pages were a thrilling contrast, packed with action, tension, revelations, and twists that kept me engaged. Despite this strong ending, it couldn't fully compensate for my disappointment with the first half of the story.",
            "I appreciated how Alexander and Saffron finally opened up to each other and made an effort to bridge their differences. However, I didn't sense much chemistry between them. Saffron's relationship with Lee felt one-sided, as if she was merely using him for assistance rather than fostering a genuine friendship. Elizabeth was my favorite character; I enjoyed her POV chapters and her more prominent role in this book. She had depth, and I felt I got to know her better. In contrast, Saffron showed little character growth."

            "The plot was confusing and dull, lacking the complexity and intrigue of earlier installments. Previous books featured engaging mysteries with surprising twists, but this story felt stagnant until the end. The final revelations were unsatisfying and failed to compensate for the lackluster journey.",
            "I was eager to reconnect with Saffron, but she didn’t appear at the party in this installment. Unfortunately, she felt flat and replaceable, lacking growth or development. Her struggles with her father's history and governmental issues came across as repetitive and unengaging, missing the depth needed to drive the story. Similarly, Alexander, despite being more fleshed out, remained dull. The revelations about him lacked emotional resonance, feeling more like information than genuine insight. As a result, his relationship with Saffron felt unearned and lost its spark, making their resolution feel insincere. \n\nOn a positive note, Eliza was a standout character, exhibiting depth and complexity that enriched the narrative. Her expanded role was a highlight, though it couldn’t fully compensate for the main characters' lack of interest. Nick's involvement was a nice addition, and I found him quite intriguing.",
            "This book seemed the most out of place, likely falling victim to middle book syndrome. I remain hopeful for the teased direction of the next installment and wish it returns to the quality of the earlier entries, which I enjoyed much more."

Saffron and Alexander lacked depth, and the plot failed to deliver the intrigue and satisfaction of the previous books. Eliza and Nick were bright spots, but they couldn’t save the overall experience. I remain hopeful for the next book to recapture the magic of the earlier installments.",

However, I found Alexander's strange vibes off-putting. While I still lean towards choosing Lee, I recognize the complexity of their dynamics. Lee offers Saffron the freedom she craves, but his flirtatious nature can be risky. In contrast, Alexander seeks order and is fiercely protective of her, even if it feels suffocating. Their relationship evokes strong Stefan and Damon vibes from *Vampire Diaries*, but Saffron isn’t drawn to the bad boy trope.",

I was worried that we would never see this absolute charmer again, but alas, he is back and ready for some action!  \n   - What I didn’t like? Alexander’s weird vibes. Do I still feel like I would personally choose Lee? Maybe a little. In one sense, he gives our girl Saffron the freedom she needs, but is risky and flirtatious to a fault. Alexander craves order and would do anything to protect our little plant-lover from harm, even if she feels suffocated. This gives strong Stefan and Damon vibes (*Vampire Diaries*), and Saffron is just not into the bad boy trope.  \n\n- **Series Progression and Future Expectations:**  \n   - The ending leads me to believe we will get more of Ms. Everleigh, and the books, as seen in the average ratings on Goodreads, get better and better as we go. I am excited to see what happens next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *A Botanist’s Guide to Society and Secrets* is a compelling addition to the series, with a more complex plot, deeper themes, and intriguing character dynamics. While I have mixed feelings about Alexander, the return of Lee and the promise of future developments leave me eager for the next installment. I would recommend this series to fans of cozy mysteries with a touch of environmental intrigue.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

Despite these flaws, I’m curious to see where Saffron’s story goes, especially if Nick Hale plays a larger role.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Continuity and Series Consistency**  \n   - The book picks up only a couple of weeks after the second one ends, maintaining a strong sense of continuity.  \n   - Alexander’s character felt more like himself in this book compared to his change at the end of the second book, which was a positive improvement.  \n   - The epilogue ending didn’t generate the same excitement as the cliffhanger in book 2, leaving me less eager for the next installment.  \n\n- **Character Development**  \n   - I have a soft spot for Saffron, but in this book, she often felt incredibly clueless, especially in her interactions with Nick and her misplaced suspicions of the men who had previously saved her life.  \n   - Alexander’s secrets and the reasons for keeping them were well-explained and made sense, adding depth to his character.  \n   - Eliza’s increased involvement was a highlight and added value to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing**  \n   - 80% of the action occurs in the last 20% of the book, which made the middle feel slow and dragged the pacing down.  \n   - The botany aspect, which was a unique element in the series, felt less prominent in this book.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Overall Impression**  \n   - Despite the pacing issues and Saffron’s occasional lack of awareness, I still enjoyed the book overall.  \n   - The action-packed ending was engaging and satisfying, even if it took a while to get there.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a good addition to the series, though it had some pacing issues and a less prominent focus on botany compared to previous books. Alexander’s character development was a highlight, and Eliza’s increased involvement added depth. However, Saffron’s occasional cluelessness and the slow buildup to the action were drawbacks. While I enjoyed the book, the epilogue didn’t leave me as excited for the next installment as the previous cliffhanger did.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The book definitely ended well.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - There’s a lot of wonderful character building in this book. Saffron is trying to balance her professional and personal life, which I found relatable. She’s still heartbroken over losing her first love but is starting to let Alexander in.  \n  - We learn a great deal about Alexander, and Elizabeth’s character evoked strong emotions in me—I wanted to give her a hug. Her brother, however, came across as a \"stupid jackass psychopath.\"  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  - My only disappointment was the lack of chemistry between Saffron and Alexander. While they seem well-suited, I didn’t feel any romantic spark between them.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  - One humorous moment stood out: when Bill introduced himself, I almost laughed out loud. His name felt so un-sinister that it broke the tension for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book and look forward to the next installment. Despite some initial confusion and a lack of romantic chemistry between the main characters, the engaging plot, strong character development, and satisfying ending made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

While it could be read as a standalone, reading the previous books would provide better context for certain characters and events.  \n\n- **Engagement and Anticipation:**  \n  - Despite the confusing mystery, the high stakes at the end left me very interested in what will happen in Book 4.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this installment for its character development and the intriguing dynamics of family relationships. However, the convoluted mystery and the feeling that the book was mostly a setup for the next one slightly diminished my enjoyment. Still, the ending has me eagerly anticipating the next book in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The mystery of Nicholas's sudden appearance is intriguing, but his plea for help puts Saffron, Alexander, Eliza, and himself in peril. At times, the plot feels contrived, particularly in how it draws Saffron into the mystery, which undermines the story's overall believability.",

In her life, Alexander serves as a positive and supportive presence, contrasting sharply with his brother Adrian, who embraces their Greek heritage and the hedonistic lifestyle of the Bright Young Things. Saffron's friend and roommate, Eliza, is also portrayed as a party enthusiast, adding depth to her character. Meanwhile, Nicholas, Saffron's long-lost brother, introduces an element of mystery and tension by drawing her into a perilous situation.",

If I had known, I probably would not have chosen to read it, as I dislike starting in the middle of a series.  \n   - I feel like I missed some small details from the earlier books that would have enhanced my enjoyment of this one.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters felt established, which is expected, but I missed some of their personality quirks until much later in the story.  \n   - Despite this, the characters appear well-developed and enjoyable overall.  \n\n- **Plot Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The plot was slow-moving, which made it a struggle for me to stay engaged.  \n   - I completely forgot it was a mystery until about halfway through the book.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - Jodie Harris did a fantastic job narrating the book and bringing the characters to life.  \n   - Her voice was what helped me finish the book when I was feeling lost.  \n   - I hope Dreamscape Media continues to keep Harris as the narrator for the rest of the series, as she has also narrated the first two books.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n   - I do not think this is a bad book by any means, but it was not a good fit for me personally.  \n   - I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction mystery series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has well-developed characters and excellent narration, the slow-moving plot and my lack of familiarity with the series made it a less enjoyable experience for me.

They are cozy mysteries with a nostalgic charm.\n\n- **Character Development and Likability:**  \n  Saffron Everleigh is like a 20-something British cousin of Nancy Drew, with a passion for botany and solving mysteries, set in 1920s London. I was glad to see the author bring back many of the same characters from previous installments, especially Dr. Lee. I hope he remains a part of Saffron's \"Scooby gang\" and continues to appear in future books.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  I appreciate that the author consistently uses the same audiobook narrator, Jodie Harris, for each installment. Not every series does this, and it’s one of my biggest pet peeves when a new narrator takes over. Jodie Harris does a wonderful job voicing the characters, and I hope she continues to narrate all future books in the series.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The cliffhanger ending has me eagerly anticipating the next installment.

I like how she knows what she wants and stands up for it, refusing to hold back her intelligence and knowledge just to conform to societal expectations in the 1920s.  \n  - **Alexander:** He plays a bigger role in book 3 and, in my opinion, is more likable than before.  \n  - **Elizabeth:** Saffron’s roommate and friend takes an active part in the plot this time, and I appreciate how she supports and stands up for Saffron.  \n\n- **Plot Pacing:**  \n  What I liked: Alexander and Elizabeth being integral parts of the story!
