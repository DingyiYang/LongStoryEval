            "May is a relatable and loving mother with intelligent children. Her struggles are genuine, and her decisions are understandable, making her a sympathetic protagonist. The emotional core of the story highlights how ordinary mistakes can spiral out of control in a hyper-connected, judgmental society, resonating deeply with readers who have faced similar pressures. Additionally, the subtle changes in May's appearance following her facial modification impact her self-perception and interactions, adding psychological depth to her character.",
            "The novel's world is strikingly realistic, reflecting a future that could soon mirror our own. The author skillfully extrapolates current trends, crafting a setting that is both believable and unsettling. The depiction of advertising is especially compelling; it is expertly tailored to the characters' needs, often compelling them to purchase beyond their means. Pervasive personified advertising and facial recognition enhance the sense of authenticity. Additionally, the vivid portrayal of environmental degradation—polluted water, charred forests, and poor air quality—creates an oppressive and claustrophobic atmosphere that limits outdoor activities.",

Through a science fiction lens, it deepens these critiques, urging readers not to judge a mother based on incomplete information. The narrative follows May's life, illustrating how easily a family can be destabilized by technology, viral videos, and public shaming. Additionally, the story explores broader implications of technology, including the blurred lines between artificial and biological life and the addictive nature of devices."

The ‘could be’ of it all is both intriguing and unsettling.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story revolves around May, her husband, and their two children living in a highly AI-driven world. The ‘hums’—advanced AI systems—anticipate and control everything, creating a tense and immersive setting.  \n\n- **Character Development and Motivation:**  \n  May’s decision to undergo a small surgical procedure to alter her appearance slightly (to become undetectable to the hums) after losing her job is a pivotal moment. This choice not only provides her with extra money but also opens up new opportunities and insights into her world.  \n\n- **Ending and Impact:**  \n  The ending is deliberately confusing, ensuring that I’ll think about this story long after finishing it. It leaves a lasting impression and invites deeper reflection.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis speculative fiction novel is thought-provoking and immersive, with a compelling plot set in a highly controlled AI-driven world. May’s journey and the deliberate, thought-provoking ending make it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The fictional world of the book depicts a society that is even more dependent on technology than our own, resulting in a more oppressive environment. While the characters enjoy various conveniences, they largely overlook the hidden costs of this lifestyle, with only the HUMs, wooms, bunnies, and May's gig recognizing these issues. This setting resonated with my own experiences in a crowded urban area where nature is scarce and air quality is poor, necessitating the constant use of air purifiers and fans.",

Its relatability enhances its impact, as it reflects many of my daily struggles and concerns. I found a deep connection to May’s tight budget and the challenges of managing technology's influence on my children. The constant barrage of intrusive commercials, even during quiet moments, resonates with my own experiences. The theme of loneliness stemming from bonding with machines rather than humans, subtly illustrated by HUM, struck a chord with me, highlighting the ease of falling into that trap in our tech-driven world."

            "The ending felt abrupt and ambiguous, leaving too much open to interpretation. When the main character, May, enters her room, the lack of specific details leads to multiple possible conclusions, which I found unsatisfying. This tendency for abrupt endings seems to be a recurring trait in the author's work, and it’s not a style I particularly enjoy.",
            "The author skillfully offers a balance of world-building, giving just enough detail to spark the reader's imagination while leaving space for personal interpretation. Although I usually favor more extensive world-building, this approach suits the novel remarkably well. That said, I'd still be interested in an updated version with additional details if one were to be released.",

The anxiety-inducing setting highlights the characters' struggles to live, raise families, and survive in an oppressive environment. As a cautionary tale about the perils of excessive reliance on technology, it powerfully underscores the importance of unplugging and disconnecting from our digital lives.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The novel explores the challenges of modern motherhood, particularly the fear of being judged as a bad mother and the anxiety over children's safety and well-being.  \n   - It critiques a dystopian world where AI has eliminated jobs, global warming has worsened, and personal devices dominate human attention.  \n   - The story delves into the tension between technology and human connection, highlighting the consequences of rejecting technology in a world where it is deeply ingrained.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - The setting is a turbocharged version of our current world, with advanced AI, omnipresent surveillance, and environmental degradation.  \n   - The introduction of \"hums\" (humanoid robots) and \"wooms\" (virtual reality pods) adds layers to the dystopian atmosphere.  \n   - The Botanic Gardens serve as a rare, idyllic escape from the oppressive urban environment, symbolizing nature's dwindling presence in human lives.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The novel is described as brief and pacey, with a darker turn when the children go missing during a family trip to the Botanic Gardens.  \n   - The consequences of May's decision to leave devices behind propel the story toward a richly satisfying and moving conclusion.  \n\n- **Character Development (May):**  \n   - May is portrayed as a mother striving to protect her children from the overreach of technology and the pressures of their dystopian world.  \n   - Her decision to splurge on a family trip to the Botanic Gardens reflects her desire for her children to experience nature and human connection.  \n   - Her actions and the resulting consequences highlight the complexities of balancing technology and human values.  \n\n- **Technology and Human Agency:**  \n   - The novel suggests that humans have lost much of their agency to technology, with AI and devices controlling their lives.  \n   - It raises questions about whether rejecting technology is feasible or if humanity must instead develop a more compassionate relationship with it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Hum* is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant novel that examines the struggles of motherhood, the pervasive influence of technology, and the consequences of rejecting it in a dystopian world. Through its compelling plot, rich themes, and vivid world-building, the story offers a poignant reflection on the challenges of preserving human connection and agency in an increasingly technological society.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

No spoilers here, so now you’ll have to read it for yourself.  \n\n- **Discovery of New Authors:**  \n   - Thanks, Goodreads, for introducing me to a fantastic storyteller I might never have read otherwise.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial skepticism about AI and the genre, *Hum* completely exceeded my expectations.

The name \"Hum,\" a truncated form of \"human,\" underscores this loss of humanity. The story highlights how advertising infiltrates emotional moments, further emphasizing the commodification of human experiences. In the final scene, May's encounter with a fake video symbolizes the erasure of truth and the futility of seeking absolution in a manipulated world.",

Through its bleak writing style, intricate world-building, and deeply flawed characters, it raises thought-provoking questions about identity, control, and the cost of technological advancement. While frustrating and disturbing, it is a gripping read for those interested in speculative fiction and the darker implications of AI and societal decay.",

I love dystopian books that are just close enough to our future to do this, yet hopefully far enough away that I won’t live the reality (as was present here). The topic is rather nightmarish, not only the AI aspects but the children aspect as well.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  In this book, nature is pretty much non-existent, which is scary in itself, and the world is overcome with AI, which is a real concern. Add in some drama surrounding kids, and you have a recipe for disaster. I ate it up.  \n\n- **Narration and Language:**  \n  I really enjoyed this one and listened to it on audio while following along in the print version. I did get a little caught up because a few of the words used sounded familiar but mean different things in this made-up world. I found myself annoyed with them because they sound like baby-talk versions of current words, and it grated on my nerves, so do be prepared for that if you listen on audio.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was middle of the road, and I found it to be even throughout.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Children):**  \n  The children were a bit much at times as well. I don’t want to go into too many more details because it might give things away, but I did enjoy it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this dystopian novel engaging and thought-provoking, with a nightmarish yet compelling exploration of AI and societal themes.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The novel created an eerie and unsettling atmosphere that I found captivating. It effectively conveyed the unease of a future dominated by technology, which added to the overall vibe of the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Clarity:**  \n  Initially, the world was confusing, with terms like \"Hums,\" \"Bunnies,\" and \"Woom\" leaving me disoriented. However, as the story progressed, these elements became clearer, and I appreciated how they contributed to the unique setting.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The kids in the story were portrayed as annoying, but their behavior felt realistic for their age and the context of being \"iPad kids.\" Their actions added emotional depth to the narrative.  \n  The relationship between the main character and her husband was strained and far from perfect, but this dynamic felt intentional and added to the story’s exploration of struggle and imperfection in a tech-driven world.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel effectively highlighted the less glamorous side of life in a technology-dependent society. It portrayed the struggles of poverty and the challenges of navigating a world where technology dominates, which I found thought-provoking and impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an intriguing and eerie read that successfully immersed me in a futuristic, tech-driven world. While the initial confusion and the flawed characters might be off-putting to some, I felt these elements enhanced the story’s emotional depth and thematic resonance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nBased on the vibes and my emotional engagement, I would rate this book highly, though no specific numerical score was mentioned in the review.  \n\nThank you to Atria / S&S for providing a gifted copy of this book!"

The plot shifts focus several times, beginning with May's transformation, then exploring the humanity of the Hum (AI robots), and finally delving into events at the Botanical Garden resort. This lack of focus makes the narrative feel meandering and disjointed. The ending is abrupt and ambiguous, leaving many questions unanswered and obscuring the final events.",

The narrative keeps the reader intrigued, even though the story lacks focus.  \n  - The open-ended nature of the plot and themes, while thought-provoking, is also disappointing as it leaves too many questions unanswered.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is an intriguing and thought-provoking read that offers a compelling look into a near-future world and the struggles of a family trying to survive in it. While the world-building and exploration of technology-related themes are engaging, the story suffers from a lack of focus, an abrupt and ambiguous ending, and unresolved questions. Despite these flaws, the book is well-written and leaves the reader pondering its themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

            "The novel features short chapters and frequent line breaks that create a sense of urgency and maintain my engagement. This stylistic choice echoes Phillips' previous work, *The Need*, effectively immersing me in the story. However, the ending is somewhat unsatisfying, leaving key questions unanswered. The behavior of the hum—its pensive demeanor, false promises, and eventual shutdown—remains unexplained, leaving me craving more clarity about its programming and purpose.",
            "The story poignantly explores themes of motherhood, desperation, and the fleeting nature of family time. Although I am not a mother, the author's writing enables me to empathize deeply with May's fatigue and intensity. Part 2, set in the botanical garden, resonated with me, powerfully illustrating the brevity of childhood and family life. This section was especially moving, underscoring the preciousness and transience of these moments, regardless of one's circumstances.",
            "The financial struggles of May and Jem bring a realistic depth to the story. Their inability to afford future vacations resonates authentically, even with readers who have the means for such experiences. The novel powerfully conveys the universal truth that time with loved ones is limited, a message that transcends its speculative elements. While undeniably poignant and emotionally draining, I don’t regret reading it; I was simply relieved to finish and escape its heavy atmosphere."

Facial recognition is ubiquitous, required for even the simplest tasks like purchasing gum or accessing buildings, and semi-anthropomorphic AI robots assist and guard everything. Helen Phillips uses this as a baseline but chooses not to dwell on it, instead focusing on the human story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, May, is a mother, wife, and recently unemployed individual whose skill set has been rendered obsolete by AI.

It delves into issues like privacy invasion (e.g., phones listening to daily encounters to sell products) and the dominance of consumerism. Phillips raises thought-provoking questions about whether we are heading toward a future where making ends meet becomes increasingly difficult.\n\n- **Tone and Narrative Focus:**  \n  While the story could easily veer into dystopian despair, Phillips maintains a balanced tone by focusing on May and her family. The narrative emphasizes the human aspect, ensuring that the negative elements of the future setting do not overshadow the characters’ relatability. It’s ultimately a story about a simple person trying to give her family a break from their troubles, which feels universal and poignant.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHelen Phillips’ *Hum* is a thought-provoking exploration of a future dominated by AI and technology, but it remains grounded in the human experience.

While the book captivated me with its themes, prose, and world-building, the ending left me deeply disappointed, significantly impacting my overall enjoyment. Despite this, the story’s powerful imagery and ideas will linger in my mind, making it a memorable, if flawed, read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Until the ending: 5 stars  \n- After finishing: 2 stars"

The robots are called HUMs. The subway still exists, but paid advertising is pervasive and unyielding to those who can’t pay to make it go away.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The family is displaced after losing jobs due to robot replacements, so money is tight; they watch *a lot* of ads. The mom cosmetically alters her face to help with surveillance deflection research in exchange for an important sum of money. As a result, the family goes on a luxurious retreat to the botanical garden, where kid hijinks and viral videos ensue.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  There were times where the leading voice in this book felt pretty dry or cold.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The story reminded me of *The School for Good Mothers*; the state is policing mothering intensely, and any misstep is blown out of proportion in the most irritating way.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n   - The novel is set in a hot, polluted city where forests have been destroyed, and stable jobs are replaced by AI-driven gig work.  \n   - The Botanic Garden serves as an urban oasis, offering a rare escape from the pervasive influence of electronic devices and advertisements.  \n   - The world feels reminiscent of the *Black Mirror* episode \"Fifteen Million Merits,\" with its critique of consumerism and technology.  \n\n- **Characterization and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - May, the protagonist, is portrayed as a mother under immense pressure and guilt, struggling to balance her responsibilities while being bombarded by distractions like text alerts and AI-driven advertisements.  \n   - The novel effectively conveys May's scattered attention and the claustrophobic spiral of her life, especially when her attempt to discard devices backfires.  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n   - The story tightens into a more intense and claustrophobic spiral as May's situation worsens.  \n   - The hallucinatory sequence in the Botanic Garden is a standout moment, but the plot becomes more conventional afterward, focusing on the overdone theme of cancel culture.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The novel critiques consumerism and the invasive nature of technology, particularly through the eerie \"hums\" that simultaneously advertise and critique the system.  \n   - It offers a fresh take on a familiar near-future scenario, making it feel relevant and haunting.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n   - Phillips' writing creates a haunting atmosphere, reminiscent of Naomi Booth's *Sealed*.  \n   - The eerie portrayal of the \"hums\" and the oppressive world-building are particularly effective.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Hum* is a compelling novel that effectively captures the pressures of modern life in a near-future setting. While it shines in its world-building, emotional depth, and haunting atmosphere, it falters slightly when the plot shifts to more familiar territory like cancel culture. Despite this, the novel succeeds in making a familiar scenario feel fresh and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

It also highlights the effects of extreme climate change, exemplified by the Botanical Garden, which stands as a refuge in a crumbling world. The exploration of technology, especially the pervasive AI Hums, is both thought-provoking and reminiscent of the Black Mirror episode \"Fifteen Million Merits.\""

Despite the lack of a strong plot, Phillips' prose was compelling enough to hold my interest.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The book is less plot-driven and more introspective.

It also explores the impact of extreme climate change, as seen in the Botanical Garden, which serves as a sanctuary in a deteriorating world. The focus on technology, particularly the omnipresent AI \"Hums,\" was thought-provoking and reminiscent of the Black Mirror episode \"Fifteen Million Merits.\"  \n\n- **Relevance and Impact:**  \n  The book made me question societal norms and the role of technology in our lives.

The futuristic elements, particularly the list of potential futures created by the older character, Lu—such as \"You will make five mistakes while singing for 1,000 people\" and \"You will be reincarnated as a cockroach\"—are central to the narrative.

The very recognizable part of being a mother really keeps you in the story.\n\n- **Pacing and Depth:**  \n  It is a slim novel that contains much, though I’m not entirely sure that I understand how it ends.

The specific reference to the streaming service riot added a layer of relatability and depth, prompting me to round up my rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis dystopian novel effectively blends speculative fiction with real-world issues, creating a narrative that is both unsettling and relevant. Its ability to reflect current societal trends and events makes it a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded up to 4 stars due to the impactful reference to real-world events)."

I have read all her books and enjoyed them all.  \n\n- **Genre and Classification:**  \n   - I don’t think of her as a science fiction writer, even though that is a possible classification. She is definitely a writer of speculative fiction.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - The world-building is very well done. The story is set in a near-future world where technology and climate change are central themes, reflecting many aspects of our current reality.  \n   - The concept of \"hums\" (smart, humanoid robots) is intriguing. They are empathic, predictive, and constantly try to sell things, much like modern apps.  \n   - The Botanical Garden serves as a stark contrast to the technological world, offering a natural, serene environment with clean air, grass, waterfalls, and wildlife.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - The main character, May, is married to Jem, and they have two young children, Lu and Sy. The family dynamics are central to the story.  \n   - May undergoes facial reconstruction to make her face unreadable by scanners, a decision that slightly alters her appearance and impacts her family.  \n   - Jem, a professional photographer, struggles to find work and takes on odd jobs, such as emptying mouse traps.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The story explores themes of technological dependence, identity, and the impact of climate change.  \n   - May’s decision to undergo facial reconstruction for financial stability highlights the ethical and personal dilemmas of living in a highly surveilled society.  \n   - The family’s trip to the Botanical Garden, where they leave their devices behind, leads to a crisis when the children get lost, unleashing chaos for May.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Approach:**  \n   - The book is very unwordy, requiring readers to fill in gaps and interpret characters’ emotions and reactions.

            "This gripping, fast-paced novel captivated me, and I finished it in just two sittings. The story centers on May, who undergoes a facial alteration procedure to evade AI recognition, using her compensation to take her family to the Botanical Garden. The plot takes a dramatic turn when May's children go missing, triggering a series of events involving technology, societal judgment, and a viral video. However, the ending left me confused. While the investigation concludes and May is allowed to keep her children, the portrait in her womb reveals that her facial alteration was actually used to train AI, contradicting the initial purpose of making her unrecognizable. This ambiguity raises questions about how the portrait absolves her of the investigation.",
            "May is a relatable protagonist, particularly in her choice to remove her children's bunnies to encourage them to engage with the real world. Her panic and frustration when Child Services intervenes are entirely understandable, as is her fear of losing her children. The societal backlash she faces, fueled by a viral video that misrepresents her as anti-technology, is both realistic and thought-provoking.",
            "This story presents a nuanced dystopian world where technology serves both beneficial and detrimental roles. Children wear bunny-shaped devices on their wrists that monitor their health and location while granting internet access. Woombs, egg-shaped structures, allow individuals to immerse themselves in virtual environments. Although Hums, the helpful robots, aim to assist, their actions—such as recording May's reactions—often result in unintended consequences. The pervasive and invasive nature of advertisements underscores the hyper-capitalist society in which the characters live.",
            "This novel adeptly examines the dual nature of technology, the challenges of parental control, and the weight of societal judgment. It critiques capitalism and highlights the invasive role of advertising in a dystopian future. The narrative provokes thought on privacy, artificial intelligence, and the ramifications of detaching from technology."

It offers a fascinating look into a dystopian, near-future world where technology and capitalism dominate. While the ending left me somewhat confused, the story’s exploration of societal and technological issues made it a memorable read.",

            "The author skillfully underscores our addiction to technology, particularly smartphones, illustrating how documenting every moment has become second nature, even in our attempts to disconnect. The story reinterprets Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, highlighting the intertwining of privacy and security with our fundamental requirements. The chilling concept of AI surveillance in Hum’s world—and potentially our own—raises critical questions about privacy and autonomy as it identifies and targets individuals. This book masterfully blends sci-fi with a reality that feels uncomfortably familiar, making it both captivating and unsettling.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Immersion:**  \n  - The book made me want to put my phone away and go outside and touch grass.  \n  - The concept of time in the story was thought-provoking: \"Their time here was brief, yes, slipping through their fingers: but it occurred to her that every day was not twenty-four hours, it was actually ninety-six, each of the four of them living their own twenty-four hours side by side.\"  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - I didn’t realize it was a dystopian novel at first, but the bleak future depicted—where AI replaces people, everything is monetized, and nature becomes a luxury—felt eerily plausible.  \n  - The book blends sci-fi with a reality that feels uncomfortably close to our own, making it both fascinating and unsettling.  \n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  - Phillips effectively highlights our addiction to technology, especially phones, and how it has become second nature to document everything, even when trying to escape it.  \n  - The story recontextualizes Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, emphasizing how privacy and security are now intertwined with our basic needs.  \n  - The idea of AI surveillance in Hum’s world (and potentially ours) is chilling, as it recognizes and targets individuals, raising questions about privacy and autonomy.  \n\n- **Pacing and Realism:**  \n  - While the pacing felt slow at times, the story’s realism and depth kept me engaged.  \n  - The book sparked new thoughts about privacy, such as the implications of DNA leaks (e.g., the 23&Me incident), which I had never considered before.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Reflection:**  \n  - I enjoyed the concept immensely, even though it was slow in parts.  \n  - The book provided a lot of food for thought, especially for readers who enjoy exploring complex, real-world issues through fiction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis dystopian novel is a compelling blend of sci-fi and social commentary, offering a stark yet realistic vision of a future dominated by AI and technology. While the pacing was slow at times, the thought-provoking themes—especially around privacy, addiction to technology, and the redefinition of basic human needs—made it a worthwhile and immersive read. It left me reflecting on the direction our world is heading and the importance of safeguarding our privacy and humanity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The author masterfully evokes a sense of dread, anxiety, and confusion, to the point where I had to take a break after Part 2 because I felt genuinely anxious. The atmosphere is incredibly immersive and unsettling.  \n\n- **Character Development (May):**  \n  May's character is deeply compelling. Her desire to give her children the life she feels they deserve is palpable, yet she is constantly restricted by external factors like finances, the state of the world, and the environmental crisis. These challenges make her feel like she’s failing as a mother and partner, which adds layers to her character.  \n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  The book does a phenomenal job of highlighting how society freely and openly judges and villainizes mothers during moments of hardship in parenthood, while fathers rarely face the same scrutiny, even when equally involved. This critique is both eerie and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Protective Instincts and Themes of Motherhood:**  \n  After a pivotal incident, May’s protective instincts go into overdrive. Her desire to shield her children, Lu and Sy, from any possible threat—especially regarding their DNA—feels raw and relatable. This aspect of the story is both intense and emotionally resonant.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics (May and Jem):**  \n  The relationship between May and Jem is portrayed with raw realism.

The Botanical Gardens emerge as a symbolic Eden, offering a rare escape from the bleak, technology-dominated landscape.",

She is offered a chance to earn ten months' worth of pay by undergoing a facial alteration procedure, which makes her undetectable by surveillance. This experiment explores the implications of technology in a future where it dominates daily life.\n   - May's decision to accept the offer leads her to splurge on a family vacation at the Botanical Gardens, an expensive retreat. However, her plan to escape reality is met with unexpected obstacles and events that threaten her family.\n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**\n   - The novel delves into the impact of technology on society, particularly how it affects employment, family dynamics, and personal identity.\n   - It also explores the lengths a mother will go to protect her family in a world that feels increasingly desolate and controlled by technology.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The book evoked strong emotions, including anxiety and sadness, which I believe were intentional on the author's part. The portrayal of May's struggles and the dystopian world she inhabits resonated deeply, making the story both compelling and unsettling.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - The Botanical Gardens serve as a stark contrast to the technological dystopia outside, offering a lush, natural retreat. However, this paradise is not without its challenges, adding layers of tension and complexity to the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - May Webb is portrayed as a desperate yet determined mother, willing to make significant sacrifices for her family. Her children's reactions to being forced to unplug from technology add depth to the family dynamics and highlight the generational divide in their relationship with technology.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\"Hum\" is a thought-provoking exploration of a future dominated by technology, focusing on the struggles of a mother trying to protect her family in a desolate world. The novel successfully evokes strong emotions and presents a compelling narrative that raises important questions about the role of technology in our lives.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Emotional Impact: 9/10\n- Plot and Premise: 8/10\n- Themes and Exploration: 9/10\n- Setting and Atmosphere: 8/10\n- Character Development: 8/10\n\nOverall Rating: 8.5/10"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  Helen Philips masterfully explores parental anxiety and dread, creating a narrative that resonates deeply with the emotional challenges of modern parenthood. The story is set in a near-future world filled with seamlessly integrated advertising, unavoidable surveillance, and a declining natural environment, which amplifies the sense of unease. While the novel feeds into anxieties, it also provides a safe space to explore these emotions, as is the role of horror and sci-fi.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The protagonist, a mother, undergoes an experimental procedure to secure financial stability for her family, but it comes at the cost of disconnecting her from her children. A family trip to a botanical garden takes a dark turn, thrusting her into the center of public attention and threat. The story imagines a future that feels both plausible and unsettling, serving as a cautionary tale for the world we are building.  \n\n- **Ideas and Ambiguity:**  \n  Philips presents a wealth of big ideas about technology, society, and the environment. Some of these ideas are left unresolved, but this ambiguity is intentional and reflective of the rapidly changing world we live in. As Philips notes in her epilogue, these ideas might become irrelevant in a year or two, emphasizing the transient nature of our current concerns.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel balances hope with a pervasive sense of dread, creating a tone that is both thought-provoking and emotionally immersive. The story encourages readers to let the emotions wash over them and then seek solace in nature, as suggested by the closing advice to take a walk in the nearest woodland.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHelen Philips' novel is a gripping exploration of parental anxiety, societal fears, and the ethical dilemmas of a near-future world. While it leaves some ideas unresolved, its emotional depth and thought-provoking themes make it a compelling read. The story serves as both a mirror to our current anxieties and a speculative vision of what lies ahead.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It is a short and quick read but it is not lacking material.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The language is simple. The concepts, and the horrors, are not.  \n\n- **Themes and Comparisons:**  \n  - This reminded me of a mix of *Annie Bot* and *The School for Good Mothers*.  \n\n- **Imagination and Ambiguity:**  \n  - There is a lot of imagination required for some of the futuristic aspects (for example, would love to know what the author actually pictured for the hum - for whatever reason all I could picture was *Bicentennial Man*, but I’m pretty sure that’s just my brain being weird).  \n  - Things are just vague enough that every reader can make it into whatever they want.  \n\n- **Engagement and Thought-Provoking Nature:**  \n  - I enjoy books like that because they make me think. Not just about what things look like, but whether they are going to end up looking like that before too long.  \n  - This novel is chilling and compulsively readable.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - Definitely pick this one up… I need more people to talk about that last sentence with.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a quick yet deeply engaging read, blending simple language with complex and chilling concepts. Its imaginative and ambiguous nature invites readers to think critically and project their own interpretations, making it a thought-provoking and compelling experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It burrows under your skin, making you confront these looming anxieties.  \n\n- **Characterization (Children):**  \n  The kids in the story are portrayed as insufferable but incredibly true to life. As a parent of three, I can relate to the love and frustration they evoke. Their behavior and dialogue are authentic, though at times exasperating.  \n\n- **Parenting Representation:**  \n  There is very little active parenting depicted in the story, which feels like an odd choice. The absence of inner-musing from the mother about how to respond to her children’s behavior or questions is noticeable. While I support letting kids express their feelings, I believe some parental guidance or explanation of reasoning would have added depth.  \n\n- **Focus and Pacing:**  \n  The story’s focus on the technology issue is somewhat overshadowed by the kids' behavior. While this behavior is realistic, it detracts from the central theme, making the narrative feel unbalanced at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel effectively captures the anxieties of modern motherhood and portrays children in a way that is both relatable and frustrating.

I realize the latter could have been a reference to LED light patterns, but I expected it to tie into a side effect of the procedure affecting her eyes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the dystopian themes and the near-future setting, the unresolved plot points, annoying characters, and ambiguous ending left me wanting more. The story had potential but felt underdeveloped in key areas.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She vividly portrayed the anxieties, the pressure, and how all-consuming motherhood can be, impacting every relationship.  \n\n- **Genre and Realism:**  \n  While the book reads like science fiction, I can easily see this scenario becoming a reality in the next 10 years or so.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to Mary Sue Rucci Books for the advanced copy!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its slow start, the book ultimately delivered a gripping and emotionally resonant story, particularly in its portrayal of motherhood. The blend of science fiction and realism made it both thought-provoking and relatable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She participates in an experiment to become unrecognizable to AI but impulsively spends the money on a luxury nature reserve trip for her family. The plot is more slice-of-life and contemplative rather than action-driven, with a focus on unplugging from technology and reconnecting with family.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist is well-developed, showcasing her struggles with obsolescence and her impulsive decisions. However, the Hums and their role in the world could have been explored more deeply to enhance the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is described as neither amusing nor clever, which could have compensated for the lack of a more plot-driven narrative.  \n\n- **Personal Preferences:**  \n  The reviewer acknowledges that the book's contemplative nature and focus on family and motherhood are not their preferred themes in fiction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel is well-crafted and explores intriguing themes of AI and human connection, its contemplative, slice-of-life approach and focus on family dynamics did not align with the reviewer's personal preferences. It could, however, be a great read for someone who enjoys these elements.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

It magnifies the stressors of day-to-day life through the perspective of May, the mother in the story.  \n\n- **Characterization and Perspective:**  \n  May's point of view provides a compelling lens to examine the family dynamics and the influence of technology. The children's attachment to the \"bunnies\" and the mysterious \"Hum\" adds depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**  \n  While the story has intriguing elements, such as the late-night \"Hum\" knock and the moment of going viral, it feels abrupt at times. The philosophical tone detracts from the emotional punch I expected, leaving me wishing for more depth and resolution.  \n\n- **Realism and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The portrayal of terror and the viral moment is strikingly realistic and frightening, effectively capturing the anxieties of modern life.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Hum* is an engaging and thought-provoking novel that explores the intersection of technology and family life. While it has moments of brilliance and realism, the abruptness and philosophical leanings left me wanting more emotional depth and resolution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this story, May Webb emerges as a relatable and desperate protagonist who undergoes micro-plastic surgery to escape facial recognition and support her family. The depiction of her children is notably strong, showcasing one of the best portrayals of children I've encountered in recent reads. May's yearning to reconnect with her kids and her appreciation for nature add significant depth to her character.",

            "Set in a near-future world that mirrors current societal trends, the book introduces helpful robots known as Hums, which assist with tasks like micro-plastic surgeries. The narrative underscores the pervasive influence of technology, exemplified by bunnies—devices worn on children's wrists that resemble today's smartphones.",
            "The book tackles several pertinent issues, such as the disparity between the rich and poor, exemplified by the wealthy's ability to evade constant advertising. It offers a nuanced critique of societal expectations for mothers, highlighting the lesser accountability often assigned to fathers. While some themes, like the implications of facial surgery, are introduced, they remain underexplored, leaving certain questions unanswered."

The children's behavior came across as unrealistic; I found it hard to believe they could call their mother names without facing consequences, especially in a dystopian setting.

The idea of a luxury vacation being a visit to a forest highlights the stark contrast between this future and our current reality.  \n\n- **Depth and Dimension:**  \n  While the book could have easily remained a cautionary tale about climate change, capitalism, and consumerism, the author elevates it by delving into the complexities of family dynamics. The exploration of how children gain independence from their parents, the balance between time together and apart, and the strain financial pressures place on marriages adds a deeply human layer to the story.  \n\n- **Relevance and Timelessness:**  \n  The novel reminds us that, despite the futuristic setting, the core fears and challenges of humanity remain unchanged.

            "The experimental procedure to alter the protagonist's face lacked clarity in both purpose and execution. It appeared more as a device to induce her identity crisis and provide financial gain, diminishing the overall impact of that storyline.",

It seemed more like a device to place her in a state of identity pain and to secure her some money, which made that aspect of the story less compelling.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The book offers decent considerations of how humans relate in an AI-driven world, such as the tension between engagement and numbing, and the balance between togetherness and isolation. However, some of these themes felt like a rehash of ideas explored by David Foster Wallace in the 1990s.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is a good read for fans of speculative fiction dealing with AI, despite some underdeveloped plot elements and themes that feel derivative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The ending left me feeling unfulfilled, as I craved a more impactful resolution. Although the premise and writing style were strong, the lack of a satisfying conclusion and relatable characters diminished my overall enjoyment. The novel's suspense is heightened by eerie, malfunctioning devices, particularly the AI-equipped smartwatches (referred to as \"bunnies\") worn by May's children, which introduce a chilling unpredictability. A particularly tense moment arises when May and Jem become separated from their children during a trip to the Botanical Garden, leading to media misrepresentation and an investigation by the Bureau of Family Aid. The pervasive power of state surveillance is emphasized through invasive visits from a mysterious entity known as the hum.",

Her fight against this surveillance system and her choice to undergo a procedure to obscure her face from cameras underscore the emotional and physical toll of constant monitoring. However, May's obsessive anxiety about her children's safety and her portrayal of motherhood often feel unrelatable and unsettling, particularly in moments where she observes her son's body in a fetishistic manner.",

The setting is both tense and dynamic, reminiscent of Black Mirror, ensuring that readers remain captivated throughout."

Eyes are a recurring motif, and the author skillfully navigates this complex symbolism without overwhelming the reader.

How are they able to afford the upkeep and costs of the wooms and bunnies? Maybe I'm not meant to care about those little details.  \n   - *Hum* makes you think about climate change and environmentalism. A future that's hot and toxic and where Central Park is now a botanical sanctuary that only the rich can enjoy.  \n\n- **Symbolism and Writing Style:**  \n   - Phillips' decision to start this novel so viscerally with a needle hovering over May's eye is so symbolic to this story.  \n   - Eyes are mentioned quite often throughout the narrative. This can be a tricky symbol to navigate as a writer, but Phillips expertly weaves in this symbolism without going overboard.  \n   - The whole story feels like the needle never quite pulls any further away than an inch from May's eye.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n   - I believe *Hum* was maybe a bit too short.  \n   - I wasn't sure what to make of the ending, but I did like it.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - *Hum* is visceral, curious, panicky.  \n   - It is a wonderful story of the lengths a mother will go to to protect her children.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I liked *Hum* and its characters, as well as the writing.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - I enjoyed the rather sparse writing that really set the mood.  \n   - It was a very easy-to-read book.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n   - The world-building was engaging, depicting a near-future where technology and AI dominate every aspect of life.  \n   - The setting felt very possible, with its portrayal of a society addicted to tech and the resulting deterioration of interpersonal relationships (e.g., a husband and wife who barely speak, kids who communicate more with devices than their parents).  \n\n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n   - The basic premise was intriguing: a near-future world where AI has advanced to the point of rendering humans redundant, and where technology has ravaged the environment and human connections.  \n   - The idea of May altering her face to fool facial recognition software was an interesting concept.  \n\n- **Plot and Story Development:**  \n   - The story felt slim and underdeveloped. It seemed more like a lengthy short story than a full-length novel.  \n   - The plot revolved around May squandering money to take her family to the Botanical Garden, where her kids briefly get lost, and a robot tricks her into releasing out-of-context footage, making her go viral as a \"Bad Mom.\"  \n   - I kept hoping for something \"more\" to happen, but it never did.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The characters felt rather bland and lacked depth.  \n   - May, the protagonist, didn’t leave a strong impression, and the other characters (her husband and kids) were underdeveloped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was a mixed experience for me. While I appreciated the sparse writing style and the immersive world-building, the slim plot and underdeveloped characters left me wanting more. The premise was compelling, but the execution felt incomplete, making the story feel more suited to a short story format. Despite its flaws, I was curious enough to finish the book, though it didn’t fully deliver on its potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "May, the protagonist, is a relatable and compelling character. Her exhaustion and desire to escape the constant barrage of advertisements are vividly portrayed. While her love for her children shines through, the societal pressures and technological burdens she faces make parenting increasingly difficult.",
            "The novel unfolds in a near-future society grappling with severe air pollution, where intelligent robots known as \"hums\" assist with everyday tasks. This world, while slightly altered from our own, strikes a balance between intrigue and relatability, offering a compelling glimpse into a speculative future.",
            "This book delivers a poignant critique of capitalism and the omnipresent influence of advertisements that infiltrate every aspect of life, even in moments of exhaustion. It vividly portrays the fatigue of living in a world where ads are inescapable, particularly when they come in the form of persistent hums rather than traditional screens. Additionally, the novel offers sharp commentary on parenting in a futuristic society where mistakes are not tolerated and external judgments loom large. The title is both thought-provoking and intentional; while one might expect the hums to be the focal point, the narrative instead delves into the extent of our humanity as we navigate a technology- and ad-dominated landscape. It raises critical questions about ownership and autonomy in a tech-saturated world.",
            "This novel powerfully addresses contemporary issues, especially the impact of technology on parenting and children's lives. It prompts readers to examine their own relationships with technology and advertising."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This speculative fiction novel is a compelling and thought-provoking read. It masterfully critiques capitalism, advertising, and the societal pressures of parenting in a tech-driven world. The relatable protagonist, May, and the marginally different yet eerily familiar setting make the story both engaging and impactful. The title and themes invite deep reflection on humanity's relationship with technology. I highly recommend this book for its rich commentary and emotional depth.",

            "The story begins with a compelling premise but gradually loses momentum, especially as the protagonist's plans unravel. The emphasis on the mother's suffering becomes repetitive, overshadowing the broader societal critique.

            "The novel centers on May, a mother grappling with family disconnection, financial instability from her shopping addiction, and depression. She enters a medical trial that offers a substantial payout in exchange for permanently altering her appearance to evade surveillance cameras and AI robots that dominate the workforce. May hopes to use the money to take her family to the Botanical Garden, a unique dome filled with real plants, animals, and fresh air, believing it will help them reconnect and escape technology. However, the pacing is notably slow, which may disappoint readers looking for a fast-paced sci-fi adventure. The story's emphasis on May's internal struggles and family dynamics may feel less engaging for those seeking more action or suspense.",

It captures May's feelings of inadequacy as her children gain independence and her marriage stagnates.

While the futuristic setting and premise are intriguing, readers seeking an action-packed or suspenseful dystopian tale may find the focus on May's personal struggles disappointing. The narrative prioritizes family dynamics and motherhood, leaning away from traditional dystopian or sci-fi tropes. Although it features elements like AI and surveillance, the heart of the story lies in May's emotional journey and her challenges as a mother and wife."

Her goal is to use the money to take her family to the Botanical Garden, a unique experience within a dome featuring real plants, animals, and fresh air, hoping it will help her family reconnect and disconnect from technology.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The story leans more toward exploring family dynamics and motherhood rather than being a dystopian thriller or sci-fi drama. While it includes futuristic elements like AI and surveillance, the focus is on May's emotional journey and her struggles with her role as a mother and wife.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The pacing is notably slow, which may not appeal to readers expecting a fast-paced sci-fi adventure. The story’s deliberate focus on May’s internal struggles and family relationships might feel less engaging for those seeking more action or suspense.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The novel delves deeply into themes of motherhood, disconnection, and the challenges of maintaining familial bonds in a technology-driven world. It portrays May’s feelings of inadequacy as her children grow more independent and her marriage becomes stagnant. While these themes are poignant, they may resonate more with readers who connect with such personal and introspective narratives.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The book subverts expectations by prioritizing family drama over sci-fi thrills. While the futuristic setting and premise are intriguing, the story’s focus on May’s personal struggles may disappoint readers anticipating a more action-packed or suspenseful dystopian tale.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Hum* is a slow-paced, introspective novel that explores the complexities of motherhood, family dynamics, and disconnection in a technology-dominated world. While it may not satisfy readers seeking a traditional sci-fi or dystopian thriller, it offers a heartfelt and emotional narrative that could resonate with those who appreciate stories centered on personal and familial struggles.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The book had a near-future feel to it that seemed not too far off.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  I felt like some of the initial plot kind of went away, and the main focus (the facial reconstruction) was all but forgotten. It felt like an incomplete thought, as if the author just gave up on it. This made me like the book a little less than I wanted.  \n\n- **Realism and Details:**  \n  I found it kind of funny how the kids would wonder what the AQI (air quality index) was outside instead of the temperature. I find myself doing the same thing during wildfire season! I also liked the AI robots (the Hums) and how realistic things were with advertising. However, I feel like the Hums could have been described better in terms of their appearance.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was a little weird and felt kind of rushed.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration (Ariel Blake):**  \n  The narrator is surprisingly good at voicing each of the four characters in the family (the mom, dad, young girl, and younger boy). However, I feel like her ‘Hum’ voice could have been better—more robotic or AI-like.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI mostly enjoyed the book but wanted to enjoy it more.

Perhaps this was by design, given the novel’s focus on AI permeating our world, making everything sound a little computer-generated.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were not fleshed out in a way that made it easy to feel for them.

The book made me realize how close to home the seemingly far-fetched premise actually is.  \n\n- **Real-World Relevance:**  \n  While listening to the book, I noticed how AI is already integrated into my daily life. My car responded to voice commands by name to adjust the temperature, my CarPlay read my texts, my GPS suggested the best route, and targeted ads popped up on my phone. This aspect of the book appealed to me, as it highlighted how deeply AI is already embedded in our world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel held my attention and offered a thought-provoking premise with its \"Black Mirror\" vibe, the uninspiring writing and lack of emotional connection to the characters left me feeling somewhat detached.

This setting serves as a refuge for the main character and her family, offering an escape from their technology-dominated environment.  \n\n- **Themes and Ambiguity:**  \n  - The story explores the role of AI in society, portraying the machines as sentient beings that struggle to recognize when their actions harm the humans they are designed to serve.  \n  - The author’s stance on technology remains ambiguous, leaving me unsure whether it is portrayed as ultimately good, bad, or a mix of both.  \n\n- **Character Development and Conflict:**  \n  - The main character’s decision to take her family to the forest backfires, creating a central conflict that drives the latter part of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - While the book was okay, I had trouble fully engaging with it due to its pacing and thematic ambiguity. I hesitate to recommend it, especially to readers who prefer more fast-paced and clearly defined narratives.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis dystopian novel explores the complexities of AI and its impact on society, set against a backdrop of a crumbling town and a contrasting natural refuge. While the world-building and themes are intriguing, the slow pacing and ambiguous messaging made it a challenging read for me. It’s an okay book, but not one I’d strongly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️s"

Her choice to undergo a facial alteration procedure for extra cash adds depth to her character, but I wished for a deeper exploration of her relationships and personal struggles.

The concept of a world where AI has replaced jobs and the societal implications of this technology was intriguing.  \n\n- **World-Building and Detail:**  \n  While we get a taste of the futuristic world in *Hum*, I wish the details were fleshed out more. The story drops us right into the action without much background on the world or the technology within it, which made some parts feel jarring and muddled.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  May, the protagonist, is an anxious mother whose job was replaced by AI, and she is barely making ends meet.

The random accounts of sex with her husband, Jem, felt out of place and unnecessary.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was a quick read, but I felt like something was missing. The plot, which revolves around May taking her family to the Botanical Gardens after her procedure, didn’t fully deliver on its potential. The experience at the gardens didn’t go as planned, but the resolution felt underwhelming.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Family Dynamics:**  \n  The interactions with May’s kids, Lu and Sy, were a mixed bag. While they added some realism to the family dynamic, I could have lived without hearing every little quip from them, as it sometimes detracted from the main narrative.  \n\n- **Potential for Adaptation:**  \n  Despite my reservations about the execution, I think the concept would make for an interesting movie or TV series, as the futuristic setting and societal themes have strong visual and narrative potential.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the concept of *Hum* more than its execution.

I still don’t fully understand what it was meant to convey.  \n\n- **Personal Reflection:**  \n  - The novel’s depiction of this dystopian world made me grateful to be in the latter half of my life and relieved that I have no children.

This approach makes the narrative relatable and engaging.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending left me somewhat uncertain. While it didn’t feel particularly mind-blowing or groundbreaking, it didn’t detract from the overall experience either. It was thought-provoking but not entirely satisfying.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  The novel offers an interesting and thought-provoking take on speculative fiction.

A few aspects of the plot and world-building weren’t fleshed out enough, which left me wanting more.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Unfortunately, I found May’s kids and husband absolutely insufferable. Their characters detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Hum* had a compelling premise and some creative ideas, it fell short in execution and character development. The relevance to current AI trends and the concept of being undetectable were strong points, but the lack of depth and unlikable supporting characters made it less enjoyable than I had hoped.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️"

Helen Phillips’ elegant prose and thematic depth shine, but the heavy focus on parenting anxiety and pervasive paranoia made the reading experience less enjoyable for me.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story revolves around May, who loses her job to AI and undergoes an experimental cosmetic procedure to support her family. She uses the money to take her family on an expensive vacation to an exclusive botanical garden. The plot is set in a dystopian future dominated by AI robots called \"hums,\" climate disaster, and omnipresent surveillance.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  May is portrayed as the only character with a sense of aversion to the technological advancements around her, as she remembers the world before it became overrun by AI. However, I found it difficult to connect with May or her family. The characters felt underdeveloped, and their relationships lacked depth.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story felt flat and disjointed to me. While the stakes of a crumbling world are high, the narrative lacked stronger, more defined moments and events. The book ended abruptly, leaving me with the impression that nothing significant had happened.  \n\n- **Themes and Setting:**  \n  The novel explores themes of motherhood, family, and the impact of technology and climate disaster on society. The setting is a dystopian future that feels cinematic and could translate well to a film adaptation. However, the execution of these themes in the story left me wanting more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the book is intriguing and the dystopian setting has potential, the execution fell short for me. The characters lacked depth, the pacing felt disjointed, and the story ended without delivering the emotional or narrative impact I had hoped for. Despite its cinematic potential, the book left me feeling unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 (rounded up)."

            "May's children were excessively obnoxious, their constant whining and bickering detracting from the story's atmosphere and intriguing arcs. May and Jem were equally frustrating; their poor communication, questionable financial choices, and awkward dynamic made it hard to empathize with them. A vague suggestion of an affair lingered in the background but ultimately went nowhere, further adding to the discomfort of their relationship.",

The biodome scenes are particularly striking, highlighting a profound appreciation for the remnants of nature while underscoring the painful reality of its inaccessibility for many. The critique of capitalism's empty and detrimental nature is commendable. However, the world-building feels underdeveloped, raising more questions than it answers.

The writing lacks descriptive language and creative worldbuilding, leaning too heavily on telling rather than showing. Additionally, punctuation issues, particularly in the dialogue between Sy and Lu, can be distracting and disrupt the narrative flow.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Concept:**\n   - The story follows May, a woman who undergoes a face-altering procedure for quick cash in a dystopian world facing a global environmental crisis.\n   - The book presents a unique tone of existential dread, with a strong feeling of plausibility and a \"what-if?\" scenario that feels uncomfortably close to our present reality.\n   - The ending is clever and well-executed, looping back to the beginning and forcing the reader to reflect on the story. The concept of technology being both the judge and savior is particularly compelling.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**\n   - The world is intriguing but feels underwritten. There’s a lack of detailed descriptions of the environment, making it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the setting.\n   - The Botanical Garden, a key location, is not described in much detail, which makes it hard to contrast it with the outside world.\n   - The hums and other technological elements are introduced but not explored in depth, leaving the world feeling somewhat hollow.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The prose is described as \"taut\" and \"urgent,\" but it often feels underwritten, with short paragraphs and excessive use of line breaks for dramatic effect.\n   - The writing lacks descriptive language and creative worldbuilding, relying too much on telling rather than showing.\n   - There are issues with punctuation, particularly in the dialogue of Sy and Lu, which can be distracting and disrupt the flow of the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - May is a relatable protagonist, and there are moments where the reader can see themselves in her struggles.\n   - However, other characters, such as May’s husband and children, feel underdeveloped and like \"cardboard cutouts.\" Their motives are unclear, and they lack depth.\n   - The narrative’s focus on May’s perspective limits the reader’s ability to connect with other characters, making them feel more like plot devices than fully realized individuals.\n\n- **Themes and Execution:**\n   - The book touches on important themes like consumerism, environmental crisis, and the impact of technology on society.\n   - However, the execution of these themes is uneven. The book introduces many ideas but doesn’t delve deeply into any of them, leaving the reader wanting more analysis and exploration.\n   - The final chapter feels rushed, as if the author was just hitting her stride before abruptly ending the story.\n\n- **Editing and Quality:**\n   - The book suffers from noticeable editing issues, including repetitive word usage and incorrect punctuation in dialogue.\n   - Given the high standards of the publishing imprint, the lack of polish in the editing is disappointing and detracts from the overall reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Hum* is a conceptually strong novel with a compelling plot and a unique tone of existential dread.

            "The pacing of the story is uneven, with certain elements—such as the children's nudity and random sex scenes—feeling unnecessary and out of place. The narrative ultimately lacks a satisfying payoff, leaving me frustrated and questioning its purpose. Centered on May Webb, a struggling mother who joins an invasive facial alteration trial to make ends meet during her unemployment, the plot takes a dark turn during a family vacation, forcing both the family and readers to confront the aftermath. While the concept is intriguing and evokes a *Black Mirror*-esque tale of technology-induced horror—something I usually enjoy—the execution falls short.",
            "The characters, including May, her husband Jem, and their children Lu and Sy, were largely unlikable. They appeared disconnected and unkind to one another, lacking any redeeming qualities. Jem was the most tolerable, yet he was barely present in the narrative. The children, in particular, were unpleasant, and their obsession with technology felt excessive.",
            "The book evokes a profound sense of depression and anxiety, instilling a constant feeling of dread. While I typically appreciate such tones, this one felt lacking, perhaps due to my inability to connect with the characters. Although the writing showed promise, the execution was lacking. The story would have greatly benefited from more detailed world-building and character development. At 272 pages, it felt underdeveloped and could have been expanded to better explore its ideas.",
            "The novel unfolds in a near-future dystopian city where AI has taken over numerous jobs, leaving beings known as Hums to fill roles once held by humans. However, the world-building is insufficient; the setting lacks vivid descriptions, which led to confusion about key elements, such as the meaning of \"woom,\" until much later in the story.",
            "The story delves into themes of technological advancement, human disconnection, and the dehumanizing impact of AI. I found myself relating more to the Hums than to the human characters, which may have been intentional but ultimately left me feeling ungrounded."

I didn’t care about her or her family.  \n   - The lack of connection with the characters made it hard to care about their struggles or what happened to them.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n   - There’s some world-building, but it’s minimal. For example, the term \"bunny\" was never fully explained, and I had to figure out it was similar to an Apple Watch.  \n   - The descriptions of the hums and the world were left to the reader’s imagination, which felt unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Themes and Message:**  \n   - The narrative explores timely themes like AI, climate change, pollution, and the challenges of motherhood in a changing world.  \n   - However, the story revolves too much around May and her family, which felt boring and repetitive.  \n   - The message about societal issues and motherhood was clear, but the execution didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a promising premise and tackled relevant themes, the execution fell short for me. The lack of character development, minimal world-building, and absence of suspense made it hard to stay engaged. I didn’t connect with the characters or care about their struggles, and the plot lacked the excitement I expected from an AI-driven story. Despite its potential, the narrative felt underwhelming and repetitive.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- I gave an extra star for the premise, but overall, the book didn’t meet my expectations."

The narrative feels rushed, lacking the space to fully explore its themes and characters. A longer format could have allowed for deeper character development and more impactful events.

            "Set in a dystopian world ravaged by climate change and advanced technology, the novel follows May, the protagonist who loses her job to AI robots known as Hums—robots she helped create. In a desperate bid to support her family, May undergoes surgery to alter her appearance, making her unrecognizable to surveillance cameras in exchange for money. The narrative unfolds as May decides to take her family on a rare vacation to the Botanical Gardens, a preserved natural space, insisting they leave their devices behind. This choice sets off a chain of significant events.",
            "I found it difficult to connect with the characters, especially May and her family, due to insufficient backstory and emotional depth. Surprisingly, the AI robots, the Hums, emerged as the most intriguing characters, which may not have been the author's intention. The family dynamics and motivations felt underdeveloped, making it challenging to invest in their stakes or struggles.",
            "The writing style was flat and failed to evoke the emotional depth necessary to engage me with the story. Although the world-building was detailed and compelling, the prose did not enhance the characters or their experiences.",
            "The author's dystopian world is both captivating and hauntingly reflective of our potential future. Themes of nature's loss, environmental degradation, and societal apathy resonate deeply, evoking strong emotions and prompting critical thought. I found myself yearning for a deeper exploration of this world, as it emerged as the most compelling aspect of the novel.",
            "The book centers on themes of motherhood and parenting, which I found unexpected and personally unrelatable. While these themes are relevant and well-intentioned, they overshadowed other aspects of the story that I found more compelling, such as the societal implications of AI and environmental collapse."

However, I struggled to connect with the characters due to underdeveloped backstories and a flat writing style. While the themes of motherhood and parenting were central, they didn’t resonate with me, and I found myself more drawn to the world-building and societal commentary.

            "This book effectively conveys the challenges of parenting in a capitalist society, a sentiment I wholeheartedly share. While it initially hints at an intriguing exploration of the contrast between raising children and the emergence of sentient AI, it ultimately centers more on the difficulties of parenting itself. The inclusion of robots and AI does little to enhance or illuminate the fundamental truths about parenting in this context; rather, it underscores that AI serves as a tool for the majority, rather than a companion.",
            "This book may resonate with parents seeking validation in their struggles. However, for those who have opted not to have children due to the world's dystopian realities, it comes across as a tired trope, reminiscent of the old man yelling at clouds meme."

Instead, it reinforced that AI is a tool of the majority, not a friend.  \n\n- **Relevance and Timeliness:**  \n   - The book, published in 2024, feels somewhat outdated in its message. If parents didn’t already expect to raise children in an unforgiving environment, I’m not sure what to say.  \n   - It reiterates well-known truths: the need for a job to protect your family, the state’s readiness to intervene, and the worsening climate crisis.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n   - This book might resonate with parents who want to feel \"seen\" and validated in their struggles.  \n   - For those who chose not to have children due to the dystopian realities of the world, the book feels like a tired trope, akin to the \"old man yelling at clouds\" meme.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book touches on important themes like the challenges of parenting in a capitalist society and the role of AI, it ultimately feels repetitive and unoriginal.

Additionally, the presence of a school secretary and the absence of advanced technology (e.g., robotic teachers or remote learning) felt out of place and unrealistic for the described dystopian future.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  The novel failed to deliver a compelling or coherent narrative. The lack of depth in both character development and world-building left me unimpressed and disconnected from the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel fell short in creating a believable dystopian world and engaging characters. The inconsistencies in the setting and the lack of personality in the characters made it difficult to enjoy or appreciate the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

I questioned whether there was a coherent plot, as it felt more like a stream of ideas rather than a structured narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  The novel seemed to explore themes of late-stage capitalism, the overwhelming influence of technology, and the alienation it causes. It captured the exhaustion of living in a world dominated by advertising and AI, where human connection feels increasingly rare. Quotes like, “The goal of advertising is to rip a hole in your heart so it can then fill it with plastic, or any other materials that can be yanked out of the earth and, after brief sojourns as objects of desire, be diverted to waste,” and “We are all villains. The system only gives us villainous options,” resonated with these ideas.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  Reading the book left me feeling exhausted, as if I had waded through a constant stream of advertising and societal critique. It made me reflect on how life would be easier if people weren’t constantly online and if technology didn’t make our lives more bureaucratic and lonely.  \n\n- **Execution and Delivery:**  \n  While the novel had big ideas to convey, I felt it fell flat in its delivery. The themes were compelling, but the execution didn’t fully engage me or leave a lasting impact.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel tackled significant themes like late-stage capitalism and technological alienation, but its lack of a clear plot and effective delivery left me feeling confused and unfulfilled. The ideas were thought-provoking, but the execution didn’t do them justice.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The author clearly had a grand idea in mind, and I could see the effort put into creating a believable but bleak future involving AI and robots.  \n\n- **Character Likability:**  \n  Unfortunately, I found all the characters to be unlikable, which made it difficult for me to connect with them or care about their journeys.  \n\n- **Thematic Connection:**  \n  I struggled to connect with the themes in the way the author intended. While the ideas were interesting, they didn’t resonate with me on a deeper level.  \n\n- **Exploration of Ideas:**  \n  The novel presents a thought-provoking future, but I felt the exploration of AI and robots was somewhat surface-level. I wanted more depth and development in this aspect.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  Ultimately, this book wasn’t my cup of tea. Despite its ambition, it didn’t fully engage me or leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I admired the novel’s ambition and vision, the unlikable characters, lack of thematic connection, and insufficient exploration of its futuristic ideas left me feeling underwhelmed. It’s a bold attempt, but it didn’t resonate with me personally.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars"

The story contained vulgar, explicit, and offensive material that I found deeply unsettling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The only positive aspect I noticed was the character of May, the female protagonist. Her decision to undergo a facial procedure to evade scanning cameras in her city was an intriguing and well-thought-out detail.  \n\n- **Author's Style and Future Engagement:**  \n  Due to the explicit and offensive nature of the content, I have decided not to read anything by this author again.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting concept with May's character and her unique approach to evading surveillance, the lack of trigger warnings and the explicit, offensive content made it impossible for me to finish. I would not recommend this book to others.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "The first 10% of the book centers on May's facial surgical modification, an episode that ultimately contributes little to the story and is never revisited. The pacing is sluggish, and the plot lacks direction, resulting in a boring and unengaging reading experience.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n   - The novel lacks subtlety and hope, presenting a bleak and exaggerated version of the near future.  \n   - It extrapolates negative aspects of the present (smartphone obsession, AI, climate change, capitalism) into a dystopian future devoid of joy, passion, love, or color.  \n   - The portrayal of adulthood, marriage, and motherhood is depicted in the most hopeless way possible.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot moves at a good pace, which is one of the few positive aspects.  \n   - The central premise (May changing her appearance for money) feels unnecessary and could have been replaced with a simpler solution like a windfall or severance pay.  \n   - The story focuses excessively on unpleasant details, aligning with the \"scum lit\" subgenre, which describes things in the most unappealing way possible.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The characters are unlikable and make consistently poor decisions.  \n   - May is portrayed as an idiot, Jem as useless, and Lu & Sy as annoying.  \n   - The characters lack depth and seem to have no reason to live, contributing to the overall hopeless tone.  \n\n- **World-Building and Terminology:**  \n   - The world-building is overly pessimistic, with no joy or hope in the future depicted.  \n   - The made-up terms (e.g., hum, woom, bunny) are excessively annoying and poorly conceived.  \n   - The relentless commercial promotions (hums) are amusing but feel out of place in such a bleak setting.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing style is intentionally dull and wooden, reminiscent of *Fahrenheit 451*.  \n   - The focus on unpleasant details and lack of subtlety make the narrative feel heavy-handed and unengaging.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The novel is boring and lacks any sense of joy or hope, making it a difficult and unenjoyable read.  \n   - The story feels like a bizarre parody of real life, which does not resonate with the reader.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis speculative novel presents a bleak, exaggerated, and hopeless vision of the near future, devoid of joy, passion, or subtlety. While the plot moves at a good pace and some elements (like the hums) are amusing, the unlikable characters, unnecessary plot devices, and overly pessimistic tone make it a frustrating and unenjoyable read. The writing style and world-building further detract from the experience, leaving the reader with little to appreciate.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No explicit rating score is mentioned in the review. However, the overall tone suggests a low rating."

I was left wondering if I was supposed to have inferred something that was exceptionally unclear.\n- **Characterization (Child Characters):** The child characters are intolerably whiny. While this might be intended to convey the culture and period of society the story is set in, it was excessive and detracted from my enjoyment.\n- **Plot Development:** I kept waiting for something of interest to happen, but it never came. The story lacked engaging or compelling events.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the book fell short of my expectations.
