However, the story didn’t explore deeper aspects of the gods’ realm or their lives beyond their duties, which felt like a missed opportunity.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The characters were disappointingly bland.

Autumn, in particular, came off as unlikable and underdeveloped, making the romance with the MC feel forced and unappealing.  \n\n- **Romance and Representation:**  \n  While the romance between Autumn and the MC was a major letdown, there were other relationships that provided positive representation, such as asexuality and multiple partners. These aspects added depth and diversity to the story, though they couldn’t compensate for the overall lack of character depth.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**  \n  The mystery of who destroyed the magical mirror that acts as a portal was engaging, but the story didn’t delve into other intriguing elements, such as flashbacks or deeper exploration of the gods’ realm.

            "In this story, Tirne, the main character and a Herald of the god Autumn, comes across as overly passive. While this may have been a deliberate choice, it ultimately frustrated me. She often finds herself as a pawn in others' schemes, rarely taking decisive action. Even when she recognizes someone's untrustworthiness, she allows herself to be manipulated, only to be surprised by their betrayal. I kept hoping for her to assert herself and turn the tables, but that moment never arrived. Additionally, while the book description hinted at romance, this element was minimal. Tirne engages in several relationships, but few are truly romantic. As someone who isn't particularly fond of romance novels, I appreciated the lack of focus on this aspect, but the description may mislead readers expecting more romance.",

While this might have been intentional, I found it frustrating. She often acts as a pawn in other people's plots and rarely takes decisive action.

            "This novel defies the typical fantasy formula.

I felt every emotion Tirne experienced, which made the story deeply resonant.  \n\n- **Representation of Chronic Illness:**  \n  As a chronic migraineur, I felt seen and understood through Tirne’s portrayal of migraines. The author, Amy Avery, handled this aspect exceptionally well, and I even wished I could access some of the potions mentioned in the book.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Genre Expectations:**  \n  This is not a typical fantasy novel. It doesn’t follow the usual formula where romantic leads meet, face a problem or villain, resolve it, and end with a happy, romantic conclusion. Instead, it veers off-course, which some readers might not appreciate, but I found Tirne’s story fascinating because of its uniqueness.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel explores female empowerment, magic, romance, mythology, and the theme of persevering through pain to survive daily life. These elements made the book a winner for me.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  Zura Johnson’s narration was excellent. She brought Tirne to life and enhanced my experience of the story.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes themes of toxic relationships, familial death, death, blood, chronic illness, ableism, grief, and addiction, which readers should be aware of.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTHE LONGEST AUTUMN is an excellent debut that resonated deeply with me.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations and Premise:**  \n  As an avid reader of Greek Mythology, I had high expectations for this book. The premise promised a spellbinding tale of a human entangled with the god of Autumn, featuring life-threatening danger and a forbidden romance. However, the execution did not live up to these expectations.\n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  One of the standout features of the book is its world-building and magic system. The author paints a vivid and enchanting landscape, creating a fantastical realm where gods and mortals collide. The depiction of the god of Autumn and the inherent dangers that accompany him adds a layer of mystique to the narrative.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Unfortunately, the plot unfolds in a manner that feels both repetitive and tedious, failing to sustain the initial promise of excitement and intrigue. The pacing struggles to maintain a consistent flow, resulting in moments of stagnation that hinder the overall progression of the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, central to any engaging narrative, lack the depth and development needed to fully captivate me as a reader. Their actions and motivations become predictable, making it challenging to establish a meaningful connection with them.\n\n- **Romantic Element:**  \n  The forbidden romance, a key element in the synopsis, falls flat due to its underdeveloped nature. This left me yearning for a more compelling emotional journey.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excels in world-building and creating an enchanting magical realm, it falls short in plot execution, pacing, and character development. The underdeveloped romance further detracts from the overall experience, leaving the narrative feeling incomplete and unsatisfying.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The final reveal was both surprising and skillfully executed. I appreciated that the story was contained within a stand-alone novel, avoiding unnecessary extensions into a trilogy or duology.

The narrative centers on the mystery of the broken mirror and the evolving relationships of the characters against the backdrop of a world threatened by perpetual autumn.",

The concept of seasons lasting longer than expected is central to the story, and the progression of the consequences, such as food scarcity and societal desperation, is both fascinating and well-executed. The brainstorming behind making these elements as accurate as possible adds depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, including the protagonist Tirne, are complex and flawed. They are messy, cruel, jealous, and deeply human, which makes them relatable and compelling. Sidriel is particularly intriguing as a scheme-y and ruthless character, while Leareda stands out as a manipulative yet fascinating gossip queen. Tirne’s growth throughout the book is satisfying and well-portrayed.\n\n- **Themes and Tension:**  \n  The tension between faith and a harsh, unforgiving world is a central theme. Tirne’s faith is repeatedly tested as her god becomes more human, and she uncovers long-hidden secrets. This struggle is handled with nuance and resonates with real-world challenges, making it emotionally impactful.\n\n- **Mystery and Plot:**  \n  The book features a twisty mystery centered around who shattered the mirror and why. The narrative keeps readers guessing, with numerous suspicious characters adding to the intrigue. The ending is bittersweet and perfectly aligns with the book’s themes, offering a satisfying conclusion that avoids being overly saccharine.\n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  While not a fantasy romance, the book includes romantic elements and messy relationships that add depth to the story. Tirne’s relationships are deliciously complicated, and the romantic threads enhance the narrative without overshadowing the main plot.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*THE LONGEST AUTUMN* is a standout fantasy novel with rich world-building, complex characters, and a compelling mix of mystery, faith, and romance.

            "I appreciated the novel's ending, which deviates from the typical \"boy gets girl/girl gets boy\" conclusion. Tirne's choice, though somewhat selfish, feels liberating and authentic to her character.",
            "The novel is a compelling quest, following Tirne as she seeks to uncover the identity of her poisoner, which led to her removal as herald, while also embarking on a journey of self-discovery. At times, I found it difficult to understand why her passion for being a herald was depicted so negatively. Her obsession with reclaiming her position prompts her best friend to label her a monster, and there is some truth to that. Tirne jeopardizes everything—her friendships and core beliefs—in her pursuit. It is only when she recognizes the harm her actions inflict on others that she begins to evolve.",

I also appreciated the incorporation of elements inspired by Greek mythology and other cultures. For instance, while Tirne serves as a herald, other characters engage in magic, alchemy, and the preservation of traditions.",

While I don’t usually gravitate toward this genre, I’m always on the lookout for excellent examples of fantasy.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  What Avery does best is create an atmospheric setting. The detailed descriptions of scents and vibrant colors transport the reader into this world, making you feel as though you’re right there alongside Tirne, Autumn, and the other characters.  \n\n- **Cultural and Mythological Integration:**  \n  I appreciated the integration of concepts that allude to Greek mythology, as well as revisions of other cultures. For example, Tirne is a herald, but there are other characters whose roles involve magic, alchemy, and overseeing traditions.  \n\n- **Character Development and Themes:**  \n  The novel is very much a quest, with Tirne on a journey to uncover who poisoned her, leading to her removal as herald, and to discover her true self—who she really is and what she wants from life.  \n  There were moments when I struggled to understand why Tirne’s passion for being a herald was portrayed so negatively. Her fixation on regaining her position leads her best friend to call her a monster, and there’s some truth to that. Tirne risks everything, including her friendships and beliefs, to reclaim her role. It’s only when she realizes how her actions are harming others that she begins to grow.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I really liked the way the novel ended. It wasn’t the traditional “boy gets girl/girl gets boy” conclusion. Tirne makes a decision that, while somewhat selfish, feels liberating and true to her character.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  As this was an audiobook, I want to highlight that the narrator did an excellent job of conveying emotion. There were many intense emotional moments, and the narrator’s performance helped me fully experience them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, fantasy readers will love this novel, and even those who don’t typically seek out this genre will appreciate Avery’s writing style and the immersive world she has created.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While some moments seemed designed to keep us guessing, others felt unresolved, like a staircase leading to nowhere. I was also dissatisfied with the portrayal of Autumn and Tirne's so-called forbidden romance; it often felt unnatural and unnecessary.

It took me some time to recognize her obsession and the lengths she would go to achieve her goals, which made her journey all the more satisfying.

I also really appreciated the author's depiction of living with a chronic condition. I related so hard to Tirne's masking, the pain, the stigmas, and the struggles of living with an invisible disability.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Tirne's character development was compelling. Like Tirne herself, it took me a while to realize she had become obsessed and just how far she was willing to go to achieve her goals. This made her journey and growth all the more satisfying. I really felt her pain and her growth, and her journey gets traumatically dark.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The world felt both very magical and very real (as in not-fantasy). It was full of wonder and incredible darkness. There was a lot of mystery and intrigue, as many characters are capable of both great and terrible things, and you never truly know what anyone is capable of. I felt very invested in many of these characters.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  The pacing and story started strong, but somewhere in the middle, it felt like things slowed down or sidetracked too far. A few times, I found myself wondering what the point of certain scenes was. Sometimes it felt like it was meant to keep us guessing, but other times it just felt unresolved, like a staircase leading nowhere.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  I didn’t really like the way Autumn and Tirne's so-called forbidden romance played out. Parts of it felt unnatural or unnecessary. While I understand it was there to show Autumn's increasing mortality, it sometimes felt confusing or unfulfilling, leaving me questioning the purpose of certain scenes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed *The Longest Autumn*. It excelled in depicting complex relationships, character growth, and a richly detailed world, though the pacing and romance subplot could have been stronger.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "This story's focus on a woman deeply committed to her career is compelling. Despite a slower start, the well-developed characters kept me engaged, each with distinct personalities that fostered intriguing interactions and a sense of court intrigue. The queernormative society felt organic and well-integrated, serving as a backdrop rather than the main focus. The portrayal of sexuality was tastefully done, with each encounter rich in tension, intimacy, and allure.",

            "Although the book features romantic elements, it shouldn't be labeled a romance novel. Instead, it focuses on personal growth, resilience, and the pursuit of a fulfilling life independent of romantic love.",

However, I decided to take a chance and found that what put other readers off was refreshing to me.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  I was fascinated by the world and the well-thought-out approach to season magic. The setting felt immersive and unique.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  The focus on a woman deeply dedicated to her job was compelling. The characters carried me through the slower beginning, and I appreciated how the author imagined the entire cast as distinct personalities with multiple dimensions. This led to great interactions and a kind of court intrigue that was executed well.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Engagement:**  \n  The mystery took its time to build thrill, but I binged the last 200 pages in one afternoon. The escalation in the final 100 pages made it impossible to put down.  \n\n- **Queernormative Society and Representation:**  \n  The novel’s queernormative society felt natural and balanced. Queernormativity wasn’t the focus of the story—it simply existed. The open approach to sex was tastefully written, with each encounter full of tension, intimacy, and enticement.  \n\n- **Romantic and Aromantic Representation:**  \n  I enjoyed that the main character, Tirne, ends up alone, casting aside romantic conventions. Her relationships were beautiful while they lasted, but she didn’t need a partner to exist. Her full life with friends and purpose, along with her resilience through many lows, showcased her strength. This was a refreshing reprieve for an aromantic perspective.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  While the book includes romantic elements, I wouldn’t classify it as a romance novel. It’s more about personal growth, resilience, and living a fulfilling life without romantic love.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial hesitation, I’m really glad I tried this book. The immersive world, well-developed characters, and refreshing approach to queernormativity and aromantic representation made it a standout read.

            "The story occasionally lost momentum, with certain sections in the middle feeling drawn out. While the ending provided a fitting conclusion to Tirne’s character arc, it didn’t resonate deeply with me. My mixed feelings about the romantic relationships diminished the emotional impact of the conclusion. However, the premise of *The Longest Autumn* is intriguing, featuring humans as heralds for the gods to usher in the seasons. The plot, centered around the breaking of the Mirror that separates their worlds and results in an endless autumn, is captivating.",

It showcased complicated relationships and explored multiple kinds of love, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I don’t need a neatly tied-up ending, and I was glad this book didn’t provide one. The unresolved elements felt authentic and fitting for the story.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  While the world-building wasn’t very vast, it was beautifully crafted. The setting felt immersive and added to the overall atmosphere of the novel.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The last third of the book took me on a roller coaster of emotions. While this part seemed to fall flat for some readers, it was the highlight of the book for me and made the story truly memorable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite mixed reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Its exploration of complex relationships, beautiful world-building, and emotional depth made it a standout read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I appreciated Tirne's other partners throughout the story, the connection between the main characters felt lacking. Autumn came across as a flat character; he didn't embody a God but rather seemed like a man struggling to understand his emotions and conforming to public expectations. Tirne was often frustrating as well; she discovered clues about the mirror's curse but withheld them to avoid exiling anyone. Additionally, she quickly dismissed her friends as suspects, despite the fact that it would take someone close to her to cast such a curse. On a positive note, I loved Sidriel's character. It's often the seemingly evil characters who experience the most growth and offer valuable lessons.",

He didn’t feel like a God; instead, he seemed like a man who lacked understanding of his emotions and simply acted based on what the general public wanted. Tirne was often frustrating, as she found clues about who broke the mirror but didn’t share them because she didn’t want to get people exiled. She also immediately disregarded her friends as suspects, even though it would take someone close to her to curse her like that.\n\n- **Themes and Ideas:**  \n  I really enjoyed the idea that Gods are fallible, regardless of your religion. The concept that there are always two sides to a story and that people often only listen to the side they want to hear was thought-provoking. The world-building and the changing of the seasons with the arrival of each God were also highlights for me.\n\n- **Character Appreciation:**  \n  I loved Sidriel’s character. It’s always the person who seems the most evil that has the most growth and offers the most to learn from.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The book had a very solid foundation, but I was bored through the first half, which took away from my enjoyment of the last 25%.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some strong elements, such as its themes, world-building, and certain characters, the lack of romance, flat character development, and slow pacing in the first half diminished my overall enjoyment. It’s a decent read with potential, but it didn’t fully meet my expectations.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars (neutral rating)."

            "I initially found Tirne to be a compelling and strong protagonist. However, as the story progressed, her character diminished significantly. My main concern was her passivity; she was so inactive that a rock could have taken her place without altering the outcome. Her personality seemed to hinge solely on her headaches and her unclear role as Herald, which felt insignificant. In contrast, the side characters, particularly the sorcerers, were far more captivating and contributed meaningfully to the plot, making them much more engaging than Tirne.",

While the magic system and the \"good magic vs. evil magic\" trope could have been better explained, I still found them engaging.

However, I was left curious about the gods' realm and wished for more exploration of that aspect."

However, once things got bad, her character fell apart. My biggest issue was that she didn’t do anything—she was so passive that you could have replaced her with a rock, and the story would have ended the same way. Her entire personality revolved around her headaches and her position as Herald, which was unclear and seemingly unimportant.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  The side characters, especially the sorcerers, were far more intriguing and worth following than Tirne. At least they were able to contribute meaningfully to the plot, which made them more engaging.  \n\n- **Fantasy Elements and World-Building:**  \n  I didn’t give this book a lower rating because I loved the fantasy elements. The magic system and the “good magic vs evil magic” trope could have been explained better, but I still enjoyed them. I particularly liked seeing how the god Autumn changed the more he was in the human realm. However, I was left wondering what the gods’ realm looked like, and I wish there had been more exploration of this aspect.  \n\n- **Potential for a Series:**  \n  Part of me wonders if this will remain a standalone book or if the author plans to make it a series. However, a large part of me doesn’t care to find out, as my interest in the story and characters has waned.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had strong fantasy elements and intriguing side characters, the main character, Tirne, was a significant letdown due to her passivity and lack of development.

I felt like too much was left unsaid here, and then all of a sudden, we had a resolution and the book was over.  \n\n- **Suggestions for Improvement:**  \n  We could have replaced the fluff in the middle with more on this part of the story instead.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a strong and creative concept with a fresh perspective on Gods and their interaction with humans, the pacing issues in the middle and the lack of development for certain aspects of the world and characters left me wanting more. The abrupt resolution further highlighted these shortcomings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The characters, both divine and mortal, are complex and deeply human. The protagonist, Tirne, is relatable, fueled by ambition and a longing to reclaim her status.

Its original mythological elements include a distinct pantheon based on the four seasons, complete with a dedicated calendar and religious holidays.

The resolution felt rushed, as everything was resolved in the final 25 pages at a breakneck speed.",

While there is some spice, it’s not explicit, and the romantic elements felt underdeveloped.  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is the strongest aspect of the book.

            "The premise of a forbidden romance steeped in mythology was captivating, but the plot ultimately fell short of my expectations. Instead of focusing on the fantasy-romance I anticipated, the story leaned more towards a whodunit mystery, which was disappointing.",

The concept of mortals escorting gods through realms to transition seasons is fascinating and well-executed.\n\n- **Plot Expectations vs. Delivery:**  \n  While the premise of a forbidden romance with heavy mythology roots was captivating, the plot did not fully meet my expectations.

This was a significant letdown, as I had hoped for a more compelling romantic dynamic.\n\n- **Character Development (Tirne’s Inner Journey):**  \n  Tirne’s character arc was engaging, particularly her journey to clear her name after being blamed for the shattered mirror. Her pride in her role as a herald and her determination to uncover the truth added depth to her character.\n\n- **Mystery and Intrigue:**  \n  The mystery surrounding the shattered mirror and the political intrigue within the story were well-crafted and kept me invested. The \"whodunit\" aspect was a strong point, even if it overshadowed the romance.\n\n- **Representation (Chronic Illness):**  \n  The inclusion of chronic illness representation, specifically debilitating migraines, was a thoughtful and meaningful addition to the story.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narration by Zura Johnson was lovely, but the story itself made it difficult to stay fully engaged. Switching between the audiobook and ebook did not significantly enhance the experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Longest Autumn* excels in world-building and mystery, it falls short in delivering a compelling romance, which was a key expectation for me.

When the portal between the human world and the gods' realm shatters during the transition from Summer to Autumn, Tirne must clear her name by identifying the true villain while others work to repair the portal before the world faces starvation.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The cast of characters seemed diverse, and it was not always easy to determine whom Tirne should trust. However, the book ended with too many loose ends in terms of relationships, leaving unresolved dynamics that could have been explored further.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Some aspects of the world-building were unique, such as the concept of the changing seasons being tied to the gods. However, several issues introduced in the world (e.g., Tirne's headaches) were repeatedly emphasized but ultimately had no bearing on the plot, which felt unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  The novel maintained an interesting pace, and I was invested in Tirne's journey to find answers and save her future. However, the resolution felt unclear, particularly regarding how the portal was ultimately fixed. This lack of clarity left some frustration.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Content:**  \n  There was a significant amount of casual sex in the book. While I don’t mind well-integrated sex scenes, many felt unnecessary and detracted from the story rather than enhancing it.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook was narrated by Zura Johnson, whose delivery was expressive, and she did an excellent job distinguishing among the characters, adding depth to the listening experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws, the novel was engaging, and I found myself rooting for Tirne throughout her journey.

Tirne, the Herald of Autumn, navigates between the land of the gods, Sylvus, and the mortal world. The story takes a dramatic turn when the magical mirror, essential for the gods' movement between realms, shatters, trapping the world in perpetual autumn. Tirne must solve the mystery of the mirror's destruction while dealing with temple politics and her own personal growth.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Tirne is a compelling protagonist who undergoes significant self-reflection as she strives to regain her Herald position. The god who becomes more mortal-like in the mortal realm adds an interesting dynamic to the story. The diverse cast of characters and their interpersonal politics are well-developed and engaging.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance between Tirne and Autumn is present but takes a backseat to the main plot. The blurb may have overstated the level of forbidden romance, as it is not a central focus. Additionally, the romantic scenes are fade-to-black, so readers seeking explicit content may be disappointed.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world of Sylvus and the mortal realm is richly imagined, with a unique blend of magic and intrigue. The concept of seasonal gods and their interaction with the mortal world is original and well-executed.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Amy Avery's writing is well-crafted, making the story immersive and enjoyable. The narrative balances mystery, politics, and character development effectively.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Longest Autumn* is a unique and well-written fantasy novel that offers a fresh take on the genre. While the romance may not meet some readers' expectations, the intricate plot, strong character development, and rich world-building make it a standout read. I highly recommend it to fans of magical and intriguing fantasy stories and hope to see more from this universe.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Tirne's quest to uncover the mystery of the mirror became somewhat tedious towards the end. However, the final twists were effective, successfully tying up loose ends.",
            "Tirne's headaches, which necessitated medication, served as a connection to several characters, but I anticipated a deeper revelation about them that never materialized. Instead, she felt more like a plot device than a fully realized character. I struggled to believe in the love between Tirne and Autumn; their bond, rooted in blood, seemed insufficient, especially given their limited physical interactions. In contrast, I found her relationship with the sorcerer more compelling. Ultimately, I appreciated the ending—Tirne has always been ambitious and deserves a love that transcends mere convenience or familial ties. She can have both love and a fulfilling career.",
            "I was captivated by the premise of the seasons as gods entering the mortal realm. The world-building was intriguing, but I found myself wanting more details. For instance, are all the children of the seasons just wandering around the temple? Are they forming connections with one another? It left me curious!"

The world-building was very interesting, but I also wished there was more. For example, are all the seasons' kids just walking around in the temple? Are they all hooking up with each other? Lol.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  Tirne was trying to solve what happened to the mirror, but it got a little laborious towards the end. The twists at the end were good and started to tie the loose ends together.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I know Tirne’s headaches, which caused her to need medicines, were how she got tied to a few characters. But I was waiting for a reveal about her headaches being a sign of something, which didn’t come. She felt like she was used as a matter of convenience.\n\n- **Romantic Relationships:**  \n  I couldn’t buy into Tirne and Autumn’s love. I get that they were connected by blood, but he touches her three times, and it’s love? I felt her relationship more with the sorcerer. I don’t mind how it ended—she was always a woman of ambition, and she deserves love too, one that isn’t out of blood relation or convenience. She can have both love and her work.\n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  This author shows promise. With a little more character-building and storytelling, I think this author could tell a good story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had a lot of promise with its unique premise and interesting world-building, but it fell short in execution, particularly in character development and romantic relationships.

            "The love triangle and the individual relationships felt contrived and lackluster. I was disappointed that the leading lady ended up with neither romantic interest, as their feelings lacked depth. One relationship was driven by dark romantic lust, while the other was an unrewarding slow burn. The connection with Autumn had the most potential, and it was frustrating that the male lead didn’t sacrifice his godly position to be with his Herald. The justification for the other romantic option felt weak; I believe the female lead would have gone to similar lengths, such as killing someone, to fix the mirror given her growing desperation. Additionally, Jade and Bix’s relationship seemed overly monogamous and inseparable, suggesting that Jade doesn’t fully understand the diverse ways romantic feelings can manifest.

Tirne's quest to uncover the mystery of the portal's malfunction was poorly executed, making her efforts feel almost comical. The ending appeared hastily assembled and lacked coherence, leaving the reading experience feeling futile. While the author had a promising concept, it seemed they struggled to develop it effectively.",

Tirne, a herald for the god of autumn, ferries dead souls from the land of the living to the well of souls in the land of the gods. When the portal between worlds breaks, Tirne, the god of autumn, and the dead souls are trapped in the land of the living, plunging the world into an endless autumn. The author did an amazing job setting up the story and infusing the first chapters with a profound sense of autumn. The descriptions of orange leaves, crisp apples, and pumpkins set the scene beautifully.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  Unfortunately, the story didn't go anywhere and was incredibly tedious from page 60 to 260. Tirne's goal was to solve the mystery of how the portal broke, but her attempts to do this were laughably bad. The ending seemed thrown together, unplanned, and made reading the book feel really pointless. I think the author had a great idea for a book but not enough ideas on how to carry it through.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I found Tirne frustratingly annoying. She complained incessantly about her headaches and every ache and pain she had. She was attracted to everyone, so every attempt at romance fell flat. The side characters were flat and uninteresting. The god of autumn seemed weak and selfish.\n\n- **Descriptive Elements:**  \n  The beautiful descriptions of autumn almost completely disappeared as the story progressed.\n\n- **Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  It just wasn't satisfying. I hated the ending, and the book felt like a missed opportunity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had a strong start with an intriguing premise and vivid descriptions of autumn, but it failed to deliver on its potential. The plot became tedious, the characters were unlikable, and the ending was disappointing.

Tirne's relationship with Sidriel felt superficial, much like her interactions with everyone else. Her relationship with Autumn was also unconvincing; she lied and betrayed him, claiming her actions were for his benefit, but there was no meaningful past between them beyond being next to each other for six years.\n\n- **Friendships and Relationships:**  \n  Tirne's friendship with Jade needed to end because she was distant and emotionally absent. Feyre, on the other hand, came across as a mean girl, entirely self-absorbed.

The main character’s inconsistency and the underdeveloped universe made it difficult to fully engage with the story. However, the book’s brevity was a saving grace, allowing me to move on swiftly. I remain hopeful that the author’s future works will show growth and improvement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It took time for the story to pick up enough to keep me engaged.  \n- **Character Development (Tirne):**  \n  Tirne, the protagonist, was quite oblivious at times, too trusting with some people and not trusting enough with others. She also came across as extremely selfish at times, which made her unlikable for most of the book.  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world created in this novel was beautiful. I particularly loved the concept of seasons as gods, the religion, and how they were worshipped.  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story was full of secrets and deceptions, which added depth and intrigue. The ending was neither happy nor sad but somewhere in the middle, which I found compelling.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy fantasy novels with richly detailed worlds and beautiful, immersive settings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a slow start and a protagonist who was often unlikable, the beautiful world-building, intricate plot, and thought-provoking ending made it a worthwhile read.

            "I found Tirne challenging to connect with, as her motivations often felt unclear. Her pattern of romantically involving herself with individuals who clearly did not have her best interests at heart seemed more like self-punishment, which was frustrating and detracted from the overall narrative. Additionally, the supporting characters felt one-dimensional and predictable; despite the large ensemble, none stood out as particularly compelling or well-developed.",

In fact, I found the MC annoying.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  - I flipped to the end to see if much changed, and while there was some resolution, it felt very lackluster.  \n  - The book had a lot of potential, but it didn’t deliver on its promise.  \n\n- **Length and Structure:**  \n  - The book is just over 300 pages, but it felt like it needed more space to develop the story properly.  \n  - However, I’m not sure if a longer book would have helped, as it might have just added more repetition.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had potential but ultimately fell flat due to its repetitive pacing, mediocre writing, and underdeveloped characters.

I am a huge fan of Gothic writing, and this style was a standout feature for me. However, I can see why many readers didn’t enjoy it, as Gothic writing is quite unusual for the fantasy genre.  \n\n- **Themes and Comparisons:**  \n  The book was promoted as something for fans of Greek Mythology. I’d agree with that comparison, but only if you go in expecting something along the lines of *Circe*.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were fun to follow, though most of them felt one-dimensional. Despite this, I still found them engaging.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I am so glad I read this book! The writing is beautiful, and I found the story quite enjoyable overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite mixed reviews and some reservations, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its Gothic writing style, beautiful prose, and engaging characters made it a memorable read, even if the characters lacked depth and the genre blend might not appeal to everyone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The ending was particularly disappointing, leaving Tirne with nothing—no Sidriel, no Autumn, and no role as Herald. Her lack of agency in the resolution, including being summoned to repair the mirror and the villain's reveal, rendered the conclusion feel pointless. It was one of the most unsatisfying endings I have ever encountered. Tirne’s choice to abandon everything she fought for felt hollow, as there was little evidence of her ambition or ruthlessness throughout the narrative. The absence of a meaningful resolution left me questioning the purpose of the entire story.",

She gives up on seeking the truth, fails to defend herself when framed a second time, and even watches her aunt die without intervening. Her lack of ambition and emotional engagement renders her a flat and unengaging protagonist.",

The opening of the story drew me in instantly, with the saboteur’s actions and the mirror shattering, stranding Autumn and halting the seasons, creating a sense of tension and investment.  \n\n- **Character Development (Tirne):**  \n  Tirne was the most passive and dull character I have ever read. She does nothing and lets everything happen around her, which became incredibly frustrating. She stops trying, doesn’t search for the culprit, does nothing when framed a second time, and even watches her aunt die without taking action. Her lack of ambition or emotional investment made her a flat and unengaging protagonist.  \n\n- **Romance (Tirne and Autumn):**  \n  There was zero chemistry between Tirne and Autumn. Despite their long history, the lack of flashbacks or meaningful interactions made their relationship unbelievable. Autumn’s willingness to break sacred rules for Tirne felt forced, especially since they barely spoke. Tirne’s lack of emotional investment in the romance further undermined its credibility.  \n\n- **Romance (Tirne and Sidriel):**  \n  Tirne’s relationship with Sidriel was equally frustrating. While she acknowledges he’s bad for her, her flat character made it hard to care. Meanwhile, Autumn’s involvement with other women as he chooses a consort to birth his children added another layer of disappointment, especially given his intriguing role as the god of Autumn.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story started strong but quickly lost momentum. Forgotten plotlines, such as the other god and the cult following, added to the confusion. The ending was particularly unsatisfying, with Tirne ending up with nothing—no Sidriel, no Autumn, and no role as Herald. Her lack of agency in the resolution, including being summoned to repair the mirror and the bad guy revealing themselves, made the conclusion feel pointless.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was the most unsatisfying I have ever read. Tirne’s decision to give up everything she supposedly fought for felt hollow, as there was no evidence of her ambition or ruthlessness throughout the story. The lack of a meaningful resolution left me questioning the purpose of the entire narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite an intriguing premise and a strong opening, the novel fell flat due to its passive protagonist, lackluster romances, forgotten plotlines, and an unsatisfying ending. The potential of the concept was overshadowed by poor execution, leaving me deeply disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story intertwines a mystery and a romance, but both elements feel secondary to the central theme of Tirne's gradual loss of everything she cherishes. The slow-paced, character-driven narrative may appeal to readers who enjoy introspective fantasies. However, the romantic relationships lack depth, and the resolution of the mystery comes across as anticlimactic and delivered too casually.",
            "This story features a rich array of LGBTQIA+ characters, and I particularly value the representation of chronic pain through Tirne's perspective. Her internal conflict with faith, as she witnesses the god of Autumn becoming more human, is both compelling and adds significant depth to her character.",
            "This book features impressive worldbuilding and a captivating magic system. I particularly enjoyed the connection between the gods and the seasons, as well as the delicate balance between their mortality and divinity achieved through their travels between realms. The author skillfully contrasts the lives of those who serve at the temple with those outside its gates.",
            "The author candidly explores Tirne's suffering, vividly depicting her devastation over losing her position and her battles with chronic pain. As her situation deteriorates, Tirne faces a critical choice: how much of herself is she willing to sacrifice to reclaim her status? Her poignant journey of disentangling her identity from her position and faith invites deep engagement."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Longest Autumn* is a slow-paced, character-driven fantasy that explores themes of loss, identity, and resilience. While its worldbuilding and representation of chronic pain are strengths, the underdeveloped romance and anticlimactic mystery resolution may leave some readers wanting more. This book will likely resonate with those who enjoy introspective stories about rebuilding after personal devastation.",

I loved the connection between the gods and the seasons, as well as the balance between their mortality and divinity maintained by traveling between the two worlds. Avery does an excellent job of showcasing the lives of those who serve at the temple and contrasting them with those outside the gates.  \n\n- **Character Representation and Themes:**  \n  The world is populated with a diverse range of LGBTQIA+ characters, and I appreciate the representation of chronic pain through Tirne's perspective. Her struggle with faith as she watches the god of Autumn become more human is compelling and adds depth to her character.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the plot includes a mystery and a romance, both feel incidental to the core of the story, which focuses on Tirne's gradual loss of everything she holds dear. The slow-paced, character-driven narrative may resonate with readers who prefer introspective fantasies. However, the romantic relationships lack development, and the mystery's resolution feels anticlimactic and casually delivered.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Character Journey:**  \n  Avery does not shy away from Tirne's suffering. Her devastation over losing her position and her struggles with chronic pain are portrayed with raw honesty. As her circumstances worsen, Tirne must decide how much of herself she's willing to sacrifice to regain her status. Her journey of separating her identity from her position and faith is poignant and worth engaging with.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Longest Autumn* is a slow-paced, character-driven fantasy that explores themes of loss, identity, and resilience.

Her struggle with debilitating headaches adds another layer to her character, making her compelling and complex.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The novel blends fantasy, slow-burn romance, and mystery, with a strong mythological undertone.

Starting at the pinnacle of social status, her fall from grace prompts her to reevaluate her life, beliefs, and purpose. While she occasionally feels one-dimensional, her character growth becomes more profound as the story unfolds. The supporting characters primarily serve as a backdrop to Tirne's journey, which remains the central focus. Although the romance aspect deviates from traditional norms, I appreciated the diverse relationships depicted throughout the narrative.",

Amy Avery did a good job at setting up the story in a new magical world with a vast cast of characters, ending it with a resolution that fit well.  \n\n- **Character Development (Tirne):**  \n  Tirne, the flawed female main character (FMC), was enjoyable to read about, particularly her journey of faith. She starts at the top in social status and only after falling to the bottom does she begin to question her life, faith, and role in the world. While I felt she was a little one-dimensional at times, her character growth and development deepened significantly throughout the story.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The other characters served more as a backdrop to Tirne, as the story was primarily focused on her journey.  \n\n- **Pacing and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery element kept me engaged, though I felt the story moved at a slow pace. This might be because we were witnessing the mystery through Tirne’s perspective as she tried to figure things out herself.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  The romance element wasn’t what I would typically consider romance, but I appreciated the diversity of relationships portrayed in the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**  \n  Overall, this was an atmospheric fantasy novel with elements of romance and mystery. At its core, it was a story about a young woman finding herself outside of the faith that had defined her for so long.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Longest Autumn* is a compelling fantasy novel with a strong focus on character growth, faith, and self-discovery. While the pacing felt slow at times, the mystery and atmospheric storytelling kept me engaged. Tirne’s journey, though occasionally one-dimensional, was deeply impactful, making this a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
