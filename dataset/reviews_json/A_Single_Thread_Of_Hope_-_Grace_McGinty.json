            "The story would have greatly benefited from a slower burn, allowing for more gradual relationship development. The transition between the first and second books felt abrupt, lacking the necessary closure or context to justify the split. Overall, the narrative would have been more cohesive as a single, thicker book rather than as two separate parts.",
            "I had trouble fully connecting with the key characters and their relationships across the two books. Although the harem concept was present, the characters often felt more like fleeting impressions than integral parts of the story. While I appreciated how the new addition to the harem in the first book was introduced smoothly, I still found it challenging to view them as a cohesive group.",
            "The author skillfully weaves a variety of mythical creatures into the narrative, striking a commendable balance that prevents it from feeling overwhelming. However, I believe the story could have benefited from a deeper exploration of these mythical elements and the world-building, which would have fostered a richer connection to the characters and their arcs.",

While they didn't leave a lasting impression, they offered a fun and accessible read, striking a nice balance between depth and lightheartedness. This will likely appeal to fans of fantasy, mythology, and a hint of history."

            "The story prioritizes plot over smut, which I found refreshing. The engaging narrative made the absence of excessive explicit content feel like a strength rather than a drawback. The balance between sweetness and spice was perfect, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments.",
            "Wren is a compelling female protagonist whose strength is rooted in her heart and soul rather than in traditional notions of power. As a mother, she embodies resilience and self-worth, demonstrating fearlessness when it counts while remaining open to vulnerability and support from others. Her choices reflect the depth of her love, adding significant emotional weight to the story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n  I loved this duet and highly recommend it if you enjoy books about Pantheons, Gods, and anything mythical. The mythical elements and world-building were captivating.  \n\n- **Main Character (Wren):**  \n  Wren is a strong female main character (FMC), but not in the typical \"badass\" sense where she’s overpowered and takes down enemies effortlessly. Instead, her strength lies in her heart and soul. She’s a mother and a woman who knows her worth, fearless when it matters, yet still vulnerable and willing to lean on others for support. Her decisions reflect the depth of a loving mother, which added emotional weight to the story.  \n\n- **Harem Dynamics:**  \n  Every male in the harem felt like their own distinct character, and it was hard to pick a favorite because each man brought something unique to Wren’s life. Together, they provided her with protection, love, and balance. The dynamic wasn’t just about Wren needing them; the men also needed each other, which made the relationships feel more layered and meaningful.  \n\n- **Spice Level and Plot Balance:**  \n  The story leans more toward plot than smut, which worked well for me. The plot was so engaging that the lack of excessive smut didn’t feel like a disappointment. The balance between sweetness and spice was just right, making the emotional moments hit harder.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This story made me tear up at times, laugh, smile like a loon, and feel genuinely happy. The emotional depth and character connections were beautifully written.  \n\n- **Desire for More Stories in the Universe:**  \n  I’m eager to explore more of Grace’s works, especially in this universe. I’d love to see side characters get their own love stories or even follow the triplets as they grow into men. Imagining them in a harem with the father of monsters god and a cute FMC would be hilarious, especially seeing their father’s reactions!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis duet was a delightful blend of mythical elements, emotional depth, and well-balanced relationships. Wren’s strength as a mother and the unique dynamics of the harem made the story stand out. The plot-driven narrative with just the right amount of spice kept me engaged, and the emotional highs and lows left a lasting impression.

            "The plot is clear, engaging, and packed with action, emotion, and humor. However, the transition in Book 1 from centering on Nate to introducing other main characters felt somewhat awkward.",
            "The female main character (FMC) is funny, relatable, and a hidden badass. The male main characters (MMCs) are well-developed, each with distinct personalities, which is impressive for a harem story. Nate stands out as the odd one out due to his Norse mythic background and lack of connection to the Crete friend group. Milo is an adorable cinnamon roll who deserves all the love. By the end of Book 2, the romantic development between the FMC and the MMCs improves, particularly the chemistry between Wren and Demke. However, I believe the story would have been stronger if the other MMCs had platonic relationships with the FMC, allowing for a deeper focus on the dynamic between Nate and Wren.",

Demke, the Minoan God of Renewal, introduces themes of rebirth, and Teron, the Gryphon, adds a mythical element.
