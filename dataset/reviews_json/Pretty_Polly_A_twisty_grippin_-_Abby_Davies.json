At least for me, it was.  \n   - It left me on the edge of my seat, my mouth gaping, and just in utter shock.  \n\n- **Genre and Recommendation:**  \n   - If you’re looking for a thriller book about a serial killer out for revenge, a story filled with secrets, and a story that will leave you breathless in the best way, I cannot recommend this one enough.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n   - Thank you to #booksirens & Abby Davies for allowing me to read this ARC! I can’t wait to read more!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterfully crafted psychological thriller with a gripping plot, unexpected twists, and deeply engaging characters.

While I appreciated her inner dialogue for helping me gauge her emotions and turmoil, it was, at times, repetitive and self-wallowing. There was no discussion about how she tried to work through her past mistakes or pain, which was surprising given her role as a therapist.  \n\n- **Character Development (Mark):**  \n  I really disliked Mark as a character and struggled to rationalize his need to be in the story.
