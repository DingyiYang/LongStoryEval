            "The ending is largely satisfying, filled with emotional and faith-driven moments, although certain aspects of the killer's tattooing process remain unclear. Owen’s tragic character arc serves as a crucial turning point in Ty’s faith journey. The plot centers on a serial killer who abducts women named after flowers, tattooing them as part of his twisted garden. The Strange Crimes Unit (SCU) is well-developed, with each member showcasing distinct skills and personalities. Ty, the impulsive and witty protagonist, has a complex backstory involving a cult and a personal connection to the case. The killer's motives are deeply personal, targeting Ty as part of a revenge scheme.",
            "The book primarily utilizes a third-person narrative with shifting perspectives, which can occasionally be disorienting. Ty's sections shine with humor and sarcasm, while other characters, like Bexley, bring a tone of anxiety, and the killer adds an element of mystery. The author skillfully interweaves humor and wit, resulting in realistic and engaging dialogue.",
            "The book thoughtfully incorporates cultural references, including a nod to *This Is Us*. However, certain plot elements, such as the delayed acquisition of a sketch of the killer, feel unrealistic and could benefit from better justification.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Continuity and Character Development:**  \n  - This psychological thriller features a familiar cast of characters from the previous two books, *Her Darkest Secret* and *A Cry in the Dark*. While the books aren’t officially marked as a series, they should be, as they are interconnected. Each book can stand alone, but I recommend reading them in order for a better experience.  \n  - I’ve really enjoyed the dynamics of this group of FBI agents. Their relationships feel realistic, and they consistently support and have each other’s backs, which adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The cult background story was intriguing and served as a lesson about the grooming, control, and lies prevalent in such systems.  \n  - The book is packed with twists and turns, though I felt the identity of the killer was overdone and ultimately less believable.  \n  - The depravity and creep factor were intense, especially in the earlier parts of the novel. While I love suspense and psychological thrillers, some details were too unsettling for me and might be overwhelming for readers who have experienced trauma.  \n\n- **Faith and Redemption:**  \n  - The faith element becomes more evident toward the end of the book. Tiberius’ background and his struggle to believe in God are compelling, and his journey to seeing faith and love in action is deeply moving.  \n  - Despite the presence of evil in the world, the story concludes with a sense of redemption and hope, which I found uplifting.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - I recommend this book, but readers would benefit from reading the previous two books in order beforehand.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis psychological thriller offers a gripping plot with a strong cast of characters and an intriguing cult backdrop. While the twists and depravity were intense, the themes of faith, redemption, and hope provided a satisfying conclusion. However, the killer’s identity felt less believable, and the unsettling details might be too much for some readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ & 1/4 (4.25 stars)  \n\n>>> I was kindly provided an advanced digital copy of this book by Net Galley, but I was not required to provide a positive review. All thoughts, opinions, and text are my own."

However, it’s possible to read this book independently if you’re not concerned about the broader character arcs.  \n\n- **Character Development (Tiberius):**  \n   - The protagonist, Tiberius, is an FBI agent specializing in religious crimes. His backstory is compelling—he grew up in a cult, escaped, but left behind the woman he loved, who was pregnant at the time. He believed she was dead, which adds emotional depth to his character.  \n\n- **Plot and Case Details:**  \n   - The story revolves around a new case involving the woman Tiberius once loved, whose sister is among several missing women. These women are found posed in front of lighthouses, tying the case to Tiberius’s team. The case becomes deeply personal for him, and he is determined to solve it to prove he’s not a failure.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - The novel explores themes of redemption, faith, and personal growth. Tiberius grapples with his relationship with God and questions the importance of faith. The looming hurricane adds urgency and tension, raising the stakes for protecting his team and loved ones.  \n\n- **Memorable Quote:**  \n   - One quote that resonated with me was: “We carry scars, little chips and cracks. They reveal our story, but there’s hope, Tiberius. There’s always hope that what was marred can be mended.” This line beautifully encapsulates the novel’s themes of healing and resilience.  \n\n- **Review Disclosure:**  \n   - I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book received from JustRead Publicity Tours. My review reflects my honest opinions, and I was not required to write a positive review or compensated in any way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping addition to the series, with a well-developed protagonist, a compelling plot, and profound themes of faith and redemption.

I sure didn’t.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Engagement**  \n   - The story is intriguing, with a lot of different characters that add depth and complexity.  \n   - I couldn’t even bring myself to read the back matter as that would only make me want to read the next book … now, and it’s not due out until 2025.  \n\n- **Visual Appeal**  \n   - The cover is very intriguing and adds to the overall appeal of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Garden Girls* is a darkly twisted and engaging tale that combines complex characters, a gripping plot, and subtle themes of faith and redemption.

            "Ty is a challenging character to connect with, marked by his anger, bitterness, and a chip on his shoulder. However, the story effectively showcases the transformative power of belief, ultimately conveying a positive message. The author provides Ty with a compelling emotional motivation to confront the villain, adding depth to his character.",

While Ty's background with Becksly was intriguing, the highlight of the book was his friendship with Owen, a genuine and supportive companion. I appreciate stories that emphasize friendship, and the entire team felt authentic and nuanced, leaving me missing them once I finished the book.",

It was so compelling that I immediately revisited the first two books in the series and completed the entire trilogy in just a week!",
            "As someone new to the thriller genre, I usually steer clear of books that focus heavily on topics like murder. However, this book exceeded my expectations and was exceptionally well-crafted."

I didn’t expect it in this type of book, and I feel like the author nailed it. A non-believer could read this book and still be moved by how the faith message was integrated.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - Tiberius (Ty) was my sort of guy—serious but humorous, deeply loyal, and passionate. I loved watching his story unfurl and figuring out how it intersected with the killer’s story.  \n  - Ty's background with Becksly was interesting, but the true standout relationship in the book was his friendship with Owen. I like books that show friendship, and Owen was a true friend.  \n  - The entire team felt real and nuanced, so I missed them when I put the book down.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The pacing was perfect, and the character development and relationships were extremely well done.  \n  - The murderer’s “why” and the twists and turns of the mystery were terrific.  \n  - Having an unknown POV trapped in the clutches of the killer interspersed with Ty's story heightened the drama and added to the creep factor.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  - This is a book that engaged the senses—I was totally engrossed. I started the book on a road trip with my daughter, and she insisted that I not finish it until she was available.  \n  - Honestly, this book was so good that I went back and read books 1 and 2 right away. I finished the trilogy in a week!  \n\n- **Narration and Series Context:**  \n  - I didn’t realize this was book three of a series, but they are sort of standalones that feature the same team, so I think I’ll be alright going back to book one.  \n  - I highly recommend this book, this trilogy, this narrator (Teri Schnaubelt), and this author. She’s a standout!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a five-star read for me. It masterfully blended thriller elements with a seamless faith message, creating a story that was both gripping and emotionally resonant. The characters, especially Ty and Owen, were well-developed and relatable, and the plot kept me hooked from start to finish.
