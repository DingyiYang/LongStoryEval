            "The story centers on three women—Lily, Cecilia, and Kristen—whose lives intersect during a summer, narrated from their alternating perspectives. This format offers valuable insight into their struggles and personal growth. While the plot explores themes of self-discovery and authenticity, where each woman influences the others, it occasionally falters. Some scenes feel contrived, detracting from the overall engagement. Despite the strong character development, the narrative ultimately missed its mark for me.",
            "In this compelling narrative, Lily finds herself at a crossroads after dropping out of medical school and retreating to Cape Cod to escape her parents' expectations. Simultaneously, Cecilia, a widow, grapples with her own insecurities and isolates herself in her hidden cottage to avoid her looming 70th birthday celebration. Meanwhile, Cecilia's daughter, Kristen, confronts a myriad of personal challenges, including grief, marital strain, and worries about her children. The author masterfully develops these characters, providing rich depth to their journeys.",
            "Initially, the title and premise led me to expect a lighthearted romantic comedy, but the story unfolded as a serious family drama instead. I was surprised to discover that the author has written multiple books, as this one felt less polished than I would anticipate from an experienced writer. Rather than the cute summer romance I anticipated, I encountered a multigenerational family saga with only a hint of romance. The tone was heavier than expected; while it wasn't bad, it lacked engagement. Ultimately, the title misled me, as the story strayed far from the comedic romance I was hoping for."

        "conclusion": "While *The Summer Swap* offers well-developed characters and explores meaningful themes of self-discovery and authenticity, it fell short of my expectations. The heavier tone, mundane pacing, and misleading title made it less engaging than I had hoped. Despite its flaws, the story has moments of depth and insight, particularly in its portrayal of the three protagonists’ journeys.",

However, the pacing and initial complexity of the characters kept it from being a 4-star read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75⭐️"

            "In keeping with the author's signature style, the book unfolds through the perspectives of three distinct characters: Cecelia, a 75-year-old widow; her daughter Kristen; and Lily, a friend of Kristen's daughter. I appreciate narratives told from multiple viewpoints, and the author excels in this approach. The generational diversity allows for relatable connections. \n\nCecelia, seeking solace from her family, retreats to Dune Cottage, a place steeped in both cherished and painful memories. Meanwhile, Kristen grapples with the aftermath of her father's death, reassessing her marriage amidst their already strained relationship. Lily, a would-be artist, has fled her parents' expectations, abandoned medical school, and taken a job as a cleaner and caretaker at Dune Cottage. \n\nThe interplay between the generations is beautifully portrayed, with each character offering valuable lessons to the others. Cecelia, in particular, serves as a source of support and encouragement for young Lily, inspiring her to pursue her dreams and embrace life on her own terms.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Reputation and Consistency:**  \n  Sarah Morgan is one of those authors whose books I will always read without even finding out what the book is about. I know that I’m going to love her books; she’s a real go-to author for me. *The Summer Swap* was no exception.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Character Perspectives:**  \n  As is Sarah Morgan’s usual style, the book is told from the perspectives of different characters. In this case, they include Cecelia, a 75-year-old widow; Kristen, her daughter; and Lily, a friend of Kristen’s daughter. I really enjoy reading a story told from multiple viewpoints, and Sarah Morgan does this so well. Having different generations means there is someone that every reader is likely to be able to relate to.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Cecelia, a widow, has had enough of her family and retreats to Dune Cottage, a place filled with memories, both good and bad. Kristen, her daughter, is still devastated by the loss of her father and is reassessing her marriage. Their relationship has always been prickly, and the loss of Cameron hasn’t brought them closer. Lily, a would-be artist, has run away from her parents’ expectations, dropped out of medical school, and is working as a cleaner/caretaker at Dune Cottage. I thought it came across very well that each generation had something of value to teach or learn from the others. Cecelia, in particular, was a great support and encouragement to young Lily, urging her to follow her dreams and live life on her own terms.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  *The Summer Swap* is a fantastic read showing it’s never too late for new beginnings. With themes of friendship, family, secrets, second chances, and being true to yourself—along with a healthy dose of romance—this is a perfect book to read this summer.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I raced through this one and found the stories from all the different perspectives equally engaging, even if Kristen didn’t seem too likeable a character at first.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Summer Swap* is a beautifully crafted novel that explores the complexities of family, self-discovery, and new beginnings through the eyes of three generations of women. Sarah Morgan’s signature style of multi-perspective storytelling shines, making it a compelling and relatable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5* (rounded up)."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n  I love a good family drama, especially in the summertime. There’s something about the messiness of these domestic stories that makes them so endearing. *Summer Swap* by Sarah Morgan checks all my boxes for a great summer read.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The story is set in a beachfront cottage, which adds to its charm.

Cecelia Lapthorne, the widow of a famous artist, feels suffocated by the life she has known and needs space to think. Lily feels suffocated by her parents' expectations for her to become a doctor. Kristen feels suffocated by loneliness in her marriage to a renowned surgeon who can’t seem to make time for his family.  \n\n- **Plot and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The generational family drama and the exploration of family bonds that grow stronger with time are central to the story. The emotional struggles of the characters are relatable and well-portrayed, making the narrative engaging and heartfelt.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  *Summer Swap* was a breath of fresh air. It’s a perfect summer read that combines a beautiful setting, compelling characters, and a touching story about family and self-discovery.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Summer Swap* by Sarah Morgan is a delightful summer read that masterfully blends family drama, emotional depth, and a picturesque setting.

One can understand why, given the amount of pressure and anxiety Lily's apparently clueless parents put on her to become a physician.  \n- **Character Development:** The characters are well done but play predictable roles.  \n- **Plot Execution:** The whole plot doesn't work for me. I'm quitting now.  \n- **Setting and Purpose:** Lily is close to a breakdown when she comes to Cape Cod and this cottage to heal. This isn't a romance so much as three women of different ages coming to the (magic) Dune Cottage for healing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story touches on relevant themes like pressure and healing, and the characters are well-developed, the predictable roles they play and the overall plot execution didn't resonate with me.

I particularly enjoyed the insight provided by Kristen (Cecelia's daughter), as it added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Timeline:**  \n  The book moved very quickly, making it difficult to follow the timeline. It felt like the entire story unfolded within two weeks, possibly a month, which made everything feel rushed.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Conflict Resolution:**  \n  When secrets were revealed, they were accepted too easily, with no messy or complicated emotions from the characters. This made the story feel a bit too fluffy for my taste, especially compared to other books I’ve read recently that dealt with messier, more complex feelings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the additional perspective from Kristen, the rapid pacing and lack of emotional complexity made the story feel rushed and overly simplistic.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Consistency and Predictability:**  \n  Every Sarah Morgan novel released in the last few years follows the same formula, which makes it reliable and comforting. While this predictability can feel a bit boring, it also ensures I know what to expect.  \n\n- **Character and Story Development:**  \n  I find that Sarah Morgan tends to include too many storylines in her novels, which often results in underdeveloped characters and plots. This lack of depth makes the stories feel somewhat superficial.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Replay Value:**  \n  While I mostly enjoy her books in a mild, unremarkable way, I don’t find them compelling enough to reread. As a result, I’ve started borrowing them from the library instead of purchasing them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSarah Morgan’s novels are like comfort food—reliable and predictable, but lacking in depth and replay value. While I find them enjoyable in a bland way, the underdeveloped characters and multiple storylines prevent them from being truly memorable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While her plots can be predictable, they always include unexpected twists and deeper themes. This particular story explores self-discovery across three generations of women, with the main character, Lily, being a friend of the daughter rather than a family member. I enjoyed accompanying them on their journeys of personal and familial revelations. Although the clues to the twist were present all along, I only caught on just before the reveal—I've been a bit slow lately!",

This one was a story of discovery through three generations of females (although the main character, Lily, isn't part of the others' family but a friend of the daughter). It involved discoveries about themselves and their families. I enjoyed going through their journeys with them.  \n\n- **Twist and Foreshadowing:**  \n  Though the clues to the twist were there looking back, I didn't realize it until right before (I'm a bit slow lately!).  \n\n- **Setting and Descriptive Writing:**  \n  As always, Sarah's descriptive writing of the settings is on point, and I could easily picture them all. Dune Cottage sounds like the place of my dreams!  \n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  I had mixed feelings about the characters: Lily was relatable, I was a fan of Cecelia and her spontaneity, but I couldn't warm to Kristen.

This made it harder to connect with them on a deeper level.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel is a sweet and light read, it falls short in terms of depth, character development, and plot complexity. It’s a good choice for someone seeking a simple, predictable story, but it may not satisfy readers looking for more substance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
