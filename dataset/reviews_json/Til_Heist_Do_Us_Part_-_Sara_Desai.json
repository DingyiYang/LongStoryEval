            "Jack and Simi's relationship mirrors the problems seen in the first book, with Simi raising valid concerns that are frequently dismissed through sweet talk or physical intimacy. Jack's unresolved trauma obstructs his capacity for healthy relationships, and he remains uninterested in confronting these issues, even in pivotal moments. This dynamic makes it difficult to engage with their romance, resulting in a frustrating reading experience.",
            "In this story, Rose is notably absent, and Cristian's limited presence paints him as less charming and more of a jerk compared to his character in the first book. Anil faces suspicion of being a traitor, which strains relationships within the crew; however, he is ultimately revealed to be playing a long con. Jack is more integrated with the crew this time, but his romance with Simi remains unresolved.",
            "The sequel comes across as harsher than the first installment, which was a lighthearted and enjoyable adventure. The crew now feels fractured rather than a cheerful band of misfits. Some phrasing, like describing Anil as looking more twenty-one than twenty-six, seems unnecessary and confusing. Additionally, Jack's second-person POV chapters at the beginning and end of the book do not enhance the narrative and feel out of place."

The heist and capers in this book were fun but felt rushed, and I wasn’t as invested as I was in the first book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - Despite some reservations, the book was very interesting, and I struggled to put it down once I got into it.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Cohesion:**  \n   - Some characters didn’t make much sense, and I wished for more group cohesion. The crew in the first book felt more united, whereas this one lacked that tight-knit dynamic.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n   - I saw the plot twist coming because one character seemed to have no purpose unless there was a twist. While the twist wasn’t as cleanly built up as I’d hoped, I was glad it happened and saved the character from being a pointless addition.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n   - I initially wasn’t looking forward to the relationship drama, but by the end, I found myself rooting for the couple.

Chloe and Gage are simply adorable, while Emma’s side story with Axle adds a lovely touch. Anil’s character arc was satisfying—I knew it would be!

The unique storyline, diverse and quirky characters, and charming subplots made it a memorable read. While the pacing felt a bit uneven and there were a few plot holes, these didn’t overshadow my love for the story. I would definitely recommend this book!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Jack, a professional thief, and Simi, an event planner, as they join forces with a motley crew to recover stolen diamond and necklace. Their journey brings them face-to-face with the mafia, the wealthy elite, biker gangs, and treacherous characters. Unfortunately, the narrative often relies on telling rather than showing, leaving the action sequences underwhelming. Key moments are summarized (e.g., \"we were surrounded\") instead of immersing the reader in the excitement.",
            "The characters, especially Jack and Simi, are well-developed, and their chemistry is captivating. Despite their rocky start, Jack, as the love interest, and Simi ultimately find their happily-ever-after. Simi’s role as an event planner injects humor into the narrative, particularly with her over-the-top celebrations of life. However, the occasional chapters from Jack’s perspective, written in the second person, disrupt the flow and feel jarring.",
            "The book excels in humor and character interactions, but its narrative style often feels more like a recap of events and plans rather than immersing the reader in the action. Additionally, the choice to use second-person narration for Jack's perspective was unconventional and detracted from the overall experience.",
            "As a fan of paranormal and historical romance that skillfully blends action with romance, I found this book lacking. The absence of detailed action sequences and a tendency to summarize rather than describe diminished its engagement compared to other works in the genre."

        "conclusion": "While the book has its strengths, particularly in humor and character dynamics, it didn’t fully land for me due to its reliance on telling rather than showing, the unusual second-person POV choice, and the lack of immersive action sequences. Fans of the first installment may enjoy this entry more, but it didn’t meet my expectations. I’ll still read the author’s future works, as I’ve enjoyed her writing in the past.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Standalone Readability:**  \n   - I did not read the first book, but this one did a solid job of filling me in on what happened in it. I didn’t feel like I needed to read the first book to understand this one.  \n\n- **Character Perspectives (POV):**  \n   - I was disappointed that the entire book is basically in Simi’s POV. The book opened with Jack’s POV, which made me expect more chapters from him, but that never happened. I spent the whole book waiting for another chapter from Jack and felt bamboozled by the opening.  \n\n- **Character Likability and Dynamics:**  \n   - I did not like Simi. She’s better than me because I would have let Cristian die with the mob after he walked out. Anil would also be dead to me—double agent or not, leaving me to die in a shipping container is not the move.  \n   - Simone was by far my favorite character. I just knew there was something up with her; too many coincidences kept happening around her.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n   - This was a silly, goofy book, and I enjoyed it greatly. Romantic comedies are my favorite genre, and I love a good heist. The book was tense, funny, and sweet in all the right places.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n   - I’m not opposed to reading the next book in the series, despite my dislike for Simi. Sometimes you don’t vibe with some characters, and Simi is that for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this book to be an enjoyable read, blending humor, romance, and heist elements effectively. While I didn’t connect with Simi and was disappointed by the lack of Jack’s POV, the other characters and the story’s tone kept me engaged. I’d consider reading the next book in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This made it confusing to keep track of who was who, especially since I was listening to the audiobook.  \n   - Simi, the protagonist, came across as extremely childish. Her behavior, such as giving Jack the silent treatment and communicating through others, felt immature for a 30-year-old character.  \n\n- **Plot and Action**  \n   - The action scenes lacked excitement and failed to create a sense of thrill or suspense.

This sequel, however, felt too similar and didn’t live up to the expectations set by the first installment.  \n   - The story lost my interest in several places, and I felt the series could have ended with the first book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I was excited to continue the series after enjoying the first book, this sequel fell short in several areas.

Simi and her unlikely gang are removing a necklace to trade it for some other jewel in a negotiation with a crime lord, which felt hard to follow. The story takes them on a road trip to New York City, with a detour into the Pennsylvania forest, and then back to Chicago. I’m not entirely sure what happened in this book.  \n\n- **Engagement:**  \n  I kept putting the book down and didn’t feel very excited to pick it back up again. While it was fun at times, the lack of clarity and momentum made it hard to stay invested.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  I didn’t like this book as much as the first one in the series. It didn’t capture my interest in the same way, and I’m not sure I’ll continue with this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments of fun, the confusing plot and lack of engagement made it a less enjoyable read compared to the first installment. I’m left uncertain about whether I’ll continue following this author’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
