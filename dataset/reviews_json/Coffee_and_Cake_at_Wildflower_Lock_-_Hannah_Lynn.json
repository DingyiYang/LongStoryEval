            "The romance in this story was disappointing. While there was initial romantic tension, it quickly became overshadowed by the love triangle, which is one of my least favorite tropes. Daisy's decisions were incredibly frustrating, and the romance lacked the cozy vibes I appreciated in the first book. Stressful events involving the boat and coffee shop further detracted from my enjoyment. The final chapter introduced yet another trope I dislike and added a wave of new problems, ultimately leaving me unsatisfied.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Context and Backstory:**  \n   - I didn’t realize this was the second book in a series when I started reading, but the author provided enough backstory quickly, so it wasn’t an issue.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story revolves around Daisy, who inherits a narrow boat called the September Rose from her father. She renovates it with her neighbor Theo and decides to live on it permanently, turning part of it into a takeaway coffee shop.  \n   - The location, Wildflower Lock, sounds beautiful and idyllic—somewhere you’d want to visit on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Daisy is determined and resourceful, investing all her savings into the boat and coffee shop. However, I found her character a bit two-dimensional at times.  \n   - Theo and Christian are well-contrasted characters. Theo helps Daisy with the boat, while Christian, a marketing guru, steps in to help her raise funds by selling her artwork.  \n   - Daisy’s friends add humor and support to the storyline, making it more engaging.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n   - Daisy’s first day of trade is a success, but a tidal wave of bad luck hits, leaving her in need of money for repairs and a trading license.  \n   - Christian’s idea of an art auction helps Daisy raise funds, but she also starts developing feelings for both him and Theo, creating a romantic dilemma.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The story is lighthearted and enjoyable, with a mix of humor, romance, and a touch of drama.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a charming and engaging story with a beautiful setting and a mix of relatable challenges and lighthearted moments. While Daisy’s character could have been more developed, the contrasts between Theo and Christian, along with the humor brought by her friends, make the book an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This sequel picks up where the first book left off, with Daisy confronting unforeseen challenges in managing her narrowboat coffee shop. Despite her diligent preparations, things don’t unfold as she envisioned. Following Theo's suggestion and others, Daisy decides to sell her paintings to support her business. This decision introduces an intriguing twist when a dog walker purchases one of her artworks and sends his charismatic son, Christian, to collect it. Christian, adept in business and marketing, emerges as a valuable ally—and potentially more—for Daisy. The tension between her budding feelings for Christian and her connection with Theo deepens the narrative. Additionally, the mystery surrounding Daisy’s mother adds an engaging layer of intrigue.",
            "Christian serves as a strong foil to Theo, creating a compelling dynamic. Although Daisy's confusion between the two men can be frustrating, it ultimately adds to the story's charm. The relationships are sweet and engaging, making it easy to root for the characters.",

Daisy's story and her relationship with Theo captivated me, and I was excited to see how their journey unfolded.

This book delivered the uplifting vibes I craved during a stressful time."

This leads to an interesting development when a dog walker buys one of her paintings and sends her charming son, Christian, to pick it up. Christian, who is skilled in business and marketing, becomes a potential asset—and perhaps more—for Daisy.  \n   - The tension between Daisy’s growing feelings for Christian and her connection with Theo adds depth to the story.
