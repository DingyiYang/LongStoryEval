Killian, on the other hand, embodies the tall, brooding, and dangerous archetype of a mafia boss that readers often find appealing. Their chemistry is undeniable, but the romance between Chiara and Killian feels rushed. In just 50 pages, they transition from captor and captive to deeply in love, lacking the necessary buildup and tension. While both characters have potential, they occasionally come across as flat.",

The story includes forced proximity, with the hero falling first and harder, and presents a morally ambiguous character in a dark romance setting that involves kidnapping and a captor-captive dynamic.

            "The plot suffers from inconsistencies and a lack of believability. Chiara's abrupt transition from pleading with Killian for intimacy to claiming she was fighting her feelings feels unrealistic. The pacing is uneven, with significant events—such as Chiara's captivity and her subsequent demands—resolved too quickly, leaving the story feeling rushed and disjointed. The ending is particularly unsatisfying; Chiara's rape is glossed over, and Killian's reaction is underwhelming. Additionally, the resolution of the conflict with Killian's cousin lacks emotional depth and feels hurried. Several plot points defy logic, such as Killian's decision to return Chiara to the apartment where she was initially taken, despite his insistence on wanting her safe. Furthermore, the inaction of Killian's security team, even in the face of clear danger (like a bullet hole in the SUV and blood on the ground), is both unrealistic and frustrating.",
            "Chiara's actions and reactions were often inconsistent and frustrating. Despite watching true crime shows and recognizing Killian's danger, she was shocked to discover his \"room of horror.\" Killian's character was equally contradictory; he spent much of the book insisting that Chiara needed to fear him to love him, only to abruptly decide she should leave for her own safety. Additionally, the side characters, such as Krista and Monica, were poorly developed, with their actions frequently lacking logic—such as Krista's acceptance of Killian keeping a victim captive.",
            "The novel was poorly written, much like another book by the same author that I’ve read. While the writing showed slight improvement in the middle, it only lasted for a few chapters.",
            "The novel's treatment of sensitive issues such as sex trafficking and captivity is problematic. Chiara's ability to feel “grateful” for Killian’s “kindness” while being held as his “property” is both disturbing and poorly justified. The moral ambiguity of the characters, especially Killian, is insufficiently explored. His anger over his cousin's betrayal eclipses the harm inflicted on Chiara, which feels tone-deaf."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this novel was a disappointing read. The poor writing, inconsistent character behavior, and illogical plot points made it difficult to engage with the story. While there were brief moments of improvement in the middle, they were not enough to salvage the book. The handling of sensitive themes was problematic, and the ending left much to be desired.",

            "This standalone dark Mafia romance centers on Chiara, who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. Her fate changes when she locks eyes with Killian, the feared head of a Mafia family, who decides to keep her. The plot effectively intertwines dark themes, abuse, and trauma, so readers should be mindful of trigger warnings. While the romance unfolds rapidly, leading to intense feelings between the characters, this \"insta-love\" may not resonate with everyone. However, it complements the story's fast-paced narrative.",
            "Killian, the formidable Mafia boss, presents a tough exterior but shows a softer, more vulnerable side to those he loves, especially Chiara. In contrast, Chiara is headstrong and inquisitive, challenging Killian's expectations of her as a submissive partner. This dynamic creates a captivating tension between the two characters.",
            "The story skillfully weaves in popular tropes like \"Touch her and *unalive*,\" forced proximity, and a possessive male main character (MMC). These elements are executed well, enhancing both the depth and tension of the narrative.",

            "The story contained some implausible elements that prevented it from being a 5-star read for me. For example, after Chiara was kidnapped and sold at a sex auction, she quickly transitioned from terror to willingly performing for Killian that same night, which felt unrealistic given her trauma. Additionally, Killian installed cameras in her room but failed to use them to check on her well-being during her first two nights at his home. Had he reviewed the footage, he could have discovered what happened to her sooner, resolving the plot more efficiently. The ending also felt rushed, as Chiara seemed to move on too quickly from the trauma of her assault, which undermined the severity of her experiences.",

However, I felt that a slower build-up to the romantic tension could have made the emotional and physical connection even more impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSheridan Anne continues to deliver with this release, offering a fast-paced, engaging story with strong characters and plenty of spice. While I thoroughly enjoyed it, I believe a slower burn would have elevated the experience even further.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book felt predictable, and the use of the insta-love trope was disappointing. I struggle to understand why authors persist with this cliché, as I have yet to meet anyone who enjoys it. There are far more effective ways to develop character connections over time.",
            "The characters in the story lacked depth and chemistry. While I found them likable individually, their connection felt limited to mere sexual attraction. Chaira was a refreshing departure from the typical timid virgin trope often seen in mafia novels, yet her personality was largely defined by her sexual desire. Killian exhibited slightly more complexity, but his actions often contradicted his role as a formidable mafia boss. For instance, he delayed checking surveillance footage until it was absolutely necessary and left Chaira to return to her old life with only money, despite being aware of the threats against her.",
            "I appreciate the author's writing style and have a fondness for mafia romance. However, the character descriptions felt sparse. We learn that Killian is tall, sculpted, and has dark eyes, while Chaira is blonde with green eyes. A bit more detail would have greatly enhanced the characters’ portrayals.",

I’ll give the author another chance, but I might take a break from her works for a while.",

This is the second book I've read of hers, and both have had the same sort of trauma.\n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**\n   - The book was predictable.\n   - The insta-love trope was disappointing. I don’t understand why authors continue to write insta-love when I have not met a single person who enjoys it. There are better ways to build a connection between characters over time.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters lacked depth and chemistry. I liked the characters fine on their own, but together, there was no real connection beyond sexual attraction.\n   - Chaira was refreshingly sexual compared to the typical timid virgin trope in mafia books, but she had no real personality beyond her sexual desire.\n   - Killian had a little more depth, but his actions didn’t always make sense for a supposed big bad mafia boss. For example, he didn’t check surveillance footage until he absolutely had to, and he left Chaira to return to her old life with just money, despite knowing there were threats against her.\n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Dynamics:**\n   - The chemistry between the characters was lacking, and the relationship felt superficial.\n   - Over 70% of the book was smut, which got repetitive and boring. While I enjoy smut scenes, sometimes less is more.\n   - The frequent use of explicit language (e.g., \"c*nt\" and \"wh*re\") lost its shock value and sexiness over time.\n\n- **Descriptions and World-Building:**\n   - The physical descriptions of the characters were minimal. All we know is that Killian is tall, sculpted, and has dark eyes, while Chaira is blonde with green eyes. A little more description would have gone a long way.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**\n   - This book wasn’t as good as the author’s previous work, *Midnight Stage*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this book had its moments, but it fell short in several areas, including character development, chemistry, and plot predictability.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n   - The introduction and trigger warnings (TW) promised a lot, but the story fell far short of my expectations, delivering less than 5% of what I anticipated.  \n   - While the events mentioned in the TW do occur, they don’t unfold in the way one might imagine.  \n\n- **Plot and Coherence:**  \n   - The story had potential to be excellent but was ruined by numerous inconsistencies and nonsensical elements.  \n   - For example, the protagonist is a Romanian mafia leader with an Irish first name and an Italian last name, which is just one of many illogical details.  \n   - There are countless other inconsistencies throughout the story that detract from its credibility.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The protagonist initially seemed strong and well-defined, but her character deteriorated as soon as she interacted with the male lead, making one poor decision after another.  \n   - The male lead, portrayed as the \"worst of the worst\" and a dangerous mafia boss, lacked credibility. Many events occurred in his own home without his knowledge, undermining his character.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics:**  \n   - The author failed to handle complex themes and the protagonist’s traumas effectively, addressing them in a superficial and poorly executed manner.  \n   - For instance, the protagonist is shown with severe, life-threatening injuries in one chapter, only to be walking around as if nothing happened in the next.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n   - This book might appeal to readers new to the mafia romance genre, especially those with a tolerance for controversial scenes.  \n   - It’s worth noting that the male lead doesn’t cross any irreparable lines; the worst events happen to the protagonist at the hands of others, which might make it more palatable for some readers.  \n\n- **Author’s Experience:**  \n   - I tried to be lenient, thinking this might be the author’s first book, but discovering she has been writing since 2017 and has published over 80 books made the inconsistencies even more disappointing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I was deeply disappointed with this novel. Despite a promising start and a strong initial impression of the protagonist, the story was riddled with inconsistencies, poor character development, and a lack of depth in handling sensitive topics. While it might suit readers new to mafia romance, it fell far short of my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75/5 stars."

Chiara is a dynamic character who refuses to back down, and I enjoyed watching her transform into the queen she is meant to be.

From the moment he declares her his, people at the auction offer her pity and wish her good luck, suggesting that he's a bad man and that she should be worried.

He is a mob boss who does despicable things, but only to those who deserve it, and Chiara isn't one of those.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved seeing Killian's possessive and almost sweet (but don't let him hear you call him that) side come out when Chiara was around. She surprised him, and he soon found himself growing more attached to her by the minute, eventually claiming her as his wife, much to his fellow mafioso's chagrin.

The male lead, Killian, is intriguing but often frustrating; his insistence that he isn't a good man or her hero contradicts his kind actions towards her. Additionally, his refusal to give Chiara a new name, only to end up using her first name anyway, feels unnecessary and adds little to the narrative. \n\nWhile the instalove between Chiara and Killian is acceptable, their relationship lacks depth, and more development could have enhanced their connection. Chiara’s rapid comfort in Killian's home seems unrealistic, given the circumstances.

The fast-paced narrative keeps you hooked from the start.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Chiara, the female main character (fmc), undergoes significant growth throughout the story. Her transformation into a stronger, resilient woman is compelling, though it comes at a great cost. Killian, the morally grey and possessive male main character (mmc), is equally captivating. His willingness to do anything for Chiara adds depth to his character.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The attraction and connection between Chiara and Killian are instant, with palpable tension and plenty of spice. Their relationship is intense, fueled by forced proximity and Killian’s “touch her and die” mentality.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book explores dark and heavy themes, including human trafficking and trauma. It’s gritty, raw, and unapologetically intense, which may not be for everyone. Sheridan Anne handles these topics with skill, creating a story that’s both gripping and emotionally charged.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Sheridan Anne’s writing is sharp and engaging, perfectly suited to the dark, fast-paced narrative. The author’s ability to balance intense themes with compelling character dynamics is a standout feature.  \n\n- **Ending and Satisfaction:**  \n  While the story wraps up well, I would have loved an extended epilogue to delve deeper into Chiara and Killian’s life together.

While some parts were difficult to read due to their graphic nature, the relationship between Killian and Chiara evolved beautifully from a forced arrangement to something deeply meaningful.

Despite his vast resources, he neglects basic security measures, such as bulletproof windows. Additionally, his high-tech security system is not monitored around the clock, which seems unrealistic for someone in his position. The fact that a sniper can bypass his security further stretches credibility.",

His embrace of a clichéd romance trope is particularly disappointing for such a powerful figure. In a puzzling choice, he lets the female lead go, insisting she's safer without him, despite having already put her in danger. When something bad happens to her, his shock feels both frustrating and unrealistic.",

Specifically, I wanted Killian to be a little rougher and Chiara to pretend more that she didn’t want it. I enjoy a bit of roughness in these moments, and I felt the story could have leaned into that more.  \n\n- **Storyline:**  \n  The storyline was fantastic! It kept me engaged and invested throughout the book. The plot was well-crafted and held my interest from start to finish.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was excellent. The author has a great way with words, and the narrative flowed smoothly. I appreciated the quality of the writing and how it enhanced the overall experience.  \n\n- **Interest in Author’s Other Works:**  \n  I’m very interested in exploring more of the author’s books. I’m excited to start *Haunted Love* next and see what else she has to offer.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an amazing book with a great storyline and excellent writing. While I wished for more intensity in the romantic scenes, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and am eager to read more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n  The storyline was pretty predictable, which is typical for a dark Mafia romance. While it didn’t offer many surprises, it served as a nice palate cleanser after reading more emotionally intense books.  \n\n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  I found myself frustrated with the female main character (FMC). Despite the male lead explicitly stating he was a dangerous person, she seemed overly naive and infatuated, ignoring clear red flags. For example, he literally bought her at an auction, yet she acted as if everything was fine.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Overall Impression:**  \n  Overall, I liked the book. It was a solid read, consistent with the author’s usual style and quality. While it didn’t blow me away, it was entertaining and met my expectations for a dark Mafia romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book delivered what I expected from a dark Mafia romance—predictable but enjoyable. While the FMC’s behavior was frustrating at times, it was still a solid and entertaining read, especially as a lighter follow-up to more emotional stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "I enjoyed the insta-love storyline, and Killian, the male lead, is both attractive and morally upright, making him intriguing. He embodies the concept of a \"mafia good guy,\" adding depth to his character. Chiara, the female lead, is strong and well-developed, consistent with the author's knack for creating relatable and engaging female protagonists.",
            "This book strikes a charming balance between cute and dark, appealing to my taste despite my usual preference for heavier themes. While it leans toward the lighter side, it still incorporates elements I enjoy, such as the \"touch her and die\" trope. Compared to the author's other works, this one feels quicker and more accessible, yet I found it thoroughly enjoyable. The pacing and tone contribute to an engaging reading experience."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Tone and Genre:**  \n  The book is described as \"cute and fluffy with a mix of dark,\" which appeals to me despite my preference for darker themes. It leans toward the lighter side but still has elements I enjoy, like the \"touch her and die\" trope.  \n\n- **Romance and Characters:**  \n  The \"insta love\" storyline works well for me, and Killian, the male lead, is portrayed as both attractive and morally righteous, which I find intriguing. He embodies the idea of a \"mafia good guy,\" which adds depth to his character. Chiara, the female lead, is a strong and well-written character, consistent with Sheridan's usual style of creating FMCs (female main characters) who are relatable and never frustrating.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  This book feels like a quicker and lighter read compared to Sheridan's other works, but I still found it enjoyable. The pacing and tone make it an easy and engaging read.  \n\n- **Author's Consistency:**  \n  Sheridan's books consistently feature strong, well-developed FMCs who don’t make questionable decisions, which is something I always appreciate. This book maintains that standard, even if it’s lighter in tone.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a delightful read with a mix of light and dark elements, strong characters, and a satisfying romance. While it’s quicker and lighter than Sheridan’s usual style, it still delivers the engaging storytelling and character depth I’ve come to expect from her work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  - The book contains graphic scenes of digital assault on the female main character (MFC) by someone other than the male main character (MMC) after her rescue.  \n  - There is a gang rape of the MFC by sex traffickers at around 85% of the book.  \n  - The MFC is also forced into performing fellatio on another antagonist.  \n  - I typically check reviews for such content warnings but missed them this time. I believe including these warnings would help readers make informed decisions about whether to read the book.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  - The book could have been just as effective with \"close calls\" or implied danger rather than explicit depictions of assault.  \n  - Despite the heavy content, the story itself is engaging and well-written.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  - I did not notice any glaring grammatical errors, which indicates strong editing and writing quality.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book is well-written and engaging, the inclusion of graphic and triggering content without adequate warnings detracted from my overall enjoyment.
