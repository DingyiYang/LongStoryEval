            "This novel masterfully blends police procedural and historical mystery elements, resulting in an atmospheric and well-paced narrative. Told from the engaging perspectives of Jo and DCI MacAdams, the story skillfully navigates a large cast of characters and multiple subplots without becoming convoluted. All narrative threads converge seamlessly at the end, delivering a satisfying resolution.",
            "Jo is a distinctive protagonist whose neurodiversity and challenges are portrayed with impressive depth. Her journey of adapting to a new life, facing adversity, and embracing new friendships is both compelling and relatable. DCI MacAdams and DCI Fleet are well-developed characters whose contrasting personalities create an engaging dynamic within the investigation. Supporting characters, like Tula the innkeeper, are thoughtfully crafted, enriching the narrative. Even the less likable characters are well-rounded, adding further complexity to the story.",

Jo's parallel quest for the missing portrait adds an extra layer of mystery and historical intrigue. While the novel's title may be somewhat misleading, this is a minor point that doesn't diminish the overall enjoyment of the story."

            "The plot is hampered by an excess of random storylines and unresolved plot points that fail to connect coherently. The book feels like two separate narratives awkwardly merged: one centers on an intriguing mystery involving a painting and a long-lost relative, while the other focuses on a murder investigation. Unfortunately, neither storyline reaches a satisfying conclusion, and two threads remain unresolved, seemingly to pave the way for a sequel. The leaps in logic are difficult to follow, and the convoluted connections between characters would require a flowchart to decipher.",
            "I found Jo to be a compelling character, and I believe the story would have been stronger if it had focused solely on her journey of establishing herself in a new town and unraveling the mystery of the painting. However, her presence felt inconsistent, particularly during the lengthy police investigation when she was often absent or sidelined. My main concern lies in the portrayal of Sid, the murder victim. He is depicted as a terrible person, making it hard to understand why three women, including his intelligent ex-wife Elsie, would genuinely mourn his loss. Elsie, in particular, had no real reason to remain connected to him after their divorce."

        "conclusion": "While the book has potential, particularly with Jo’s character and the mystery of the painting, it is hindered by poor plot structure, inconsistent character presence, and a lack of cohesion between its dual storylines. The representation of neurodivergence also falls short, making it difficult for readers who struggle with name recognition and complex character webs. The unresolved threads and questionable character motivations further detract from the overall experience.",

She was a compelling character, but her presence was inconsistent, especially during long stretches of the police investigation where she was absent or a non-factor.\n\n- **Neurodivergent Representation:**  \n  It’s disappointing that a book with a neurodivergent lead, written by an autistic author, is not autistic-friendly. Many of us struggle with name recognition, and the plot introduces too many random characters who pop in and out, making it impossible to follow along. Important characters like Tula, who are central in the first half, disappear in the back half.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Cohesion:**  \n  The plot suffers from too many random storylines and dropped plot points that don’t connect or make sense. The book feels like two different stories forced to share pages: one about an intriguing mystery involving a painting and a long-lost relative, and another about a murder investigation. Neither storyline has a compelling conclusion, and two threads are left unresolved, likely to leave room for a follow-up book. The leaps in logic are hard to follow, and the connections between characters are so convoluted that you’d need a flowchart to understand them.\n\n- **Character Motivations (Sid and His Ex-Wives):**  \n  My biggest issue is trying to understand why three women were so enamored with Sid, the murder victim. He’s portrayed as a terrible person, and I can’t believe any of his three ex-wives would genuinely be sad he’s gone. This is especially true for Elsie, who is intelligent and had no real reason to associate with him post-divorce.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has potential, particularly with Jo’s character and the mystery of the painting, it is hindered by poor plot structure, inconsistent character presence, and a lack of cohesion between its dual storylines. The representation of neurodivergence also falls short, making it difficult for readers who struggle with name recognition and complex character webs. The unresolved threads and questionable character motivations further detract from the overall experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel is set in a small town in the north of England, which is portrayed as both a blessing and a curse. The small-town life is vividly depicted, with its close-knit community and local gossip playing a significant role in the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery revolves around the death of the caretaker, who is found dead shortly after being fired by Jo, the protagonist. The plot is engaging, with alternating third-person perspectives between Jo and MacAdams, a local policeman investigating the case. While Jo is more focused on uncovering family mysteries in the inherited manor, MacAdams deals with the murder investigation and the interference of an ex-Scotland Yard investigator.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Jo, an American on the autism spectrum, is a unique and sympathetic protagonist. Her disinterest in solving the murder and her focus on family secrets make her stand out. MacAdams, the policeman, is also a well-developed character, dealing with professional challenges and personal connections to the case. The dynamic between the two main characters adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The novel strikes a balance between embracing and poking fun at an American's perspective of the British police system. It includes moments reminiscent of popular BBC police serials, adding a layer of familiarity and humor. The tone is satisfying, with a mystery that isn’t overly intense but still engaging.  \n\n- **Appeal:**  \n  This book is a great choice for readers who enjoy mysteries without extremely high stakes but that aren’t overly cozy either. It offers a fresh take on the genre with its unique characters and setting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a well-crafted mystery novel with a compelling setting, engaging plot, and sympathetic characters. The alternating perspectives of Jo and MacAdams, along with the small-town dynamics, make for a satisfying read. It’s a great pick for mystery lovers who appreciate a balance of intrigue and character-driven storytelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  - The story revolves around Jo, who inherits an estate and becomes entangled in a murder mystery and a secondary mystery involving the house, a painting, and her ancestors.  \n  - The main murder mystery was engaging, but the secondary mystery about the house and ancestors felt even more unique and compelling.  \n  - The pacing was well-done, keeping me invested throughout.  \n  - However, I guessed the culprit early on, and the plot occasionally became unnecessarily complicated, making it hard to follow at times.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The main character, Jo, is autistic, and I loved how her job, interests, and autism were woven together to create a unique, smart, and interesting protagonist. Her love for books was a delightful touch.  \n  - The male main character (MMC) was a classic police detective, and while I liked him, he didn’t stand out as much as Jo.  \n  - The flawed characters added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Ambiance:**  \n  - The small-town setting and general ambiance were charming and added to the overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The narration was in third-person past tense with a dual perspective, which worked well for the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - This was a very enjoyable read, especially once the mystery picked up. I was so invested that I was sad when the story ended.  \n  - I hope this becomes a series because I’d love to read more about these characters and their future adventures.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Framed Women of Ardmore House* is a captivating British mystery with a unique protagonist, engaging dual mysteries, and a charming small-town setting. While the plot occasionally became overly complicated, the story was hard to put down, and I was left wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nOverall rating: 4⭐  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to Harlequin Trade Publishing, Hanover Square Press, and NetGalley for the eARC!"

            "The story unfolds in third-person perspective, alternating between Jo's exploration of her heritage and Detective Inspector MacAdams' murder investigation. However, the transitions between their viewpoints within the same chapter can feel abrupt and disorienting. MacAdams' role was unexpected, as the synopsis focuses solely on Jo, who appears in about half of the book. The ARC formatting lacked clear breaks for POV shifts, despite having distinct chapter markers. I would have preferred separate chapters for each perspective, and I hope the final version offers clearer transitions.\n\nThe mystery aspect is engaging, featuring a twisty plot that keeps readers guessing. Initially, MacAdams comes across as somewhat incompetent, opting for easy answers, but he ultimately redeems himself by unraveling the complex case. Jo's storyline, which involves her inheritance and a missing painting, intertwines effectively with MacAdams' investigation, adding depth to the narrative. The slower pacing suits the procedural nature of the story, allowing readers to follow the characters and potential red herrings with ease.",
            "The book boasts a compelling cast of characters. Jo is relatable as she grapples with her overwhelming inheritance and the murder on her estate, while quickly forming a friendship with the innkeeper. Meanwhile, MacAdams transforms from an initially unimpressive detective into a more capable investigator as the story unfolds."

            "The story struggles with an uneven tone, oscillating between cozy mystery and police procedural elements. The dual perspectives contribute to this imbalance, leaving the narrative feeling incomplete by the end.

            "I enjoyed Jo and the supporting characters, as Jo is a compelling protagonist. However, the dual POV structure sidelines her, as the other perspective comes from one of the investigators. This shift detracts from Jo's role in the murder investigation, leaving her to focus primarily on researching her family history, which feels disconnected from the central mystery.",

The premise initially suggests a cozy mystery or thriller, but the book tries to blend cozy mystery, thriller, and police procedural elements, which creates some tonal inconsistency.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really liked Jo and the side characters. Jo is a compelling protagonist, but she becomes a side character in her own story due to the dual POV structure. The other perspective belongs to one of the investigators, which detracts from Jo's involvement in the murder investigation. Instead, Jo spends much of her time researching her family history, which feels disconnected from the central mystery.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The story feels uneven as it shifts between cozy mystery and police procedural tones. The dual POVs contribute to this imbalance, and by the end, the story feels incomplete.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  - The story follows Josephine Jones, who moves from Brooklyn to the English countryside after inheriting a crumbling estate in North Yorkshire following a series of personal tragedies.  \n  - The novel combines a curious historical backdrop with a present-day murder mystery, which I found engaging and satisfying as a fan of cozy mysteries.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The protagonist, Josephine, is portrayed as a neurodivergent woman navigating the challenges of being taken seriously, both as a woman and as someone with autism. I appreciated this representation and found it well-executed.  \n  - Some of the background characters felt underdeveloped, but I understand this may be intentional, given the story’s focus on Josephine’s perspective. I’m hopeful that future installments will flesh out these characters further.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  - The novel effectively highlights the struggles of neurodivergent individuals, particularly women, in a way that felt authentic and meaningful.  \n  - The themes of resilience and self-discovery resonated with me, especially in the context of Josephine’s journey.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  - The narrative is written primarily from Josephine’s perspective, which provides a unique lens for understanding the story and its characters. While this approach may make it harder to connect with other characters initially, it adds depth to Josephine’s portrayal.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to fans of cozy mysteries and stories with strong, nuanced protagonists.  \n  - I’m excited about the prospect of a sequel and look forward to seeing how the story and characters evolve.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivers a compelling mix of mystery, historical intrigue, and heartfelt representation of neurodivergence. While some characters could benefit from further development, the story’s focus on Josephine’s perspective is both intentional and impactful. I found it to be a rewarding read and eagerly anticipate the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her neurodivergent traits were portrayed in a way that felt genuine and integral to the story. It was particularly compelling how these traits led investigators to mistakenly suspect her of being the murderer, which added a layer of realism to the plot.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book is a delightful cozy mystery with enough twists and turns to keep me engaged throughout. The balance between suspense and the charming atmosphere of the English countryside made the story both intriguing and comforting.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  The setting of an inherited house in the English countryside added a delightful charm to the story. The atmosphere was so immersive that it almost made me forget there was a murder at the heart of the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a sweet and silly mystery that combines authentic representation, a well-paced plot, and a charming setting.

However, she wasn't treated like a true protagonist. Other characters like Green, Rachel, Gwilym, Roberta, Tula, and Ben were well-developed and enjoyable. DCI MacAdams, while likeable, needed a character arc and came off as an incompetent detective, making mistakes that led to frustration.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - The pacing was problematic, with obvious withholding of breakthroughs for the sake of suspense. This led to frustration, especially with the delayed tracking down of Elsie and the lack of an interview with Ricky.\n\n- **Editing and Proofreading:**\n   - The galley received was a mess, with numerous typos, inconsistent name spellings, timeline errors, and a mix of American and UK terms. This made the reading experience less enjoyable, and it is hoped that the published version is much better.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I liked this book for its intriguing plot involving the Ardemores and its great characters.

Her journey of self-discovery—learning to trust her instincts and appreciate herself—is compelling.

I would get invested in one storyline only to be pulled into the other, which disrupted the flow.  \n   - The mystery aspect was predictable; I figured out the antagonist early on, which made the reveal less satisfying. Additionally, the motive for the murder felt convoluted, and the resolution of the painting storyline was underwhelming.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book as a light summer read and appreciated the introduction to Jo, a character I would like to revisit in a potential sequel. However, the plotlines and pacing left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Schillace has fostered a unique community and actively promotes other authors and topics that often lack a platform.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The novel, *The Framed Women of Ardemore House*, follows an American woman, recently divorced, who inherits a crumbling mansion in a rural community. She navigates her new life and becomes entangled in a murder investigation. The protagonist, Jo, is autistic, which adds a unique layer to the story.\n\n- **Representation of Autism:**\n   - What stood out most to me was how Jo’s autism was portrayed. It’s rare to see neurodivergent or autistic experiences in popular fiction, and when they are, they often rely on stereotypes or a narrow portrayal. Schillace handled Jo’s interactions with law enforcement and her perception of those interactions with nuance. The book explores how autistic traits can be misunderstood and how masking plays a role in Jo’s life. Jo’s autism was naturally integrated into the story, making it an authentic and meaningful part of her character.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**\n   - Schillace’s wit and humor shine throughout the novel. The pacing is quick, and once I started reading, I found it hard to put the book down. The mystery was engaging, and I often told myself, “just one more chapter,” which inevitably turned into several more.\n\n- **Character Development and Immersion:**\n   - It took some time to get used to the cast of characters, but once I became familiar with the community, I was fully immersed in the story.

            "The mysteries were overly simplistic, and I solved them halfway through the book. The story demanded too many leaps of faith, and the plot was filled with implausible elements.",
            "Jo and Gwilym were the standout characters, particularly Jo, whose arc was engaging. However, McAdams, the country cop, came across as a poorly executed version of Inspector Frost or an incompetent Columbo, which detracted from the story. I appreciated the representation of a neurodivergent main character, and the narrative would have been stronger if it had centered more on Jo’s journey. Additionally, the subplot involving a secretly gay couple felt outdated and unnecessary, failing to add any real depth to the story.",
            "The story suffers from a significant lack of research, particularly concerning historical building regulations and renovation permits in England. The notion that the house could be repaired without proper planning permissions is unrealistic. Additionally, Jo's decision to bring Mace to England is implausible, given its illegality in many U.S. states and the stringent post-9/11 security measures. The logistics of Jo moving her furniture and belongings from the U.S. to England are never addressed, nor is her ability to afford such expenses. The immediate availability of roofers and the absence of necessary permits for roof repairs further detract from the story's credibility. Moreover, the act of turning on electricity in a water-damaged house without addressing black mold or fire hazards is a glaring oversight.",

The idea that the house could be repaired without proper planning permissions was unrealistic.\n   - Jo bringing Mace into England was implausible, given its illegality in many U.S. states and the strict post-9/11 security measures.\n   - The logistics of Jo moving furniture and belongings from the U.S. to England were never addressed, nor was her ability to afford such expenses.\n   - The immediate availability of roofers and the lack of proper permits for roof repairs were unrealistic.\n   - Turning on electricity in a water-damaged house without addressing black mold or fire hazards was another glaring oversight.\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**\n   - I appreciated the inclusion of a neurodivergent main character, and the story would have been more compelling if it had focused more on Jo’s journey.\n   - The inclusion of a secretly gay couple felt outdated and unnecessary, as it didn’t add depth to the story.\n\n- **Publishing and Editorial Choices:**\n   - The fact that this book is listed as an Editor’s Pick and one of the Best Books of 2024 so far is disappointing and raises questions about the standards for good reads.\n   - Discovering that it’s a Harlequin press publication explains some of the subpar elements, though I’m relieved it didn’t include the typical Harlequin trope of including a rape storyline.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe book had potential, particularly with Jo’s character and the neurodivergent representation, but it was ultimately let down by a disjointed plot, lack of research, and unrealistic elements. The story felt like a poorly stitched-together Frankenstein monster, and the easy-to-solve mysteries didn’t help. While there were some bright spots, the overall execution fell short, especially given its status as an Editor’s Pick.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The resolution of the central mystery feels incomplete, leaving several questions unanswered and suggesting a potential continuation. While the title implies that Jo will be framed for the murder, this expectation is not fully realized; instead, characters perceive her in various negative ways, such as a rude American or an unemotional individual. The plot delves into challenging family dynamics, including exploitation, infidelity, and medical neglect, which are both compelling and unsettling.",
            "The protagonist, Jo, is a well-crafted character—smart, likable, engaging, and multifaceted. However, I occasionally found it difficult to remember some supporting characters, indicating a need for deeper character development. Jo’s internalized criticism of her neurodiversity, influenced by her mother, adds a poignant yet potentially distressing layer to her internal monologue. The portrayal of Jo’s autism is authentic, as the author’s own experiences lend depth and credibility to the character. Additionally, the exploration of how women are framed socially, emotionally, and narratively is both thought-provoking and skillfully executed.",
            "Jo's internal monologue offers a glimpse into her intense emotions, yet by the end, I still feel disconnected from her experience, which is unsatisfying. While the portrayal of her autism and her mother's criticism is authentic, the absence of visible emotion leaves me yearning for a deeper emotional connection.",
            "The unresolved mystery of Evelyn's death and the fate of her infant—whether unborn, stillborn, or otherwise—was disappointing. This lack of closure indicates that a sequel is necessary to explore these unanswered questions."

        "conclusion": "While the novel is intriguingly framed and features a well-crafted autistic protagonist, it falls short in providing a complete resolution to its central mysteries. The exploration of difficult family dynamics and the authentic portrayal of neurodiversity are strengths, but the lack of emotional engagement and unresolved plot threads leave me wanting more. The potential for a sequel offers hope for further development and closure.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Cultural Authenticity and Accuracy:**  \n   - I found the portrayal of UK settings and characters by an American writer to be uneven and often inaccurate. For example, an Irish character being in the Peace Corps or someone attending high school with the victim felt unrealistic and out of place.  \n   - The observation that Jo, a curious and neurodivergent character, thought Swansea wasn’t so different from York struck me as odd and inconsistent with her personality.  \n\n- **Editing and Fact-Checking:**  \n   - There were noticeable editing errors, such as \"queued\" instead of \"cued\" and \"rouse\" instead of \"ruse,\" which were jarring and should have been caught by a decent fact-checker or editor.  \n   - Given the author’s background, these mistakes felt less excusable.  \n\n- **Character Focus and Development:**  \n   - The story seemed less about Jo, the neurodivergent protagonist, and more about Inspector MacAdam, his backstory, and his work environment.  \n   - Jo’s exploration of historical information, like the garden map, felt rushed and lacked the necessary depth to frame the plot effectively.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n   - The pacing was uneven, with too much time spent on MacAdam’s personal issues and not enough on the murder investigation.  \n   - The plot felt crowded and chaotic, with key elements rushed and not given enough time to develop.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Expectations:**  \n   - While many people enjoyed the book, it didn’t work for me despite the recommendation I received.  \n   - It didn’t tick enough boxes for me, though I acknowledge I’ve read worse books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had potential, but issues with cultural authenticity, editing, character focus, and pacing made it fall short of my expectations. While it has its merits, the uneven execution and rushed plot elements left me unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her journey of navigating social cues in a new world after moving to England to inherit an estate was compelling.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  I absolutely loved Ben and Tula, the owners of the local bar and inn, who befriend Jo immediately. Their warmth and charm added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  Brandy Schillace’s choice to tell the story from Jo’s perspective until the murder occurs, followed by alternating viewpoints between Jo and Detective Chief Inspector MacAdams, was an interesting and effective narrative decision.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  I expected a cozy mystery with an amateur sleuth, but was pleasantly surprised by the police procedural feel. Jo uses her research skills more than traditional sleuthing, which added a unique layer to the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story is set in modern times but has the feel of a Christie novel, with a small village setting, a crumbling estate, and a limited cast of characters.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity and Resolution:**  \n  The murder mystery and the missing painting subplot seemed a bit convoluted at times, but Schillace tied everything together with solutions that made sense and felt satisfying.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The novel explores themes of outcasts, determination, connections, and family secrets, making it a rich and layered read.  \n\n- **Potential for a Series:**  \n  The ending hints at the possibility of a series, and I would be thrilled to reunite with Jo, MacAdams, Green, Tula, Ben, and Gwilym in future books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Framed Women of Ardemore House* is a captivating blend of modern mystery and classic Christie-esque charm. With a strong protagonist, memorable supporting characters, and a well-crafted plot, it kept me engaged from start to finish. The potential for a series is exciting, and I look forward to more adventures with these characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

That would have been a bit too pat.  \n\n- **Editing and Accuracy:**  \n   - In a book about an editor, written by an editor, it irked me how many little errors there were, ranging from the wrong \"it's/its,\" \"queue\" instead of \"cue,\" and a few mentions of dollars instead of pounds by British characters about British funds, etc.  \n   - These errors weren't huge by any means, but there were enough that they took me out of the story a couple of times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the novel engaging and well-paced, with a realistic portrayal of an autistic main character and interesting dual POV storytelling.

The first three-quarters were engaging, particularly the sections where characters chased clues and connected the dots.

The climactic reveal was disappointing, as it lacked sufficient hints about the killer’s motives and mistakes, making it feel unearned and abrupt.",

While the primary plot revolves around solving a murder, the story delves deeper into the protagonist's hyperfixation on uncovering the origins of a single framed woman in the Ardemore House.  \n\n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  Cozy mysteries are not typically my go-to genre, but I’m glad I picked this one up. It was a nice and \"cozy\" read, offering a refreshing change from my usual preferences.  \n\n- **Protagonist and Representation:**  \n  The protagonist, Jo, is neurodivergent, and the story also includes neurodivergent side characters. As a neurodivergent person myself, I strongly identified with Jo and her experiences. The author, Schillace, did an excellent job portraying Jo’s journey of wanting to stop masking and embrace her authentic self.  \n\n- **Mystery and Plot:**  \n  The mystery kept me guessing throughout the story. While Jo uses information from other portraits, her focus remains on the single mystery woman in the portrait, which added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really enjoyed learning more about the side characters, who added richness and complexity to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a solid and enjoyable read, blending a cozy mystery with meaningful representation and character depth. The protagonist’s journey of self-discovery and the engaging mystery made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

There was a murder mystery, which I was honestly kind of bored with. The murder of Sid and the “missing painting” felt like they were just added to stretch the story, possibly to set up a second book.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  We never really meet Sid enough to care that he’s dead, and the police in the story don’t lean too heavily into Jo being an actual suspect for long enough for it to be a major plot point.  \n\n- **Preferred Focus of the Story:**  \n  I would have rather just read a book about Jo finding the mysterious painting and then looking into her ancestors and the secrets they tried to hide.  \n\n- **Potential for a Sequel:**  \n  That being said, if there is a second book, and it actually focuses on the Ardemore family, the painting, and Jo discovering all the family secrets, I will absolutely read it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential, it fell short of my expectations due to its disjointed plot and lack of focus on the more intriguing elements, such as the family secrets and the painting.

The premise of a \"fish out of water\" narrative was compelling and drew me in.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Cohesion:**  \n   - The plot became increasingly fractured after a man is murdered in Jo’s cottage. The story splits into two separate investigations: Jo’s search for a missing ancestor and the police investigation into the murder. This dual focus made the narrative feel disjointed and less cohesive.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Several character arcs and relationships were introduced but left unresolved.

This would have tied the two plotlines together more effectively.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started with a strong and engaging premise, the fractured plot and unresolved character arcs detracted from its overall impact. The story had potential but lacked cohesion, leaving too many threads unresolved.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Over the course of about a year, Jo loses her job as an editor, is blindsided by a divorce, faces the illness and death of her mother, and moves to England after inheriting Ardemore House.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The supporting characters are quirky and, for the most part, likable (though there’s always \"that one\" character!).  \n\n- **Author’s Credentials:**  \n  I was impressed by Brandy Schillace’s credentials—she holds a PhD in History, Medical Humanities, and Literature.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful and engaging read, with a unique protagonist and a well-crafted plot. I will definitely be reading more books by Schillace in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
