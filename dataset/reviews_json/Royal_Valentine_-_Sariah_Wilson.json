However, even without directly copying the film, the story felt dull and lacked originality.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters were barely sketched in, and there was no real spark between them. I found both the male and female leads unlikable, especially when the male character got mad for something he was also guilty of, which was frustrating.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n   - The dialogue felt painfully juvenile, which further detracted from my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Series Comparison:**  \n   - Several other books in this series surprised me, and I very much liked 4 out of the 6. It‚Äôs disappointing that the series ended on such a low note with this story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novella didn‚Äôt resonate with me due to its dull plot, underdeveloped characters, and juvenile dialogue. While I appreciated that it wasn‚Äôt a direct retelling of *Roman Holiday*, it failed to deliver the charm or originality I had hoped for. It‚Äôs a disappointing conclusion to an otherwise enjoyable series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The story is cute and well-paced, making it an enjoyable read.

The constant use of phrases like ‚Äúdinnae‚Äù and ‚Äúken‚Äù felt overdone, much like over-salted food. While a little could have added flavor, the overuse pulled me out of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel‚Äôs connection to *Roman Holiday* added a layer of appreciation for the story, the overemphasis on the MMC‚Äôs Scottish accent detracted from the immersion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Once I realized he was Scottish, I appreciated how well Jesse nailed the Scottish brogue.  \n  - Jesse Vilinsky is one of my favorite narrators.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  - The story had no spice (0/5).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Royal Valentine* had some charming elements, like its Roman holiday setting and undercover royalty trope, the inclusion of a breakup felt unnecessary for a novella.
