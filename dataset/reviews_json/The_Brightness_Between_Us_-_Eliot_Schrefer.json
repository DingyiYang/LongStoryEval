        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Sequel Potential:**  \n  I initially didn’t plan to write a sequel to *THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE US* because I felt it didn’t naturally lend itself to one. Sequels are risky, and I didn’t want to create a story that felt like a mere continuation (“Day 2”) of the original. For two years, I couldn’t come up with a concept that could stand on its own, so I told my editor a sequel wasn’t happening.  \n\n- **Reader Feedback:**  \n  Despite the general advice that writers shouldn’t read their reviews, I read every single one of *TDOU*, including the scathing ones. This experience was incredibly valuable. It helped me understand how readers interpreted the book and what resonated with them. For example, I chuckled at the comment about the lack of moisturizer on the ship and felt a sense of accomplishment when someone compared the book to *Interstellar*—but queer and more intense.  \n\n- **Inspiration for the Sequel:**  \n  Immersing myself in reader feedback allowed my subconscious to work on a new story idea. Eventually, I came up with a concept that felt compelling and worthy of being written. The sequel builds on the idea from *TDOU* that “intimacy is the only shield against insanity.” It explores how humanity survives itself and whether it should, with intimacy, family, and love at its core.  \n\n- **Themes and Message:**  \n  The sequel continues to grapple with profound questions about humanity, survival, and the importance of connection. I believe the answer to whether humanity should survive is a complicated yes, and that answer is deeply intertwined with intimacy, love, and relationships.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nReading reader reviews of *THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE US* was a transformative experience that ultimately inspired me to write a sequel. This new story builds on the themes of intimacy and survival from the first book, exploring humanity’s resilience and the role of love in our existence. I’m excited to share this continuation with readers and can’t wait to hear their thoughts.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars (though I acknowledge I might be a bit biased)."

It examines themes of loneliness, found family, grief, and the essential human connections we crave to persevere. Though set in a Sci-Fi context, it remains profoundly human and resonates on a deeply personal level.",
            "This book took me on an emotional rollercoaster: my heart broke with Yarrow, was mended slightly by Kodiak, and then shattered again with Owl. It made me laugh, cry, and experience the bittersweet blend of laughter and tears, highlighting its profound emotional depth.",

            "The book features decent pacing and introduces multiple points of view, including two new characters, but it ultimately lacks the engagement of *Darkness*. The shifting timelines significantly slow the narrative, and there's noticeably less action than in the first book. Instead, the emphasis is on political maneuvering and technical details. While the opening chapters effectively create an unsettling atmosphere that arouses curiosity, the overall story feels more like an extended epilogue or prequel novella. Although I enjoyed the read, I firmly believe *Darkness* should have stood alone. Nevertheless, I didn't mind this follow-up, even if it lacked dramatic developments.",
            "Ambrose shines as a standout character, radiating sunshine and optimism. He serves as the glue that holds everyone together and provides the voice of reason, complemented by a witty personality that I adored in both books. Kodiak, my favorite character in the duology, is a multidimensional figure with a tough exterior that belies a soft, vulnerable core. Owl’s perspective is joyful and honest, though her youthful optimism can occasionally feel overwhelming. By the end, her character feels more fully developed. Yarrow, a new addition, presents a dark and borderline lunatic viewpoint that starkly contrasts with the others. However, his backstory makes him more relatable and easier to embrace by the end.",

I want to see Yarrow getting better and Owl exploring Minerva!!!  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THIS WAS HAPPENING???!?!!??!!??!?!?!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDefinitely a great sequel, though it didn’t quite match the intensity of Book 1. The convergence of timelines, the glimpse of Earth, and the emotional depth of OG Ambrose and Kodiak’s story made it a compelling read. I’m left wanting more from these characters and their journeys.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(20/10/2024)  \n(18/01/2024)"

            "Ambrose and Kodiak are the parents of 15-year-old Owl and almost 16-year-old Yarrow, who both contribute to the family's explorations and scientific endeavors. A pivotal moment occurs during Yarrow's 16th birthday party, where he discovers key insights, including the idea that “intimacy is the only shield against insanity.” The alternating perspectives between past and present, as well as between characters, seamlessly enhance the storyline. It's refreshing to encounter queer characters in a sci-fi setting. I was particularly struck by the words tattooed on young Ambrose’s chest: “Labels are the Root of Violence,” highlighting his unapologetic identity. The narrative delicately navigates this theme, enriched by poignant lines like, “Stop,” I whisper, pushing a sodden branch back and forth, back and forth, with my foot,” which add emotional depth to the characters and their relationships.",
            "This book features fewer intimate scenes than *The Darkness Outside Us*, but the descriptions are vivid enough to allow readers to engage their imaginations. It is suitable for a high school audience, tackling profound philosophical questions about humanity's impact on the world, which ties seamlessly into the central conflict of the plot.",
            "This book brought me to tears, yet the resolution left me immensely satisfied. I feel there is still potential for the author to further develop the narrative, particularly regarding the possibilities of genetically diverse zygotes and embryos."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This is another great book, blending sci-fi with deep philosophical questions and rich character development. The story stands well on its own, with a satisfying resolution that leaves room for future exploration. The inclusion of queer characters and thoughtful themes makes it a standout read.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Standalone Quality:**  \n  I think you might be able to read this book (Book 2 in the series) prior to Book 1, as each book stands alone very well. While this one takes Ambrose and Kodiak further into their future, there are back-story chapters that tell of their past.\n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  There are fewer intimacy scenes in this book compared to *The Darkness Outside Us*, yet there’s enough description to let your mind fill in the blanks. The book can remain unchallenged on a high school shelf. The story explores bigger philosophical questions, such as whether humanity is a scourge and should be stopped, which ties into the plot’s central conflict.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ambrose (Dad) and Kodiak (Father) are the parents of a 15-year-old daughter, Owl, and a soon-to-be 16-year-old son, Yarrow. Both children are helpful with exploring and scientific research. Yarrow’s 16th birthday party is a key moment where he learns pearls of wisdom, such as, “Intimacy is the only shield against insanity.” The alternating POVs between past and present, as well as between characters, match perfectly with the developing storyline.\n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  It’s refreshing to have queer characters in a sci-fi novel. I particularly liked the words on young Ambrose’s chest: “Labels are the Root of Violence.” His identity is unquestionably ‘out,’ and the story handles this with care. The inclusion of lines like, “Stop,” I whisper, pushing a sodden branch back and forth, back and forth, with my foot,” adds depth to the characters’ emotions and relationships.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I had some tears while reading this book. The story’s resolution left me extremely satisfied, though there’s still room for Schrefer to continue the series, especially with the potential of genetically different zygotes/embryos to incubate and grow up.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is another great book by Schrefer, blending sci-fi with deep philosophical questions and rich character development. The story stands well on its own, with a satisfying resolution that leaves room for future exploration. The inclusion of queer characters and thoughtful themes makes it a standout read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nSolid 5*"

I didn’t want the disappointment to ruin the enjoyment I had from the first book.\n\n- **Author’s Skill and Consistency:**  \n  Thank goodness for Eliot Schrefer, who casually wrote two books that are easily considered five-star reads for me. I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys sci-fi and to everyone I speak to.\n\n- **Spoiler-Free Summary:**  \n  It’s hard to write a spoiler-free review of this book because it’s best discussed with examples and references to both Book 1 and Book 2. To keep it simple: this book carries you into a different world and tears your heart apart just as easily as the first book did.\n\n- **Character Development and Characterization:**  \n  The character development and characterization are exceptional. I love how Eliot handles timelines, and I never wanted this book to end.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Personal Connection:**  \n  This book left me emotionally drained, and I’m currently a shell of my former self.

            "This book diverges from a traditional sequel format, with over half of the narrative unfolding prior to *The Darkness Outside Us*. It alternates between two timelines: the Before chapters featuring Young Ambrose and Kodiak, and the After chapters, set 17 years later, following their children, Owl and Yarrow. While the flashbacks are emotionally resonant, they overshadow the development of Owl and Yarrow's characters. The story strikes a commendable balance between humor and drama, employing dry wit to lighten the high-stakes scenarios. Although there are clever plot twists, none match the shocking impact of the “Holy Shit!” moment in *The Darkness Outside Us*. The pacing suffers due to the heavy focus on the Before timeline, which leaves the After timeline feeling somewhat underdeveloped.",
            "The scenes with Young Ambrose and Kodiak are both compelling and emotionally resonant. However, the emphasis on their past sacrifices detracts from the opportunity to explore Owl and Yarrow's personalities and growth more deeply. Nonetheless, it is enjoyable to see Ambrose and Kodiak adapting to their new roles as parents while still embodying their classic sunshine/grumpy dynamic.",

It provided more insight into what was happening at the time of the Coordinated Endeavor's launch and revealed what the original Kodiak and Ambrose were like.\n\n- **Sci-Fi Elements:**  \n  I’m not a big sci-fi reader, but part of what I loved about *The Darkness Outside Us* was the great unknown of space. You had no idea what the characters might encounter on their journey or when they reached the new planet. *The Brightness Between Us* maintained this sense of mystery, as you have no idea what the characters might encounter as they begin to explore Minerva.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The theme of family throughout the book was heartwarming. I loved getting to see the dynamic between Ambrose, Kodiak, Owl, and Yarrow. This balanced out the heavier topics, such as the question of whether humanity should be allowed to keep surviving.\n\n- **Continuity and Strengths:**  \n  All the aspects I loved about the first book were also present in the second book, making it a fantastic read overall.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Brightness Between Us* is a fantastic sequel that delivers the same sense of mystery, emotional depth, and strong character dynamics as its predecessor.

This decision had me internally cheering and added significant depth to the narrative.

While it introduces more POVs and characters, it lacks the claustrophobic atmosphere that made the first book so compelling. That said, I still enjoyed it and would read a third installment.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The new characters are likable, but Kodiak remains a standout. His presence elevates the story, and I was thrilled when he became more prominent halfway through. Kodiak alone would make this a 5-star book.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story is a mix of despair and hope, exploring the question: \"People suck. But could they not suck, given the right circumstances?\" It includes both subtle and overt social commentary on humanity and features an exciting exploration of a new planet, which sci-fi fans will appreciate.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The overuse of the \"last-minute\" gimmick was frustrating. While it was plausible a couple of times, its repeated use felt excessive. Additionally, I wished for more sass regarding the OS's earlier behavior, a critique I also had with the first book.\n\n- **Ending and Spoiler:**  \n  The ending was impactful, particularly the moment when Owl saves her murderous brother over an embryo.

While the first book leaned more into psychological and romantic elements, this one expanded into a broader, more scientific narrative.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story was spread across four perspectives and two timelines, which made it feel less like we were inside the heads of the two main characters (MCs) and more like we were observing their stories as they collided repeatedly across the world, space, and tens of thousands of years.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The romance and love in this book were still present but shifted toward a love of humanity itself. It emphasized the fight to love each other and strive for a future, not just for the individual but for humanity as a whole.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  The inclusion of OS bots and animals that formed relationships with the MCs added sweet, purposeful moments of tenderness, love, and connection.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book felt more poignant than ever before, and I truly needed to read it at this moment in my life.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel expanded on the sci-fi elements of its predecessor, weaving a complex narrative across multiple perspectives and timelines. It explored profound themes of love and humanity while offering tender moments of connection. The emotional depth and relevance of the story made it a deeply impactful read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The emotional weight of the final flashback resonated with me, despite knowing a more positive outcome lay ahead.

This sequel took some time to get into, but it still had moments that made the story enjoyable.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  While there were romantic elements, I wouldn’t classify this as a romance. The story focused more on political upheaval, human greed, and power, making it emotionally powerful and memorable.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Flashbacks:**  \n  The flashbacks were a highlight for me, as they explained how the events of the first book came to be. They also provided deeper insight into the original characters and their roles in both the destruction and creation of the world. The ending of the flashbacks was particularly emotional, even though I knew a better outcome awaited beyond the past.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The present-time storyline with the new characters and the old couple from the first book was intriguing, though a bit frustrating until more answers were revealed. Schrefer’s ability to tie everything together by the end, including surprising twists, was clever and satisfying.\n\n- **Setting and Closure:**  \n  While I preferred the space setting of the first book, this sequel provided much-needed closure by answering lingering questions and filling in plot gaps. It was a satisfying way to tie the story together.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*THE BRIGHTNESS BETWEEN US* is an emotionally impactful and cleverly crafted sequel that, while slower to start, delivers closure and depth to the overarching story.

There’s so much potential—it could pick up where this one ended or delve deeper into Owl and Yarrow’s future. However, I don’t want to see Kodiak and Ambrose die (even though saying this might not make sense considering [redacted for spoilers]).  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Sequels:**  \n  I’ve been a bit of a sequel hater this year, or at least my experience with sequels has been mixed. But I loved this one. Schrefer did a fantastic job.  \n\n- **Story Development:**  \n  Schrefer built on the story both in the present and the past, keeping just enough elements from the first book to satisfy readers while adding enough new elements to keep the book exciting.  \n\n- **Plot and Suspense:**  \n  The plot twist wasn’t the biggest ever, but it really worked for the story. The suspense kept me engaged without being too stressful, making it a perfect cozy winter read.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  This book answers the question of what would have happened to Kodiak and Ambrose even without the forced proximity of the Endeavor. I’m absolutely obsessed with how every version of them is meant to be together.  \n\n- **Author’s Future Work:**  \n  I’m very keen on seeing what Schrefer does next. I’m not a historical fiction fan, so I haven’t read his *Charming Young Man* novel. But whether his next work is an addition to this universe or something completely new, I’ll be curious to give it a read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful and engaging read, balancing familiar elements with fresh twists.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Sequel Quality and Expectations:**  \n  Sequels are always a challenge, especially when the first book sets a high bar, as Schrefer did with the first book in this duology. However, from the very first chapter of *The Brightness Between Us*, I could tell this sequel was going to capture my heart and hold on tight, in the best way possible.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n  While the first book had a strong scientific focus, tempered with the deep human connection between the main characters, Ambrose and Kodiak, the second book centers its theme around intimacy. Seventeen years later, thanks to a scientific miracle, Ambrose and Kodiak now have two children, Owl and Yarrow, who are coming of age on a planet they’re helping to rebuild from scratch.  \n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n  As we follow their journey, we uncover unsettling developments with the children and the future of the planet, while also navigating this new normal on planet Minerva. At the same time, we get flashbacks to Earth’s war-torn past and the origins of the original mission, learning about the sacrifices Ambrose and Kodiak made along the way.  \n\n- **Emotional Resonance and Message:**  \n  Was it destiny that brought them together? Perhaps. But as I read, the phrase ‘love finds a way’ kept echoing in my mind. Despite all the horrors, setbacks, and technological advancements that challenge them, it’s their capacity to love and care for one another that ultimately matters most. In the world we live in, it’s an important message.  \n\n- **Appeal to Readers:**  \n  I beg those of you who ‘don’t read YA’ to give this incredible duology a chance—it’s truly outstanding.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Brightness Between Us* is a heartfelt and compelling sequel that builds on the strengths of its predecessor while exploring new themes of intimacy, family, and resilience. It delivers a powerful message about love and connection, making it a standout read in the YA genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The family grapples with significant external and internal threats to their survival. Ambrose and Kodiak continue to evolve while remaining true to their core traits—Kodiak’s stoicism and Ambrose’s openness. Owl and Yarrow serve as perfect inversions of their fathers, enriching the family dynamics. Experiencing Ambrose and Kodiak through their children’s perspectives is both endearing and insightful. Additionally, OS/Rover, the AI, undergoes a transformation from a Hal-like figure to something more akin to Data from *Star Trek*, adding a layer of complexity to the narrative.",

Despite sacrificing some sci-fi realism, the emotional core of the story remains robust. The Minervan family's unbreakable bonds make their struggle for survival both harrowing and heartwarming.",

However, I was worried it might fail to live up to its predecessor and potentially diminish Ambrose and Kodiak’s journey. While it couldn’t recreate the same highs of the first book’s thriller-romance alchemy, *The Brightness Between Us* enhanced and complicated the emotional and ethical dimensions of their survival on exoplanet Minerva.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The book started a little slow, but I couldn’t put it down after the 50% mark, much like the first book. The story was so compelling that I needed time to process it all afterward.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Seventeen years after their harrowing journey, Ambrose and Kodiak have built a modest home with their surviving teenage children, Owl and Yarrow.

Seeing Ambrose and Kodiak through their children’s eyes was both endearing and insightful.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Core:**  \n  While the first book explored what is necessary for human survival, this one questions whether human survival is a blight on the universe. The emotional core of the story remains strong, even at the expense of sci-fi realism. The Minervan family’s bonds are unfailingly powerful, making their fight for survival both harrowing and heartwarming.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Redemption:**  \n  OS/Rover, the AI, gets a little redemption, evolving from a Hal-like figure to something more akin to Data from *Star Trek*. This added a layer of complexity to the story.\n\n- **Humor and References:**  \n  The Pink [Blue] Lagoon references were amusing, though I’m unsure if they were meant to be taken seriously.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Brightness Between Us* is a worthy sequel that deepens the emotional and ethical stakes of Ambrose and Kodiak’s journey.

While I'm typically not a fan of multiple POVs, this format worked well since each character had distinct sections, making transitions smooth and non-disruptive. I initially expected the focus to be solely on Kodiak, Ambrose, and their family's life on Minerva, but I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of their backstory and the events leading up to the first book. I sincerely hope this isn't the conclusion for Kodiak, Ambrose, Owl, and Yarrow, but if it is, the ending remains satisfying. That said, I can't help but wish for a third book!",

I was so excited that Kodiak and Ambrose's story would continue, and I was not disappointed (although, I kind of am because I want more!).\n\n- **Narrative Structure and POVs:**  \n  This story is told from four POVs: Owl and Yarrow from the present and OG Kodiak and Ambrose from the past. I'm usually not one for multiple POVs, but this really worked because it wasn't going back and forth between chapters. They each had their own sections, which was nice because it wasn't jarring when a new POV was introduced.\n\n- **Plot and Surprises:**  \n  I really expected the story to be all about Kodiak, Ambrose, and their family's lives on Minerva but was pleasantly surprised. It was nice to get some of Kodiak and Ambrose's backstory and the events leading up to the events in the first book.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Can I also say that I love that Kodiak and Ambrose will always choose each other no matter what?\n\n- **Ending and Future Hopes:**  \n  I really hope this isn't the end of Kodiak, Ambrose, Owl, and Yarrow's stories. However, if it is, the ending is satisfying. That being said, can we please, please, please get a third book?\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you so much to HarperCollins Children's and NetGalley for the ARC!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"The Darkness Outside Us\" is a captivating and well-structured novel that exceeded my expectations.

            "Owl's excitement and eagerness to explore capture the essence of a teenager yearning for adventure amid extreme circumstances. Her frustration with a mundane routine while sensing a larger world outside is both relatable and realistic. She embodies resilience and determination, mirroring her father, Kodiak. \n\nAmbrose's journey is simultaneously heartbreaking and beautiful. His quest for human connection, reactions to the mission reveal, and transformation from wanting to sabotage the mission to committing to save his future selves are powerful. The subplot involving his celebrity crush adds depth to his character.\n\nYarrow's story is darker and more tragic. His transformation from a mild-mannered child to someone willing to take drastic actions for his family is heart-wrenching. His discovery of the sea and immediate urge to share it with Owl highlights his profound love for his sister.\n\nKodiak's chapters resonated with me most deeply. His lifelong dream of becoming a spacefarer, initial desire for solitude, and eventual longing for human connection reflect the complexity of the human experience. His relationship with Ambrose, particularly in their final moments together, is both heartbreaking and uplifting.",
            "The story centers on the theme of human connection and intimacy, drawing parallels between Ambrose and Kodiak's journey and that of Owl and Yarrow. These comparisons illuminate the effects of deception and the varied ways characters cope with its consequences. Ultimately, the book underscores the significance of love, hope, and resilience.",
            "The story elicited a spectrum of emotions, from heartbreak to hope. Yarrow’s return to Owl, Kodiak’s knitting, and the title reveal all left a lasting impact. The ending, showcasing Owl and Yarrow’s optimism for the future, was especially poignant.",

            "In *The Brightness Between Us*, the main twist is impressive, though it doesn't quite match the earth-shattering revelation of the first book. The discovery that Devon manipulated frozen fetuses to instill aggressive traits raises the stakes significantly. Additionally, the concept of sabotage from 30,000 years ago and characters communicating across time adds a unique and gripping layer to the story.",
            "Owl, the protagonist, may not have been my favorite character, but she was well-suited to the story. Her curiosity and resentment towards her parents aligned perfectly with the \"space colony gone wrong\" theme. While she lacked the likability of Ambrose and Kodiak—who I enjoyed seeing as parents—her role was essential. Although Ambrose and Kodiak's character development in the present-day storyline felt somewhat repetitive compared to the first book, their arcs remained emotional and compelling.",
            "The worldbuilding on Minerva is exceptional, showcasing meticulous research into its terrain, climate, and wildlife. The suspense remains palpable, even in seemingly minor details, such as the bones Owl discovers, which intriguingly turn out to be from a duck. The hard sci-fi elements are well-crafted, with every detail feeling like a Chekhov’s gun poised to fire. The present-day storyline featuring Ambrose and Kodiak is equally compelling, vividly illustrating a divided world of corporate excess versus rigid control. This backdrop deepens our understanding of how Ambrose and Kodiak evolved into the characters we meet in book one. Devon, the slippery antagonist, adds intrigue, and his acts of sabotage stand out as a highlight of the novel.",
            "I was surprised to find this story had a sequel, but it turned out to be a captivating continuation. The premise of a \"space colony gone wrong\" was expertly developed, and I'm glad I stayed to see how the author expanded the narrative."

        "conclusion": "*The Brightness Between Us* delivered a compelling and emotional story. The characters were well-developed, and the narrative was deeply engaging, making it a memorable read. While it didn’t surpass the twists of *The Darkness Outside Us*, it stood strong on its own with excellent worldbuilding, a gripping plot, and well-suited characters.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations and Sequel Setup:**  \n  I didn’t expect *The Darkness Outside Us* to have a sequel, but *The Brightness Between Us* proved to be a fascinating follow-up. The setup for a “space colony gone wrong” story was perfect, and I’m glad I stuck around to see how Eliot Schrefer expanded the story.\n\n- **Worldbuilding and Sci-Fi Elements:**  \n  The worldbuilding on Minerva was exceptional, with detailed research into the terrain, climate, and wildlife. Schrefer kept the suspense alive, even when seemingly minor details like the bones Owl found turned out to be from a duck. The hard sci-fi elements were solid, and every detail felt like a Chekhov’s gun waiting to fire.\n\n- **Character Suitability and Development:**  \n  Owl, the protagonist, wasn’t my favorite character, but she was perfectly suited for the story. Her curiosity and resentment towards her parents made her an ideal fit for the “space colony gone wrong” plot. While she wasn’t as likable as Ambrose or Kodiak (who I loved seeing as parents), her role in the story was undeniable. Ambrose and Kodiak’s character development in the present-day storyline felt a bit repetitive compared to book one, but their arcs were still emotional and compelling.\n\n- **Plot Twists and Suspense:**  \n  The main twist in *The Brightness Between Us* was excellent, though it didn’t surpass the earth-shattering twist of book one. The revelation that Devon manipulated the frozen fetuses to develop aggressive traits added high stakes to the plot. The idea of sabotage from 30,000 years in the past and characters communicating across time was a unique and gripping twist.\n\n- **Present-Day Storyline and Worldbuilding:**  \n  The present-day storyline with Ambrose and Kodiak was equally fascinating. Schrefer’s vision of a divided world—one of corporate excess and another of rigid control—was vividly portrayed. It provided a deeper understanding of how Ambrose and Kodiak became the characters we met in book one. Devon, the antagonist, was slippery and intriguing, and his sabotage was a highlight of the novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Brightness Between Us* had the monumental task of living up to its predecessor, but it delivered a compelling and emotional sequel. While it didn’t surpass the twists of *The Darkness Outside Us*, it stood strong on its own with excellent worldbuilding, a gripping plot, and well-suited characters. A 5-star read that kept me hooked from start to finish.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars!"

            "The book employs dual timelines—one set on Minerva in the present and the other on Earth in the past—intertwining their narratives.

            "Ambrose and Kodiak, a long-established couple deeply in love, have built a resilient life together on Minerva. In this story, the focus shifts from their romance to their children, Owl and Yarrow, who play a more central role in themes of family and survival.",

            "I initially expected the Earth timeline to take center stage, but both the Earth and Minerva timelines are equally significant and well-balanced. The convergence of these timelines is remarkable and showcases the author's ingenuity.",
            "The introduction of Owl and Yarrow, Ambrose and Kodiak’s children on Minerva, is a standout moment in the story. Their family dynamic is beautifully depicted, showcasing profound love and strong bonds. Ambrose and Kodiak’s commendable parenting highlights the heartwarming affection their children have for them. This book truly allows Kodiak to shine, as he was somewhat overshadowed in the first installment. His character is explored in depth across both timelines, leading me to develop a strong admiration—and perhaps even a crush—for him. The relationship between Ambrose and Kodiak on Earth is equally compelling; their meeting and becoming each other’s anchor in a world devoid of support is both poignant and beautiful.",
            "This book evoked a wide range of emotions, but the depth of love in Ambrose and Kodiak's family was particularly striking. Their bond with each other and their children was profoundly moving.",
            "Initially, I was skeptical about a sequel, worried it might tarnish the perfection of the first book. However, the blurb piqued my interest, particularly the idea of exploring Ambrose and Kodiak’s lives on Earth and Minerva, separated by 30,000 years. This premise offered endless potential. While the story lacks the same suspense as its predecessor, it is equally captivating. It drew me in from the beginning, pulling me out of a reading slump, and I finished it in a single day, completely engrossed."

        "conclusion": "This book surpassed my expectations in every way. Despite my initial scepticism, it delivered a beautifully crafted narrative with well-balanced timelines, deeply emotional character relationships, and a compelling exploration of Kodiak’s character.

This setup had endless potential.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Timelines:**\n  - I assumed the past timeline (Earth) would be the primary focus, but both timelines—Earth and Minerva—are equally important and well-balanced. The way these timelines eventually converge is astonishing and a testament to the author’s ingenuity.\n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**\n  - While the story doesn’t hold the same level of suspense as the first book, it is just as fascinating. It captured my attention from the start, pulling me out of a reading slump. I read it in one day, completely engrossed.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n  - The introduction of Owl and Yarrow, Ambrose and Kodiak’s children on Minerva, was a highlight.

The portrayal of their bond with their children and with each other was profoundly moving.\n\n- **Comparison to the Predecessor:**\n  - Initially, I wasn’t sure if this book could match the five-star quality of the first one. However, by the end, I was convinced it not only met but possibly exceeded the high standard set by its predecessor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book surpassed my expectations in every way.

The characters' three-year confinement inside the Aurora due to the comet felt bleak and joyless. I yearned for a glimpse of hope, perhaps seeing Yarrow and Owl recover or new children playing, but the conclusion was disappointingly dark.",

However, Kodiak's ongoing annoyance and criticism of Ambrose were frustrating. I wanted to see more evolution in their relationship—some softening and a deeper recognition of their affection beyond mere circumstance. Instead, their connection often felt overshadowed by the narrative's insistence on it being situational, preventing them from genuinely falling in love.",

Teenagers Kodiak and Ambrose manage to program and deploy beacons designed to traverse space for 30,000 years, performing DNA correction on humans and zygotes along the way. Meanwhile, an allegedly “unstoppable” warbot hunting them abruptly loses interest, claiming their pursuit is “not necessary anymore.” After weeks of searching, the humans discover that the beacon on the alien planet is merely a 30-minute walk from their habitat. A 16-year-old boy transforms into a tech-savvy, memory-impaired, calculating killer, attributed to an “over-production of testosterone.” In a seemingly emotional farewell, Kodiak and Ambrose choose to have sex in the basement of an abandoned Glasgow university just before facing nuclear destruction. Although the book holds significant potential, it struggles to deliver a sequel that matches the impact of its predecessor.",

After the intensity of the first book, I felt this one didn’t live up to expectations.  \n\n- **Flashback Storyline:**  \n  The flashback parts were a major letdown. The most compelling plot is the new human settlement on an alien planet thousands of years in the future, but the story keeps getting sidetracked by unnecessary flashbacks to Earth. These flashbacks rehash the same romance from the first book, but it feels worse because it’s the originals of the clones we already followed. Kodiak’s character feels inconsistent—he’s distant and solitary in the first book but fantasizes about hooking up almost immediately in the flashbacks. The romance feels rushed and forced, only happening because the plot of the first book dictates it. The flashbacks do eventually become relevant when the sabotage of the future mission is revealed, but they’re boring and unnecessary for half the book. The only redeeming part of the flashbacks is Sheep, the dog Kodiak saves and cares for, who follows them around like an affectionate puppy.  \n\n- **Plot Convenience and Believability:**  \n  The plot is full of overly convenient events that don’t make sense. For example:  \n  - Devon sabotages the zygote DNA of the entire human colony in just two minutes during a ship tour, and the scientists can’t fix it before launch.  \n  - Kodiak and Ambrose, both teenagers, somehow program and launch beacons to fly across space for 30,000 years and perform surgery to fix DNA mutations in humans and zygotes.  \n  - An “unstoppable” warbot hunting Kodiak and Ambrose suddenly decides to leave because dealing with them is “not necessary anymore.”  \n  - The beacon on the alien planet, which the humans spend weeks searching for, is just a 30-minute walk from their habitat.  \n  - A 16-year-old boy becomes a tech-hacking, memory-impaired, cruel, and calculating murderous genius due to an “over-production of testosterone.”  \n  - Kodiak and Ambrose decide to have sex in the basement of an abandoned university in Glasgow as their last act before being blown up by nuclear bombs.  \n\n- **Character Motivations and Writing:**  \n  The character motivations feel off compared to the first book, and the writing comes across as forced. The story doesn’t capture or engage me like the first one did.  \n\n- **Potential and Execution:**  \n  The book had a lot of potential, but it’s clear how difficult it is to make a sequel that lives up to the first book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some interesting ideas, it fell short in execution.

In contrast, the present timeline felt lackluster; I struggled to connect with the kids, despite the strong horror and mystery elements.\n\nThe conclusion of the past timeline was particularly satisfying and emotional—I even shed a few tears.

            "I couldn't put the book down, especially towards the end, where I was so engrossed that I missed train stops. The comet as a looming threat was thrilling and perfectly aligned with my love for terrifying space scenarios. However, the saboteur subplot, while intriguing, felt less impactful compared to the comet's menace. The exposition during Devon Mujaba’s reveal was clunky, and I would have preferred a deeper exploration of mental health struggles over genetic sabotage. Additionally, the timing of certain events, such as the characters arriving in Edinburgh just as the war escalated, felt a bit too convenient.",
            "I appreciated the deeper exploration of Ambrose’s personality, particularly his \"fuckboy princeling\" side, which was only hinted at in the first book. Kodiak stood out as a compelling character, showcasing vulnerability and depth in a refreshingly authentic way. However, I found the supporting characters, Sri and Devon, less impactful and lacking emotional resonance.",
            "The vivid and immersive descriptions of locales on both Minerva and Earth created a strong sense of place.",
            "This book evoked intense emotions, bringing me to tears as I deeply connected with the characters and their journey. The portrayal of family life, particularly the main couple's efforts to build a life and raise children, resonated with me. The ending was both heartbreaking and hopeful, leaving a lasting impression."

            "I was captivated by Yarrow's internal conflict as his mind turned against him, reflecting the all-too-real struggle with intrusive thoughts. I appreciated his battle with feelings of doom and the fear of unintentionally harming others. However, when he ultimately acts on these fears, it felt unearned. His final justification—claiming he had no reason for his actions and was merely following orders—didn't resonate with me. I needed a stronger rationale to support this pivotal moment in the story.",

The struggle of intrusive thoughts is one that is all too real to me. I loved Yarrow’s struggle with his own feelings of doom and worrying about accidentally hurting others. However, when he finally acts on it, it’s a plot point that didn’t feel earned to me. His final thoughts about there not being any reason for why he did it and just following orders didn’t sell me on that plot point being in there. I needed something else to justify his actions.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  Maybe it was the audiobook narrator's tone, but the final line of Yarrow’s section where he turns violent came off with school-shooter vibes to me, and I don't think that’s where Schrefer intended to go with this character. It may read differently for me if I reread the text copy.  \n\n- **World-Building and Gene Editing Concept:**  \n  I can suspend my disbelief and buy into a world where gene editing is possible to a point where it can trigger as soon as a child hits adolescence. What I can’t buy is gene editing putting specific thoughts or worded instructions in someone’s mind.  \n\n- **Villain Reveal (Devon Mujaba):**  \n  I’m sorry, but I just cannot buy into famous, sexy, boy-band heartthrob Devon Mujaba being the one responsible for the gene editing sabotage. That reveal about him doing last-minute gene editing would have been comical if the ramifications hadn’t been so serious. If you told me that he was the villain ahead of time, I likely would not have read this book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Adaptation Hopes:**  \n  Despite those two plot points that confused me, I still liked this book, which is why it gets 3 stars. Schrefer pulled off a sequel and prequel in one book about two characters I love, and it was a true treat being given both their backstory and their fates all at once. It felt like watching all the bonus content right after finishing a new amazing movie. Now that I know the movie rights have been bought by Elliot Page's production company, I can't wait and really hope they incorporate parts of both books in this duology to make a fantastic film and do it justice. Just PLEASE don’t tack on extra movie sequels and add padded content that doesn’t need to be there—make one really good one!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some confusing plot points, particularly around Yarrow’s actions and the villain reveal, I still enjoyed it overall. The blend of sequel and prequel elements, along with the rich character development, made it a satisfying read. I’m excited about the potential film adaptation and hope it stays true to the essence of the books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

The first 100 pages, centered on Owl, were difficult to engage with, but the story truly gains momentum when Yarrow begins to glitch at the end of Part 1. By Part 4, the narrative becomes gripping, making the remainder of the book highly engaging. Divided into seven parts, the story alternates between the perspectives of Owl, Yarrow, Ambrose, and Kodiak. While the shifting timelines and viewpoints can be challenging to follow, they ultimately enhance the story’s depth and intrigue.",
            "In Parts 1, 5, and 7, Owl, the main character, pales in comparison to Ambrose, Kodiak, and Yarrow. Yarrow's psychological state is the story's central mystery, making his sections especially engaging. The Earth Kodiak storyline in Part 4 is a highlight, and Sheep is a standout character for me.",

The alternating perspectives and timelines add complexity, and the latter half of the book, particularly Earth Kodiak’s sections, is exceptionally compelling.

The alternating perspectives and timelines add complexity, and the latter half of the book, particularly Earth Kodiak’s sections, is exceptionally compelling. Despite some initial pacing issues, the high stakes, intriguing characters, and plot twists make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I found Yarrow’s resolution a bit too convenient, as the surgery seemed like a quick fix. Additionally, his intrusive OCD-like thoughts and visions could have been explained more thoroughly. However, I acknowledge the need for suspension of disbelief in a YA novel.",
            "I found myself less invested in Owl and Yarrow compared to Ambrose and Kodiak, but I still enjoyed their chapters. My fondness for Ambrose and Kodiak grew as I appreciated their development into devoted dads, outliving their clones and original selves. Their tragic yet beautiful ending deeply moved me, highlighting the profound connection they forged in their brief time together. ",
            "The book is engaging and easy to read, making it difficult to put down. Despite the multiple timelines and character perspectives, it remains easy to follow, which I truly appreciated.",

I particularly appreciated the exploration of life after the launch, as well as glimpses into the characters' lives before.",
            "This story moved me to tears, especially the tragic yet poignant ending involving Ambrose and Kodiak. A standout quote on page 376 captures this beautifully: “Somewhere out there, maybe right now, millions of years away, in the void of space, a version of me is being woken up next to a version of him, these two beings who are intimately connected and nothing alike.”"

The impending and tragic convergence of these perspectives left me emotionally wrung out, but in a good way.\n\n- **Story Continuation and Craftsmanship:**  \n  I had significant reservations about picking up this sequel, fearing it might not live up to the first book’s brilliance. However, I found this sequel to be well-crafted. It continues the story in an interesting and compelling way, though I don’t like it as much as the first book. The secondary storyline, which explores an alternate universe where Kodiak and Ambrose meet under different conditions, elevated the story beyond my expectations.\n\n- **Comparison to the First Book:**  \n  While I didn’t enjoy this book as much as the first, I liked it more than I expected. The introspective vibes from the first book are still present, making it familiar yet different enough to avoid feeling alienating or disappointing.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you enjoyed the first book, I think you’d mostly like this sequel. It retains many of the elements that made the first book special while introducing new layers to the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sequel successfully continues the story with a well-crafted narrative and emotional depth.

The first book gripped my attention immediately and left me silently wallowing at the beauty of it all. This one did not disappoint.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Perspectives:**  \n  The book is divided into a few different perspectives, ranging from the moments Kodiak and Ambrose get their minds scanned to almost 20 years after the last clones landed on Minerva. Overall, I think these perspectives work to create a story that feels familiar like that in the first book, but gets new details added now that we have other perspectives. The fact that this is written from the original Kodiak and Ambrose as well as their two children, Owl and Yarrow, adds great immersion into this story.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Key Moments:**  \n  Getting to finally know what was on Kodiak's video to his future self, or what happens to the original Kodiak and Ambrose, left me utterly devastated. Once again, including the novel's title in a titular heart-wrenching moment left me utterly speechless for a moment before I could go on reading. I thought getting to see Ambrose record his future video was eye-opening. How against it he was, and seeing that his mother was willingly admitting to doctoring the video because that's what was best for the mission, brought a new light into this world that we just saw for a page or two at most.\n\n- **Overall Satisfaction and Desire for More:**  \n  Just like the first book, this leaves me wanting more of their story and their world. It left me utterly fascinated, hopeful, and a bit of a mess emotionally. If Eliot Schrefer ever writes more, just know I'll be first in line!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book lived up to my high expectations, delivering a deeply immersive and emotionally impactful story. The multiple perspectives added depth and familiarity while introducing new layers to the narrative. It left me yearning for more and solidified my admiration for Eliot Schrefer's storytelling.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It felt like a gut punch, leaving me utterly wrecked. The intensity of the story was overwhelming, and I couldn’t help but yell and feel deeply for the characters and their journey. I was so affected that I’m certain a reread will hurt just as much as the first time.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were incredible, from Owl and Yarrow to the original Ambrose and Kodiak.

The depth of their development added layers of complexity to the story.\n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The central theme of the novel, much like its predecessor, is hope and the promise of something better. This hope isn’t always immediate or realized within a lifetime, but it’s what drives the characters forward. The story serves as a powerful reminder that hope is a fundamental part of being human—living, loving, and striving for a better future for those who come after us.\n\n- **Pacing and Immersion:**  \n  I’m glad I set aside an entire day to read the book in one sitting because I couldn’t imagine stopping partway through.

They might all have different wants, but there is no distinctive voice, even for the two original characters that are supposed to be more fleshed out.  \n\n- **Scientific Accuracy:**  \n  There is faulty science in this book.

Another instance involves excess testosterone, which has more side effects than the author seems to acknowledge. These are just the first two examples that come to mind, but there are other instances as well.  \n\n- **Consistency and Plot Development:**  \n  While it was not mentioned in the last two-thirds of the book, Owl mentions at least four times in the first 100 pages how much she hates being the only person both capable of and possibly expected to carry a kid and co-parent with her brother. This is never mentioned again after that, which feels very odd and out of place with the rest of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was not worth it, and I am not entirely sure the author knew what he was doing for a good chunk of it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The author did an amazing job of continuing the original story without making it feel unnecessary or repetitive.\n\n- **Character Perspectives (POVs):**  \n  I especially enjoyed the POVs from the original characters, Ambrose and Kodiak. Their story had a strong dystopian feel, and it was executed very well. I would have been perfectly happy if the book had focused solely on their part of the story. Additionally, I found myself surprisingly engaged with the POVs and story set 30,000 years in the future, featuring Owl and Yarrow.

This portrayal was both fascinating and unsettling. I wouldn’t mind reading a whole book exploring how the world evolved to the state it was in during Ambrose and Kodiak’s time.\n\n- **Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  This is definitely the best book I’ve read in a while.

I worried a sequel might not capture the essence of the original. However, *The Brightness Between Us* proved to be the perfect follow-up, answering lingering questions like whether the original Kodiak and Ambrose ever met, if the final pair of clones succeeded in their settlement, and whether Minerva represented humanity's future or demise.\n\n- **Character Development and Familiarity:**  \n  Seeing Ambrose and Kodiak again felt like reuniting with old friends after a long time apart. The multiple POVs, especially being inside Kodiak’s head, added depth to his character and enhanced my understanding of the Kodiak I met in the first book.\n\n- **Themes and Philosophical Exploration:**  \n  A core theme of the novel is the question of humanity’s existence and whether humans should exist at all. This philosophical exploration is woven throughout the story, adding a layer of depth and introspection.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The book features two intertwining storylines—the \"past\" on Earth, where Ambrose and Kodiak learn the truth about the Coordinated Endeavor, and the \"present\" on Minerva, following the POVs of Owl and Yarrow, their teenage children. The two storylines are cleverly woven together, each building toward their own \"Oh shit\" moments that are both distinct and connected.\n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I appreciated the audiobook narration, which helped cement certain pronunciations in my mind and added to my overall enjoyment of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Brightness Between Us* is a masterful sequel that not only meets but exceeds the expectations set by *The Darkness Outside Us*.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Continuity and Sequel Quality:**  \n  I was both excited and nervous about the sequel to *The Darkness Outside Us*, but my fears were put to rest as soon as I started *The Brightness Between Us*. The story picks up 17 years after the first book, with Kodiak and Ambrose now parents to two teens, Owl and Yarrow. Fans of the original will not be disappointed.  \n\n- **Character Development and Perspectives:**  \n  Owl longs for freedom to explore, while something seems off with Yarrow. The story also delves into the past, over 30,000 years ago, to explore the original Ambrose and Kodiak and the events that shaped the present. The decision to tell the current story from Owl and Yarrow’s perspectives was a great choice, and the perspective shifts were smooth and well-executed.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n  The word I’d use to describe this story is “hopeful.” I experienced a full range of emotions while reading, from excitement to anger, tears, and joy. The story’s twists and turns kept me engaged, and it’s one that will stay with me for a long time.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The narrative seamlessly weaves between the past and present, maintaining a compelling pace. The twists and turns were well-placed, and I appreciated how the story unfolded without giving too much away.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Brightness Between Us* is a beautifully crafted sequel that lives up to the original. It’s a hopeful, emotionally resonant story with well-developed characters and a narrative that seamlessly blends past and present. It’s a book that will stay with readers long after they finish it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars.  \n\nThank you NetGalley and Harper Collins for the ARC in exchange for an honest review."

            "*The Darkness Outside Us* follows a group of clones tasked with repairing a spaceship to reach a distant planet, culminating in the arrival of the final pair at their destination. In *The Brightness Between Us*, the narrative shifts focus to the clones—now called Dad and Father by their children—who face challenges on their new home planet. Meanwhile, the original Ambrose and Kodiak discover that it is their clones, not themselves, being sent into space. The plot also involves sabotage of the system responsible for creating future generations of humans and animals.

I think the author wasted some really good exploration opportunities. Come on! You live on a strange planet and don't want to know what is behind the corner?\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I loved some parts of the book, but overall, I felt it didn't meet my expectations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some beautifully written moments and unexpected dramatic twists, it ultimately fell short of the high standard set by its prequel.

I gained valuable insights into Ambrose and Kodiak, from the mission's details to Ambrose's impulsive decision to find Kodiak, who initially follows him without clear motivation. This all leads to a powerful moment where they warn their clones about the impending danger. Brilliant!",

Their bond is subtle yet profound, and it's evident they would face any challenge for one another. \n\nTheir family is their greatest treasure. Owl and Yarrow, though unexpected, are vital to this narrative. Owl is both annoying and remarkably strong, while Yarrow, despite his illness, returns to his family.

I wanted to see them connect more before their end. They felt less developed in this book, likely because the story is told from the perspective of their kids. However, it was sweet seeing their little moments.  \n\n- **Character Development (Yarrow and Owl):**  \n  Yarrow and Owl were interesting characters, but I wish we knew more about them.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The first half of the book felt slow, and just as it started to pick up speed, the momentum was taken away.  \n\n- **Desire for Future Focus:**  \n  I feel like another book is needed, one that focuses solely on the family of four without any time separation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t resonate with me as strongly as the first one, it eventually won me over.

I was incredibly pleased to see them again in this sequel. Their roles as dads were chef's kiss—still their typical selves but so warm and nurturing. Kodiak's ways continued to amuse me. Owl was probably my favorite character after the dads; she was one great kid.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was thrilling, angsty, with some very unexpected twists and turns. It was rather sad in places but still carried an underlying sense of hope. However, the past-flashback chapters, which centered on Kodiak and Ambrose’s time on Earth before and after the ship left for the new planet, dragged a little. While I enjoyed them to a point, I found myself eager to return to Minerva with the crew I knew. That said, the background information did enrich the overall story.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  Life on Minerva was not easy, but years later, the characters had built a whole new life there, complete with two children, Owl and Yarrow, and a lot of urgent complications. The depiction of their struggles and triumphs on the new planet was compelling.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story was emotionally resonant, blending moments of sadness with a persistent thread of hope. The angsty and thrilling elements kept me engaged throughout.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I’m so glad we have this second book, and honestly, if there were more books in the series, I’d read them without hesitation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sequel was a satisfying return to the lives of Kodiak, Ambrose, and their crew, offering a mix of thrilling plot twists, emotional depth, and rich character development. While the flashback chapters slowed the pacing slightly, they added valuable context to the story.

It shifted focus to a flashback YA dystopian apocalypse narrative, which felt disconnected and underwhelming.\n- **Plot Conveniences:** The story relied heavily on convenient coincidences, which detracted from its believability. For instance, the sudden introduction and immediate appearance of a planet-destroying comet felt forced and unrealistic.\n- **Tone and Execution:** The overall tone and execution of the story were disappointing. The flashback structure and dystopian elements came across as clichéd and eyeroll-inducing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel didn’t resonate with me as it strayed from the strengths of its predecessor. The reliance on contrived plot points and a lackluster execution made it a frustrating read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nMeh."

His presence felt unnecessary and frustrating, to the point where it became a persistent annoyance for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its highs and lows, the expansion of the world and the resolution of the original characters' arcs were standout elements. However, the inclusion of Devon detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"
