He’s an angry, broken soul consumed by obsession, making him my favorite type of male love interest—messed up and hiding his feelings with a façade of jerkiness. Row is irresistibly swoon-worthy and adds another captivating hero to obsess over. \n\nCal's journey is equally compelling; she's faced immense challenges and is struggling to find her footing in life. I loved how Row embraces her uniqueness and builds her up throughout their tumultuous relationship. After a missed opportunity to be together, they reconnect five years later in their hometown, teetering on the brink of repeating past mistakes. Their story is filled with intense angst and longing, making it both sweet and heartbreaking."

            "Ambrose Casablancas captured my heart in an instant, quickly rising to the top of my favorites alongside Noah Riley from *Say You Swear*. Row is simply amazing—his obsession with Calla and the depth of his love for her made me giddy. From small gestures to grand displays, he embodies the perfect book boyfriend, and even his grumpiness adds to his charm. I’m so enamored with him that I could talk about him all day.\n\nCalla, a beautifully quirky mess, won me over just as quickly. Unapologetically herself, she has a lot of growing and healing to do, but her journey—though at times frustrating—is incredibly rewarding. I adored her relationships, especially with her mom, and her sunny disposition is infectious. You can’t help but like her, even when she’s avoiding the truth.\n\nThe banter between Row and Calla is fantastic and hilarious; I lost count of how many times I laughed at their exchanges. It adds a delightful layer to their already sizzling chemistry. There truly is no one better for Calla than Row, and I found myself wanting to fight for him—he deserves the world and more.",

Row may very well be the love of my literary life, and I'm declaring it a thing until I find a way to move on—spoiler alert: that's never happening. Cal's complexity as a character made her endearing and relatable, even when her choices frustrated me. To judge her otherwise would overlook how trauma can manifest in our lives.",

The story drew me in like a cartoon character following the irresistible scent of delicious food, and it never let me go."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  I loved the story of Roe Casablanca and Cal Litivin. Roe grew to hate Cal five years ago after she tore apart his heart. Despite this, Roe secretly loved Cal but never confessed his feelings because he knew she would deny and fight it. The tension and emotional depth in their relationship kept me hooked. The turning point where Cal realizes her love for Roe and tries to win him back was particularly compelling.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Roe’s character was well-developed, and his internal struggle between love and resentment felt authentic. I also adored Rhyland, Roe’s best friend and right-hand person in his restaurants. He added a layer of warmth and loyalty to the story. Cal’s journey from denial to acceptance of her feelings was also well-portrayed.\n\n- **Writing Style and Author’s Skill:**  \n  This is my third or fourth book by LJ Shen, and I highly recommend it. The author’s ability to craft emotionally charged narratives and complex characters is exceptional. The pacing and dialogue felt natural, making it easy to stay engaged.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt and emotionally rich story about love, regret, and second chances. The dynamic between Roe and Cal, supported by well-written secondary characters like Rhyland, makes it a standout read. LJ Shen’s storytelling continues to impress me, and this book is no exception.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a high rating, likely 4.5 or 5 stars."

While Cal struggles with the idea of a relationship, Row is deeply in love with her. \n\nFive years later, Cal returns to town for her father's funeral after years of silence. Rebuilding her friendship with Dylan proves challenging, especially with Row back in the picture, harboring resentment towards the world. Beneath his tough exterior, tattoos, and sarcasm, Row is a softie—especially for Cal. He offers her a job, gives her rides, helps her confront her fears, and carries some of her burdens. Row Casablancas is undeniably swoon-worthy, and I found myself captivated by his every sharp remark.",

I just knew I was going to love it intensely.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  - Row is Cal's best friend's older brother, but he’s so much more than that. He’s the only man she feels safe with alone, someone who always has her back. To Cal, he’s as much of a home as Dylan.  \n  - Their relationship takes a dramatic turn when Row takes Cal’s virginity, and Dylan finds out. The fallout isn’t for the reasons one might expect—Cal is incapable of a relationship, but Row is in love with her.  \n  - Five years later, Cal returns to town for her dad’s funeral after years of radio silence. Rebuilding Dylan’s friendship isn’t the hardest part; Row is back too, and he shows her the same resentment he feels toward the rest of the world.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Development:**  \n  - Row is a total softie beneath his hard exterior, tattoos, and sarcasm—at least when it comes to Cal. He’s there to give her a job, provide rides, help her face her fears, and carry some of her secrets and burdens on his shoulders.  \n  - Row Casablancas is swoon-worthy, and I found myself drooling over his every rude comment.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - I loved everything about this story—the relationship, the banter, the innuendos, and the sweetness. The writing style kept me engaged and emotionally invested throughout.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  - I need at least 324 more books set in this world.

Despite its length and a touch of miscommunication, the story felt purposeful and enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Both characters are deeply in love yet too stubborn to admit it for far too long. When Dot finally makes a grand gesture towards the end, I found myself shouting at my Kindle, “Yes!! Finally!!!” The story employs dual POVs, showcasing the grumpy x sunshine trope. Row is patient, caring, hopeful, and supportive, going above and beyond to protect Dot, listen to her, and cherish her in the bedroom, even when she disappoints him. Cal, on the other hand, is haunted by a traumatic high school incident that creates long-lasting challenges. Despite her efforts to overcome these issues with Row, she struggles to fully open her heart until the very end. Their captivating banter and willingness to let each other in—while keeping others at bay—add depth to their connection. Although Cal is a fantastic best friend, she struggles as a partner.

It was heartbreakingly beautiful, and the raw pain of the characters made me cry at times.  \n  - The book is long, but the detailed backstory added depth to the plot and made it worth the length.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I connected deeply with Row’s frustrations and heartbreak, especially as someone married to a partner with anxiety. The portrayal of patience and waiting for a partner to work through their feelings was written exceptionally well.  \n  - Cal’s best friend, Dylan, was a standout character with her sassy personality and great lines.  \n\n- **Setting and Nostalgia:**  \n  - I loved the 90s references, including chapter titles named after 90s songs. It brought a strong sense of nostalgia and added a unique charm to the story.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  - The book included many great tropes: best friend’s brother, grumpy x sunshine, boss & employee, enemies to lovers, second chance romance, billionaire romance, forced proximity, and a lot of angst.  \n  - The spice level was 🌶️🌶️, adding to the overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  - This was a surprising and enjoyable read. I went into it blind and was blown away by the outcome.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTruly Madly Deeply was a beautifully written, emotional, and nostalgic read that exceeded my expectations. The slow-burn romance, well-developed characters, and 90s references made it a standout experience. I highly recommend it, especially for fans of angsty, second-chance romances.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a high rating, likely 4.5 or 5 stars."

The characters, especially Cal and Row, are complex and compelling, and the supporting cast adds depth to the narrative. I can’t wait for the next book in this series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I absolutely loved the main female character, Cal. She is loving, caring, and unafraid to show her vulnerabilities. Her determination to overcome her struggles makes her incredibly relatable and inspiring. Row, the main male character, is just as endearing, second only to Zachary, who I will cherish forever. Row is gentle, loving, and fights for their love with even more passion than Cal. His heartfelt words and swoon-worthy actions toward her completely melted my heart.\n\nThe side characters added significant depth to the story. Dylan is smart, feisty, and refreshingly honest, even when her words can sting. Cal’s mom embodies the ideal mother—kind, funny, and incredibly supportive. And then there's Kieran, whom I adored! He’s clever, humorous, and seeking redemption after a past mistake in high school. I truly hope he gets his own book!"

Both characters have their flaws, yet their love for those closest to them is genuine. I appreciated LJ's twist on the typical narrative, presenting a male lead who is both a cook and a jerk, with a compelling reason for his guarded demeanor. Cal's past trauma, which she kept hidden, added depth to her character and made me empathize with her struggles. Their witty banter was delightful, and I admired Cal's refusal to tolerate Row's nonsense. Additionally, the friendship between Cal and Dylan (Row’s sister) was heartwarming; despite years of silence, they effortlessly rekindled their bond as if no time had passed.",

As an awkward millennial, I relate to her quirky personality. The grumpy male lead is another highlight; his deep love for Cal, sharp wit, and unwavering support for the women in his life—his mom, sister, and Cal—are truly endearing. Cal’s best friend, also the male lead’s sister, brings a lot of humor to the story. The dynamic between Cal and her best friend is hilarious, but my favorite moments are the witty exchanges between Cal and the male lead.",

She might even be my favorite female main character (FMC) that L.J. has written. As an awkward millennial, I totally relate to her quirky and awkward personality. Row, the grumpy male lead, is another standout. I love how deeply in love he’s been with Cal, his dirty mouth, his encouraging words, and how he’s always there for the women in his life—his mom, sister, and Cal. Dylan, Cal’s best friend and Row’s sister, adds a lot of humor to the story. The dynamic between Cal and Dylan is hilarious, but my absolute favorite is the banter between Cal and Row.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  This book is a small-town romance with the best friend’s brother trope, trauma, second chances, angst, and plenty of banter.

I don't even think twice or read reviews before picking up a book if it's by LJ Shen.

This speaks to how engaging and enjoyable her novels are.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLJ Shen's novels are consistently excellent, and this one was no exception. The only disappointment was that it had to end, leaving me eagerly awaiting her next release.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Ambrose 'Row' Casablancas is an irresistibly swoon-worthy character. He falls hard and fast, embodying patience, self-sacrifice, and unwavering support while respecting emotions and boundaries. His thoughtfulness, strong will, and fierce protectiveness make him the standout element of the book, complemented by his playful side in the bedroom. \n\nCal's quirky personality is equally charming, with her unapologetic embrace of her 90s obsession adding a delightful layer to the narrative. Her growth throughout the story is significant, largely thanks to Row's supportive presence. Initially, the chemistry between Cal and Row seemed more one-sided, with Cal's attraction rooted in lust, likely due to her unawareness of Row's feelings. However, as the story unfolds, their connection deepens, making their evolving relationship a pleasure to witness.\n\nThe side characters, including Dylan, Rhy, and Taylor, contribute humor and depth, enriching the overall reading experience."

I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning and didn’t want it to end, but by the 300-page mark, I was left confused as to why it was still dragging on. The story was overloaded with plot points, veering dangerously close to becoming a Romantic Suspense.",
            "LJ has a unique talent for crafting grumpy bad boys, and this one is no exception! Cal, a clumsy true crime enthusiast with a love for the '90s, contrasts sharply with Row, a brooding Michelin-star chef who embodies a blend of Gordon Ramsay and James Dean. Their differences create an electric chemistry that captivates. This story features a delightful mix of tropes: grumpy x sunshine, best friend's brother, childhood crush, enemies to lovers, and a slow burn. The steamy scenes are particularly memorable; they had me glancing over my shoulder to ensure no one was reading along.

From the start, he is deeply devoted to Calla, the female protagonist, who endures unimaginable trauma that leads to her androphobia and severe social anxiety. This struggle adds significant depth to her character and complicates her ability to form healthy relationships. The author excels in crafting bully love stories, and this one is no exception; the dynamic between Row and Calla is both intense and compelling.

            "The book occasionally dragged and felt longer than needed; a final round of editing could have enhanced the pacing.",
            "I adored her quirky personality and 90s obsession, as well as her comfort in her own skin. Some of her decisions were puzzling, particularly her obliviousness to Row's feelings. However, as the story unfolded, her actions became clearer, showcasing significant character growth, especially after her past traumas were revealed. Initially, I was skeptical about her choice to start a true crime podcast, perceiving her as somewhat of a loser and thinking Row deserved better. Yet, LJ Shen skillfully wove the podcast into the narrative, culminating in an impressive climax. I loved Cal; his love for her was challenging, but he navigated it flawlessly—no notes, he was perfect. The writing vividly brought the characters to life, and the side characters were true gems, adding depth to the story."

The characters, especially Row and Dot, are deeply relatable, and their journey is both heartwarming and emotional. Despite the third-act breakup trope, the story shines through its authentic relationships and heartfelt moments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐️"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Excitement and Anticipation:**  \n  - I had the paperback on preorder for a while and literally squealed when I got accepted for the ARC. Thank you to the Author Agency for it!  \n  - I absolutely LOVED all of the 90s love that this book gives.  \n\n- **Relatability and Connection to Characters:**  \n  - I am Cal, Cal is me.  \n  - The constant pining from both of them got to me, but I don’t want to get into it and post spoilers before the book is even out.  \n  - They both just say some things that the other then just... doesn't hear or comprehend?  \n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**  \n  - The banter is top-notch, as usual for Shen's books.  \n  - I highlighted quite a lot of this book, but this was one of my favorite lines: “My dad had stood out in the quaint, small town of Staindrop, Maine, like a dildo in a church.”  \n\n- **Re-readability and Future Expectations:**  \n  - I ABSOLUTELY will be reading this again at some point.  \n  - I can’t wait for the next book. I’m hoping it will be Dylan 🤞.  \n  - I enjoyed basically all of the side characters and would love to know more about them all!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute delight, filled with relatable characters, witty banter, and a nostalgic 90s vibe. The emotional pining and miscommunication between the characters added depth, and the humor was spot-on. I’m eagerly looking forward to re-reading it and diving into future books in the series, especially if they focus on Dylan or other side characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This contemporary romance explores the best friend's brother trope. The prologue takes us back several years, where the main character, the FMC, loses her virginity to the MMC during a brief encounter. Although the FMC has a fear of men, she feels safe with the MMC, only to later discover that she has always been in love with him. \n\nThe story then fast-forwards to the FMC's return home after her father's death, where she reconnects with her former best friend and the MMC. Despite his distant demeanor, the MMC harbors deep feelings for her. As the FMC begins working for him, their close proximity ignites drama related to changes in their town and her traumatic past. The narrative also includes high school rivalries and a slow-burn romance. \n\nUltimately, the FMC pushes the MMC away, only to realize her true feelings for him and seek a happy ending.",

Additionally, the reconnection with a former best friend enriches the female character's arc, adding depth to her journey.",

            "This book delves into themes of love, trauma, and reconciliation, featuring familiar tropes such as the best friend’s brother, close proximity, and miscommunication stemming from one character's unwillingness to listen. Additionally, the story includes elements of second-chance romance and drama involving other women, including a high school rival.",
            "The story centers on an emotional journey, driven by the FMC's trauma and the MMC's concealed feelings. The resolution sees the FMC recognizing her love for the MMC and striving for a happy ending. However, the reliance on the miscommunication trope may frustrate some readers."

The FMC eventually pushes the MMC away, only to realize she loves him and seeks a happy ending.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The FMC is portrayed as someone dealing with trauma and fear, which prevents her from fully embracing her feelings for the MMC. The MMC is initially grumpy and distant but is revealed to have always loved the FMC. Both characters grow throughout the story, with the FMC overcoming her fears and the MMC opening up emotionally. The reconnection with the former best friend adds depth to the FMC’s character arc.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing is described as pretty good, with a slow-burn romance that some readers may enjoy.

As they prepare to part ways—Cal heading to New York City for school and Row returning to Paris to pursue his culinary dreams—chaos erupts when Row's sister and Cal's best friend, Dylan, catches Cal giving Row her V-card. The narrative then shifts to Cal's return home after a five-year absence following her father's death.

            "One of my favorite aspects of the author's writing is their ability to create multidimensional male characters, and Row is no exception. As a celebrated chef with the world at his feet, he defies the typical playboy archetype often seen in contemporary romance. Instead, Row presents a grumpy yet fiercely protective demeanor towards Cal, which adds depth to his character. Cal's journey is particularly poignant as she battles severe anxiety and androphobia stemming from a traumatic past—an experience she has kept hidden. While Row may not fully understand her struggles at first, his instinctive protectiveness shines through. He navigates her discomfort around men with care, doing everything he can to make her feel safe and cherished.",

            "This story centers on a forbidden love trope featuring Ambrose, a conceited Michelin-starred chef, and Cal, a quirky and compassionate woman who has harbored a crush on him since middle school. The plot introduces various elements, such as a new restaurant opening, a multimillion-dollar property deal, and a violent stalker, which create layers of conflict but can feel overwhelming at times. While the blurb suggests a rekindling of an old flame, the execution leans towards the overly dramatic and exaggerated.",
            "The hero, Row, evokes Vicious from *Sinners of Saints* and effectively embodies the anti-hero archetype. Cal, the second main character, is strong-willed and holds her own, but her personality swings between childishness and guilt, which makes it difficult to connect with her. Both characters come across as over-the-top, exuding a sense of entitlement and glitzy personas that overshadow the narrative.",
            "The witty dialogues in the 84 chapters often feel forced and excessive, giving the impression of trying too hard to be clever.",

Cal had been opening up to Row, only to abruptly shut him down, which seemed out of place, especially after Row's near-death experience and his persistent attempts to express his feelings. However, the grand declaration was quintessentially Cal and had a charming 90s romcom vibe that I appreciated.",

I even felt secondhand embarrassment for him during the scene where Cal pleaded with Dylan."

I particularly enjoyed Cal’s assessments, like the objection in *While You Were Sleeping*, though I disagreed with the Titanic door scene analysis—it wasn’t buoyant enough for both Jack and Rose!  \n\n- **Character Development (Row):**  \n  Row gave me major *Vicious* vibes, which I loved since Vicious is my favorite LJ Shen character. Row is a total jerk to almost everyone except his love interest, and even with his close circle, he’s testy. He was especially harsh to Cal early on, but by the end of the prologue, it became clear why he acted that way. I even felt secondhand embarrassment for him during the scene where Cal pleaded with Dylan.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics and Conflict:**  \n  The third-act breakup felt expected and a bit annoying. Cal had been letting Row in so easily, only to shut him down abruptly. It felt silly, especially after Row’s near-death experience and his repeated efforts to prove his feelings. However, the grand “declaration” was very on-brand for Cal and had a classic 90s romcom vibe, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Series Anticipation:**  \n  I loved this book, as I have with almost all of LJ Shen’s works. I’m excited for the next book in the series, especially since LJ hinted it might not be about the expected characters. My guess would be Dylan and Kieran, or maybe Tate and Gia, given their enemies-to-lovers and rich boss/assistant dynamic. Alternatively, it could be a wildcard like Rhyland and Taylor, possibly exploring an MM or bi awakening. Regardless, I’m looking forward to it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful read, filled with nostalgia, complex characters, and classic romantic tension. While the third-act breakup felt a bit forced, the overall story and character dynamics kept me hooked. I’m eagerly anticipating the next installment in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5⭐️"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery twist in this book, which introduced a darker element to the story.",
            "Row and Cal were a delight to read. Their chemistry radiated from the pages, highlighted by their witty banter and playful insults. Cal embodies the quintessential villain—cynical and disdainful of everyone except Row. His softer side, revealed in his affection for her, was utterly charming. Row's quirky obsession with the '90s and her incessant chatter had me laughing throughout. The character development was impressive; I was thrilled when Row finally recognized that Cal was everything she desired and more. Her struggles with teenage trauma and her belief that she couldn't love anyone, even Cal, took me on an emotional rollercoaster.",

            "I appreciated that Row was the one deeply pining for Cal, and I truly felt for him as I read about his love for her and the way she unintentionally broke his heart. His grumpy demeanor around her contrasted nicely with the moments of laughter and protectiveness, showing that he still cared. Throughout the book, I felt a deep sadness for Cal. Losing her dad and hearing about her trauma was heartbreaking, especially considering her struggles with men during her high school years.",

Although it's been a while since I read anything by this author, I've always appreciated their ability to blend familiar formulas with unique storylines. While the male protagonists often share similar traits, there's always a fresh twist that keeps me coming back for more. This combination of predictability and originality makes their books consistently engaging."

I've jumped back on my darker romance book horse, so this book was exactly what I needed at this time.  \n  - It's been a bit since I've read an LJ Shen book, but something I've always loved about her books is that yes, they follow a formula and the MMCs have the same type of personalities, but there's usually something unique to the storyline that still makes me want to come back for more.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I liked that Row was the one that was pining after Cal... and pining hard. I genuinely felt bad for him when I read about how much he loved her and how much she (unintentionally) broke his heart.  \n  - When he grew into a grump around her, I liked the small snippets we got of him laughing with her or being protective. It was nice to see that he still cared.  \n  - I was sad for Cal throughout almost the entirety of this book. I felt bad that she lost her dad and then hearing about her trauma was heartbreaking. Not to mention her struggle with men throughout her high school years in particular.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  - It was nice seeing those moments of happiness when we got them.  \n  - I always know what I'm going to get with her books, but at the same time, I know that there is going to be something a little different than what I think. This was definitely one of those books.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - Overall, I do recommend this book. If you like other books by LJ, then you'll like this one, too.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book delivered exactly what I was looking for in a darker romance novel.

            "The book presents several inconsistencies, such as Row being 27 while Cal is 22 and still in ninth grade. Odd details, like the depth a chef’s knife can penetrate a butcher block and the appearance of a macabre Cambro tattoo, raise questions about plausibility. Additionally, certain scenarios, such as a 69 position with a knife wound to the gut, stretch credibility. Some elements, like a zucchini and a candy cane, feel random and lack explanation. Overall, these inconsistencies detract from the narrative's coherence.",

            "This is the quintessential grumpy sunshine book, and it delivers exactly what I hoped for. Row embodies the true grump, a \"I hate everyone except her\" type of male lead who genuinely despises everyone around him. His crotchety demeanor contrasts sharply with Cal, our vibrant heroine who embraces neon colors, adores the '90s, and radiates energy. She is sunshine personified, making this a delightful take on the grumpy sunshine trope.",
            "While the story is filled with clichés and overused phrases like \"Who did this to you?\", I found myself not caring about the cringe factor.",
            "In the opening chapters, we meet Calla (Cal), who experiences the profound loss of her father, setting the stage for the story. Her grief is portrayed with striking authenticity, resonating deeply with anyone who has lost a parent. As someone who has faced a similar loss, I found myself moved to tears within those first two chapters.",
            "I absolutely loved this book! It was such a fun read that I found myself frustrated when I had to work instead of just sitting down with it. I can't wait for book two! While there are a few potential couple options, I have a feeling it might not be the one I hope for, but I'm still excited. I adored Cal and Row, and I'm sure I'll love the next couple just as much!"

The grumpy-sunshine dynamic between Row and Cal was executed perfectly, making their characters stand out. The story was so engaging that it was hard to put down, and I’m eagerly looking forward to the next installment.",

Row is a wonderfully grumpy character who captures everyone's attention, yet his heart belongs solely to Cal, his sister’s quirky and socially awkward best friend. His obsession with her is endearing, and the thoughtful gestures he makes are incredibly sweet. Their banter and chemistry are electric, filled with tension and angst that keeps you engaged. I loved how everything ultimately comes together in the end.",

However, once we got to see his story and background, I began to warm up to him. Watching him take care of Cal made me love him.  \n  - Cal is so awkward that you can’t help but love her. At times, I wanted to shake her and tell her to demand better for herself, but her behavior fit her personality perfectly. I enjoyed watching her grow with Row’s support.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  - While Row and Cal could be hard to love at times, I enjoyed watching their relationship develop. You could feel the desire between them, but their stubbornness made it hard to see past at certain moments.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The book was a rollercoaster of emotions. The growth of the characters and their relationship was deeply moving.  \n\n- **Favorite Quotes:**  \n  - “Your broken is still the most whole thing I’ve seen.”  \n  - “The best part is right in front of me.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was great.

I had a lot of sympathy for her for about 70% of the book, but I eventually got very frustrated with her. As someone who also struggles with self-sabotage, I could relate to her initially, but my sympathy ran out as the story progressed.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics (Celibacy):**  \n  The celibacy aspect was a point of contention. I usually find it unrealistic when one character remains celibate while the other doesn’t, especially after years apart. However, in this case, it was handled in a way that felt somewhat understandable, so I was able to forgive it. While some readers seemed upset about this dynamic, it didn’t bother me as much as it usually would.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book, primarily because I liked the hero.

While she was portrayed as a kind person, her actions made her come across as selfish, a liar, and someone who could have put Row in a bad position.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Trauma:**  \n  Trauma looks different from person to person, but Cal’s behavior felt completely irrational and frustrating. Her decisions and actions seemed unrealistic and poorly justified.  \n\n- **Social Commentary (Gender Dynamics):**  \n  The \"v situation\" highlighted a real-world issue that both men and women face daily. Women sometimes lie about being drunk or use other excuses to avoid embarrassment about their choices, which can harm men and make it harder for genuine victims to be believed. This aspect of the story was thought-provoking but also frustrating in its execution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I loved Row and found her character compelling, Cal’s actions and the handling of certain sensitive topics detracted from my overall enjoyment of the novel.

Cal has secretly harbored a crush on Ro since childhood, but he has always been angsty, cruel, and seemingly untouchable. Their complicated history includes Ro's role in the fallout between Cal and his sister, Dylan.\n\nRo returns to their small hometown to open a high-end restaurant before heading to Paris, while Cal is back to care for her mother after her father's death. She seeks a job from Ro, and despite his initial reluctance, he eventually hires her. As the story unfolds, Ro's apparent disdain for Cal reveals itself to be a mix of longing and frustration. The narrative explores whether they can overcome their past and forge a new relationship or if they are doomed to repeat their mistakes. \n\nWhile the story is a slow burn, it ultimately delivers on the spice when it arrives.

It added a bold and engaging layer to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book tackled significant mental health topics, which I appreciated. However, I would recommend checking trigger warnings beforehand, especially for themes like bullying.  \n\n- **Character Age and Relatability:**  \n  The characters were in their mid-20s, which didn’t feel entirely relatable to me. This aspect slightly detracted from my connection to the story.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The bickering between the female protagonist, her best friend, and the male main character (MMC) was \"TOP NOTCH.\" It was witty, entertaining, and one of the highlights of the book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While I loved the MMC, I found the female protagonist to be childish at times, which occasionally hindered my enjoyment of her character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this New Adult Romance delivered a mix of bold romantic elements, meaningful themes, and dynamic character interactions. While the age of the characters and the female protagonist’s behavior weren’t entirely relatable or appealing to me, the witty banter and exploration of mental health topics made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐"

The dynamic between Cal and Row was enjoyable, especially their playful \"hate\" banter, with Cal expertly pushing Row's buttons, which often elicited giggles.

I can’t quite put my finger on what was different, but I didn’t enjoy it as much. It was definitely more lighthearted compared to her other works on her backlist.  \n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  I felt the book was too long, and some of the issues could have been resolved sooner.  \n- **Character Likability:**  \n  Row, the male main character (MMC), isn’t super likable since he’s supposed to be grumpy. However, his loyalty to the female main character (FMC), Cal, no matter what, was admirable.  \n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The book felt lighter in tone compared to the author’s other works. I recommend it as a holiday or Christmas read.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Unfortunately, I was not a fan of this audiobook. It’s definitely not Leigh’s best work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the loyalty between the main characters and the lighter tone of the story, the pacing and length of the book, along with the less likable protagonist, made it a less enjoyable read for me compared to the author’s other works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

Cal is quirky, struggles with anxiety, and tends to lie to please others rather than being true to herself.

While the journey was lengthy, the ending was cute and satisfying, delivering a well-deserved happily-ever-after (HEA) for Cal and Row. I enjoyed the book, but it felt unnecessarily long in parts.

The dynamic among Cal, her best friend, and Row adds depth to the story, particularly with the tension stemming from their past.",

I hoped for her growth, but her older perspective showed no improvement. She was inconsistent—claiming she could handle a casual relationship with Row, then insisting to Dylan that she could only do exclusive, only to later assert she could never give Row her heart. This erratic behavior was frustrating and hard to follow.\n\nRow wasn't much better. He tried to act indifferent, claiming he was over Cal, but it was clear he was still hurt by her actions. While this made him slightly more tolerable than Cal, his behavior still felt immature and reactive. The romantic tension between them was a mixed bag. I appreciated Row's moments of vulnerability, especially when he confessed his love for Cal, but her incredulous response of \"you love me?\" after he had already told her was infuriating.

            "This novel presents an angsty, emotional slow-burn romance between Cal and Roe, delving into themes of personal struggles, phobias, and unresolved feelings. The story unfolds over eight weeks, exploring Cal's return to her small town following her father's death and her reconnection with her former best friend, Dylan, and Dylan's brother, Roe. As they navigate their attraction and lingering tension, the narrative reveals the complexities of their shared history.",
            "Cal is a quirky, socially awkward protagonist navigating life after her father's death while trying to support her mother. In contrast, Roe is a morally ambiguous character—a once-kind, now bitterly angry chef who harbors resentment toward Cal due to their past hookup. Despite his spiteful demeanor, Roe has always been drawn to her. Both characters are flawed yet relatable, with Roe's complexity adding depth to the narrative. Their romance unfolds as a slow burn, with Cal gradually rediscovering her attraction to Roe, who struggles to resist falling for her again. Complicating matters are Roe's impending move to London and the emotional baggage they both carry. The unresolved tension between them creates a compelling dynamic that keeps readers engaged.",

As Cal stays to care for her mother, the close quarters between her and Ambrose set the stage for a compelling mix of tension and romance.",

The prolonged miscommunications and reluctance to express true feelings between Dot and Row came across as excessive and unrealistic. It wasn't until about the 70% mark that Row finally confessed his feelings, only for Dot to break up with him again for a flimsy reason, which was frustrating.",

Dot is intelligent and uniquely expressive, while Row is a handsome man who genuinely cares for her, despite her misconceptions.

However, the slow realization of Dot and Row's feelings for each other felt drawn out and somewhat implausible.

While it was a good book, it didn’t give me everything I wanted.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I enjoyed the relationship between the female main character (fmc) and her best friend more than the relationship between the fmc and the male main character (mmc). Row, the mmc, sounded lush and had an appealing \"hot chef\" vibe, but I wanted more depth from him. His chapters sometimes made me cringe, though I can’t pinpoint exactly why. I think I wanted more personality from him and less of him being overly infatuated with Cal.  \n\n- **Female Main Character (Cal):**  \n  Cal was an okay fmc—definitely not a favorite, but not offensive either. I appreciated the author’s attempt to incorporate Cal’s anxiety issues, but I felt the explanation for her struggles came too late in the book.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  I always love the enemies-to-lovers trope (it’s practically all I read), and this book had elements of that, though it leaned more into the grumpy/sunshine dynamic.  \n\n- **Author’s Strengths:**  \n  Don’t let this review discourage you from reading L.J.

Her books are usually easy romance reads with great chemistry, plenty of spicy moments, engaging storylines, and often feature the enemies-to-lovers trope.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book had its moments and was an enjoyable read overall, it didn’t fully captivate me like some of L.J.

His protective nature, always putting her first since childhood, was heartwarming. The way he shifted his demeanor when he realized he was talking to her—especially during the fight with Kieran—added depth and humor to his character.

His obsession with the female lead was both hilarious and endearing.  \n  - His quirks, like hating Gatorade but drinking it because she did, or saying he’d keep her germs as pets, made him feel unhinged in the best way.  \n  - His protective nature, putting her before himself since they were young, was heartwarming.  \n  - The way he switched his demeanor when he realized he was talking to her (e.g., during the fight with Kieran) was always hilarious and added depth to his character.  \n\n- **Character Development (Female Lead):**  \n  - I appreciated how she eventually matched his energy and embraced his quirks, showing growth in her character.  \n  - Her sentimental attachment to the taco he made her for over seven years was a touching detail that highlighted her emotional depth.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamic:**  \n  - The grumpy x sunshine trope between Row and the female lead was executed perfectly.  \n  - Their relationship felt authentic and engaging, especially with Row’s obsessive yet protective love for her.  \n\n- **Humor and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The humor, particularly Row’s over-the-top reactions and switch-ups, had me laughing out loud.  \n  - The emotional moments, like Row’s unwavering love and protection, were deeply moving.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the frustrating miscommunication trope, the book was enjoyable overall.

The moments that could have added depth often felt superficial, with characters oscillating between being enemies and friends without sufficient development. The protagonist's childhood memories, including her complicated relationship with the brother's sister—who initially resented her for being with him but later seemed to accept her—added to the confusion.

            "Cal, the quirky and endearing protagonist, is so richly developed that I found myself wanting to give her a hug. Her journey of self-discovery—understanding her identity and growth—brought a genuine smile to my face. Row, the grumpy older brother of Cal’s best friend and a renowned chef, is a deeply devoted character. His love for Dot is so palpable that I felt his heart being torn and mended throughout the story. As the male main character, Row's steady presence is incredibly compelling. The relationship between Row and Dot is both heartwarming and intense, with his devotion beautifully portrayed, leaving a lasting emotional impact.",

I adored Row’s unwavering support for Calla, which added a layer of emotional depth to the story. However, I found Row’s personality problematic.

I particularly admired Row for not giving up on Cal, which I found endearing and a highlight of the story.  \n- **Engagement:** While the story started off engaging, the repetitive nature of Cal's development made it harder to stay invested as the novel progressed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a cute and easy-to-read novel with well-developed characters, though the repetitive pacing of Cal's growth tested my patience. Row's unwavering support for Cal was a standout element that kept me invested until the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 ⭐️ | 2.5 🌶️"

The lack of engagement and connection with the main characters made it a challenging read, and I found myself more invested in a secondary character, Dylan.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars."

This allowed me to persist, albeit with difficulty.  \n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  At times, I found myself skipping entire paragraphs just to get through the story, as the pacing and length made it hard to stay fully engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel succeeded in making its point clear through repetition, the excessive length and slow pacing made it a challenging read. I only finished it due to external circumstances and often resorted to skipping parts to reach the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I appreciated how the author committed to his grumpiness without resolving it abruptly. Even though he could be quite an asshole at times, he remained likable throughout. Row was my favorite character, staying true to himself from beginning to end while exhibiting significant personal growth. His moments of vulnerability were well-timed, allowing readers to see him shed his guarded layers.\n\n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  Unfortunately, the FMC didn’t resonate with me. I found myself begging for more character development. Her lying felt excessive and, at times, illogical, which made the narrative drag in places. While she eventually recognizes her role as the heroine of her own journey and learns to confront her challenges, her obliviousness to the MMC’s feelings was frustrating.\n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The tropes were executed super well in this book! Grumpy MMC, best friend’s older brother, friends-to-enemies-to-lovers, and \"touch her and die\" were all done justice. The banter was particularly great and added to the overall enjoyment.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**  \n  The story could have wrapped up much sooner than it did. Certain parts felt unnecessarily drawn out, especially due to the FMC’s actions and decisions. However, the plot had its enjoyable moments, and the spice, while delayed, was worth the wait.\n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The spice was indeed spicy (3/5), but it took a while to kick in. When it did, it delivered, though I wished it had been introduced earlier in the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a solid read with some enjoyable moments. The MMC’s character development and the well-executed tropes were highlights, but the FMC’s lack of growth and the pacing issues held it back from being a perfect read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Romantic Comedy Style:**  \n  I LOVE L.J. Shen's comedy. She puts the \"com\" in Rom-Com. The back-and-forth comments and quick, witty one-liners make the book so enjoyable. I firmly believe she could make anything good with her banter.  \n\n- **Plot and Expectations:**  \n  The plot was interesting and not what I had expected, which surprised me, considering it wasn’t a majorly complex story. I didn’t realize this was a newer release and assumed it was an older book.  \n\n- **Character Connection:**  \n  I thought the FMC (female main character) was slightly annoying and oblivious to everything. I couldn’t connect with her, which made it harder to enjoy the story. However, the MMC (male main character) was fantastic. I would have done anything for him. I wanted him to make me pasta, feed it to me while I sipped on a glass of red wine, and then teach me a few things in the kitchen.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  I did not enjoy how the story felt a tiny bit of a drag at times. There were moments when the plot seemed to stall, like wanting to put your foot on the accelerator but not building any speed. It was frustrating, which is why it wasn’t a 4-star read for me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the pacing issues and my lack of connection with the FMC, I did enjoy the book very much. A re-read might be needed to confirm my rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book confirmed my love for chef characters and L.J. Shen’s comedic writing style. While the FMC was a bit frustrating and the pacing occasionally dragged, the witty banter and the charming MMC made it an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot a 4-star read, but very enjoyable. A re-read might help solidify the rating."

Cal's quirky personality adds charm, but her actions can be frustrating; she consistently shuts down Row's heartfelt confessions of love, even in vulnerable moments, such as when he is in a hospital bed.

He is portrayed as deeply loving and devoted, willing to move mountains for the female main character (FMC).  \n  - Cal, the FMC, has a quirky personality but her actions are frustrating.

However, this novel felt different from her usual style, and I kept waiting for that moment when everything would click into place, but it never did.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story started off strong, but it felt like a recipe missing one crucial ingredient—what could have been a delicious entrée ended up being a bit mediocre. The book felt unnecessarily long and drawn out, and my interest waned as the story progressed.\n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  I found myself wanting more from the main characters. While Bitchy and Mac had more chemistry, even their dynamic could have been more compelling. Dot and Row’s story dragged, and their chemistry felt watered down. Dot’s slow realization that Row was the gem she should never let go of was frustrating.\n\n- **Romantic Tension and Expectations:**  \n  When Dot started working at Row’s restaurant, I expected some real sparks—perhaps a slow-burn romance or fiery tension. However, we barely got two days of restaurant scenes, and by the time things started to heat up, my interest had cooled off.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Their Impact:**  \n  Dylan did her best to salvage the story, but even her efforts couldn’t save the fact that the book fell short of my expectations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential and started off strong, it ultimately felt lacking in key areas such as character development, romantic tension, and pacing. Despite some moments of chemistry and Dylan’s efforts to enhance the story, the book didn’t meet my expectations and left me wanting more.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I wanted to DNF (Did Not Finish) it multiple times, which is rare for me.  \n  - The story took too long to develop, with the main characters not getting together until around 70% of the book.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  - The characters, Cal and Row, spent most of the book circling around each other’s feelings, which felt frustrating and drawn out.  \n  - Despite the slow build, there were moments where their connection shone through, particularly in the latter part of the book.  \n\n- **Plot and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  - The book had several swoon-worthy moments that I loved, such as Row recreating her favorite discontinued childhood chocolate, buying her a ring after their first kiss, creating a recording studio for her, and Cal saving keepsakes from age 7.  \n  - However, these moments only captured my attention around 80% into the book, which was too late to fully redeem the experience.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  - I had high hopes for this book, especially since it features one of my favorite tropes and was highly recommended on TikTok.  \n  - Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations, leaving me disappointed despite the hype.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Specific):**  \n  - The narration by Teddy Hamilton was a highlight, but even his performance couldn’t fully salvage the pacing issues.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some genuinely heartwarming and swoon-worthy moments, the pacing was a significant drawback. It took too long to engage me emotionally, and the drawn-out character dynamics made it a struggle to stay invested. Despite the strong narration and a few standout scenes, the overall experience was mixed, leaving me torn between 2.5 and 3 stars.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Debating between 2.5 and 3 stars."

Her actions, such as stealing and keeping his movie ticket for years, contradict her supposed lack of awareness about her feelings.\n\nRow, on the other hand, is a character I genuinely liked. However, his unwavering obsession with Cal, despite her repeated rejections and humiliations, feels unrealistic.

I struggled to understand what he saw in Cal, as her flaws overshadowed any potential chemistry or connection between them.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The Gordon Ramsay homage was a highlight for me, adding an interesting layer to the story. However, the overall narrative didn’t fully deliver what I was looking for, particularly in terms of character growth and resolution.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  I didn’t feel emotionally invested in Cal’s journey. Her failure to earn back the trust and love of her peers made it difficult for me to connect with her or the story’s resolution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some enjoyable elements, such as the Gordon Ramsay homage, the main characters—particularly Cal—fell short for me. Her lack of growth and Ambrose’s derivative nature left me unsatisfied with the overall story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This delayed development tested my patience.  \n- **Ending:**  \n  Despite the slow pace and delayed romance, the ending was satisfying and made the effort of finishing the book worthwhile.  \n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  I seriously considered not finishing the book (DNFing) at several points due to its slow progression and lack of early romantic payoff. However, I pushed through because I wanted to see how it concluded.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was overly long and tested my patience with its slow-burn romance and unnecessary plot elements, the ending ultimately redeemed the experience. It was a challenging read, but the payoff made it worth the effort.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nSpice: 🌶🌶🌶"

I wouldn’t consider it a 5-star read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

However, it didn’t fully deliver on its promise.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was underwhelming, scoring a 2/5. It felt disjointed and lacked depth, making it hard to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was mediocre, with a 2/5 rating. It didn’t stand out and failed to elevate the story.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was slow and uneven, also rated 2/5. It dragged in places, making the story feel tedious.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were the weakest aspect, earning a 1/5. They felt underdeveloped and lacked relatability or depth.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was lackluster, scoring a 2/5. It didn’t feel compelling or believable.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The spice was minimal and uninspired, rated 2/5. It didn’t add much to the story.  \n\n- **Tropes/Features:**  \n  The story included tropes like second-chance romance, grumpy-sunshine dynamic, and workplace romance. While these could have been engaging, they weren’t executed well.  \n\n- **Themes/Content Warnings:**  \n  The book touched on heavy themes like child abuse, cheating (not involving the main characters), and descriptive bullying. These elements were handled in a way that felt jarring and unnecessary.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was disappointing. The concept had potential, but the execution fell flat in almost every aspect—plot, writing, pacing, characters, and romance. The heavy themes and tropes didn’t add value to the story, and I regretted not DNF-ing (Did Not Finish) it. I wouldn’t recommend this book or read more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Concept/Idea: 3/5  \n- Plot: 2/5  \n- Writing: 2/5  \n- Pacing: 2/5  \n- Characters: 1/5  \n- Romance: 2/5  \n- Spice: 2/5  \n- Overall Rating: 1/5"

Their development was exceptional, and even the background characters were well-written. Everything about the characters felt authentic and engaging.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  The story itself was compelling, and the author’s writing style drew me in. However, the excessive and gratuitous sexual content detracted from the overall experience. It felt unnecessary and, at times, absurd (e.g., the references to zucchini and candy canes), which ultimately ruined the story for me.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Future Works:**  \n  While this was my first book by this author, and I appreciated her talent for character creation, the over-the-top sexual content has made me hesitant to read any more of her works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI loved the characters and their development, but the excessive and gratuitous sexual content overshadowed the story and left a negative impression. As a result, I won’t be exploring more books by this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
