            "The pacing of the novel is steady, filled with enough action and unexpected twists to keep me fully engaged. The chaotic plot, featuring characters picked off one by one, heightens the suspense and propels the story forward. Surprising turns and an unpredictable narrative add to the excitement, making for an engrossing read. The tale centers around a grisly axe murder at Beechwood Castle over 25 years ago, where three teens were killed and one survived. The present-day story unfolds as six individuals receive invitations for an overnight stay at the castle, with the chance to win part of a million-dollar cash prize if they can last 24 hours on the property. This setup evokes the feel of a B-horror film, reminiscent of \"And Then There Were None,\" but with a darker focus on horror and brutal killings.",
            "The initial character setup is engaging, introducing six unlikable individuals, each with their own motivations for being at the castle. The drama among them is captivating, and the mystery of who might be an imposter heightens the intrigue.",
            "This is the third novel I've read by this author, and I've thoroughly enjoyed each one for their engaging, fast-paced, and intense narratives. The author's lighthearted style adds to the overall fun, making for an entertaining experience.",
            "While the book is labeled as a Locked-Room Mystery, it primarily functions as a Horror Thriller, emphasizing blood and gore. Its playful, over-the-top tone adds to the enjoyment, making for an entertaining read that doesn’t take itself too seriously."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The Traitors is a fun, fast-paced horror thriller with a classic setup, engaging characters, and plenty of twists and turns. It’s an entertaining read for fans of the genre, offering a mix of mystery, drama, and brutal slayings. I enjoyed the book and plan to read more from the author.",

            "The story centers on six individuals invited to spend a night at Beechwood Castle, a deteriorating mansion steeped in the grim history of a massacre from 27 years ago. The premise captivates, merging elements of a final girl narrative with a locked-room mystery reminiscent of And Then There Were None. The suspense surrounding the identity of the imposter and the reason these characters are branded as traitors adds intrigue, although the rationale behind their labeling remains ambiguous. At 270 pages, the book is a quick, entertaining read, but the pacing misses the opportunity for deeper engagement and emotional investment.",
            "The story features six characters: a true crime author, a cop, a YouTuber, an architect, a psychic, and the sole survivor of the original massacre. Although they are introduced individually, the characters lack depth, making it difficult to connect with them or grasp their motivations. Most are unlikable, leading to a diminished emotional investment in their fates and, consequently, a reduced impact when they meet their ends.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story revolves around six individuals invited to spend a night at Beechwood Castle, a crumbling mansion with a dark history of a massacre 27 years ago.  \n   - The premise is intriguing, blending elements of a \"final girl\" story with a locked-room mystery akin to \"And Then There Were None.\"  \n   - The mystery of who the imposter is and why these six were labeled as traitors adds suspense, though the reasons behind their labeling remain unclear.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n   - The six characters include a true crime author, a cop, a YouTuber, an architect, a psychic, and the final girl from the original massacre.  \n   - While introduced individually, the characters lack depth, making it hard to connect with or understand their motivations.  \n   - Most characters are unlikable, and the lack of emotional investment in their fates diminishes the impact of their deaths.  \n\n- **Suspense and Tension:**  \n   - The story maintains a certain level of tension and suspense, keeping the reader engaged.  \n   - The mystery of the imposter and the killer is compelling, though the resolution feels elusive and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n   - At 270 pages, the book is a quick and entertaining read.  \n   - However, the pacing doesn’t fully capitalize on the potential for deeper engagement or emotional investment.  \n\n- **Overall Impact and Memorability:**  \n   - While the story is intriguing, it lacks the depth and emotional resonance needed to leave a lasting impression.  \n   - The book is enjoyable but ultimately forgettable, failing to fully engage the reader or deliver a satisfying payoff.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Traitors* is an entertaining locked-room mystery with an intriguing premise and a decent level of suspense. However, its lack of character depth, emotional investment, and unclear motivations for the characters' labeling as traitors prevent it from making a lasting impact. While it’s a quick and enjoyable read, it falls short of being memorable or deeply engaging.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "The pacing in certain sections, particularly the middle chapters, could have been tighter, as the introduction of side characters and plot developments felt rushed. A more gradual integration of these elements would have enhanced the narrative flow. However, the novel excels in weaving a web of suspense, gradually unveiling the characters' hidden motives and the dark secrets that connect them. The isolated setting of Beechwood Castle heightens the sense of paranoia and isolation, creating an eerie and captivating atmosphere. As the night unfolds, strange occurrences and unsettling discoveries keep readers guessing. The intricate mystery is well-crafted, with skillfully placed hints and red herrings that maintain tension and keep readers on the edge of their seats until the very end.",
            "The characters are richly developed and complex, each possessing a unique backstory and motivation. From the enigmatic ex-con to the ambitious lawyer, they offer distinct perspectives that enhance the narrative's depth and intrigue. The author skillfully delves into themes of betrayal, guilt, and redemption as the characters confront their past mistakes and wrestle with the repercussions of their actions.",
            "Beechwood Castle, a haunting and decayed estate, is steeped in secrets and chilling history. The atmosphere is both eerie and captivating, with the author's evocative prose immersing readers at the heart of the narrative. However, while the setting is well-developed, a deeper exploration of the castle's history and its connection to the mystery would have enhanced the overall experience."

Lynch's talent for crafting intriguing characters and weaving a captivating mystery.

The reveal of the killer was frustrating and poorly executed, lacking adequate buildup and feeling like a rushed decision by the author.",

Additionally, the events of the night involve characters freely moving around the castle and its grounds, further distancing it from the locked room concept. The label of \"traitors\" for the characters is also misleading; they are flawed individuals with questionable pasts rather than true traitors."

Despite these flaws, it was a quick read that might still appeal to some readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 3 stars.  \n\nThank you Netgalley and Harper Collins UK, One More Chapter for this ARC."

            "The story unfolds at Beechwood Castle, an infamous manor in Rock Hill, Southern Indiana, site of a tragic axe murder thirty years prior. Six individuals are invited to spend the night in the house with the chance to win a share of one million dollars. This intriguing premise blends horror, mystery, and suspense seamlessly. The haunted house, replete with dark history and the threat of a killer, creates a gripping narrative. At 270 pages, it's a quick read—I finished it in under 24 hours. The pacing strikes a perfect balance between slow-building suspense and intense action, keeping me engrossed from beginning to end. The tension and suspense are expertly maintained, making it difficult to put down.",

While all are well-crafted and engaging, some characters receive more development than others. Lolly Andrews, a survivor of the initial attack, adds significant depth to the narrative. Her presence prompts intriguing questions about her past involvement and whether her invitation is merely coincidental.",
            "The author's storytelling is both gripping and immersive, filled with shocking twists, grisly murders, and unexpected surprises that kept me thoroughly engaged. The writing strikes a perfect balance between vivid descriptions and dynamic dialogue, making for a clear and captivating read.",

The setting is integral to the story's suspense and horror, with the absence of cameras and microphones, along with the enigmatic host, intensifying the unsettling ambiance that keeps both characters and readers on edge.",
            "The book adeptly weaves themes of survival, trust, and the haunting nature of the past. It offers a fresh take on the final girl trope while seamlessly blending crime fiction with horror, particularly slasher elements. This integration makes the story captivating for fans of both genres."

The characters are well-developed, and the story is filled with tension, suspense, and unexpected twists. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this book and highly recommend it to fans of crime fiction and horror. It’s a thrilling, entertaining read that I couldn’t put down.",

The surprise felt forced and unsatisfying, detracting from the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel for its intriguing premise, ominous setting, and well-paced plot. However, the disappointing resolution and unsatisfying reveal of the killer led me to lower my rating. Despite this, the book remains a compelling read for thriller enthusiasts.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe book was enjoyable but lost a couple of stars due to the disappointing resolution."

            "The narration was strong, although I found myself speeding it up at times due to some overly dramatic pauses that became a bit grating. I binged the book in one sitting, which highlights its engaging pacing. However, the ending glossed over a few connections that could have provided more clarity. The twist caught me off guard, and even Mr. B, who was listening along, didn’t see it coming. Overall, it was a fun, twisty tale with a bloody conclusion.",

            "The story features eight points of view, but at least half could have been eliminated to enhance suspense. While the characters have distinct motives, their interchangeable voices—due to the first-person narrative—make it difficult to identify who is speaking. Frequent mid-scene POV shifts disrupt immersion and lead to repetitive moments without adding new insights. A chapter from the \"hostess\" perspective feels unnecessary and diminishes potential tension. The book opens with an info-dump about each character receiving their invitation, which undermines narrative tension. Intriguing backstories, such as Staci’s mistake, Bonnie’s prison time, Lolly’s suspicions, and Rad’s fall from grace, are revealed too early, missing the opportunity to build unease. Additionally, the personalized letters found in the mansion could have heightened tension, but their impact is lost when characters immediately share their contents with one another.",
            "While the setting holds significant atmospheric potential, the book ultimately falls short in evoking any real ambiance. The mansion, intended to be a central feature of the locked-room mystery, comes off as generic and lacks importance.",

This made it hard to keep track of who was speaking.  \n   - The frequent switching of POVs mid-scene broke my immersion and caused repetitive beats without adding new information.  \n   - A single chapter from “the hostess” POV served no purpose and removed potential tension.  \n\n- **Lack of Subtlety and Over-Explanation:**  \n   - The book leaves nothing to the reader’s interpretation. Characters explicitly state their thoughts, feelings, and motives at all times, leaving no room for inference or intrigue.  \n   - Stream-of-consciousness writing feels lazy, as characters repeatedly wonder, “Who did this?? Why am I here??” without allowing the reader to feel their intrigue.  \n   - Example quotes:  \n     - “Well, this was a plot twist I didn’t see coming.” (Feels like a meta wink rather than showing genuine reaction.)  \n     - “We all looked at Penelope with shock and disgust. She truly was a vile lady.” (Characters constantly state their thoughts outright.)  \n     - “Maybe this letter will offer some answers…like why I’m here and who sent me those drawings.” (Tells rather than shows the character’s intrigue.)  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n   - Despite the atmospheric potential of the setting, the book fails to create any atmosphere.  \n   - The mansion, which should be a crucial element in a locked-room mystery, feels generic and unimportant.  \n\n- **Pacing and Exposition:**  \n   - The book opens with an info-dump about each character receiving their invitation, which kills narrative tension.  \n   - Intriguing backstories (e.g., Staci’s screw-up, Bonnie’s prison time, Lolly’s suspicions, Rad’s fall from grace) are revealed immediately instead of being drawn out to build unease.  \n   - The personalized letters inside the mansion could have been a powerful tool to ramp up tension, but they were deflated by characters immediately sharing their contents with others.  \n\n- **Editing and Technical Issues:**  \n   - The book has numerous errors, including missing punctuation, repetitive language, and awkward grammar, which should have been caught during editing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a strong premise and some intriguing elements, its execution fell flat for me.

The short, succinct chapters, especially in the second half, made for a quick and easy read.

However, by the end, I found Cornelius to be a superfluous character—his portrayal as a pervert felt repetitive and unnecessary. While I assume the characters' unlikability was intentional, I had hoped to connect with at least one of them. Unfortunately, that never happened, and I felt a sense of relief upon finishing the book and moving on from them.",

            "The first half of the book was engaging, skillfully building tension leading up to the evening at Beechwood Castle. The suspense peaked in the eerie dining room, but afterward, the story lost its momentum. Although twists were present, they felt clichéd and anticlimactic. I suspect the book's shorter length hindered the depth and impact of these crucial moments.",
            "The book presents six main characters: Staci, the internet detective; Bonnie, the psychic; Penelope, the writer; Rad, the ex-cop; Cornelius, the architect; and Lolly, the final girl and sole survivor of the 1996 murders. Told from multiple perspectives, the narrative offers glimpses into each character's thoughts. Unfortunately, the character development feels superficial, leaving me disconnected and indifferent to their fates.",
            "This book is well-written and features a clear, accessible style that makes it easy to read. However, I found the limited exploration of the setting and backstory—particularly regarding the 1996 murders—lacking, leaving me craving more depth.",
            "The story centers on six individuals invited to spend 24 hours at Beechwood Castle, a notorious murder house, each driven by their own motives, from pursuing prize money to uncovering the truth behind the 1996 murders. The castle's eerie, gothic atmosphere effectively sets the stage for the unfolding events, although I wished for more detailed descriptions of the home and the 1996 crime to deepen the setting's impact."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Traitors* is a well-written thriller with an intriguing premise and a strong start. However, the shallow character development, cliché twists, and lack of depth in exploring the setting and backstory prevented it from being a standout read for me. It will likely find an audience among newer thriller readers who enjoy fast-paced, easy-to-digest stories.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Setting:**  \n  The story revolves around six individuals who receive mysterious invitations to stay at Beechwood Castle, a famous murder house, for 24 hours. Each character has their own motives, whether it’s the prize money or uncovering the truth about the 1996 murders. The eerie, gothic atmosphere of the castle is intriguing, especially during the buildup to the night’s events. However, I felt the descriptions of the home and the 1996 crime could have been more detailed to enhance the setting’s impact.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The book features six main characters: Staci (the internet detective), Bonnie (the psychic), Penelope (the writer), Rad (the ex-cop), Cornelius (the architect), and Lolly (the final girl and sole survivor of the 1996 murders). The story is told through multiple POVs, which provides insight into each character’s thoughts. However, the character development felt shallow, and I didn’t feel deeply connected to or invested in their well-being.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The first 50% of the book was engaging, with a strong buildup to the night at Beechwood Castle. The tension peaked when the characters gathered in the eerie dining room, but after that, the story felt flat. The twists, while present, came across as cliché and anticlimactic. I suspect the shorter length of the book may have limited the depth and impact of these moments.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book is well-written, with a clear and accessible style that makes it easy to read. However, the lack of deeper exploration into the setting and backstory (e.g., the 1996 murders) left me wanting more.  \n\n- **Appeal to Target Audience:**  \n  While the book didn’t fully captivate me, I believe it will appeal to readers newer to the thriller genre. Its fast-paced nature and straightforward storytelling make it a quick, enjoyable read for those looking for an introduction to locked-room mysteries.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Traitors* is a well-written thriller with an intriguing premise and a strong start. However, the shallow character development, cliché twists, and lack of depth in exploring the setting and backstory prevented it from being a standout read for me. It will likely find an audience among newer thriller readers who enjoy fast-paced, easy-to-digest stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Premise and Setting: 3/5  \n- Characters and Development: 2.5/5  \n- Plot and Pacing: 3/5  \n- Writing Style: 3.5/5  \n- Overall Enjoyment: 3/5  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and One More Chapter Publishing for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."

            "The book features a significant twist that unveils the killer's identity and motives related to both historical and recent murders. While this twist is logical, it feels more like a gimmick than a satisfying conclusion. Six individuals are invited to a mansion for a chance to win a substantial cash prize, with the catch being that leaving means forfeiting the money. The new owner's identity and the reason for the invitations remain ambiguous. The group is a varied mix of characters, each carrying their own troubled histories and motivations. The narrative delves into their interactions and fears while chaos ensues as two guests are murdered. The first half of the book emphasizes character development and relationships, but once the murders occur, the pacing accelerates to a frantic rhythm. Unfortunately, the over-dramatic scenes and the characters' unlikability detract from the suspense, leaving the tension diminished.",
            "The characters are deeply flawed and largely unlikable, making it challenging to connect with or care about their fates. Nevertheless, their weaknesses are revealed early on, adding depth to the narrative. The group features the 'final girl' from the 1996 murders, a disgraced true crime YouTuber, a washed-up true crime author, a fraudulent psychic, a disgraced architect, and a former policeman connected to the original case.",
            "The story is atmospheric and unsettling, unfolding in an old, decaying mansion on the edge of the woods. Once the site of a gruesome axe murder in 1996, the now-vacant property has remained locked and sold for decades, providing a chilling backdrop for the unfolding events.",

            "The author spends an excessive amount of time establishing the story's context, which would be acceptable in a longer book. However, given its brevity, this extensive setup feels unwarranted. Instead of delivering a concise narrative, the author introduces a cast of six characters, two of whom could easily be omitted without impacting the plot. Additionally, there are noticeable inconsistencies; for instance, a character is initially described as thirteen during a pivotal event, only to be referred to as sixteen just two pages later.

However, the length of the book is too short to justify this extensive setup.  \n   - Instead of making it a short and snappy book, the author insists on having a cast of six people, two of which could have been cut out completely without affecting the story.  \n\n- **Tension and Engagement:**  \n   - There were some whispers of tension throughout the book, but nothing remarkable. It felt like a first draft that could have been perfected over time but was held back from reaching its full potential.  \n\n- **Consistency and Errors:**  \n   - There were noticeable discrepancies in the book. For example, at the start, a character is said to be thirteen during a central tragedy, but two pages later, she is suddenly sixteen.  \n   - Another inconsistency occurs when characters have dinner at a castle, but later, one character recalls it as lunch. These small mistakes pulled me out of a story that was already struggling to hold my attention.  \n\n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n   - I read the book to find out who the real killer was, but it didn’t matter much because I had already guessed it. I’ll always retain bragging rights for that, though.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential, it fell short due to pacing issues, unnecessary characters, and inconsistencies that disrupted the reading experience. The tension was underwhelming, and the plot was predictable, making it a disappointing read despite my hopes for the thriller genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 Stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The novel is fast-paced and kept me engaged throughout. I read it in just a few hours, and the frenzied pace of the story made it hard to put down. The tension builds steadily as the characters try to figure out who the imposter is, leading to an action-packed narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The premise is intriguing, though it feels familiar—six people are invited to a crumbling mansion in the Indiana woods with the chance to win a share of a million dollars. The catch is that gruesome, unsolved murders took place there years ago, adding a layer of mystery and danger. The story revolves around the question: \"Six people walk into the house. One of them is an imposter, all of them are traitors, which of them will survive the night?\"  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The setting is atmospheric, creepy, and gothic. The mansion is vividly described, from the bloodstained floors to the musty smell in the closed-off rooms. This adds to the overall sense of unease and tension throughout the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  We get a bit of background on each character as they receive their invites, which helps to establish their personalities and motivations. As the story progresses, the characters start to blame each other, creating friction and chaos that drives the plot forward.  \n\n- **Twists and Ending:**  \n  The ending was completely unexpected and left me stunned. It was a twist I never saw coming, and it elevated the entire reading experience.  \n\n- **Author's Skill:**  \n  The author has crafted a compelling and immersive story. I’ll definitely be looking out for more of her books in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Traitor* is a gripping, fast-paced mystery with a gothic atmosphere and a plot full of tension and unexpected twists. The vivid setting, well-developed characters, and shocking ending make it a standout read. I highly recommend it to fans of suspenseful, action-packed stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The title, which suggests an imposter and traitors among the contestants, felt misleading. I couldn’t see how anyone was a traitor or to what or whom they were betraying.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I didn’t care for the ending at all.

            "This novel presents a captivating locked-room mystery reminiscent of \"And Then There Were None.\" It follows a group of largely unlikable characters called to an abandoned mansion with a sinister past linked to multiple crimes. While the plot takes time to gain momentum, the payoff makes it worthwhile. Though the mystery's solution may stretch plausibility, it aligns with the story's framework. Despite its shortcomings, the resolution is satisfying and successfully ties the narrative together.",
            "The cast features a range of individuals tied to the mansion's history, including the original final girl, a cop who poorly handled the initial investigation, and a psychic. Although some character connections felt contrived, the overall guest list worked within the mystery's context. I found most characters unlikeable, with the exception of the final girl, the cop, and the psychic.",

The structure keeps me engaged, particularly through the gradual unveiling of each character's secrets and the overarching mystery.

Each character is intricately connected to the tragic events of 1996, including the lone survivor of that night.

This results in a pulpy and fun tone, though there are a few holes here and there.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book is pretty short, which makes it a quick and enjoyable read. Its length adds to its appeal, especially for those looking for a fast-paced story.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  It’s a gritty little whodunit, delivering a fun and engaging mystery that fits well within its genre.  \n\n- **Author Background:**  \n  The author appears to be an indie writer who gained success through self-publishing before being picked up by Harper. This background is somewhat reflected in the writing style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a fun and entertaining book, perfect for readers seeking a quick, gritty mystery. While the writing has a few minor flaws, it’s still enjoyable and worth the read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story begins with a horrific event where five teenagers are brutally murdered with an axe, leaving one survivor, Lolly, the \"final girl.\"  \n   - Years later, BeechWood Castle, the site of the murders, is purchased by a mysterious benefactor who invites select individuals to spend a night there. If they survive and follow the rules, they will receive a large sum of money.  \n   - The narrative weaves together the past tragedy with the present, as the invitees, each with their own motivations and connections to the castle, find themselves locked in and facing unexpected dangers.  \n\n- **Characters and Their Motivations:**  \n   - **Lolly:** The lone survivor of the massacre, tormented by guilt and shame, and haunted by whispers that she might have been the killer.  \n   - **Staci:** A true crime YouTuber desperate for an invite to boost her channel's ratings, who ultimately attends alone due to a conflict with her partner.  \n   - **Cornelius Jones:** An ostracized architect and peeping tom who hopes the invite will provide an escape from his troubled marriage.  \n   - **Penelope:** A struggling true crime novelist seeking to revive her career.  \n   - **Bonnie:** A medium with a sordid past and family ties to BeechWood Castle, who is wary of the invite but needs the money.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n   - BeechWood Castle serves as a chilling and ominous backdrop, sitting empty for years after the murders. Its eerie atmosphere heightens the tension as the characters are locked in and forced to confront their pasts.  \n\n- **Mystery and Suspense:**  \n   - The mysterious benefactor seems to know far more about the invitees than they should, creating an unsettling sense of being watched and manipulated.  \n   - The unresolved mystery of the original killer adds to the suspense, as the characters wonder if the murderer is among them or still at large.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The story explores themes of guilt, survival, and the lingering effects of trauma, particularly through Lolly's character.  \n   - The emotional weight of the past tragedy and its impact on the characters' lives is palpable, adding depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Traitors* by C.A. Lynch is a gripping and atmospheric thriller that masterfully intertwines past and present, blending mystery, suspense, and emotional depth. The chilling setting of BeechWood Castle and the well-developed characters with their personal motivations create a compelling narrative that keeps readers on edge. The unresolved mystery of the killer and the eerie sense of being watched add layers of tension, making this a page-turner that lingers in the mind long after the final page.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "I loved the fast pacing of the book, which made it a real page-turner. The numerous unpredictable twists kept me guessing throughout, creating a compelling mix of intrigue and ambiguity—you never quite knew whom to trust, yet you found yourself rooting for the characters. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the rushed ending; after a key revelation, everything wrapped up too quickly, leaving me wanting more. Initially, I was concerned it would mirror the TV show *The Traitors*, but it exceeded my expectations. The plot centers on six individuals invited to an abandoned house with a dark past—a murder that occurred nearly 30 years ago—and challenges them to solve the cold case.",
            "I appreciated the use of multiple points of view in the story. While I often struggle to keep track of numerous characters, each had a distinctive trait that made them memorable. The author skillfully reminded me of these traits throughout, which helped me easily follow the narrative."

However, it wasn’t. The story revolves around six people invited to an abandoned house where a murder took place almost 30 years ago. The central question is whether they can solve the cold case.  \n\n- **Character Development and Multiple POVs:**  \n  I loved the multiple points of view. Normally, I find it difficult to keep track of characters, but each one had a distinctive trait. The book subtly reminded me of these traits throughout, making it easy to remember who was who.  \n\n- **Pacing and Twists:**  \n  The pacing was fast, which I loved! It made reading the book so easy. There were so many twists and turns that I couldn’t predict what would happen next. You couldn’t trust anyone, but you also wanted to be on their side.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The only reason it wasn’t a 5-star read for me was that I felt the ending was too quick. After the key piece of the story was revealed, things tied up very quickly. I wanted more.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Genre Vibes:**  \n  This was an intense locked-room thriller that gave me *Daisy Darker*, *The Christmas Murder Game*, and *The Three Dahlias* vibes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a gripping and fast-paced thriller with well-developed characters and an intriguing premise. While I enjoyed the twists and turns, the ending felt rushed, leaving me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️)"
