            "The plot is undoubtedly my favorite aspect of this book. Two people who 'hate' each other are trapped in a house during a snowstorm on Valentine's Day. I love how their relationship evolves from \"Leave me alone, I hate you\" to \"Don't leave me alone; I'm scared, but I still hate you,\" and finally to \"I love you and can't live without you.\" Their tension and angst are amusing, even if a bit childish. I found myself laughing throughout the entire book.",
            "**Hazel:**  \n**Peter:**  \n- That man, seriously, he carries the entire book on his back!  \n- He's quiet, empathetic, kind, and a cat person.  \n- He gave Hazel incredible gifts and has an impressive bookshelf, along with various editions of Monopoly!  \n- It's clear that his trauma has shaped him, and he truly deserves the world—and me.  \n- Hazel didn't appreciate him; she always made assumptions about someone who was genuinely a cinnamon roll.",
            "This story presents a classic grumpy x sunshine dynamic, featuring the charming interplay between an extroverted girl and an introverted guy, set against a backdrop of forced proximity and a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers arc during a snowstorm on Valentine's Day. Initially, I found the writing to be decent for a rom-com, but as I progressed, I noticed it became quite repetitive and felt somewhat juvenile, reminiscent of Wattpad-style narratives. While the story was undeniably cute and hilarious in a brief format, with some light dramatic moments, certain aspects didn't resonate with me, leading to my rating of 3.5 stars."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a lighthearted, humorous, and short rom-com with a mix of cute and dramatic moments. While the writing felt repetitive and somewhat childish at times, the plot and character dynamics, especially Peter, stood out as highlights. Hazel, though occasionally annoying, added humor and energy to the story. The tropes and Valentine's Day setting made it an enjoyable read, despite some flaws.",

Overall, it's an enjoyable, fast-paced read, though the lack of plot depth leaves something to be desired.",

I struggled to see any chemistry between him and the FMC, as his feelings seemed unconvincing. His primary gesture of affection—letting her stay at his house—didn’t convey the warmth or emotion I was hoping for. Instead, his sighs and other actions felt more intrusive than endearing, making their relationship feel forced, particularly on his part. Overall, the lack of believable chemistry hindered my enjoyment of their connection.",

At first, I ended up hating Peter and finding him rude. As the story progressed, Peter was still hard to like, but I eventually warmed to him as I saw his vulnerability and understood why he is the way he is. Hazel was such a loud, opinionated woman that I wasn’t sure how they fit together or if they would get together.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The story depicts the balance between love and conflict and how unexpected people can bring out qualities you didn’t know you had.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  It was a sweet, easy read and a nice little story. If anyone fancies a cozy read, I would recommend it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a charming and cozy read with well-developed characters and a balance of love and conflict. While the pacing felt rushed at the start, the story becomes more enjoyable as it progresses, and the characters grow on you.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The heroine annoyed me from the very beginning.  \n  - The hero is portrayed as rude and unengaging, with little effort to connect with the heroine.  \n  - Both characters come across as rude, making it difficult to empathize with or care about their fates.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  - There is zero chemistry or attraction between the heroine and the hero.  \n  - The hero barely communicates, often just grunting at the heroine.  \n  - The heroine’s attempts at humor (basic jokes) are completely lost on the hero, further highlighting the lack of connection.  \n\n- **Engagement and Plot Investment:**  \n  - I found myself completely disinterested in the story and the characters.  \n  - The lack of emotional investment led me to stop reading at 31% (DNF).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel failed to engage me due to unlikable characters, a lack of romantic chemistry, and an overall disinterest in the plot. I stopped reading early because I didn’t care about what happened to either the heroine or the hero.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- DNF (Did Not Finish) at 31%.  \n- Implied low rating due to dissatisfaction with the story and characters."

            "I found it difficult to connect with the main characters, especially Peter and Hazel. By the 30% mark, I barely knew Peter's name, only recalling that he was Mari's husband's best friend. Hazel struck me as unrelatable and unlikable; her random ramblings and portrayal as a selfish, bitter friend did not resonate with me. I also found her assumptions about Peter—labeling him as rude and cold—unreasonable, particularly since her judgment stemmed from a brief, awkward interaction at a wedding."
