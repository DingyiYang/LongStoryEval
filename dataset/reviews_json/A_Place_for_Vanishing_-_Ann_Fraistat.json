The tone was consistently dark and unsettling, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Pacing and Breaks:**  \n  The story included small breaks for family bonding and cutesy romance, which added a lovely contrast to the overall tension. These moments provided a nice balance to the darker elements.  \n\n- **Themes and Moral Clarity:**  \n  The novel presented a clear moral framework: people are redeemable, the \"Baddies\" are genuinely bad, and dabbling in the occult is portrayed as a definite no-no. This black-and-white approach to horror is exactly what I enjoy.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for providing a complimentary digital copy in advance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivered a well-crafted horror experience with a strong sense of foreboding, balanced by moments of warmth and moral clarity. It aligns perfectly with my preferences for the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

This book is geared towards a younger audience, so I definitely wanted to check it out.  \n\n- **Horror/Suspense Elements:**  \n   - I liked the horror/suspense aspect of the book.  \n\n- **Mental Health Representation:**  \n   - I strongly disliked the mental health aspect of the book. As a licensed mental health therapist, it was very obvious from the onset that the author has little to no knowledge of mental health, and any research on the matter was less than subpar.  \n   - The author inaccurately portrayed Cyclothymia (Bipolar III Disorder) and looped in symptoms more aligned (barely) with Schizophrenia, based on inaccurate, stigmatized beliefs about these disorders. Cyclothymia is actually the more manageable of the bipolar mood disorders, yet the character describes experiencing the opposite.  \n   - The mom and sister interact with the main character as if she's experiencing psychosis, which has nothing to do with her \"diagnosis.\"  \n   - The portrayal of suicidal ideation and attempts was poorly written, lacking understanding or respect for those who have experienced it.  \n   - The incorrect use and description of \"night terrors\" versus \"nightmares\" and other key details showed a lack of proper research.  \n   - Trauma, overall, was poorly described and perpetuated misinformation that has plagued mental health for generations.  \n\n- **Therapist and Treatment Representation:**  \n   - The interactions with the therapist and treatment interventions were poorly researched and written, as if the author did a quick Google search and threw in whatever popped up first.  \n   - The description of the mom's trauma and her alleged interventions to interact with her daughter suffered from the same lack of research.  \n   - The portrayal of psychiatric hospitalization was inaccurate, seemingly based on TV shows or movies rather than real-life processes.  \n\n- **Author's Intent and Impact:**  \n   - I love when authors bring awareness to mental health in an informed, positive way that improves knowledge and understanding. This book is doing the opposite and is, basically, exploiting mental health to make the narrator seem unreliable.  \n   - I am very disappointed and annoyed. I am aware that if I had little or no knowledge of mental health, I might have found this book enjoyable. However, I shouldn't have to be ignorant on a topic to find it enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the horror/suspense elements of the book were enjoyable, the inaccurate and poorly researched portrayal of mental health, trauma, and treatment significantly detracted from the overall experience. The book perpetuates harmful stereotypes and misinformation, which is disappointing and frustrating, especially for someone with professional knowledge in the field.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story grabs your attention from the beginning and maintains a captivating pace throughout. However, the shift towards fantasy elements detracted from the experience for those anticipating a traditional ghost story. Additionally, the rushed ending left some plot threads unresolved, resulting in an unsatisfying conclusion.",
            "Libby, the protagonist, is a complex character navigating bipolar disorder, depression, and the aftermath of a near-tragedy. Her struggles are portrayed with authenticity and sensitivity, reflecting the author’s own experiences. The supporting characters are equally well-developed, each facing their own challenges and growth, which enriches the narrative.",
            "Set in an abandoned family home, the story envelops the reader in an unsettling atmosphere that is anything but cozy. Eerie elements like crawling insects, grotesque stained glass, and strange noises from the attic contribute to a pervasive sense of unease and mystery. This consistently dark and suspenseful setting effectively immerses the reader in a world of fear and intrigue.",
            "The novel delves into profound themes of mental illness, suicide attempts, and the struggle to regain normalcy amidst past traumas. The depiction of family relationships adds significant emotional depth, making Libby’s journey resonate powerfully. I found myself deeply invested in her struggles, feeling her fear and anxiety, which heightened my engagement with the plot.",
            "The novel masterfully intertwines horror, fantasy, and psychological drama, crafting a tone that is both grotesque and chilling. It's ideal for readers who relish a good scare, but those sensitive to insects and creepy-crawlies may find certain scenes unsettling."

        "conclusion": "This is a well-crafted young adult novel that straddles the line between horror and fantasy. It excels in creating a dark, unsettling atmosphere and developing complex, relatable characters. While the exploration of mental health and family dynamics adds depth, the shift toward fantasy and the rushed ending may not appeal to all readers.

            "The author skillfully weaves several themes into the narrative, enhancing the story's authenticity. Libby, the protagonist, navigates a recent Bipolar III diagnosis, portrayed accurately through her symptoms, medication, and effective coping strategies. The motif of masks linked to the house plays a crucial role in the unfolding magic and monsters within it. The synopsis captures this duality: \"We all wear masks—to hide our imperfections, to make us stronger and braver. But if Libby keeps hers on for too long, she might just lose herself—and everyone she loves.\" This theme resonates throughout the entire story.",

It presents a haunted house narrative filled with spirits, mediums, and seances, but offers a fresh and thoughtfully crafted perspective on the genre.",

Libby, the MC, was dealing with a recent Bipolar III diagnosis that was represented very well, with her symptoms, meds, and constructive ways to help deal with the illness.  \n   - The concept of masks attached to the house was imperative to the magic (or monsters) of the house. From the synopsis: \"We all wear masks—to hide our imperfections, to make us stronger and braver. But if Libby keeps hers on for too long, she might just lose herself—and everyone she loves.\" This served a dual meaning and carried throughout the entire story.  \n\n- **Unique Elements and Execution:**  \n   - The bugs!

            "The story follows Libby, who returns to her mother’s ancestral home seeking a fresh start after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and surviving a suicide attempt. As she settles in, Libby uncovers the house’s dark history and suspects that the insect masks attached to the windows hold the key to the truth. The theme of masks permeates the narrative, symbolizing both the façades people adopt to conceal their flaws and the literal insect masks that house spirits and bestow supernatural powers. With a gripping and well-paced storyline, the book keeps readers on the edge of their seats, gradually building tension that culminates in a dramatic and satisfying climax.",
            "The characters in this story feel both authentic and deeply flawed, particularly Libby, whose bipolar disorder is portrayed with respect and compassion. Her struggle with mental health adds significant depth, elevating the narrative beyond mere horror. The character and world-building are exceptional, creating a steady tension that culminates in a gripping final séance.",
            "This novel is a haunting and atmospheric gothic horror that masterfully incorporates elements like a haunted house, séances, and ghosts. The house itself is chilling, marked by decades of decay, an infestation of creepy crawlies, and unsettling stained glass windows featuring insects and disturbing imagery. The setting is pivotal in creating tension and unease, enhanced by the house's sinister history of masked séances and mysterious disappearances.",
            "I am thoroughly impressed with this book and eagerly anticipate reading more from the author in the future. I'm excited for its publication on January 14, 2024, and I extend my gratitude to the publisher for providing a digital advance reader copy."

        "conclusion": "This gothic horror novel is a masterful blend of eerie atmosphere, compelling characters, and a multi-layered plot that keeps readers engaged from start to finish. The respectful and compassionate portrayal of mental health issues adds depth to the story, while the central theme of masks—both literal and metaphorical—provides a rich and thought-provoking narrative. The tension builds steadily, culminating in a thrilling climax that leaves readers eager for more from this talented author.",

It’s rare for horror books to give me the creeps, but this one succeeded perfectly.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was engaging and well-structured, earning a solid 4 out of 5.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The setting was decent but not particularly standout, scoring a 3.5 out of 5.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were somewhat underdeveloped for my taste, resulting in a 3 out of 5.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing felt a bit off at times, which affected my overall enjoyment, leading to a 2.5 out of 5.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was satisfactory but not particularly memorable, earning a 3 out of 5.  \n\n- **Genre Execution:**  \n  The book excelled in delivering a strong horror experience, scoring a perfect 5 out of 5 for its genre.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was solid but not exceptional, with a score of 3.5 out of 5.  \n\n- **Vibe/Atmosphere:**  \n  The overall vibe and atmosphere were decent, contributing to a score of 3.4 out of 5.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s younger YA tone made it harder for me to connect with the characters, I appreciated its exploration of mental health and its exceptional horror elements.

Overall, it’s a solid read, especially for fans of the horror genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot: 4  \n- Setting: 3.5  \n- Character: 3  \n- Pacing: 2.5  \n- Ending: 3  \n- Genre: 5  \n- Writing: 3.5  \n- Vibe: 3.4  \n- Overall: 3.6 (rounded up to 4)"

However, the story could have benefitted from a deeper exploration of Flynn as an individual, beyond his role as a medium and his ties to the House of Masks. Ultimately, the narrative revolves around Libby, Vivi, and their mother striving to achieve what their ancestors could not—surviving the house.",

The descriptions were phenomenal and even made me gag a few times, adding to the unsettling atmosphere.  \n\n- **Character Development (MC):**  \n  I loved that the main character had a mental health issue that isn’t often discussed in literature. It was refreshing to see this representation, especially since the author shares the same diagnosis. The way this was woven into the horror, blurring the lines between what was real and what wasn’t, was masterfully done.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  The story had a few too many spirits, which made it a bit hard to keep track of everything. However, this didn’t detract too much from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The small side romance was a sweet addition and provided a nice break from the intense paranormal elements.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Author’s Skill:**  \n  I would 10/10 recommend this book to anyone who can handle the creepy crawlers. The author’s skill in crafting such a unique and immersive paranormal story is undeniable, and they’ve definitely become a go-to author for me moving forward.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout in the paranormal genre, blending horror, mental health representation, and a touch of romance into a gripping and unsettling story. Despite a slightly overwhelming number of spirits, the phenomenal descriptions and unique premise make it a must-read for fans of creepy, atmospheric tales.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n10/10 recommend."

            "The story took a sudden and disappointing turn with the introduction of hallucinations and the concept of characters transforming into the bugs of their followers. This shift felt rushed and poorly executed, leading to a significant slowdown in pacing that rendered the narrative disengaging. I ultimately stopped reading at the 46% mark. \n\nThe book initially showed promise, centered around a mother and her two daughters, aged 16 and 13, returning to the mother's childhood estate. The premise was intriguing, particularly with the older daughter's struggles with bipolar disorder and severe depression, raising questions about their nature. The discovery of insect-themed designs in every window of the mansion added an eerie and mysterious element to the story.",
            "Vivi, a captivating 13-year-old, is enthralled by butterflies, a passion that resonates with the insect-themed decorations in her window. The nickname \"House of Masks,\" linked to the girls' grandmother, suggests deeper secrets and hints at a rich backstory waiting to unfold.",
            "The book heavily focused on sci-fi thrills, which didn't align with my personal preferences. I encountered similar issues in the author's previous work, *What We Harvest*, which I also found difficult to finish."

            "The story had notable gaps, especially regarding Libby's suicide attempt. I wished for a deeper exploration of her motivations beyond the embarrassment from the play, as it seemed there was an untold depth to her experience. I appreciated that the romance between Flynn and Libby didn't overshadow the central themes of the house and the masks; it remained a subtle but meaningful part of the narrative.",

Her emotional journey, particularly her yearning for escape, deeply resonated with me. While Vivi’s character introduced a minor flaw by making Libby feel guilty about her suicide attempt, I found myself wanting more insight into their relationship, especially the shift from their happy childhood memories to the aftermath of the play.",
            "Review:  \nThe house was both fascinating and visually captivating, filled with eerie and disturbing elements. Features like the oversized closet, turret space, attic, Libby’s room with the skylight, and the strikingly dark windows and 3-D masks drew me in. The story’s vivid imagery, including the unsettling picture of mosquitos feasting on sheep, the unsettling noises from the attic, the shadowy figures near the stone table, and the transformations of characters like Flynn and Mom, established a haunting and immersive atmosphere.",

I enjoyed imagining the potential powers of other masks, such as the house fly mask for healing or the cockroach mask for invincibility. The blend of insect-human creations and the haunting beauty of scenes, like Vivi's aerial ballet amidst butterflies, adds a distinctive and imaginative layer to the story."

I found the development of these familial bonds more impactful than the romance subplot.\n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**\n   - I recommend *A Place for Vanishing* to readers who enjoy haunted house stories with rich character development. The book masterfully balances reality and the supernatural, creating a chilling and captivating atmosphere.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*A Place for Vanishing* is a haunting and gripping novel that combines mental health themes, family dynamics, and supernatural intrigue. With its immersive setting, strong writing, and well-developed characters, it offers a chilling and enthralling reading experience. While I cannot speak to the accuracy of its mental health representation, the book excels in storytelling and atmosphere.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "I was greatly impressed by the way the author developed her characters, especially Libby and Flynn. Flynn's perspective resonated with me: \"I never wanted anything normal. Normality is... For me, normality is a lie. And this is the truth.\"",

Choć to horror skierowany do młodzieży, nawet tacy wrażliwcy jak ja mogą się przestraszyć. Dlaczego nikt wcześniej nie powiedział mi, że młodzieżowy horror może być tak fascynujący? A już zwłaszcza, że festiwal gotyckiego klimatu może mnie tak zafascynować! Blisko 500 stron czystego mroku, grozy i elektryzującej ekscytacji."

Tension builds steadily throughout the narrative, culminating in a powerful revelation about the spirits and the house’s dark history. The story centers on Libby, a newly diagnosed bipolar teenager, and her family, who move into a seemingly haunted home seeking a fresh start. The house, infested with bugs and steeped in a century-old history of disappearances, becomes the focal point of Libby’s determination to uncover its secrets, particularly the enigmatic bug-shaped masks scattered around the property. Additionally, the house’s former owner was a medium who conducted seances, and Libby’s mother shares a mysterious connection tied to her own parents' disappearance in their childhood.",

The underlying tension and silence between them intensify her feelings of rejection and isolation. Libby’s mental health struggles, particularly her cyclothymia diagnosis (which she describes as bipolar III disorder), are depicted with noteworthy sensitivity. In the second half of the book, we witness Libby’s growth as she discovers her inner strength, her will to live, and the profound love she holds for her family.",

            "The house in the story is truly enigmatic, and I enjoyed accompanying Libby on her quest to uncover its mysteries and the fates of its previous inhabitants, including her own family. However, I found the book slightly too lengthy; although it laid intriguing breadcrumbs to maintain my interest, the pacing often lagged, only gaining momentum towards the end. Despite this, I believe the payoff was ultimately rewarding, even if the story could benefit from some trimming.",
            "One aspect that both intrigued and concerned me was the plot's inciting incident: Libby's bipolar III diagnosis. While I was unfamiliar with this condition, having only known about bipolar I and II, it sparked my interest to learn more. However, I had reservations about the potential for mental health issues to be exploited in horror narratives. Fortunately, this did not occur; Libby’s character is portrayed with depth and authenticity, reflecting the complexities of mental health. From my general understanding of mental health care, the treatment is depicted with compassion and sensitivity.",
            "Having thoroughly enjoyed the author’s previous work, I eagerly anticipated her next release, *A Place for Vanishing*. This novel captivated me from the start, delivering all the elements I seek in Gothic horror, particularly a haunted house steeped in history. The atmospheric prose effectively conveys the setting's claustrophobia, while vividly depicting the unsettling presence of bugs and other horrors."

The prose is atmospheric, capturing the claustrophobic nature of the setting perfectly, not to mention the visceral nature of the bugs and other horrors at play.  \n\n- **Characterization and Mental Health Representation:**  \n  One aspect that both intrigued and worried me was the inciting incident for the plot being Libby’s bipolar III diagnosis. On the one hand, I had never heard of this particular condition, only being familiar with bipolar I and II, so I was intrigued to learn a bit about it. However, there was a part of me that worried about how mental health issues could be weaponized against the mentally ill person in horror books. This did not happen, though, as Libby’s character felt nuanced and believable for someone dealing with mental health issues. The treatment is, from my basic understanding of mental health care on a general level, pretty compassionately depicted.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The house was a real enigma, and I enjoyed following Libby as she attempted to unravel it and figure out what happened to previous inhabitants of the house, including members of her family.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  I did think the book was a tad too long, and while the story laid breadcrumbs fairly well to keep my interest, the pacing lagged throughout, with it really only picking up at the end. While I do think it could be trimmed somewhat, I did feel the payoff was worth it either way.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  This was a more or less enjoyable read, and I’d recommend it to readers looking for an immersive, if slow-paced Gothic horror story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Place for Vanishing* delivers an atmospheric and immersive Gothic horror experience with a nuanced portrayal of mental health and a compelling mystery.

            "While the story offers glimpses into the past of a couple of characters and their entanglements with fate, I wish we had the opportunity to explore more of the others. Ultimately, the narrative centers around a paranormal mystery that is heavily populated with bugs. If you're squeamish about insects, this may not be the book for you, as I cannot emphasize enough the sheer volume of bugs and their various appendages throughout the text.",
            "Libby's journey in *The House of Masks* is fraught with challenges, and while she emerges stronger, she is far from magically fixed. I deeply resonated with her mental health struggles, particularly how they manifest differently during adolescence compared to later stages of life. As an adult with children of my own, I found the dynamic between Libby and her mother particularly revealing. Libby often overlooks her mother's potential mental health issues, which feels painfully realistic. Witnessing her mother's struggle to maintain composure while losing herself struck a powerful chord with me.",
            "APFV is masterfully written, allowing readers to vividly immerse themselves in The House of Masks. The atmosphere is both eerie and enchanting, creating a uniquely captivating experience. Despite moments that are unsettling or grotesque, the narrative beautifully balances these elements with heartwarming themes.",
            "This book offers an outstanding representation of mental health, beautifully capturing the themes of friendship, young love, and families reconnecting. It's refreshing and essential, especially for young readers who need to understand that they are complete and worthy, even when they require medication or other forms of support.",
            "Weeks later, I find myself reflecting on the book—not just on the main character, but also on her mother and the subtle depth woven throughout the story. Reading APFV evoked many of the same emotions I experienced in my youth. I can’t emphasize enough how expertly everything was handled."

        "conclusion": "*A Place for Vanishing* is a beautifully written, atmospheric novel that masterfully balances creepiness with heartwarming themes of friendship, love, and family. The mental health representation is handled with care and authenticity, making it a deeply relatable and impactful read. While the abundance of bugs might not be for everyone, the story’s emotional depth and well-crafted characters make it a standout book that lingers in the mind long after reading.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The book offers a fascinating twist on a haunted house story, incorporating elements like creepy masks, seances, ghosts, possessions, and an overwhelming number of bugs. The heart of the novel lies in its exploration of family drama, as the main character readjusts to life with her mother and younger sister in a new house after a suicide attempt. This is portrayed with painful honesty, showcasing the rebuilding of relationships on increasingly unstable ground as the home becomes more dangerous.  \n\n- **Representation and Diversity:**  \n  The novel excels in diverse representation, particularly in its portrayal of mental illness (Bipolar III) and an aroace character. While the aroace representation isn’t a major part of the plot, it is appreciated and adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n  The story is executed with skill, blending supernatural elements with raw, emotional family dynamics. The balance between horror and emotional depth is well-maintained, making it an engaging read even for someone who typically doesn’t gravitate toward this genre.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite being outside my usual genre preferences, I found the book enjoyable and worthwhile. The unique blend of horror and family drama, along with the strong representation, made it a compelling read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout for its unique take on the haunted house trope, its honest portrayal of family dynamics, and its strong representation of mental illness and aroace identity. It’s a worthwhile read for anyone intrigued by these elements, even if it’s not typically their preferred genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story's fast pace effectively enhances its horror elements but often sacrifices depth in exploring its heavier themes.",

            "This standalone YA novel offers a swift narrative enriched with elements of low fantasy and supernatural horror. While it evokes gothic vibes, the story leans more towards outright horror, presenting themes such as mental health, attempted suicide, body horror, and unsettling imagery, including pervasive insects. Its heavy and nuanced content regarding mental health and suicide can feel exploitative and excessively bleak. The tone exudes angst, creating a tension that may seem simplistic for adult readers while being too intense for the typical YA audience."

        "conclusion": "While *A Palace for Vanishing* has some enjoyable supernatural horror elements and a fast-paced narrative, it falls short in its handling of sensitive topics like mental health and suicide, which felt exploitative and overly depressing. The unlikable protagonist and flat romance further detract from the story. The book’s tone and content make it difficult to pinpoint a suitable audience, as it feels too heavy for YA readers yet too simplistic for adults.

The premise of a mysterious old house that the family moved into intrigued me, especially with the mom keeping secrets about the house.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  As the story progressed, I lost interest. The plot became too far-fetched, and I found myself frustrated with the mom’s decision to ignore the dangers and keep her kids in the house.  \n\n- **Execution of Themes (Bugs):**  \n  The portrayal of the bugs was overwhelming and not what I expected based on the summary. It felt excessive and detracted from my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  The book was hard to finish, and my initial interest waned as the story unfolded.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started with an intriguing premise, the plot became too unrealistic, and the excessive focus on the bugs made it difficult to stay engaged. Despite my initial interest, I struggled to finish the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Flynn's discovery of his true abilities as a medium adds significant depth to both his character and the narrative.",

My favorite moment was when Libby recognized the reasons behind her mom and sister's distance, as this realization allowed her to heal and understand the broader impact of her actions.",
            "I was truly impressed by this book. As a YA novel, it had me on the edge of my seat with a sense of terrified anticipation. The depictions of bugs were disturbingly vivid and unsettling—definitely not for the squeamish.

For a YA novel, it kept me on the edge of my seat in terrified anticipation.  \n   - The bugs were incredibly vivid and unsettling. If you're squeamish, I don't recommend it.  \n   - The visceral response some scenes evoked was insane—I felt like I had to double-check that I didn’t have bugs on me.  \n\n- **Character Development (Libby):**  \n   - I loved seeing Libby grow as a person and gain self-confidence after her attempted suicide.  \n   - It was important not to shy away from her struggles and to take the reader along as she reconstructed her life and worldview.  \n   - I appreciated how the book showed her dealing with the aftermath of her actions and the effects on her mother and sister, ViVi.  \n\n- **Relationships and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - As a reader, it was hard to see the strain in Libby’s relationships with her family, and my heart yearned for her as she tried to repair them.  \n   - My favorite part was seeing Libby identify why her mom and sister were acting distant, which helped her heal and understand the broader impact of her actions.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot (Flynn):**  \n   - I loved the addition of Flynn and how he helped Libby heal while dealing with his own demons.  \n   - However, I didn’t think the romance was necessary and would have preferred them to remain friends. It felt like the romance was included because all YA novels seem to require one nowadays.  \n\n- **Mental Health Representation:**  \n   - I liked that mental health was featured in a horror book and played a significant role.  \n   - As someone without professional expertise or personal experience with this specific disorder, I can’t comment on the accuracy of the representation. I recommend looking up reviews from individuals with firsthand experience for a better judgment.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The storyline was intriguing and fast-paced, with excellent paranormal elements.  \n   - The vivid depictions of the house, especially the creepy imagery of the kitchen floor, will stay with me for a long time.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - I really liked the ending and the family’s decision to stay. It felt like a huge step in their growth and a powerful statement about facing challenges instead of fleeing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis YA horror novel was everything I could have asked for—intense, emotionally resonant, and filled with vivid, unsettling imagery. While I appreciated the focus on mental health and character growth, the romance subplot felt unnecessary. The ending was satisfying and symbolized significant growth for the characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Fraistat built the tension and mystery around the house so well, and the complicated family dynamics introduced in the aftermath of Libby's attempt and bipolar III diagnosis kept my interest in the story. I also really liked the descriptions of the house and the rooms—they always gave the ick vibes that fit the setting perfectly.  \n\n- **Weaknesses in the Romance:**  \n  I didn't like the romance. Flynn, the love interest, is crucial to many things that happen throughout the book, but the romance between him and Libby felt weird and lacked any chemistry to me.  \n\n- **Disappointment in the Mystery Reveal:**  \n  The reveal of the mystery was also a disappointment. The tension became straight-up paranormal horror. It should have worked for me, but after it, I felt myself growing more detached from the story. I was skimming to get to the end, which seemed hastily thrown together after the action-packed climax. I wish the plot let itself breathe a bit more rather than rush like it did.  \n\n- **Overall Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The strong beginning gradually became mid as it went on.  \n\n- **Future Interest in the Author's Work:**  \n  I think I will still follow Fraistat's coming works, just in case something else of hers catches my liking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book started strong with excellent tension, mystery, and family dynamics, but the weak romance, disappointing mystery reveal, and rushed ending detracted from the overall experience.

Flynn adds depth as a supporting character, and I appreciate that any romantic elements remain secondary to the central mystery.",

The Victorian house, charmingly dilapidated, features peculiar blue roses and insect-themed stained glass windows adorned with insect masks. Although it has good bones, the house has suffered decades of neglect, evident in its faded, peeling insect-patterned wallpaper and boarded-up windows.

This YA horror novel incorporates a variety of elements: a creepy house, mystery, séances, and an abundance of bugs. Even if you've read books with similar themes, this one stands out as unique.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - The setting is a perfect backdrop for a gothic horror story. The house initially appears charmingly dilapidated, with its strange blue roses and insect-themed stained glass windows featuring masks of insects. Despite its crumbling state, the Victorian house has good bones but has been neglected for decades. The faded, peeling bug-patterned wallpaper, boarded-up windows, and the presence of various insects despite fumigation add to its eerie atmosphere. The attic rooms produce weird noises, and the grandparents' bedroom door remains oddly locked, heightening the sense of mystery.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - Libby's character is portrayed with visceral emotions, lending credibility to her portrayal. The author strives to present an honest depiction of mental illness, particularly bipolar disorder, and its impact not only on the individual but also on their loved ones. Libby's relationship with her younger sister, Vivi, evolves and thrives throughout the story. Flynn serves as a great supporting character, and I appreciate that any romantic elements take a backseat to the central mystery.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**\n   - The novel doesn't give readers much time to breathe. Strange events begin almost immediately and escalate rapidly. Initially, the changes are extraordinary and bewitching, but as the story progresses, the creepiness and sense of wrongness intensify. The horror is more paranormal than traditional ghostly scares, with plenty of body horror to keep readers engaged. And, of course, there are lots and lots of bugs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA Place for Vanishing is a compelling YA horror novel that combines a creepy setting, well-developed characters, and a fast-paced plot. The unique elements, such as the insect motifs and the honest portrayal of mental illness, set it apart from other books in the genre. Ann Fraistat has crafted a story that is both eerie and emotionally resonant, making it a memorable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The creepiest part for me was their mom slowly being lost to madness as the spirits took over.  \n\n- **Character Representation and Relatability:**  \n  I’ve never read a book where the protagonist had bipolar disorder, so I enjoyed the unique perspective of Libby.
