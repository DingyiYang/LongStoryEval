            "**Review:**\n\n*Fast & Dirty:* The plot was illogical and confusing, with elements like stalking, a forced relationship, and a sudden threesome that felt out of place. Overall, the narrative lacked coherence. \n\n*Brodie's Promise:* The story began promisingly but quickly became inconsistent, plagued by miscommunication, impulsive breakups, and manipulative behavior. Additionally, the writing style suffered from abrupt scene changes that disrupted the flow.\n\n*My Funny Valentine:* I realized too late that this was part of a series, which may have provided necessary context.\n\n*Brodie's Promise:* I’m intrigued by Maddox and Alex’s potential storyline, but I’m uncertain if it’s worth continuing the series.",
            "**Reclaiming His Soulmate:** I enjoyed the story's simplicity and the club's special night but felt a deeper resolution was needed after the chapters of conflict. \n\n**No Perfect Beginning:** The sweet dynamic between Declan and Marisol was delightful, but the abrupt ending left me wanting more. Carter's unresolved best man request felt like a missed opportunity. \n\n**Final Destination:** I appreciated the instant connection between the characters and the light deception that ultimately strengthened their relationship. \n\n**Roomies:** The sexual tension and the \"he falls first and hard\" dynamic were engaging, though I expected more depth in certain scenes. \n\n**My Funny Valentine:** The character development was impressive, but I found Finn's obliviousness to the heroine's abusive past frustrating. Giovanni offered some hope despite his mood swings. \n\n**Saving Abby:** I liked the chemistry between Drake and Abby, but the timing of the proposal felt inappropriate given her uncle's recent death.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The story is a steamy romance involving a love interest between a woman and two men. I enjoyed the overall plot and how it was written, but I would have preferred it to focus on a relationship with just one man instead of both.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The connection between the characters felt unrealistic, primarily relying on love at first sight and numerous steamy scenes. This lack of depth in their relationships made it harder for me to fully engage with the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the writing style and the steamy romance elements, the unrealistic character dynamics and the inclusion of a love triangle detracted from my overall enjoyment. I would have preferred a more focused and believable relationship development.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
