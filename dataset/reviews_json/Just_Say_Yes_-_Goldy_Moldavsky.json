            "The ending of this story is both perfect and satisfying, tying everything together in a way that feels realistic yet romantic. The line, “I’ll hate myself if I don’t marry you,” truly resonated with me, leaving me both emotional and happy. The premise is unique and engaging: a 17-year-old girl from Peru living in New York discovers she’s undocumented and decides to marry an American to secure her future. While the plan may seem absurd, it unfolds in an entertaining and thought-provoking manner. The plot is filled with humor and lighthearted moments, particularly as Jimena navigates her dates and schemes. Overall, it’s a fun, fast-paced read that kept me hooked from beginning to end.",
            "Jimena, the main character, embodies a charming naivety and makes questionable decisions, yet she remains endearing and relatable. Her determination combined with vulnerability makes her an engaging protagonist. Vitaly, her best friend, truly shines as a character. His unwavering support for Jimena, even as he aids her in her wild plans, is both heartwarming and commendable. Their dynamic is one of the book's highlights, and I found myself rooting for them to become a couple from the start. The romantic tension between Jimena and Vitaly is beautifully crafted; their playful banter and Vitaly's subtle gestures of care—such as standing guard during her dates—add significant depth to their relationship.",
            "This book is a delight to read, featuring an engaging and conversational writing style that made it hard to put down. I finished it in just a few hours! The pacing is excellent, striking a perfect balance of humor, drama, and romance that propels the story forward without feeling rushed.",
            "This story resonated with me, particularly the notion that beauty often emerges when we’ve lost faith in fairy tales. I connected with the experience of wanting to give up, only to be pleasantly surprised by something wonderful. Jimena's emotional journey felt authentic and moving, especially her struggles with her undocumented status and her determination to create a better future."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book was a delightful and emotional read that combined humor, romance, and a unique premise. The characters, especially Jimena and Vitaly, were well-developed and easy to love, and the ending was absolutely perfect. It’s a story that reminds you to believe in the unexpected, even when life feels overwhelming. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a heartwarming and entertaining novel.",

Although I can’t relate to her drastic decision to marry for citizenship at just 17, her character is both relatable and well-developed.

While their banter is delightful, I felt their backstory could have been explored more deeply, especially early in the book.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  Jimena’s initial plan to marry Vitaly is quickly dismissed due to his own future plans, but their evolving relationship adds depth to the story. Vitaly’s protective nature, as he accompanies Jimena on her disastrous dates, creates a charming dynamic between the two.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The book is described as \"cute\" and balances humor with serious topics effectively. The tone remains lighthearted despite addressing significant issues, making it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a cute and engaging read that skillfully blends humor with important social themes. While I wished for more backstory between Jimena and Vitaly, their interactions and the novel’s exploration of immigration and relationships made it a memorable story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Vitaly was a standout character who encouraged Jimena's growth, and vice versa.

Blue's character, on the other hand, felt frustrating as his identity centered exclusively around activism, which ultimately added little to the narrative.",

While some moments, like critiques of Republicans, felt heavy-handed, the political commentary was less pronounced than anticipated.

This YA novel genuinely resonates with its teen audience, and I appreciated that.",

After reading *Just Say Yes*, I’m eager to explore her other works, as this book has set a high standard for her storytelling.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n   - The novel is cute, romantic, and funny, but it doesn’t mock or trivialize the hardships faced by Jimena and her mother as undocumented immigrants.

Her personality makes her relationships with other characters incredibly fun to read, and it’s impossible not to root for her success, even when her choices seem ridiculous at first glance. These choices, however, reflect her desperation to avoid deportation and the fear and anxieties that come with her situation.  \n\n- **Setting and Nostalgia:**  \n   - I thoroughly enjoyed the 2009 setting, which felt like a fun throwback while still being relatable for modern teens. The book captures the essence of that time without feeling outdated.  \n\n- **Authenticity of Teenage Characters:**  \n   - The characters felt like real teenagers, even amidst serious situations, which made the story refreshing and authentic. It’s a YA novel that truly feels like it’s meant for teens, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n   - If you’re wondering whether to read *Just Say Yes*, this is your sign to pick it up. Even if you weren’t planning to, I highly recommend giving it a try or sharing it with a teen in your life. It’s a book worth getting into the hands of young readers, and I’d love to see it in local libraries.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Just Say Yes* is a delightful, heartfelt, and humorous novel that balances romance and serious themes with authenticity and charm. Jimena’s story is both entertaining and impactful, making it a must-read for fans of YA fiction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot lacks tension, as solutions come too easily to Jimena without significant compromise. The ending is unsatisfying and poorly resolved; Vitaly’s abrupt proposal and the epilogue feel rushed and unrealistic, disregarding established conflicts such as his plans for Oxford and his family dynamics.",
            "Jimena's character lacks realism. Despite being undocumented, she navigates life with surprising ease. At just 17, she is stunningly beautiful, has supportive friends, a lenient mother, and enough money to dine out daily. Her reactions to potential solutions—such as resorting to violence against a man offering marriage for a green card or panicking over a marriage of convenience—come across as overly dramatic and inconsistent with the situation's stakes.",
            "The tone of the story is inconsistent, as Jimena’s angst and melodrama often overshadow the serious themes surrounding her undocumented status. The humor and romantic elements clash with the weight of the subject matter, resulting in a narrative that feels somewhat unserious.",
            "The pronunciation of \"Vitaly\" as \"Big Rally\" is incorrect in Russian; it should sound more like \"Big Folly.\" The mid-2000s setting is poorly executed, relying excessively on brand mentions—such as Juicy tracksuits and Usher—rather than establishing an immersive atmosphere. These constant references come off as blatant product placement, ultimately detracting from the story.",
            "The story presents an intriguing premise, with characters facing unique situations. The nostalgic setting adds a personal touch, making it feel deeply connected to the author's experiences."

        "conclusion": "While the book had potential with its interesting premise and nostalgic setting, it ultimately fell short due to unrealistic character behavior, a lack of meaningful conflict, and a poorly resolved ending. The clumsy handling of the 2000s setting and cultural inaccuracies further detracted from the story. This book was disappointing enough to make me hesitant to read more from the author.",

            "The story is engaging and well-paced, skillfully balancing heavy and light moments. While the epilogue raises some open-ended questions that may leave readers wanting more closure, the penultimate chapter offers a satisfying and heartwarming conclusion to Jimena and Vitaly’s journey.",
            "Jimena, the 17-year-old protagonist, navigates her complex circumstances with a refreshingly realistic portrayal. Her attempts to resolve her undocumented status often come off as impulsive and misguided, underscoring her youth and inexperience. However, her evolution throughout the story is compelling; she shifts from anger and confusion to a profound appreciation for her mother's sacrifices and the broader implications of her situation.\n\nVitaly, Jimena's childhood friend, is another well-developed character who enhances the narrative with his own complexities. Their romance is a highlight, filled with sweet moments and a genuine connection that creates a captivating will-they-won’t-they dynamic. Endearing interactions—such as Vitaly’s creative PowerPoint presentation and his chaperoning during Jimena’s dates—add depth and warmth to their relationship, making it a standout element of the story.\n\nMoreover, Jimena's friendship with Sofia is poignantly illustrated, showcasing how Jimena's undocumented status affects their bond and its evolution over time. The reconciliation between Jimena and her mother, marked by Jimena's growing understanding of her mother's sacrifices, is a touching and significant aspect of the narrative, rounding out a rich and emotionally resonant story.",

It poignantly captures the emotional and psychological turmoil that arises when a teen, who has no memory of their home country, learns about their undocumented status.",
            "The book powerfully captures the stress, fear, and heartbreak of Jimena’s situation, making her struggles deeply relatable and emotionally resonant. The depiction of the language barrier and its effects on immigrant families adds an important layer of emotional depth, shedding light on a common yet often overlooked experience."

But I don’t. I have no idea what I want to be when I grow up.

            "Inconsistencies regarding Blue’s birthday detracted from the story's flow. Jimena states it is October 21st, yet later, Blue claims it is February 8th. This confusion was particularly noticeable and caught my attention.",
            "The protagonist, a 17-year-old navigating the complexities of life, believes that marriage could resolve her issues, which is understandable for her age. However, her actions—particularly lying about her age and seeking relationships with older men—are concerning and difficult to overlook from an adult perspective.",
            "This book effectively highlights the immigrant experience in the U.S. and addresses their struggles. However, I believe the portrayal could have been approached differently to mitigate the uncomfortable dynamics involving older men.",
            "While I understand that YA books aren't specifically aimed at a 25-year-old like me, I typically enjoy them and can overlook certain character choices that reflect teenage immaturity.

It was cute, and I’m a sucker for friends-to-lovers tropes.  \n   - The age-appropriate love story at the end was satisfying, though it took a while to get there.  \n\n- **Uncomfortable Themes and Situations:**  \n   - Half the book made me incredibly uncomfortable because the protagonist, a minor, was going on dates with grown men and lying about her age.  \n   - As a 25-year-old, it was unsettling to read about a teenager deceiving adults into dating her, knowing I could accidentally be in a similar situation.  \n   - Even though I knew she wouldn’t end up marrying any of these men (it’s a YA romance, after all), the dates still felt icky to read about.  \n\n- **Character Choices and Immaturity:**  \n   - I understand that the protagonist is a 17-year-old still learning about life, so her belief that getting married would solve her problems makes sense for her age.  \n   - However, her actions, especially lying about her age and pursuing relationships with older men, felt problematic and hard to overlook as an adult reader.  \n\n- **Inconsistencies in the Plot:**  \n   - There was a noticeable inconsistency with Blue’s birthday. Jimena mentions it’s October 21st, but later, Blue says it’s February 8th. This discrepancy was confusing and stood out to me.  \n\n- **Cultural and Immigrant Representation:**  \n   - I appreciate that the book sheds light on the immigrant experience, particularly in the U.S., and tells an important story about their struggles.  \n   - However, I feel the portrayal could have been handled differently to avoid the uncomfortable dynamics with the older men.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Personal Enjoyment:**  \n   - I recognize that YA books aren’t written for me as a 25-year-old, but I usually enjoy them and can overlook certain character choices because they’re meant to reflect teenage immaturity.  \n   - Despite this, the uncomfortable elements in this book made it harder for me to fully enjoy it, even though I wanted to love it, especially since *Kill the Boy Band* is one of my all-time favorite reads.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I liked the book for its cute, age-appropriate romance and its exploration of immigrant experiences.

            "I was impressed by the original concept of the plot, as it uniquely tackles the challenges immigrants face in obtaining green cards. This is a topic I hadn't seen explored in literature before. The author skillfully navigates the complexities of this issue, portraying the harsh realities of immigrants living in the country without legal status.",
            "In my review, I struggled with the plot, particularly Jimena's relentless pressure on her friend to marry her despite knowing his reasons for reluctance and his past. This aspect felt weak and poorly developed. I didn’t connect with Jimena, as I found her thoughts superficial and her handling of serious matters trivial. In contrast, I absolutely loved Vitaly. His character quickly won me over, and his emotional depth and uniqueness made him the standout character, despite his more subdued presence in the story.",
            "This was my first experience with this author's work, and I thoroughly enjoyed her writing style. The short chapters, written in a delightful language, made it easy for me to finish the book in just a few hours, even amidst a reading slump I had been facing.",

While reading, I had a smile on my face almost the entire time, though there were moments when tears welled up in my eyes.\n\n- **Originality of the Plot:**\n   - I really liked the original idea behind the plot. Honestly, I had never encountered a book that addressed the topic of green cards for immigrants and the difficulties associated with obtaining one. I appreciated how the author approached this topic without oversimplifying it, showing the realities of immigrants living illegally in the country.\n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**\n   - This was my first encounter with this author's work, and I really enjoyed her writing style. The short chapters, written in a pleasant language, allowed me to finish the book in just a few hours, despite a reading slump I had been struggling with for a while.\n\n- **Technical Issues (Untranslated Dialogues):**\n   - One drawback I noticed was more technical than content-related. The Spanish dialogues in the book were not translated. At first, I used a translator to understand what the characters were saying, but it became quite cumbersome and disrupted my reading flow. Eventually, I gave up and tried to guess the conversations, but reading shouldn’t involve guessing, so the lack of translation was a frustrating aspect.\n\n- **Character Development and Behavior:**\n   - Another issue I had was with the plot itself. I found it extremely irritating how Jimena pressured her friend into marriage, especially since she didn’t stop even after learning about his reasons for refusing and his past experiences. This behavior felt weak and poorly written to me.\n   - I didn’t particularly like the main character, as I felt she thought very superficially and trivialized many matters.\n   - On the other hand, I absolutely loved Vitaly. He quickly won my heart with his behavior, and his character’s emotional depth and distinctiveness intrigued me even more. Despite living more in the background, he felt like the most well-developed character.\n\n- **Re-readability and Recommendation:**\n   - I had a really pleasant time with this book, but it’s not one I’ll return to. Nevertheless, I’m glad I had the chance to experience this story, and I recommend it to others.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, \"Powiedz Tak\" was a delightful and comforting read with an original plot and engaging writing style. However, the untranslated dialogues and certain character behaviors detracted from the experience. While I enjoyed the story, it’s not a book I’ll revisit, though I’m happy to have read it and would recommend it to others.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5⭐️"

            "The premise of the story is compelling: Jimena learns that her mother is an undocumented immigrant, and even a minor legal issue could result in her deportation. This setup offers significant potential. However, the execution left much to be desired. Jimena's desperate quest for a husband to secure a visa felt unrealistic and off-putting, making her single-minded pursuit less relatable and at times, unlikable.",
            "I was immediately drawn to the main character, Jimena. Unlike typical teenage protagonists who are often quiet or insecure, she is confident, intelligent, and well-liked. Her self-assured demeanor shifts dramatically when her mother's secret is revealed. Vitaly, the neighbor, emerged as the standout character for me. His quiet, reserved nature and disinterest in conventional pursuits made him intriguing, both to Jimena and to me as a reader. However, the ending left me deeply disappointed. Vitaly's decision to marry Jimena felt forced; despite his love for her, it seemed more like a result of pressure than genuine desire, undermining the story's emotional impact.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Book Edition and Design:**\n   - The cover is my favorite among all the books published by Yana. The embossing is stunning, and I spent the first few minutes just touching it.\n   - The interior design, especially the pink elements, is a wonderful idea. It looks beautiful and perfectly complements the cover.\n\n- **Reading Experience:**\n   - The book was difficult to read at first, but only because of my lack of time. I started reading it on Legimi during my commute to school, as those were the only moments I had free.\n   - When I finally returned to reading the physical book, I didn’t even notice when I finished it. The writing style is very pleasant, and the translation is excellent.\n   - The only moments of hesitation were with the Spanish fragments, which were a bit challenging.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - I was surprised that I enjoyed the \"friends to lovers\" trope, as I’m usually not a fan of it. Here, it was well-written and enjoyable to read.\n   - The character of Jimena is vibrant and reminds me of a character from a \"mean girls\" type of show, though I can’t recall which one.\n   - Vitaly’s character was initially disappointing, as he seemed bland. However, I was pleasantly surprised as I learned more about his motivations, training, and life outside of his \"plan.\" By the end, I completely fell in love with his character.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book from Yana is a beautifully designed and well-written novel. Despite my initial struggles with time, I found the story engaging and the characters, especially Vitaly, deeply compelling. The \"friends to lovers\" trope was executed in a way that even I, a usual critic of it, enjoyed. Overall, it was a delightful read, and I look forward to exploring more books from this publisher.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was frustrating that we only meet the actual love interest in the last third of the book. There needed to be more setup earlier, even if it was just a vague introduction, like a guy she’d been messaging on a dating app but never met.  \n   - I absolutely LOVED Vitaly!

In contrast, Vitaly is portrayed as the quintessential neighborhood boyfriend—polite, cultured, well-read, and infatuated with Jimena. While their relationship is charming, it feels overly idealized and ultimately forgettable. I would have preferred more focus on Jimena's relationship with her mother, as it is fraught with unresolved resentment and anger. The communication struggles stemming from her mother's limited English are intriguing and warrant further exploration.",

            "This story delves into the hurdles faced by youths eligible for the DREAM Act, highlighted by Jimena's mom disclosing their undocumented status and the potential for legal residency if the Act succeeds. The idea of a high schooler contemplating marriage to an adult citizen for citizenship is both outrageous and thought-provoking.

Jimena, a Russian-born Peruvian, stands out with her popularity and distinctive style, often funded by Kohl’s cash. Her best friend, Soph, brings humor and warmth to their dynamic. As the story unfolds, the relationship between Jimena and Vitaly shifts from a lighthearted rom-com tone to a deeper connection, with Vitaly even proposing the addition of analytics to their plans.",
            "The writing is both witty and engaging, marked by memorable moments like Vitaly describing Jimena’s dates as “soul-crushing” and a lawyer joking about marriage for citizenship. The humor is skillfully crafted, evident in scenes such as the NY police responding to a noise complaint and the clever Jeopardy contestant analogy.",
            "This novel skillfully balances humor and seriousness, delivering a delightful rom-com atmosphere while thoughtfully exploring the implications of immigration policies. It also highlights the rarity of love-based marriages outside the Western world, adding depth to the narrative.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The novel follows Jimena Ramos, who discovers she is undocumented at seventeen, derailing her future plans. Her new goal is to find someone to marry to secure legal status in the US, with the help of her friends. However, I found the execution of this plot problematic, particularly the storyline of her joining a dating site while underage and going on dates with strangers. This aspect felt cringy and uncomfortable to read.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jimena's struggle with being undocumented is portrayed sympathetically, and her determination to find a solution is evident. However, her actions, such as using a dating site illegally, made it difficult for me to fully connect with her character or support her decisions.\n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  While the book ultimately sends the right message by the end, I found the overall messaging to be poorly executed and inappropriate for a high school audience. The portrayal of Jimena's actions as a solution to her undocumented status felt misguided and potentially harmful for young readers.\n\n- **Appropriateness for Target Audience:**  \n  I would not feel comfortable purchasing this book for high school students due to its handling of sensitive topics and the questionable decisions made by the protagonist. The story's approach to addressing undocumented status and relationships felt unsuitable for younger readers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel attempts to address the challenges of being undocumented and the lengths one might go to for stability, the execution of the plot and messaging fell short for me. The storyline involving underage dating and questionable decisions made it difficult to appreciate the book, despite its sympathetic portrayal of Jimena's struggles. I would not recommend this for a high school audience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The protagonist embodies the dramatic flair typical of YA novels, fitting well within the genre's conventions.

Her determination to get a green card was commendable, and her mistakes along the way felt relatable and understandable.  \n- **Romantic Development:** I wanted more time with Jimena and Vitaly. Their relationship felt underdeveloped, and I didn’t feel fully satisfied with their dynamic.  \n- **Ending:** The ending felt abrupt and left me wanting more closure or a more fleshed-out resolution.  \n- **Genre Experimentation:** While the author tried something new with this rom-com, I believe her strengths lie in dark mystery thrillers, which she writes exceptionally well.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was enjoyable, especially for its witty writing and strong protagonist, Jimena. However, the ending felt rushed, and the romantic relationship lacked depth. While the author’s attempt at a rom-com was commendable, her expertise in dark mystery thrillers remains unmatched.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐3.5/5"

While the characters' behaviors sometimes felt random and unrealistic, Vitaly stood out as a likable character. The predictable yet satisfying ending added to the overall experience. However, the story’s somewhat childish tone and lack of depth make it unlikely to leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

For someone in her position, marrying an older American may indeed seem like a realistic option for achieving stability and maintaining familiarity in their life."

It might be very realistic for someone in her situation to consider marrying an older American to secure stability and remain in the life they know.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book presents a heartfelt romance and tackles an important issue, I found Jimena's decision to marry while still in high school unconvincing.
