            "I adore the author's \"One\" series, which, rather than being a traditional series, consists of books that unfold within a single day, moment, weekend, or holiday. This installment, set on New Year's Eve (or Hogmanay in Scotland), follows that same captivating structure.",
            "Every character is relatable and well-crafted, making it easy to root for their happy endings. I appreciated seeing familiar faces from the previous One books. Each character's individual chapter provided insight into their perspectives, deepening my connection to them. Minnie was my favorite; she reminded me of my grandmother, and I adored her. The friendship between Ailish, Gwen, and Rhonda was particularly heartwarming—they were consistently supportive and refreshingly honest, the kind of friends who give you a much-needed push when you need it.",

Her characters are deeply relatable, allowing readers to genuinely experience their joy and pain. This book is a delightful journey, showcasing the author's signature ability to create engaging characters."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I initially expected magical realism based on the book's description, but it turned out to be a deeply realistic portrayal of human life. The storylines are grounded in the everyday experiences of joy, love, pain, and grief.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  At its core, the novel explores the resilience of the human spirit. It emphasizes the importance of forgiveness, living authentically, and letting go of the past. Each character’s journey serves as a reminder to live deliberately, without regret or hesitation, as time waits for no one.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Through multiple intertwined storylines, the book showcases how people navigate their struggles while holding onto fleeting moments of happiness. The characters’ experiences highlight the balance between pain and joy, making their journeys relatable and impactful.  \n\n- **Memorable Quotes:**  \n  The book is filled with poignant quotes that resonate deeply. Some of my favorites include:  \n  - “Take a deep breath, slap a smile on, and let's do it.\"  \n  - “Some friendships last long after midnight.\"  \n  - “The time for forgiveness would come when it was right.\"  \n  - “I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but you'll survive this.\"  \n  - “It's a business. It's not life or death.\"  \n  - “It's not too late for you to start another life, one that makes you truly happy.\"  \n  - “Time moves on. And if you're so busy clutching on to the past, then all you do is destroy any chance for a happy future.\"  \n  - “Don't do anything because you feel obliged to. Or because it's easy. Or because he wants you.\"  \n  - “Maybe life is too short not to forgive someone you love when they make a mistake.\"  \n  - “There were so many possibilities, so much potential for heartache, so many things that could go wrong. But right now he wasn't going to think about any of them, because if he'd learned anything today, it was that the past didn't matter. Neither did what lay ahead. So, from now on, all he was going to worry about was today.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a profound exploration of human resilience, forgiveness, and the importance of living authentically. While it defied my initial expectations of magical realism, its realistic portrayal of life’s joys and struggles left a lasting impression. The intertwined storylines and memorable quotes make it a deeply moving and thought-provoking read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciate how the author skillfully divides the narrative into different time periods, focusing on various characters. This approach is executed brilliantly in the novel. The fast-paced story captivated me from the beginning, and I was eager to see how each character's journey would intertwine.",
            "The ages of the characters felt somewhat inconsistent. Ailish, Gwen, and Rhonda seemed more like they should be in their late 60s or early 70s, given their speech and behavior, rather than their 40s or 50s. Meanwhile, Minnie, intended to be in her 70s, appeared much older—closer to her 90s—exhibiting a frailty not typical for someone in their 70s today. This discrepancy was distracting and detracted from the story's realism. However, the author excels at crafting quirky characters that elicit genuine laughter while infusing the narrative with warmth and depth. The book strikes a delightful balance between humor and heartfelt moments, keeping readers engaged throughout.",
            "This book had me laughing one moment and feeling deeply moved the next. It’s an emotional rollercoaster, but in the best way. I raced through it, eager to see how everything would unfold."

This moment stood out as a highlight of the story.  \n\n- **Cultural Connection:**  \n  As someone who loves all things Scottish, I was so intrigued by the setting that I immediately searched online to see if I could find *The Steamie*, a Scottish movie set on Hogmanay in the 1950s. I was thrilled to discover it’s available on YouTube!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a captivating setting and a well-executed climax, the characters, aside from Minnie, didn’t fully engage me. The story’s Scottish cultural elements were a definite highlight, sparking my curiosity to explore related media.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"
