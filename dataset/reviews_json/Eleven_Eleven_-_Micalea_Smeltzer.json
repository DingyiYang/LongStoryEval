            "From the outset, Via is a character you can easily relate to, and her journey is truly engaging. Her growth—opening her own business, creating art, joining a book club, and forging new friendships—is both inspiring and aspirational. Reid, introduced early on as the love interest, has an undeniable chemistry with Via. He embodies the ideal partner: handsome, respectful, a talented cook, and a bit adventurous in the bedroom. His character is so well-crafted that he almost feels too good to be true for a 21-year-old. While I typically lean towards slow-burn romances, the pacing and writing of their relationship were spot on. The steamy scenes were satisfying and well-executed, and Reid’s love and support for Via added a heartwarming depth to their bond. The side characters are also well-developed, featuring some that are lovable and others that are delightfully detestable.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author and Trope Appeal:**\n   - Micalea Smeltzer is a new author to me, and I chose to read 'Eleven Eleven' primarily because of the featured trope—reverse age gap. This trope always captivates me, and 'Eleven Eleven' delivered everything I hoped for.\n\n- **Plot and Engagement:**\n   - The story pulled me in and kept me invested in the welfare of the characters and the romance, leading to a satisfying ending. It’s a superbly written story that reminds readers how fulfilling it is to live life on one's own terms.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - **Via:** The heroine, Via, is a thirty-two-year-old recently divorced woman who left her life and career as a lawyer in San Francisco to move to a small town in Maine. She plans to open an art store. Via’s journey of healing, rediscovering herself, and finding true happiness was inspiring. It was remarkable to see her move past her insecurities and embrace new opportunities, including reopening her heart to love.\n   - **Reid:** Reid Crawford, a 21-year-old independent man, is a mature and swoon-worthy hero. His patience, support, sweet nature, protectiveness, and good looks made him the perfect match for Via. Despite wanting forever with Via, he didn’t push her and worked at her pace.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**\n   - Via and Reid shared an instant connection when they first met at a bar. Although Via initially had no interest in more than one night due to her emotional scars from her cheating narcissistic husband, fate had other plans. Their paths crossed again in a strange manner, and their relationship blossomed into something deep and meaningful.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**\n   - The novel emphasizes that it’s never too late to pursue your dreams. Via’s decision to leave her old life behind and start anew in a small town was a significant risk, but it ultimately led to her healing and happiness.\n\n- **Favorite Quotes:**\n   - “It’s strange to think that I’m home now. This is the beginning of my new life. The biggest risk I’ve ever taken. I left behind a high-paying job and my friends and family for a future filled with uncertainty.”\n   - “Because you were sitting there with this lonely look in your eyes.” He brushes a thumb along my jawline. “I wanted to be the reason you didn’t feel that way any more.”\n   - “But it takes a good friendship to establish a solid foundation. I don’t want to only be your lover. I want to be your person. The one you go to first. The one you think of when you wake up. The one… just the one.”\n   - “Reid is a vibrant splash of colour in the dull landscape that is my life. He’s red. Passion and energy. He’s blue. Friendly, a rock I can hold on to against the crash of waves. He’s green. Infallibly positive, with a generous soul. He’s yellow. The optimistic sunshine on my cloudy days. He’s every colour in-between streaked across my blank white canvas.”\n\n**Conclusion:**\n'Eleven Eleven' is a captivating story that beautifully portrays the journey of self-discovery, healing, and finding love. The characters, especially Via and Reid, are well-developed and their romance is both heartwarming and inspiring. The novel’s themes of pursuing dreams and living life on one’s own terms resonate deeply.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "Despite its hefty 500 pages, I found myself utterly engrossed in this book—it was compelling and almost addictive. The story centers on Via James, who relocates to a small town after her divorce to chase her dream of opening an art studio. Key elements of the plot include a one-night stand, a reverse age gap (Via is 32 and Reid is 21), and a \"he falls first\" dynamic. Notably, the absence of a third-act breakup was a refreshing twist.",
            "Reid Crawford is a truly exceptional character—sweet, caring, supportive, and undeniably sexy, with an irresistible charm. He embodies the essence of a golden retriever hero, exuding confidence and charisma. Via James begins her journey in a fragile state after her divorce, but she evolves into a strong and resilient woman, largely thanks to Reid's pivotal support. Their chemistry is palpable, and their connection feels like the meeting of twin flames. While the reverse age gap is a central theme, it’s portrayed in a way that makes age irrelevant, allowing their relationship to unfold naturally and authentically. The steamy scenes are intense and enhance the depth of their bond.",

She leaves her job as a lawyer, moves out of California, and opens an art studio in an unfamiliar East Coast town. On her first night there, she has a one-night stand with Reid, who is 11 years her junior, insisting they won't contact each other afterward. As Via settles into her new home, she goes on a date with her contractor, unaware that he is Reid's father. Their date ends with a surprising encounter when they run into Reid again. This story is truly an enjoyable read!",
            "What I appreciated most about this reverse age gap story is how it centers on Via's journey of self-discovery, making her character feel equally matched with Reid. From the beginning, I found Reid captivating; he's not your typical 21-year-old. He exudes confidence, kindness, and a nurturing, protective aura. The book club characters add another layer to the narrative, providing Via with a genuine sense of community as they rally around her. They are perfectly crafted side characters. I also really enjoyed Via's sister, Izzy, adding depth to the story.",

Eleven Eleven was no exception.  \n  - The end of this book was so good. I love the way Micalea handled some of the struggles Via was going through and the outcome she and Reid ended up with.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - Via is newly divorced from her cheating husband and decides to start fresh with the life she wants instead of the life that has been expected of her. She quits her job as a lawyer, moves out of California, and heads to the east coast to open an art studio in a town she has never stepped foot in.  \n  - On Via’s first night in town, she has a one-night stand with Reid, who is 11 years younger than her. She tells him she wants this night to be all they have—they won’t contact each other after or see each other again.  \n  - As she’s settling into her new home, she goes on a date with her contractor, who unbeknownst to her is Reid’s father. At the end of their date, they end up face to face with Reid, much to Via’s surprise. Enter Reid back into Via’s life.  \n  - I loved the age-gap dynamics in this book. It challenges societal norms and offers a fresh perspective on reverse age gap.  \n  - The story is just a really great read!  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I think the biggest reason I liked this reverse age gap is that it feels the entire time like Via is actually trying to discover herself and figure out who she truly is more than Reid even, so they feel very on par for each other.  \n  - I loved Reid from the start. He doesn’t present as a normal 21-year-old guy; he’s confident, adorable, kind, genuine, and he’s got this whole nurturing and protective vibe going on.  \n  - I love the book club characters and how they all rally around Via and give her a true sense of community. They were the perfect side characters for this story.  \n  - I also loved Via’s sister, Izzy.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  - This book is spiiiiiiicy, so be warned if spice isn’t your thing.  \n\n- **Ending and Future Potential:**  \n  - I also won’t spoil anything, but I am so excited to see Izzy’s future!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEleven Eleven by Micalea Smeltzer is a captivating and spicy read that challenges societal norms with its reverse age-gap trope.

His dedication, patience, and irresistible charm have me completely captivated. Reid brings vibrancy to my life; he's a burst of color on my otherwise blank canvas. He embodies passion and energy, like red; he offers friendship and stability, like blue; he radiates positivity, like green; and he brings sunshine to my cloudy days, like yellow. \n\nIn this sweet reverse age gap romance, Reid falls fast and first.

He is persistent, genuine, and deeply committed to Via, which made me root for him throughout the story.  \n   - Via’s journey of self-discovery and her hesitations due to her recent divorce and the age gap with Reid felt relatable and well-developed. Her growth throughout the book was compelling.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story follows Via as she rebuilds her life after a divorce, moving to a small town and unexpectedly connecting with Reid. Their initial one-night stand evolves into a deeper relationship, which was engaging and heartfelt.  \n   - While I enjoyed the overall plot, I felt the book could have been shorter. Some parts seemed unnecessary and dragged the story out longer than needed.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n   - The book touches on themes of self-discovery, second chances, and overcoming societal stigmas, such as the idea of \"missing out\" when marrying young. As someone who married young, I found this aspect a bit biased and not entirely relatable.  \n   - The age gap between Via and Reid was handled well, with Via’s hesitations and Reid’s persistence adding depth to their relationship.  \n\n- **Marketing and Expectations:**  \n   - The promotional material for the book focused on elements that didn’t play a significant role in the actual story. This left me waiting for certain developments that were ultimately brushed over, which was slightly disappointing.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Readability:**  \n   - Despite its length, the book was easy to read, and I found myself flying through it. The characters and their growth kept me invested, and I was genuinely excited for the next book based on the teaser provided.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters, especially Reid, were well-crafted and memorable, and the story was engaging despite some pacing issues. While certain themes and marketing choices didn’t fully align with my expectations, the book was a delightful read, and I’m eager to see where the series goes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

            "The love story between Reid and Via is beautifully crafted, and I particularly appreciated the absence of a third-act breakup—such a refreshing choice. The reverse age gap (he's 21, she’s 32) is skillfully handled, with Reid’s maturity making him an ideal partner for Via. The narrative features engaging tropes like small-town romance, boy obsession, and one-night stands, all woven together seamlessly.",

Via's journey to prioritize her own happiness after her recent divorce and lack of parental support was both relatable and inspiring. Additionally, the dynamic between Via and her sister added depth to the story that I really appreciated.",

            "Reid embodies the ideal book boyfriend—loving, supportive, and gentle with Via. His nervousness during their first date and steadfast support for her are truly endearing. Via’s healing journey stands out as she learns to trust herself and embrace love, with her growth and bravery, especially against her ex, proving deeply satisfying. Lili, Via’s younger sister, shines as a supportive and assertive character. Derrick and Izzy’s dynamic adds intriguing layers, and I’m eager to see where their story goes.

            "This book radiates warmth and joy, particularly during Via’s opening day and her seamless integration into the community. The encounter with her ex is notably satisfying, as Via's indifferent response effectively neutralizes his narcissism.

There hasn’t been a single book of hers that I haven’t loved. In fact, I downloaded three more of her books today because I trust her storytelling so much.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  The story follows Via, who leaves her comfortable life in California for a slower-paced one in Parkerville, Maine. She’s newly divorced, has left her lawyer job, and is pursuing her passion of opening an art studio. Her younger sister, Izzy, encourages her to get out and enjoy herself, which leads her to Monday’s, a local bar/restaurant. There, she meets Reid, who is 11 years younger than her. What starts as a one-night stand turns into something much deeper as Via can’t stop thinking about him.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics and Conflict:**  \n  Via tries to move on by going on a date with Derrick, the contractor renovating her store/apartment. However, the date takes an unexpected turn when Derrick gets a call and takes Via to his house, where she discovers Reid is his son. This creates a complicated dynamic, as Reid is 11 years younger than Via, and Derrick is 11 years older. Despite the age differences, Via falls in love with Reid, and their relationship blossoms.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Subplots:**  \n  Izzy, Via’s sister, plays a significant role in encouraging Via to embrace her new life. Eventually, Izzy moves to Parkerville to be closer to Via and ends up marrying Derrick, adding another layer to the story. Their story is set to be released in October 2024, and I’m already excited for it!  \n\n- **Resolution and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story concludes with Via and Reid adopting two children, as Via couldn’t have children of her own. Their journey is heartwarming and fulfilling, and the epilogue provides a satisfying glimpse into their future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is another masterpiece by Micalea Smeltzer, filled with emotional depth, complex relationships, and a satisfying resolution. The characters are well-developed, and the story kept me hooked from start to finish. I can’t wait for the next installment in this series!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

            "Via and Reid emerge as an unlikely but well-developed couple. Via stands out as a strong, determined character who skillfully shapes her own destiny. I admire her refusal to compromise and her decision to walk away from old habits, marking significant growth in her character. Reid, at just 21, exhibits remarkable maturity. His caring approach towards Via, free from objectification, underscores genuine respect. Despite facing his own challenges, he remains a supportive presence rather than trying to alter her path.\n\nThe romance is exceptional, characterized by palpable sexual tension and chemistry. While I usually shy away from one-night stands in literature, this portrayal is well-executed. The pacing allows for authentic connection, and the inclusion of steamy scenes with effective dirty talk enhances the allure. Compelling side characters, especially Isabel—Via's sincere friend—add depth to the story, and I eagerly anticipate reading Isabel's story in the next installment.",

            "Reid was a pleasure to read about. Despite being eleven years younger than the female main character (FMC), he displayed emotional maturity and a genuine care for Via. Initially, I was skeptical about Reid's age, but he quickly won me over with his depth and charm. His reaction to Via accidentally going on a date with his dad was perfectly endearing and had me melting. \n\nVia was an engaging character who finally embraced life on her own terms, unapologetically embracing the significant changes she faced. Although she was apprehensive about dating a younger man, she made a compelling point about the societal double standards surrounding age gaps. This dynamic added a fascinating layer to the story. Reid fell for Via deeply and quickly, and my heart ached for him when he feared she was dating someone else.",

She moves across the country to a small town to start fresh after her divorce, showing her resilience and desire for a new beginning.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  - The story takes an intriguing turn when Via, encouraged by her sister to meet new people, ends up at a bar and has a one-night stand with 21-year-old Reid.  \n  - The conflict arises when Via spirals, believing she can't be with someone eleven years younger. To distract herself, she goes on a date—only to discover she’s dating Reid’s dad.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story follows Oliva, a newly divorced woman who moves to Maine to start a new life, leaving her career as a lawyer to open an art studio.  \n   - The plot includes a romantic twist when she goes on a date with Darrick, who turns out to be the father of her much younger one-night stand.  \n\n- **Relatability and Character Connection:**  \n   - As a 31-year-old woman, I found Via’s journey relatable, especially her desire to start over and create a new life in a different place.  \n   - I connected with her dream of moving across the country and living in a fantasy world, even though I’m not divorced myself.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - I loved the small-town feel of the book, which added charm and coziness to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Flaws:**  \n   - Via’s self-doubt and concern about judgment felt a bit excessive at times, which slightly detracted from her character.  \n\n- **Themes and Interests:**  \n   - As an art lover, I appreciated Via’s artistic vision and her decision to pursue her passion by opening an art studio.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n   - I am OBSESSED with Reid, who is undoubtedly a standout character and “God tier” for me.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n   - I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a romance read, as it offers a compelling story with relatable themes and engaging characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was amazing! It combines a relatable protagonist, a charming small-town setting, and a romantic storyline with unexpected twists. While Via’s self-doubt occasionally felt overdone, her journey of self-discovery and passion for art resonated deeply with me. Reid, in particular, stole the show and made the story unforgettable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In her quest for a fresh start after a recent divorce, Via relocates across the country, where she crosses paths with the much younger Reid at a bar. An instant, intense attraction sparks a one-night stand between them. However, their connection lingers in their minds long after that night. Their paths hilariously collide again when Via, now on a date, discovers she is with Reid's father.",

I admired Via's strength; starting over after a difficult divorce is no easy feat, yet she faced it all with fierce determination—someone I'd love to be friends with. The supporting characters were fantastic as well, especially Via’s sister and Reid’s sister. I hope to see them both find happy endings in future books!",

            "Reid's family conflicts are resolved too quickly, leaving his character feeling somewhat two-dimensional at times. Readers will find themselves wanting a deeper exploration of his backstory. The book refreshingly avoids a typical third-act breakup commonly found in romance novels. While the infertility storyline is beautifully crafted, it may not resonate with all readers, particularly those who don't relate to themes surrounding children. The age gap between Reid and Via is frequently highlighted but feels overemphasized, which somewhat shifts the focus away from other conflicts, such as Via's divorce and her fear of moving on.",
            "Reid is the man of everyone’s dreams, embodying acts of service as his love language. His refreshing patience and absence of toxic jealousy, even in the presence of an ex, highlight his admirable qualities. With an artistic and sensitive nature, he adds depth to the narrative. Via is a strong, intelligent, and kind protagonist who courageously rebuilds her life after it crumbles. Her resilience and strategic thinking make her a captivating character. The supporting cast—Lili, Layla, Derrick, Izzy, Ella, and Glenda—are well-developed and unforgettable, with Glenda particularly shining as a scene-stealer.",
            "The writing is a delightful blend of sweetness, spice, and emotion, skillfully balancing fluff with heartfelt moments. The humor and lightheartedness, particularly evident in the characters' interactions, contribute to an enjoyable and engaging reading experience.",
            "The book is highly engaging, eliciting strong emotional reactions, from giggles to foot-kicking excitement. The well-crafted side characters leave readers eager for spin-off stories featuring them."

            "The reverse age gap between Via and Reid is mentioned often, yet it fails to generate substantial tension when they go public, receiving only fleeting glances from the townspeople. Derrick's reaction to their relationship seems disproportionate, especially considering his previous interest in Via. I particularly valued the absence of a third-act breakup, a refreshing departure from the norm in contemporary romance. The story cleverly sidesteps unnecessary drama, avoiding clichés like Via's ex resurfacing or scandal surrounding her dating Reid's father.",
            "Reid, a mature 21-year-old, has a sweet yet dominant personality, exuding confidence as he knows what he wants. In contrast, Via, having experienced a difficult marriage, struggles with trust and independence. Reid's unwavering commitment helps her gradually feel secure in their relationship, which is both cute and heartwarming. \n\nThe dynamics between Via and her sister Izzy, as well as Reid’s bond with his niece, enrich the narrative. While the potential scandal of Via dating Reid's father, Derrick, adds intrigue, it feels underdeveloped, and Derrick’s lack of persistence after their date seems inconsistent. The side characters, particularly Izzy and Derrick, are engaging, and I look forward to their possible spin-off stories. I also hope for a book featuring Layla, as she appears to be a fascinating character."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I enjoyed Via and Reid’s heartwarming and drama-free romance. The characters are well-developed, and their relationships feel genuine. While some plot points, like Derrick’s behavior and the lack of tension around the age gap, could have been handled better, the story remains engaging. The potential for spin-offs with side characters adds excitement for future reads.",

The way the book portrayed her journey was compelling and relatable.  \n  However, I found it hard to believe that the male main character, Reid, was only 21. His maturity and actions seemed inconsistent with his age.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The way the book addressed infertility was beautiful. It was handled with sensitivity and depth, making it a standout aspect of the story.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The town and setting were so well-crafted. They added a rich, immersive layer to the story that I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The found family dynamic within the community was heartwarming and added a lot of emotional depth. The side characters were also well-developed and memorable.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation:**  \n  I really enjoyed the book overall, especially the sections told from Via’s perspective. I’m VERY excited to pick up the next book in the series!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful read, with strong character development, meaningful themes, and a vivid setting.

Reid might have also shared how he and Via met and why their relationship remained private, addressing critical points:  \n1. The double standard regarding age differences and its effects on Via.  \n2. Reid's concern for Derrick, wanting to avoid hurting him due to his past with Via.  \n3.

His confidence and maturity, despite his age, made him an endearing character, though his behavior at 21 felt slightly unrealistic.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Relatability:**  \n  The book excels in capturing Via's emotions and thought processes, which felt incredibly real and mirrored how I might have reacted in similar situations. The story tackles serious issues like divorce, infidelity, and starting over, making it more than just a light romance.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The chemistry between Via and Reid is electric, with a mix of sweet moments and steamy scenes. Reid's unwavering devotion to Via and his filthy mouth added layers to their relationship, making it both passionate and heartfelt.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing is engaging, and the pacing keeps the story moving smoothly. The inclusion of small details, like Reid wearing glasses, added charm to the narrative.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The book concludes with a satisfying happily ever after for multiple characters, leaving me eager for the next installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a captivating blend of romance, emotional depth, and relatable struggles. While Reid's maturity at 21 felt slightly unrealistic, his character and the chemistry between him and Via made the story unforgettable. It’s a must-read for fans of reverse age gap romances with a touch of realism.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars."

            "Via relocates to Parkerville to rebuild her life after divorcing her unfaithful husband. Leaving her legal career behind, she opens an art studio. On one of her first nights in town, under her sister's encouragement, she meets 21-year-old Reid, leading to an unforgettable one-night stand. However, they cannot shake their thoughts of each other. When Via accepts a date from her contractor, Derrick, who is also Reid’s father, their connection deepens unexpectedly when Reid takes her home after an emergency. The story unfolds at a medium pace, addressing themes of infidelity—Via’s ex-husband’s affair—but avoids cheating between the main characters. Via’s struggle with infertility is also a key element. The epilogue offers a heartwarming view of Via and Reid’s married life with two adopted children.",
            "**Review:** \n\nInstalove is evident from the start, as Reid feels an immediate connection despite pushing for a slower pace in their taboo relationship. While Via initially seeks to keep things under wraps, she never fully distances herself from Reid. \n\n**Hero (Reid): 5/5** – Patient, kind, and caring, he embodies the essence of a golden retriever.  \n**Heroine (Via): 5/5** – I admired her journey of reinventing her life and prioritizing her own needs for the first time.",

This change enriches the storytelling, offering a deeper insight into both characters’ emotions and motivations.",

            "The story began with a strong hook, but I found my interest waning around the middle as the narrative lost momentum. Fortunately, it regained its energy in the latter half, capturing my full investment until the conclusion.",
            "In this story, Via, the heroine, embarks on a new chapter after her divorce, pursuing her passion for art in a fresh town. Her journey is both relatable and engaging. Reid, the 21-year-old male lead, displays a maturity that is appealing, often exhibiting a thoughtfulness and endearment in his interactions with Via. Interestingly, he sometimes demonstrates more maturity than she does, adding depth to their dynamic. The chemistry between Via and Reid is electric, making it one of the book's highlights. Their connection feels authentic and intense, evolving from a one-night stand into a satisfying and well-developed relationship. This narrative effectively challenges the stereotype that only stories with older male leads are appealing, showcasing that reverse age gap stories can be just as captivating. I hope more readers discover and appreciate this dynamic, as it offers a refreshing and exciting perspective.",

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the reverse age gap trope and the pseudo-love triangle involving Via, Reid, and Derrick. Via’s relationship with her sister, Izzy, was particularly heartwarming. Reid’s playful nature and the creative dates he planned for Via brought a delightful touch to the narrative. Little Lili was utterly adorable, adding charm throughout the story. The portrayal of Reid’s sister, Layla, and her life circumstances was well-crafted and added depth to the plot. Via’s journey of self-discovery following a messy divorce was compelling, and Reid’s close connection to Layla as she navigated her own changes added an intriguing layer to his character.",
            "This story's central message about the possibility of starting over resonated deeply with me. I appreciated the humorous yet tension-filled taboo of Via's one-night stand being the son of her current date. The author skillfully navigated potentially cringeworthy moments, leaving me feeling entertained rather than uncomfortable.",

He truly embodies the ideal book boyfriend, and his physical attributes, including his impressive stamina, only enhance his appeal.\n\nConversely, Via fell short in my eyes.

Instead of letting it break her, she picked herself up, left her old life behind, and started fresh in a new place. Her resilience and determination were inspiring.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters (Izzy and Reid):**  \n  Via’s sister, Izzy, played a crucial role in pushing her to step out of her comfort zone, which led to her meeting Reid. Reid, a confident and determined 21-year-old, was a standout character. He knew what he wanted from the moment he saw Via, and their chemistry was undeniable.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Twists:**  \n  The story took an unexpected turn when Izzy pushed Via to go on a date with Reid’s dad. My jaw dropped at this twist, but Reid’s reaction—refusing to let her go on another date with his dad—was both intense and satisfying.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship (Via and Reid):**  \n  Their relationship started as a one-night stand, but it evolved into something much deeper. Reid’s unwavering determination to claim Via as his own was both passionate and endearing.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The heartwarming ending brought tears to my eyes. I was so happy for Via and Reid, and it left me eagerly anticipating the next book in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a rollercoaster of emotions, filled with resilience, unexpected twists, and a deeply satisfying romance.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - Reid and Via were cute together, and their age gap didn’t feel weird at all.  \n  - Reid’s initial bold statement (*“I can fuck you better than my dad”*) was intriguing, but his lack of action for 200 pages was disappointing.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  - The story felt a little “meh” overall.  \n  - The relationship progression was minimal, with the characters essentially making up their minds in the first few chapters, making the rest of the book feel like filler.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  - The sneak peeks leading up to the release suggested a very spicy story, but the actual content fell short, with barely any spicy scenes.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  - There were a lot of typos, which, while not the end of the world, were noticeable and slightly bothersome.  \n\n- **Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite the flaws, I had a fun time reading the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I wasn’t obsessed with the novel as I had hoped, I didn’t dislike it either. The characters were endearing, and their dynamic was enjoyable, but the plot felt underdeveloped, and the lack of spice was disappointing. The typos were a minor annoyance, but overall, it was a fun read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75⭐️"

At 21, my own boys and their friends were far from mature, though I recognize that the character's circumstances may have shaped him differently. This is my own projection; maturity is certainly possible at that age.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Complexity and Themes:**  \n  The book tackles a variety of dramatic issues, including a cheating ex, the protagonist's struggle with self-image, parental expectations, and a career choice that feels safe but unfulfilling. It also explores fertility issues, a second-chance romance with a reverse age gap (which adds a taboo element), and a potential love triangle that ultimately doesn't materialize. Despite these heavy themes, the story manages to feel comforting and uplifting.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist (h) is well-developed, grappling with self-image issues and the pressure to meet her parents' expectations. Her journey of leaving a safe career to pursue her art dream adds depth to her character. The romance, though unconventional due to the reverse age gap, feels genuine and adds to the emotional richness of the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Tone and Pacing:**  \n  Despite the heavy themes, the book maintains a feel-good tone. The humor, particularly in scenes like the \"mouse scene\" and the skating scene, provides moments of levity and made me laugh out loud.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance is a central focus, with a second-chance, reverse age gap dynamic that feels both taboo and heartfelt. The potential love triangle adds tension but is resolved in a way that keeps the story focused on the main relationship.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of drama and comfort, tackling serious themes while maintaining a feel-good tone. The well-developed characters, humorous moments, and heartfelt romance make it an engaging and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I usually love Micalea's writing, but this one just wasn't hitting for me this time.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  I liked that it was a small-town setting, which is totally my vibe.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The reverse age gap was enjoyable because it’s something you don’t see too often. I also appreciated that there was no third-act breakup.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was way too slow for me. I had a hard time staying focused and found myself easily distracted because the story didn’t pull me in and keep me engaged.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were just okay. I actually enjoyed Via’s sister more and preferred the scenes where she was present over the ones without her.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This book was just okay for me. I might try revisiting it later to see if my thoughts change, but for now, it didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some elements I enjoyed, like the small-town setting and the reverse age gap, the slow pacing and lack of engagement made it a less enjoyable read for me compared to the author’s other works. I might give it another chance in the future, but for now, it was just okay.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The book suffers from a lack of meaningful conflict, primarily centering on Via's indecision about her feelings for Reid. Without significant obstacles or challenges, even the minor conflict involving Reid’s father discovering their relationship is resolved too quickly and lacks depth. This absence of real issues renders the plot flat and unengaging. For instance, Via’s transition to a small town and her integration into the community occur unrealistically smoothly. Additionally, the pacing is slow and repetitive, as Via's incessant whining and indecision dominate the narrative. Overall, the lack of conflict or tension results in a monotonous and uninspiring story.",

She frequently laments her divorce, her ex-husband, her parents' disapproval, and her new life in a different town. Even when Reid enters her life, she can't help but compare him to her ex-husband, which seems implausible for someone of her age. In contrast, Reid comes off as overly mature for a 21-year-old, displaying an instant and unwavering commitment to Via that feels unrealistic and almost too good to be true.",

Reid's swift, intense feelings for Via and his father's rapid acceptance of her come across as contrived.

            "The beginning (Part One) was captivating and well-written, prompting me to recommend it to friends. However, Parts Two and Three lost momentum, transitioning from an exciting, forbidden age-gap story to a more feel-good, Hallmark-style narrative that lacked drama and tension. The epilogue felt rushed and poorly executed, especially with the inconsistency of referring to Izzy's partner as her husband while revealing his name in the blurb for the next book.",
            "Reid is an engaging character—mature, likable, and surprisingly wise beyond his 21 years, which is somewhat unrealistic yet still enjoyable. Via, while pleasant, feels distant throughout the story, making it difficult to fully connect with her. Despite this, Reid and Via have good chemistry, and Reid stands out as a five-star guy who is a great match for anyone.",
            "The story was marred by grammatical errors, missing or extraneous words, and inconsistencies that detracted from the overall experience. These issues could have been mitigated with more thorough proofreading.",
            "The story opens with impressive emotional depth and intensity but falters in Parts Two and Three, where it shifts towards an overly cheerful tone and loses tension. While the passionate scenes are a standout, the overall emotional impact wanes as the narrative unfolds."

However, the story lost its intensity in the later parts, and the rushed epilogue, along with grammatical errors, detracted from the experience. While it had its highs, it didn’t fully deliver as a 5-star read.",

In contrast, Reid was quite likable, and I found myself enjoying his perspective more than Via's.

The exploration of societal perceptions regarding age differences in relationships, particularly how they differ depending on whether the man or woman is younger, was thought-provoking, even if neither scenario is deemed fully acceptable. I found the age-gap trope engaging, though I was frustrated by the protagonist’s belief that she was \"old\" at 32. Additionally, I enjoyed the small-town romance aspect of the narrative."

I tried to understand her, but the way she handled her problems, insecurities, and panic didn’t sit well with me.  \n\n- **Plot Construction and Execution:**  \n   - I didn’t like how the author constructed certain moments, especially the entire situation with his father. The attempt to make it funny felt awkward and forced to me.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n   - I really liked the connection to the title, which fit perfectly. The idea that society views relationships differently when the man is younger versus when the woman is younger was interesting, though neither scenario is considered entirely normal. The age-gap trope was present, with her being older (though I couldn’t stand how she thought she was old at 32 😅). Another trope I enjoyed was the small-town romance.  \n\n- **Character Development (Reid):**  \n   - Reid was very likable. I enjoyed him more than Via, and I’m glad we got his perspective in the book. At first, I thought it wouldn’t happen because it took a while to get there 🤭. Their moments together were very beautiful, especially those related to art.  \n\n- **Overall Story and Recommendation:**  \n   - The story has a lot to offer, even though the author didn’t fully meet my expectations. I recommend giving it a chance if it sounds appealing to you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had issues with the main character and some plot elements, the story’s themes, Reid’s character, and the small-town romance trope made it enjoyable overall.

            "The reveal about Derrick and Izzy was absolutely jaw-dropping!",
            "Via's overly dramatic nature and immaturity are frustrating, making her character hard to connect with. Her embarrassment over her dislike of rodents feels excessive, and the age gap between her and Reid is unsettling—especially as he, a 21-year-old, seeks to care for her after her 8-year marriage. Their relationship is driven by lust, leaving it feeling superficial. I can't help but wonder how things might have unfolded had Via been more mature and appeared older. Additionally, her failure to confront her toxic parents is disappointing; after they blamed her for her failed marriage and secretly shared her new address with her ex-husband, I expected her to stand up for herself.",
            "Throughout the book, I felt deep empathy for Derrick. His genuine loneliness and interest in Via were palpable, yet she did not share his feelings. While it's not entirely her fault, she could have done more to prevent leading him on. Derrick's heartbreak after their date was particularly poignant, especially given his status as an older widower."

            "The story centers on Via, who relocates from bustling Los Angeles to a small town following her divorce. This new environment challenges her comfort zone and significantly influences the narrative. At its heart is a reverse age gap romance—Via is 11 years older than 21-year-old Reid—which is complicated by a love triangle involving Reid and his father. Clocking in at 500 pages, the novel may feel lengthy to some readers. While I didn't find the length to be a dealbreaker, it did contribute to moments where the story felt somewhat drawn out.",
            "The relationship between Via and Reid lies at the heart of the story. Reid embodies everything Via shouldn't desire but ultimately needs. However, I struggled to connect with the characters on a deeper level, which affected my overall engagement. The spice level is decent, with explicit scenes that enhance the tension and drama. This unconventional romance delves into themes of forbidden attraction and emotional complexity.",

She hires a contractor to realize her vision, but when her sister nudges her to date him, it doesn’t go well. This turn of events proves fortuitous, as the contractor is the father of Ried, her brief fling. Despite their age difference—Ried is 11 years younger—he unexpectedly brings color and joy back into Via’s life. The satisfying conclusion sees Via rediscovering herself and building a supportive community around her.",

Their relationship evolves from a one-night stand into a deep emotional connection, with Ried significantly contributing to Via's healing. In contrast, Via's pushy and immature sister diminishes her likability. The dynamic between Via, Ried, and Ried's father, the contractor, introduces an intriguing layer of potential awkwardness to the narrative."

Additionally, the relationships Via was building in the town could have been explored more to add richness to the narrative.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book made me crave donuts and inspired a desire to travel to Maine, which speaks to the immersive and evocative setting.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Sequel Interest:**  \n  Despite some dislikes, I found the book enjoyable as a vacation read and am looking forward to grabbing the sequel in October.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some areas that could have been improved, such as reducing repetitive elements and delving deeper into certain characters and relationships, it was an enjoyable read overall. The immersive setting and engaging character development left me eager to continue the story with the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The premise of a troubled woman in her mid-30s having a one-night stand with a 21-year-old and then becoming involved with his father was dramatic and intriguing.  \n- **Plot Development:**  \n  Unfortunately, the initial promise of the story didn’t hold up. After the dramatic setup, the plot began to drag. It felt like the author had a great idea for twists and turns to make the story stand out but ultimately abandoned that potential, settling for a more conventional love story.  \n- **Originality:**  \n  While the book initially seemed like it would break away from typical romance tropes, it ended up falling into predictable patterns, which was disappointing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had a captivating and dramatic start, but it failed to maintain its momentum. What began as a unique and engaging story devolved into a conventional love story, leaving much of its initial potential unfulfilled.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Initial Engagement: 10/10  \n- Overall Execution: Lower than expected due to the lack of sustained interest and originality."

However, I ended up enjoying this one more than I expected.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The MMC, Reid, really stood out to me. His tattoo and the way he calls the FMC \"Angel\" got me in my feelings—so much so that it’s now a new favorite name I want my significant other to call me. Additionally, the fact that Reid wears glasses added to his appeal; there’s just something about a man with glasses that I find incredibly attractive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial hesitation about the reverse age gap trope, this novel pleasantly surprised me.

            "The story began with a captivating premise but quickly lost momentum. The first third had strong, 5-star potential, but the quality deteriorated afterward. The frequent, detailed phone calls with Via's sister felt like unnecessary filler, stretching over 50-80 pages. The plot centered on Via's single date with Reid's father, Derrick, which felt contrived and lackluster. Over time, the initially passionate connection between Reid and Via faded, making the middle of the book tedious. Overall, the pacing suffered due to the focus on less compelling subplots, especially the relationship between Via's sister and Derrick.",
            "In the first third of the book, Reid is an incredibly likable character, and his support for Via stands out as a highlight. However, Via's sister becomes a significant annoyance, particularly with her incessant phone calls and detailed involvement in the plot. While the initial romantic tension between Via and Reid is engaging, it fades as the story progresses. Additionally, the subplot featuring a romantic connection between Via's sister and Derrick, Reid's father, feels both off-putting and poorly executed.",

Their initial chemistry is undeniable; however, this tension diminishes as the story unfolds. Additionally, the forced date between Via and Derrick (Reid's father) feels contrived and detracts from the overall narrative."

The relationship lacked depth, the writing included off-putting dialogue, and the pacing failed to keep me engaged. However, I appreciated the resolution with Via’s mother, which added some emotional weight to the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "While I appreciate age gap romances, reverse age gaps aren't my preference.",
            "Reid comes across as a confident “man,” perhaps to compensate for the age gap in the story. However, it's unrealistic for a 21-year-old to behave this way, as most young men are still immature. Instead of being possessive, Reid seems more like a quirky, obsessive guy who struggles with how to interact with women.",
            "I initially gave this author a couple more chances after enjoying one of their top 5-star reads, but I've come to realize that their writing style isn't for me. The excessive detail adds around 100 extra pages that I found unnecessary, and the cringe-worthy dialogue often made it difficult to continue reading."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While I initially supported Ms. The author's recent writing style, characterized by excessive detail and cringy dialogue, no longer resonates with me. Additionally, the portrayal of Reid as a 21-year-old “man” felt unrealistic and off-putting, making the reverse age gap romance unappealing.",

However, recently I’ve discovered that her writing style is not for me.  \n   - There is so much unnecessary detail that takes up a good 100 extra pages, which I couldn’t care less about.  \n   - The cringy dialogue makes it unbearable to read at times.  \n\n- **Character Development (Reid):**  \n   - I feel like Reid was written to be seen as a confident “man” to make up for the age gap.  \n   - Let’s be real, no guy at 21 acts like that because they are, in fact, still children.  \n   - Reid seemed like one of those weird, obsessive boys who don’t know how to act when they talk to a girl.  \n   - He wasn’t being “possessive”; he was just being weird.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes (Age Gap Romance):**  \n   - I’m all for age gap romance, but reverse age gaps are not for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I initially supported Ms. Micalea Smeltzer and enjoyed her Wildflowers series, her recent writing style, characterized by excessive detail and cringy dialogue, no longer resonates with me.
