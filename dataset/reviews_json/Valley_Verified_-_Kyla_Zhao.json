            "The story starts strong, merging aspects of *The Devil Wears Prada* and *Silicon Valley*, but loses focus as Zoe moves to LA. The introduction of a #MeToo storyline complicates the plot unnecessarily, detracting from the main narrative. Additionally, the ending features an unrealistic business decision that comes across as rushed and unconvincing.",
            "Zoe Zeng begins as a confident fashionista in New York, but her character becomes inconsistent as she regresses into immaturity after moving to LA. The highly educated tech professionals in LA come across as inauthentic and juvenile in their dialogue and behavior. Additionally, the instant friendship that develops between Zoe and a stranger she meets while shopping feels unrealistic and lacks depth.",
            "The writing is clear and easy to follow; however, the tone fluctuates between adult fiction and YA, resulting in a disjointed reading experience. Additionally, the repetitive inclusion of Rebecca Stiles’ articles becomes tedious and interrupts the story's flow.",
            "The depiction of the tech industry and its culture comes across as exaggerated and inauthentic, particularly due to outdated slang and stereotypes. Additionally, the relationship dynamics, especially Zoe's friendships, lack credibility, as her New York friends continue to support her despite her neglectful behavior.",
            "The novel tackles significant themes such as diversity, representation, and female empowerment within the realms of fashion and tech. However, these important messages are often conveyed through stilted and unnatural dialogue. While the exploration of social media and tech culture is relevant, the execution tends to be heavy-handed and lacks nuance."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While *Valley Verified* tackles important and timely themes, its execution falls short due to inconsistent character development, an overly complicated plot, and a lack of authenticity. The novel has moments of fun and insight, but the unrealistic ending and heavy-handed messaging prevent it from reaching its full potential. It’s a mixed bag that might appeal to readers looking for a light, tech-meets-fashion story but may disappoint those seeking deeper emotional resonance or realism.",

While I enjoyed the blend, it felt different from what I initially expected.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - The book felt overly wordy at times, particularly around the 60% mark, where I found myself skipping about 75 pages without losing the essence of the story.  \n   - Despite the pacing issues, the author’s ability to tackle thought-provoking issues kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Reflection:**  \n   - As someone who loves fashion, I appreciated the discussion about high-end brands and the emphasis on personal style and confidence.  \n   - The novel made me reflect on societal biases and the value of all professions, which I found deeply meaningful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Valley Verified* had some pacing issues and felt a bit wordy, it succeeded in addressing important themes and challenging societal stereotypes.

However, Damien's introverted nature and his relationship with Zoe feel underdeveloped; their romance, hinted at throughout, comes across as abrupt and would benefit from further exploration.",
            "This book tackles the often-overlooked issue of gender inequality in the tech industry. It reveals the double standards women face, where men's mistakes are excused while women's are met with harsh criticism. Rebecca Stiles' character illustrates how some women contribute to this problem by undermining their peers, creating a frustrating dynamic. Additionally, Lilian’s character arc highlights the silent struggles that many women endure, including harassment and the fear of professional repercussions. This aspect of the story is particularly thought-provoking.",

Zoe's journey mirrored my own, particularly her complex love-hate relationship with both industries. I shared her passion for the editorial side of fashion, recalling the thrill of attending events, trying new products, and crafting compelling stories. However, like Zoe, I'm acutely aware of the financial challenges this career entails. The depiction of the tech startup world was spot-on, highlighting the steep learning curve, tight deadlines, and high-pressure environment.

The narrative features bold outfits, a Mindy-like best friend, and a plot centered on proving the skeptics wrong.

Additionally, Zoe often receives opportunities without effort, which feels unrealistic and frustrating. While the romance is somewhat developed, it remains secondary to the main plot.",

Zoe's financial situation was inconsistent; she lamented her lack of funds while taking unpaid internships in New York and regularly purchasing designer items. The romantic subplot with Damien was particularly frustrating. Despite Zoe's intelligence and accomplishments, she appeared oblivious to his intentions, which felt unrealistic and poorly handled. The final act, especially regarding Bill, was chaotic. The intended dramatic twist fell flat, leaving me frustrated and wanting more.",

Her best friends are defined only by their fashion quirks and blind loyalty, while her coworkers embody exaggerated tech-bro stereotypes. Bernadette and Lillian struggle under patriarchy, but their experiences lack depth. Zoe's Asian ethnicity is represented through two shallow traits: a sense of filial piety and an incessant craving for boba, neither of which adds meaningful context to her character or the plot. Additionally, her size is mentioned only in passing, without any significant relevance to the story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Tone and Genre Expectations:**\n   - I wish this was satire, young-adult fiction, or something other than completely earnest and genuine. Instead, it felt completely awful and surface-level.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Every character seemed like a caricature, serving only as a purpose in Zoe's life. Her best friends lacked substance beyond their fashion quirks and unwavering loyalty. Her coworkers were exaggerated tech-bro stereotypes, and Bernadette and Lillian were portrayed as suffering under patriarchy without depth.\n\n- **Representation and Identity:**\n   - Zoe's Asian ethnicity was reduced to two shallow elements: filial piety and a constant desire for boba, neither of which contributed meaningfully to her character or story. Her size was also mentioned only in passing, without any significant impact.\n\n- **Plot and Logic:**\n   - The plot, dialogue, and reasoning were vapid and lacked depth. Zoe's financial situation was inconsistent—she complained about being broke but somehow managed unpaid internships in New York and bought designer items regularly.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**\n   - The romantic subplot with Damien was frustrating. Despite Zoe's intelligence and accolades, she seemed oblivious to his intentions, which felt unrealistic and poorly executed.\n\n- **Authenticity of Industry Portrayal:**\n   - As someone with a background in tech marketing and influencer campaigns, I found the portrayal of these industries to be inaccurate and unbearable to read. The book's depiction of these fields was far from realistic.\n\n- **Ending:**\n   - The final act of the book, particularly involving Bill, was a mess. The intended \"hot take\" fell flat and left me wanting to scream in frustration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a disappointing read, with shallow characters, inconsistent logic, and an unrealistic portrayal of industries I know well. The ending was particularly frustrating, and I have no desire to read anything else by Kyla Zhao in the future.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a very low rating, likely 1/5 or 2/5."

            "The plot became engaging once it picked up momentum. I appreciated the theme of girls taking down men, though it occasionally felt oversimplified. The pacing was inconsistent; at times it dragged significantly, but when it was on point, it was truly captivating.",
            "Zoe, the protagonist, struggles with extreme self-confidence issues, which may resonate with some readers but made it difficult for me to connect with her persistent self-doubt and her failure to accept compliments. While the characters and dialogue effectively capture the essence of life in Silicon Valley, they occasionally stray into unnecessary exposition.",
            "The dialogue frequently veered into excessive exposition, particularly on issues like sexual harassment, which seemed redundant for contemporary readers. Given Zoe's background in the New York fashion scene, her lack of prior encounters with inappropriate male behavior felt implausible, contributing to the overall frustration.",
            "The Bay Area and Silicon Valley setting was the highlight of the book for me. It felt authentic and relatable, as I seldom see my everyday environment depicted in literature. The characters, inspired by real-life tech figures, enhanced the story's realism. While non-Silicon Valley readers may miss some of the Easter eggs, they aren't essential to the plot."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Authenticity:**  \n   - The Bay Area and Silicon Valley setting was my favorite part of the book. It felt authentic and relatable, as I rarely get to read about places from my day-to-day life.  \n   - Many characters are based on real-life Tech people or amalgamations, which added to the realism. While non-Silicon Valley readers might not catch all the Easter eggs, they aren’t crucial to the plot.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The plot, once it got going, was engaging. I enjoyed the \"girls take down the men\" theme, though it felt a bit oversimplified at times.  \n   - The pacing was inconsistent—when it dragged, it REALLY dragged, but when it was good, it was REALLY good.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Zoe, the main character, lacked self-confidence to an extreme degree. While this might resonate with some readers, I found it hard to relate to her constant self-doubt and inability to recognize compliments.  \n   - The characters and dialogue were overall great and reflective of real life in Silicon Valley, though they sometimes veered into unnecessary exposition.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Realism:**  \n   - The dialogue often felt overly explanatory, especially regarding topics like sexual harassment, which felt unnecessary for modern readers.  \n   - Zoe’s background in the Fashion world in New York made it hard to believe she hadn’t encountered inappropriate male behavior before, which added to the frustration.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Despite its flaws, I found it to be a good light beach read. The author shows promise, and I would definitely read another book by her, especially if it’s set in Silicon Valley.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had its highs and lows. The Silicon Valley setting and relatable characters were highlights, but the inconsistent pacing, Zoe’s lack of self-confidence, and overly explanatory dialogue detracted from the experience.

Zoe's struggles were palpable; she grapples with her sense of belonging, her place in a new world, and the changes in her old life after leaving.

            "I initially sought this story for its representation of plus-size fashion, and it certainly delivered. However, it exceeded my expectations by exploring themes of passion, identity, and compromise in a deeply relatable manner.

However, the story offered so much more than I expected, exploring themes of passion, identity, and compromise in a way that felt deeply relatable.  \n  - The novel does an excellent job of capturing the tension between loving something so much that it defines your personal and professional life, while also grappling with the reality that the job will never love you back in the same way.  \n\n- **Character Development and Protagonist:**  \n  - I adored following Zoe as a protagonist. Her journey felt authentic and true to life, especially as a coming-of-age-in-your-20s story.  \n  - Zoe’s struggles were palpable and real: she doesn’t know where she belongs, how she fits into her new world, or what her old world will look like now that she’s left. Her negotiation between these two worlds was compelling and relatable.  \n  - I appreciated how Zoe’s worries about relationships—both with new people and those who have been constants in her life—were explored.

While I can take or leave this aspect, it didn’t detract from the overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The novel has a tone reminiscent of early 2000s romcoms, with a *Devil Wears Prada* vibe that works well on multiple levels. It’s lighthearted yet thoughtful, making it an enjoyable read.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  - The audio narration was excellent and helped bring the story to life. No notes there—it added to the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Valley Verified* was a delightful read that exceeded my expectations.

I appreciated that Zoe is mid-sized, offering a refreshing representation.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n   - I expected this novel to be more like *The Devil Wears Prada* meets *Uncanny Valley*, but it turned out to be straightforward chick lit.  \n   - While fans of the genre might enjoy it more than I did, it didn’t fully meet my expectations.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n   - The story follows Zoe Zhang, a fashion journalist who transitions to working at a tech start-up in Silicon Valley.  \n   - The plot is predictable, and I found myself rolling my eyes during the first third of the novel, especially when Zoe seemed overly naive.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Zoe’s initial naivety, such as assuming she could bond with her only female colleague over clothes and gossip, was frustrating.  \n   - However, I appreciated how her character evolved as she reassessed her judgments and grew throughout the story.  \n   - Her friendships with Bram and Austin, the software engineers, were enjoyable to read.  \n\n- **Romantic Sub-plot:**  \n   - The romantic sub-plot is kept light, which I appreciated, as the focus remained on Zoe’s professional challenges.  \n   - However, the development of the love interest felt clunky, particularly in a scene where his character growth is conveyed through a personal essay he shares with Zoe.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite its predictability, the novel is readable, fun, and more intelligent than it initially appears.  \n   - The cover design is gorgeous, which added to my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n   - I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Valley Verified* didn’t fully align with my expectations and had some predictable and clunky moments, it was an enjoyable and intelligent read overall. Zoe’s character development and her evolving friendships were highlights, and the light romantic sub-plot kept the focus on her professional journey. Fans of chick lit will likely appreciate this novel more than I did.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The ending felt rushed, lacking the reactions of Damien and Bram and Austin to Bill's actions, which deserved a dedicated scene. I also would have appreciated a final interaction between Zoe, Lillian, and Bill, showcasing his anger at their retaliation versus their satisfaction in standing up to him. While the twists were effective, particularly the revelation of Bill's sexual harassment and his role in Zoe's trouble with Valley Verified, his deceptively nice demeanor was shocking yet realistic—such men often hide their true natures well. The board's decision to remove Bill solely for financial reasons also resonated as authentic, reflecting how victories in the real world can unfold, even if they feel incomplete.",
            "Zoey and the other characters are likable, particularly Lillian, who adds depth to the story. However, it’s frustrating that Zoey never apologizes to Lillian for her misunderstandings and accusations, while Lillian is quick to apologize herself. Zoey's lack of accountability ultimately detracts from her character development.",
            "The story features some hilarious moments, such as when the CEO of Dreamcatcher humorously claims he's in his \"flop era\" instead of his \"Forbes era.\" That line really made me laugh!"
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, it was a nice read with a pretty cover, likeable characters, and some shocking yet realistic twists. However, the ending felt rushed, and certain character resolutions, like Zoe's lack of apology to Lillian, were disappointing. Despite these flaws, the book had its moments of humor and realism, making it an enjoyable experience.",

Lovely cover art.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Zoey was a likeable character, and so were the other characters. I enjoyed Lillian's character as well.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Realism:**  \n   - The twists were good. Bill being a sexual harasser and being the one to get Zoe in trouble with Valley Verified was shocking. He seems so nice, and him actually being an awful person was shocking.  \n   - It was realistic though, since bad men often seem very likeable.  \n   - The board only voting to kick Bill off due to financial reasons felt very real. It's unfortunate, but at least it shows the characters winning in a way that would likely happen in the real world.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Resolutions:**  \n   - Zoe never apologized to Lillian for her accusations. All the time, Zoe misunderstood her, but she never apologizes for it. Lillian does apologize. Zoe should have done the same.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n   - The ending was rushed. We never see Damien's or Bram and Austin's reaction to what Bill did. That absolutely should have been a scene.  \n   - I would have liked to see Zoe and Lillian get one last interaction with Bill. For him to be angry about what they did, and for them to be happy they got back at him for his awful actions.  \n\n- **Humor and Memorable Moments:**  \n   - It had some hilarious lines, like the CEO of Dreamcatcher saying he was in his flop era when he was supposed to be in his Forbes era. That cracked me up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, it was a nice read with a pretty cover, likeable characters, and some shocking yet realistic twists.

I would have preferred to see Zoe take more time acclimating to Silicon Valley before immersing herself in her new role. This lighthearted yet impactful story resembles a tech-themed version of *The Bold Type*, effectively contrasting the intense work cultures of NYC and Silicon Valley. Following Zoe, a fashion blogger from New York, as she unexpectedly accepts a VP position in fashion marketing at a tech startup, the novel touches on themes of passion, work-life balance, imposter syndrome, and gender inequality in the tech industry.",

However, the interactions among the coworkers, especially with the sole female colleague, felt problematic. The main character chooses to see the worst in almost all her new coworkers, except for two—one of whom ultimately proves to be the worst. As for the other woman in the office, she constantly worries about being judged but spends her time judging and misunderstanding her coworker instead. Instead of trying to connect, she takes everything personally and never stands up for herself. It's hard to believe this character could thrive in the fashion industry, given that she often takes time off to cry rather than confront challenges. This made it difficult for me to fully support her journey.",

She doesn’t even try with her, just takes everything personally.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n   - She never stands up for herself. I have no idea how this character would have survived in the fashion world when all she did was take time off work and cry when things came up. It was a bit hard to root for her.  \n\n- **Representation of IT Industry:**  \n   - I work in IT, and this book felt a bit determined to show the worst sides of it, which I was surprised by. Sure, there are struggles, and some of these things can happen at any company or job, but a lot of this book just felt so negative towards... well, everything.  \n\n- **Strengths and Highlights:**  \n   - There were some truly important conversations brought up in this book.  \n   - I truly loved the friendships and the way everything wrapped up, especially the epilogue—fantastic.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings:**  \n   - TW: gaslighting, bullying, sexual harassment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had elements I truly loved, such as the friendships, the theme of career change, and the satisfying epilogue, I struggled with the negative portrayal of the IT industry, the main character’s lack of growth, and her problematic interactions with coworkers. It’s a book with important conversations, but not one I could highly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The synopsis seemed very intriguing to me, and I was excited to dive into it.\n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**\n   - The book follows Zoe Zeng, a junior fashion editor/writer who takes on a new marketing job at a Silicon Valley startup called FitPick. She successfully launches an influencer campaign, even after her emails were initially ignored. However, the inclusion of Aisha Monroe, who was caught photoshopping her photos, leads to controversies around authenticity and body image issues. The story takes a turn when Bill, the CEO of FitPick, is fired after allegations of sexual harassment and the revelation of his college suspension. Lillian, the COO, eventually rebrands FitPick with Zoe and their coworkers.\n\n- **Tone and Enjoyment:**\n   - I loved how positive and lighthearted the entire story was. It was a quick and easy read, and the interactions between Zoe and Damien were particularly charming.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Zoe Zeng is a relatable and dynamic protagonist. Her journey from a junior fashion editor to a key player in a tech startup is engaging. The supporting characters, like Damien and Lillian, add depth to the story.\n\n- **Critiques and Questions:**\n   - One critique I have is the lack of preparation in pitching the app's profitability. Zoe was brought on to convince Logan Horossen to invest, yet they didn't anticipate his questions about profits and numbers in their business model. Additionally, I found it odd that Rebecca Stiles kept writing about FitPick. Despite her harsh reviews of new startups, it seemed unrealistic that she would focus so much on FitPick, as if it were the only tech startup worth discussing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this book was a delightful and engaging read with a positive and lighthearted tone. While there were a few plot points that left me questioning, the story was enjoyable, and the characters were well-developed.

However, it was engaging enough for me to complete, unlike other books I’ve abandoned recently.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2/5 stars"

The blossoming romance between Zoey and Damien was a highlight, and I loved how she won over Bram and Austin.

I would have preferred to see their relationship evolve earlier, akin to Elle and Vivian's dynamic in *Legally Blonde*.

It feels like a secondary plotline that doesn't significantly enhance the narrative. The focus is on Zoe Zeng, who moves from a fashion editorial position to a high-level role at a fashion app startup in Silicon Valley. The central theme revolves around Zoe learning to navigate a cutthroat, male-dominated environment as she strives to establish herself as a #girlboss in this coming-of-age tale.",
            "As the story unfolded, Zoe's character increasingly frustrated me. She came across as naive and showed little growth, particularly in her interactions with her colleagues, especially Lillian. Her immature behavior and decision-making often made her seem more like a teenager than a professional in a high-stakes environment. In contrast, the side characters, particularly Bernadette, were far more compelling, and I would love to read a book centered on her story.",

However, I remain interested in the author’s debut novel, as I've heard good things about it. The story engaged me until about the halfway point, after which I began skimming.

In the latter part, the introduced conflicts seem abrupt and disconnected, disrupting the overall flow of the narrative. The story centers on Zoe Zeng, a young professional in the fashion industry who feels burnt out and underappreciated. A chance encounter prompts her to quit her job and relocate to Silicon Valley to pursue a new chapter in the tech world. The premise is engaging, and the comparisons to *Legally Blonde* are apt as Zoe navigates the challenges of being out of her element in a new environment.",

The banter with her new coworkers stands out, highlighting her knack for forming meaningful relationships.

However, I would have liked to see more one-on-one moments between Zoe and Damien to deepen their connection.",

Although the narrative concludes on a hopeful note with Zoe and Lilian receiving the justice they deserve, it's crucial to recognize that this was not driven by the board’s genuine concern for the women or Bill’s flawed ethics.

This made some of the twists and turns less surprising.\n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics:**  \n  The trigger warning at the start of the book made me wary, but thankfully, nothing truly devastating happened to the female characters. However, the sexual harassment and misogyny they faced were portrayed explicitly and should never be taken lightly. The author did a good job of addressing these issues and explaining the situations clearly.\n\n- **Resolution and Justice:**  \n  While the story ends on a positive note with Zoe and Lilian getting the justice they deserve, it’s important to note that this justice wasn’t driven by the board of directors’ genuine concern for the women or Bill’s flawed values. Instead, it was motivated by their own financial interests, as the author explicitly points out. The board could have just as easily fired Lilian and Zoe, given their deep-rooted biases against women’s capabilities.\n\n- **Workplace Environment and Ethics:**  \n  To answer one of the discussion questions at the end of the book, I would not choose to work at FitPick. The board’s lack of genuine support for its management team, especially women, makes it an unattractive workplace. However, I also recognize that such situations are unfortunately common across many companies and industries, making them hard to avoid.\n\n- **Unresolved Questions and Future Implications:**  \n  The story leaves me wondering if Bill will attempt to take revenge and reclaim the company he founded. Additionally, I’m curious about the history of how Lilian and Bill met, as this backstory wasn’t fully explored.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book effectively addresses important issues like sexual harassment and misogyny, though the plot’s predictability and the board’s self-serving motives for justice left me with mixed feelings.

She took a bold leap, leaving her friends and life in New York behind for a fresh start. Initially, her new colleagues were unkind, but Zoe's resilience shone through as she found her confidence in a challenging environment.

This book had the same fluff as TFS, except it focused on normal people with a reasonable amount of money and unreasonable working hours, which made it less interesting.  \n\n- **Character Development (Zoe’s Struggles):**  \n  I vaguely liked Zoe’s struggle with work validation, fulfillment, and her adaptation to a completely new environment. However, these themes felt pretty vanilla and didn’t stand out as particularly compelling.  \n\n- **Exploration of Workplace Gender Issues:**  \n  One thing this book does better than TFS is its attempt to tackle serious workplace gender issues. The microaggressions were plausible, but I hated how the sexual harassment was written. There’s no way any woman lives in complete indifference to a man’s advances—survival instinct should kick in! It infuriated me that Zoe was completely unaware of the big boss’s intentions and misinterpreted her colleague’s protective actions as workplace competition. I don’t believe there’s a real-life woman who carries zero underlying fear of how men might exploit her in any situation.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance was cute, though not the most convincing or intense. Damien sounds like a great guy, and I can see how he and Zoe gel together. However, the author made me do a lot of the work to connect with their relationship.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Effort:**  \n  This book was a bit stupid, but I give it credit for trying to address serious themes. It just needs to do better in execution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel has its strengths, particularly in attempting to address workplace gender issues, it falls short in execution, especially in its portrayal of sexual harassment and character depth. The romance is cute but underdeveloped, and the story lacks the intensity and believability needed to fully engage the reader.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25/5"

I loved the overall tone and style, which made it highly engaging and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The conversations surrounding sustainable and inclusive fashion, feminism, and female empowerment in a male-dominated industry were particularly compelling. I also appreciated the exploration of AI as both a productive and disruptive force, as well as the theme of finding oneself amidst and outside of career choices.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Zoe’s internal rivalry and grudge with Lillian felt unnecessary and out of place. It wasn’t very “girl’s girl” of her, and it was embarrassing to witness. However, I was glad to see her grow out of that mindset by the end of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was an enjoyable read with strong themes of empowerment, sustainability, and self-discovery. While the subplot involving Zoe’s rivalry with Lillian detracted from the overall experience, her eventual growth made up for it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 🌟"
