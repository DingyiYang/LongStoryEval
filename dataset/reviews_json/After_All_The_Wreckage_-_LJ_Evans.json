            "This book is best enjoyed without any prior knowledge, as it is filled with twists and connections that enhance the reading experience. The emphasis is more on the mysteries and inconsistencies than on romance, which I found surprisingly refreshing. The payoff is truly jaw-dropping when all the pieces finally come together. The story centers on two main mysteries: Rory’s mother’s suspicious accident, which has left her in a hospital for the past year, and the disappearance of Gage’s brother, who has been having visions of the future. The link between these events drives the plot, compelling Rory and Gage to collaborate in solving the mysteries and rescuing Gage’s brother.",

            "This book skillfully weaves together several captivating tropes, including small-town romance, romantic suspense, single parenthood, and the journey from childhood friends to lovers. The story features a spirited female protagonist who is a private investigator and a brooding male lead who owns a bar. With its emotional depth and palpable angst, this read offers a satisfying blend of tension and romance."

The mystery element keeps the plot engaging, although I found myself wishing for a deeper understanding of the *Veronica Mars* references to fully appreciate certain aspects. Centered on Rory Marlowe Bishop and Gage Palmer, two young adults who have faced significant hardships and been thrust into adulthood prematurely, the novel delves into themes of family responsibility, young adult angst, and the challenges of growing up too soon.

Both characters are relatable and well-developed, showcasing their resilience and dedication to family.
