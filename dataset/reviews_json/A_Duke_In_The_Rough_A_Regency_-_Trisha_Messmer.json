            "The book was tedious and repetitive, centered around a country party that spans just a few days. Unfortunately, the plot meanders through 37 chapters without much excitement or variation. The pacing is slow, and the narrative fails to deliver engaging developments.",
            "The main characters, Drake and Honoria, lack depth and can be frustrating. Drake's incessant lamenting over Honoria's past rejection becomes tiresome, and his choice to disguise himself as Simon instead of revealing his identity as the Duke feels unnecessary and clichéd. Meanwhile, Honoria appears passive and reluctant, resembling more of a rag doll than an engaging character.",
            "The dialogue in the story was both repetitive and melodramatic. The characters frequently lamented their past and present, with Drake fixating on Honoria’s rejection and Honoria obsessing over his perceived lack of love. This back-and-forth felt shallow and did not contribute meaningful emotional depth to the narrative.",

The story revolves around a country party that lasts only a few days, and the plot drags on for 37 chapters without much excitement or variation. The pacing was slow, and the narrative lacked engaging developments.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters, Drake and Honoria, were frustrating and one-dimensional. Drake’s constant whining about Honoria rejecting him in the past became tiresome, and his deception about his identity (pretending to be Simon instead of the Duke) felt unnecessary and overused. Honoria, on the other hand, came across as passive and unwilling, resembling a \"rag doll\" rather than a dynamic character.\n\n- **Dialogue and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The dialogue was repetitive and melodramatic. Both characters repeatedly lamented their past and present situations, with Drake fixating on Honoria’s rejection and Honoria obsessing over Drake’s supposed lack of love for her. This back-and-forth felt shallow and failed to add meaningful emotional depth to the story.\n\n- **Unique Elements:**  \n  The fact that Drake is a virgin could have been an interesting twist, but it did little to alleviate the overall monotony and lack of substance in the plot. The setting of a country party also felt limiting and uninspired.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel was a disappointing read due to its repetitive plot, lackluster character development, and overly dramatic dialogue. The story failed to engage or provide meaningful emotional depth, making it feel like a tedious and unexciting experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "This book marks the beginning of the author's new series, a spin-off from previous works. For optimal enjoyment, it's highly recommended to read the earlier series first, as many main and side characters make appearances, fostering a sense of familiarity. The integration of familiar names enhances continuity throughout the narrative.\n\nWhile the reveal at the end is somewhat predictable, it is approached with humor and forgiveness from the party guests. I found the public proposal scene emotional but wished for a more triumphant resolution. However, the resolution of Honoria’s thwarted courtships and her ultimate defiance against her parents' expectations is deeply satisfying.\n\nThe story centers on Drake's return as a newly minted duke and his quest to win Honoria's heart amidst societal pressures. The identity deception trope—where Drake poses as the duke's man of business while his friend Simon pretends to be the duke—is well executed, despite my usual reservations about such tropes. Additionally, a subplot involving *The Muckraker* gossip rag adds intrigue.\n\nThe pacing of the story is engaging, like a kiddie roller coaster with consistent highs and lows that keep the reader invested. The balance between dialogue and introspection is spot on, contributing significantly to the book’s charm and readability.",
            "In this book, Lady Honoria Bell, a character from a previous series, finally finds her second-chance romance. Drake Merrick, a loyal and humble man, grapples with resentment and an internal struggle: he desires Honoria's love for who he is, not just for his new title. This conflict adds depth to his character.\n\nHonoria's growth is striking as she confronts her parents and faces her fears, demonstrating her strength and independence. New characters, including Drake’s mother, sister, and Aunt Kitty, infuse humor and richness into the narrative. Additionally, the interactions within Honoria’s circle of friends enhance the story with layers of camaraderie and support.",
            "The romance between Drake and Honoria serves as the heart of the story, enriched by their history and unresolved feelings. The love scene is mild, earning a rating of 2 on my steam scale, which is consistent with the author’s signature style."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*A Duke in the Rough* is a charming and well-paced historical romance that successfully introduces new characters and dynamics. The story’s blend of romance, humor, and intrigue, along with its strong character development and continuity, makes it an enjoyable read. Despite some minor quibbles with the ending, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and look forward to future works by the author.",

            "In this story, the main characters, Drake and Honoria, are well-developed yet frustrating due to their pride and fear, which lead to unnecessary conflict. Honoria's failure to offer a genuine apology and Drake's struggle to forgive and trust impede their relationship's growth. In contrast, side characters like Simon and Aunt Kitty shine, bringing wit, humor, and depth to the narrative. However, Anne, one of Honoria's friends, feels underdeveloped, appearing spoiled, immature, and superficial.",

The prolonged emphasis on longing and misconceptions overshadowed the expression of love, making the narrative feel dragged out.",
            "The romance between Drake and Honoria was marred by angst and misunderstandings, which stifled genuine affection.

Despite these issues, the story had its bright spots, particularly in the side characters, but the slow pacing and lack of romance limited its appeal.",

            "The story is charming and wholesome until about the 80% mark, which may not satisfy readers looking for higher steam. While Drake's deception and the gradual unveiling of his true identity add tension, they also lead to some frustration.",
            "Honoria's journey to finding love is both satisfying and meaningful, particularly in light of her past struggles. The slow-burn romance between Drake and Honoria is effectively drawn out, enhancing the tension surrounding Drake’s deception. The introduction of Aunt Kitty, Charlotte, and Simon adds depth, with Charlotte and Simon’s dynamic proving especially engaging.\n\nHowever, some elements detract from the overall experience. Honoria's father’s harsh attitude toward Drake feels unjustified and undermines the story. Additionally, Drake’s motivations for his deception are unclear and inconsistent, especially considering Honoria’s genuine feelings for him. His unwillingness to end an absurd engagement out of pride contrasts poorly with the expectations he places on Honoria. Meanwhile, Anne, the social-climbing fiancée, remains underdeveloped, rendering her actions somewhat contrived.",
