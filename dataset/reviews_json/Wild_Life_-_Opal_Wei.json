He inadvertently takes an important slide‚Äîthough the mechanics of this are unclear‚Äîand it ends up in a crate sent to his island. Instead of simply mailing it back, Zoey decides to travel to the island to retrieve it herself.

Additionally, the introduction of an unnecessary villain in the third act, along with multiple underdeveloped side plots and characters, made the narrative feel convoluted and rushed.",

Instead, the narrative felt more like a visit to a wealthy person's estate, with sporadic storms that failed to create the survival tension I anticipated. I would have preferred a longer stay on the island to enhance the sense of isolation and interdependence among the characters.",
            "I found the heroine unlikable; while I didn‚Äôt outright hate her, her excessive judgmentality‚Äîespecially regarding money and her assumptions about others‚Äîirritated me. The hero, though sweet and charming, came across as overly easygoing, which overshadowed his anxiety and diminished his character's depth. I also expected more focus on the family, but they felt underutilized in the narrative.",

While I didn‚Äôt hate her, I found her overly judgmental, especially about money and her preconceived notions of others before they could even show their true character. This aspect of her personality irked me.  \n\n- **Characterization (Hero):**  \n  The hero was sweet and charming, but he felt a little too easygoing. His niceness made his anxiety seem less significant than it should have been, which diminished the depth of his character.  \n\n- **Plot Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I think I misread the back cover or misinterpreted the vibe. I expected an adventurous, survivalist story akin to *Indiana Jones*, *Crocodile Dundee*, *Blue Lagoon*, or *Romancing the Stone*, where the characters would be stranded and rely on each other. Instead, the story felt more like visiting a rich person‚Äôs house, with occasional storms that didn‚Äôt fully deliver the survivalist tension I anticipated. I would have preferred if they stayed longer on the island to deepen the sense of isolation and reliance on each other.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamic:**  \n  Despite my reservations, I liked the pairing of the two main characters. Their dynamic as Type A and Type B personalities worked well, and they complemented each other in meaningful ways. She needed someone to care for her since she was always caring for others, and he needed someone to care for because people often underestimated his ability to do so.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  I thought the family would have more screen time, but they felt underutilized in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel and the relationship between the two main characters, even though the plot didn‚Äôt fully meet my expectations and some characterizations fell short. It was an engaging read, but there were missed opportunities to deepen the story and its themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I was so happy that she went to the island with Davy, and I loved watching them fall in love and figure out different things about themselves.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**  \n  However, after the big incident with Davy‚Äôs island neighbor and the subsequent return to the island with George, I just lost interest.  \n\n- **Character Chemistry and Focus:**  \n  In summary, the chemistry between the two main characters alone was so good, but when others got involved, I lost interest. I think this is just me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel started strong with a beautiful cover, engaging character dynamics, and a compelling romance. However, the introduction of additional characters and plot twists later in the story diminished my interest.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "The story begins with a catalyst‚Äîthe research slide‚Äîthat pushes Zoey out of her comfort zone. While the pacing is generally strong, the week-long timeline for the romance feels somewhat unrealistic.",
            "Zoey is a chaotic, indecisive, and emotionally complex character, enhanced by her unique habit of labeling her thoughts with a TM. In contrast, Davy is quieter and steadier, providing a grounding presence. His anxiety is portrayed with sensitivity, and his aspiration to create an animal sanctuary is both compelling and well-developed. Both characters feel authentic, and their struggles with mental health, career transitions, and life choices resonate, particularly with readers in a similar age group. The romance is both passionate and intellectually grounded, showcasing a mature and natural relationship as they support each other through their challenges. However, the week-long timeline for their romance felt rushed, and the \"I love yous\" came too soon for my taste. Despite this, the characters' growth and mutual support ultimately redeemed the relationship for me. Representation includes a Chinese-Canadian MC dealing with burnout and a Taiwanese-Canadian MC with anxiety.

Although she appears dissatisfied with her job as a cancer researcher, she spends much of the narrative grappling with whether to continue in that role, never clearly articulating her true desires.

The book is well-written, with dynamic characters and great plot pacing. Wei‚Äôs writing style is fun and easy to read.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are dynamic and well-developed.

For example, in the film, Cary Grant‚Äôs character is trying to retrieve a dinosaur bone, while here, Zoey is trying to recover a slide of a cancer bone, which is why she ends up stuck on the island with Davy. I also think Davy‚Äôs name is a clever callback to Cary Grant‚Äôs character, David Huxley.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*WILD LIFE* is a good read that balances spice, humor, and heartfelt sincerity.

Davy, a former boyband member, struggles with anxiety and past drug use, which derailed his life. Despite being naturally people-oriented, he isolates himself on a private island, focusing on wildlife rescue to avoid causing harm or embarrassment to those he cares about. His concern for Zoey and fear of messing things up for her added depth to his character.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both Zoey and Davy are complex, well-rounded characters. Zoey‚Äôs journey of self-discovery and her evolving feelings for Davy were particularly engaging. Davy‚Äôs backstory, including his struggles with anxiety and his decision to live as a hermit, made him a sympathetic and relatable character. His dedication to wildlife rescue also added a unique layer to his personality.\n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The Canadian setting was fantastic and added a refreshing backdrop to the story.

            "The novel surprised me by prioritizing the romantic relationship between Davy and Zoey over the anticipated animal-focused narrative.

However, I did enjoy Zoey's character; her quirky charm added a delightful touch to the story.",

The rushed romance was a drawback, but Zoey‚Äôs personality and the comedic geese made up for some of the disappointment.",
