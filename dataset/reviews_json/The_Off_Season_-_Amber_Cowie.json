The atmosphere is heightened by relentless rain, flooding, and the isolation brought on by unreliable Wi-Fi and phone service.",

Unfortunately, the ending feels rushed, leaving me unsatisfied. While I appreciate open-ended conclusions, this one lacked the context or closure needed to feel complete.",

Their dialogue and conflicts felt repetitive, often rehashing the same issues without any progression. The interactions lacked emotional depth and realistic reactions, particularly from Jane, Dom, and Murray, which made their exchanges feel flat.",

The characters were unhinged and toxic, yet compelling enough to keep me turning the pages.  \n   - I loved the unpredictability of the characters, which made me want to keep reading.  \n   - The mystery surrounding Jane’s actions was intriguing and kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Setting and Aesthetic:**  \n   - The cover design with the running raindrops was visually appealing and perfect for the story’s vibe.  \n   - I appreciated the Canadian setting (British Columbia) and the references to Vancouver, as it felt personal and relatable.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - Mickey and Fraser the cat were standout characters and highlights of the story.  \n   - However, the adult characters (Jane, Dom, and Sienna) felt one-dimensional. Their dialogue and conflicts were repetitive, with the same issues being rehashed without progression.  \n   - The lack of emotional depth and realistic reactions from the characters, especially Jane, Dom, and Murray, made their interactions feel flat.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n   - The beginning was slow, with overly detailed descriptions of the setting that felt excessive and made me want to skip ahead.  \n   - The middle section was well-paced and engaging.  \n   - The ending felt rushed and left me unsatisfied. While I enjoy open-ended conclusions, this one needed more context or closure to feel complete.  \n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n   - The dialogue between the adult characters came off as juvenile and lacked complexity.  \n   - Conversations were repetitive and didn’t evolve, making the characters feel stagnant.  \n   - There was a lack of emotional reactions or realistic responses, especially during shocking moments, which made the dialogue feel unnatural.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was a mix of enjoyment and frustration. While the unhinged characters and unpredictable plot kept me engaged, the slow start, rushed ending, and lack of depth in the dialogue and character development detracted from the experience. The Canadian setting and aesthetic were highlights, but the repetitive and juvenile dialogue left much to be desired.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her secrets and obsessive tendencies reveal a more complex character. Although her naivety and blind trust in Dom and Sienna can be frustrating, they add depth to her portrayal.

            "The first half of the book felt slow, largely due to an overemphasis on setting descriptions.

Their frustrating decisions sparked lively discussions in our read-along group, resembling a train wreck—you simply couldn’t look away.",

It created a unique and atmospheric backdrop for the story.  \n  - However, the descriptions of the setting were overly detailed and lengthy, which made the first half of the book feel slow and dragged out. I even found myself skipping over some of these sections.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  - The first half of the book was slow-moving, primarily due to the excessive focus on setting descriptions.  \n  - The pace significantly improved in the second half, and I became more invested in the story.  \n  - That said, the big reveal took a little too long to unfold, even though I ultimately guessed what was going to happen.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The characters were the standout element of the book for me. Every character was toxic, unlikable, and completely unhinged, which made them fascinating to read about.  \n  - Their decisions and actions were often frustrating, but they sparked lively discussions in our readalong group. It felt like watching a train wreck—you couldn’t look away.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  - I highly recommend reading *The Off Season* as a buddy read, readalong, or as part of a book club.

It’s been a fantastic summer of reading, and I’m thankful for the opportunity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Off Season* was a mixed experience for me.

The final two chapters seemed rushed and left many questions unresolved. The novel effectively blends mystery and suspense, centered around Jane Duvall's quest to uncover secrets about her husband and the enigmatic Ventura Hotel. The hotel’s history of strange disappearances added an intriguing layer, heightening my curiosity about past events. However, the abrupt ending ultimately fell flat, leaving me feeling unsatisfied.",

            "The novel incorporates several thriller elements, such as mysterious notes, looming dangers, and a storm that cuts off the bridge, yet these components feel disjointed and lack a solid emotional core. While the mysteries surrounding Dom's ex-wife's death, the hotel owner's son, and other local fatalities add intrigue, they fail to fully engage me. The protagonist's constant emotional shifts hinder my understanding of her motivations and diminish my investment in her journey. As a result, I struggled to care about her relationships and the dangers she faced. Although the major reveals were unexpected, the lack of a strong emotional connection to the characters diluted their impact.",
            "I struggled to connect with the characters, particularly the heroine. Her fascination with the Venaventura Hotel and her attraction to Dom felt unconvincing. The relationship between the main character and Dom lacked emotional depth, making it difficult to invest in their struggles, including Sienna's behavior. Sienna came off as bratty, and both she and Dom seemed to need family therapy. Additionally, Mickey, the main character's best friend, felt more like a plot device than a fully developed character, primarily serving to convey information.",

            "The novel began with a compelling premise but soon faltered due to excessive melodrama and implausible twists. The pacing slowed as it became mired in snarky, repetitive interview-style arguments. The convoluted twists and cyclical accusations of deceit dragged on, undermining the narrative's momentum. Ultimately, the plot felt contrived, and Jane's struggles lacked a satisfying resolution.",
            "Jane's character was frustrating to watch, as she often seemed to lack agency, getting pushed around by others. The conniving stepdaughter and easily manipulated father came across as one-dimensional caricatures, relying on overused tropes. This lack of depth made it difficult to connect with the characters. However, the book does feature diverse representation, including Canadian, second-generation Chilean, second-generation Chinese, cis, nonbinary, and hetero characters with varying skin tones.",
            "The writing lacked fluidity, but the detailed descriptions partially compensated for this shortcoming. I appreciated the third-person narration, as I prefer not to delve too deeply into a character's mind through first-person perspectives. The vivid and immersive world-building, complete with floorplans and layouts, was a highlight. Initially, the book exuded a spooky, psychological atmosphere, but it eventually devolved into a cringeworthy soap opera. The mood was characterized by industrial detergent, stale coffee, wooden beams, and a damp chill, perfectly reflecting the isolated, dark setting. While the tension surrounding Jane's realization of her dysfunctional family was compelling, it ultimately became overshadowed by melodrama.",

However, these elements can feel exaggerated and overly dramatic. Content warnings include car crashes, public shaming, pandemic experiences, parental loss, sexual harassment, theft, and more."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The novel started strong but quickly lost my interest due to over-the-top drama and unconvincing twists.\n   - The story dragged on with endless snark and repetitive interview-style arguments.\n   - Convoluted twists and back-and-forth accusations about who is lying or at fault went in circles for far too long.\n   - The plot felt convenient rather than organic, with no real resolution for Jane’s struggles.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Jane’s character was frustrating to watch as she got pushed around with no agency.\n   - The conniving stepdaughter and easily manipulated dad felt like one-dimensional caricatures from an overused trope.\n   - The characters lacked depth, making it hard to connect with them.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The writing didn’t flow easily, but the detailed descriptions made up for it to some extent.\n   - The third-person narration worked well for me, as I’m not a fan of being too deep in a character’s mind via first-person narration.\n   - The descriptive world-building, including floorplans and layouts, was vivid and immersive.\n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**\n   - The book had a spooky, psychological vibe initially but devolved into a cringey soap opera.\n   - The mood was industrial detergent, stale coffee, wooden beams, and a damp chill air, which matched the isolated, dark setting.\n   - The tension around Jane realizing she’s stuck in a dysfunctional family was compelling but ultimately overshadowed by melodrama.\n\n- **Themes and Content:**\n   - The story explored themes of withholding, relationship dynamics, and survival.\n   - It touched on toxic family dynamics, gaslighting, and abusive behavior, but these elements felt exaggerated and over-the-top.\n   - Content warnings include car crashes, public shaming, pandemic memories, loss of a parent, sexual harassment, theft, and more.\n\n- **Setting:**\n   - The novel is set just north of Chilliwack, BC, Canada, during fall/winter, with a dark and stormy night isolated by a snowstorm.\n   - The setting added to the atmosphere but couldn’t save the story from its flaws.\n\n- **Representation:**\n   - The book includes diverse representation, such as Canadian, second-generation Chilean, second-generation Chinese, cis, nonbinary, and hetero characters with varying skin tones.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel had a strong start and vivid descriptive writing, it ultimately fell flat due to its over-the-top drama, unconvincing twists, and one-dimensional characters. The psychological tension and atmospheric setting were promising but were overshadowed by melodrama and repetitive plot points. The story’s potential was undermined by its lack of depth and resolution, making it a frustrating read overall.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Energy: Trifling. Miserable. Isolated. 🐺 Growls\n- Mood: Industrial detergent. Stale coffee scent. Wooden beams. Roaring river. Damp chill air. Grilled cheese. Snowstorm. Snark."

Dom's reluctance to discuss his late wife, Melissa, only deepens his mysterious and unlikable character. Meanwhile, his teenage daughter Sienna is manipulative and cruel, with her behavior going unchecked by Dom, further distancing me from the characters. Overall, none of them are particularly relatable: Jane appears naive, Dom is overly secretive and controlling, and Sienna is outright unpleasant.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Jane, the narrator, is a documentary producer focusing on true crime, yet she fails to recognize the red flags in her own life. Her decisions, such as marrying a widower she barely knows and agreeing not to look into each other's pasts, are questionable.  \n  - Dom (Jane's husband) and Sienna (Dom's teenage daughter) are underdeveloped characters. While I felt some sympathy for Sienna, Jane's contempt for her made it hard to connect with her.  \n  - Jane's insensitivity and lack of empathy, particularly in her response to Sienna's bulimia and her unrealistic expectations of Sienna accepting her as a stepmother, made her an unlikable protagonist.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story felt predictable, and I kept waiting for a plot twist that never came. Jane's lack of self-awareness and the absence of significant character growth made the narrative frustrating.  \n  - The mystery and deaths surrounding the remote hotel in Canada were overshadowed by Jane's self-centeredness, making it hard to root for her to solve the case.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  - The book explores themes of grief, family dynamics, and self-awareness, but these are undermined by Jane's insensitivity and the lack of depth in other characters.  \n  - The tone is frustrating and often bleak, with little redemption or resolution to make the journey worthwhile.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  - I found myself more invested in the stray cats mentioned occasionally than in the human characters.  \n  - The book was ultimately predictable and unsatisfying, leaving me relieved when it ended.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had potential with its setting and premise, but the unlikable protagonist, underdeveloped characters, and predictable plot made it a frustrating read. Jane's insensitivity and lack of growth overshadowed the mystery, leaving me disconnected and unengaged.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Character Development: 2/5  \n- Plot and Pacing: 2/5  \n- Themes and Tone: 3/5  \n- Engagement and Enjoyment: 2/5  \n- Overall Rating: 2/5"

            "This story is action-packed, suspenseful, and genuinely unsettling, keeping me guessing until the very end. The mysteries surrounding Dom’s first wife's death, the disappearance of seasonal workers, and the eerie notes and noises left me eagerly turning the pages for answers.",
            "The characters in the story are largely unlikable, which enhances its overall atmosphere. Dom, the husband, appears as a misogynist lacking both conviction and parenting skills. Sienna is portrayed as cruel, naive, and sullen. Although Peter is not present often, his lurking presence adds an unsettling mystery to the narrative.",

            "Set in Chilliwack, the story's flooding scenario resonates deeply with me, as it reflects a real and pressing danger from recent history. The off-the-grid setting, combined with the raging storm and rising floodwaters, heightens the intensity and fear throughout the plot, fostering a palpable sense of isolation and escalating danger."

            "The story hinges on Jane and Dom's impulsive decision to marry without truly knowing each other. While the reveals were clever, the pacing felt overly slow; it took too long to get to them. The book is filled with meandering conversations and enigmatic events that leave characters puzzled. I appreciate a slow burn, but with so much to explore, earlier revelations would have significantly enhanced the narrative.",
            "I struggled to connect with the two main characters, primarily because they got married after just four months of knowing each other, which I found incredibly foolish. Their persistent lack of common sense throughout the book was frustrating, and the absurdity of their conversations and actions diminished my enjoyment of the story.",

Initially, the time jumps between chapters bothered me, but I later recognized their intentionality, which added a unique narrative layer I hadn't encountered before. I'm uncertain about the ending, particularly the final chapter, which felt open-ended—presumably by design. It left me curious about the future of the characters, especially Dom, Sienna, and Jane, as well as whether Mickey's next project will connect back to the hotel. The author skillfully kept me guessing as Jane unraveled the hotel's strange occurrences.",

I wanted to mother her, as she was clearly distressed and in need of her mom.\n   - Jane, the protagonist, was my least favorite character. She came across as self-centered, incessant, and egotistical—a Karen in the making. However, her annoyingness kept me entertained and played a role in her survival.\n   - Mickey, Jane's business partner, was my favorite character. They were the kind of friend who goes to great lengths to uncover secrets and scandals, adding a lot of intrigue to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Twists:**\n   - The plot twist reveal felt a bit obvious, given the buildup of scandal. It lacked the \"gasp\" factor I was hoping for. However, the consequences of the reveal more than made up for the underwhelming moment of truth.\n\n- **Favorite Scene:**\n   - The drama surrounding the necklace Sierra gave Jane was pure gold. It perfectly captured the Gen Z aversion to millennials and added a layer of humor and tension.\n\n- **Overall Appeal:**\n   - The novel is sexy, thrilling, and intense, making it a great recommendation for fans of 90-minute Lifetime movies and short, sweet Agatha Christie-style mysteries.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*The Off Season* is a gripping and intense novel with well-crafted characters and a fast-paced plot. While the plot twist could have been more surprising, the overall story and character dynamics kept me thoroughly entertained. Despite disliking the protagonist, Jane, her flaws added to the story's intrigue. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspenseful, dramatic tales.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Engagement and Pacing: 5/5  \n- Character Dynamics: 4/5  \n- Plot and Twists: 3.5/5  \n- Overall Appeal: 4.5/5"

The isolated setting, combined with a huge storm that knocks down the only escape route (the bridge), creates a tense and claustrophobic environment.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story starts strong, with things going downhill quickly for the newly married couple and the husband’s teenage daughter. However, certain parts of the plot dragged on for me, and I found myself wanting the story to just get to the point at times.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Jane, the main character, becomes very paranoid very quickly, which makes her a great potential unreliable narrator. This adds an intriguing layer to the story.  \n\n- **Suspense and Thrills:**  \n  There are a lot of spooky elements in the book, and the tension is well-executed. I don’t usually have issues reading thrillers at night, but this one made it hard for me to read before bed!  \n\n- **Local Familiarity (for Vancouver readers):**  \n  For those familiar with Vancouver and the surrounding areas, the novel includes recognizable neighborhoods and locations, which adds a nice touch of realism and connection.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Off Season* is a gripping and atmospheric thriller with a strong sense of tension and an intriguing unreliable narrator.

It was fun to recognize familiar places and events, especially since I’m from the area.  \n\n- **Use of Real-Life Tragedy:**  \n   - I was deeply disturbed by the author’s decision to include a real unsolved murder in the story. This felt incredibly disrespectful to the victim’s friends and family. The author specifically referenced a true crime without obtaining consent from the affected family, which is not trauma-informed and comes across as insensitive. Given that the author is from the same location as the crime, it’s highly likely that readers who know the victim or their family could be hurt by this inclusion.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters were poorly developed and unengaging. I found them to be unrelatable and lacking depth.  \n\n- **Plot Quality:**  \n   - The plot was disappointing and poorly executed. It failed to hold my interest or deliver a compelling narrative.  \n\n- **Author Communication:**  \n   - I reached out to the author to express my concerns about the inclusion of the real-life crime before leaving this review. Unfortunately, I received no response, which further added to my disappointment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the local setting and references to real events added a layer of authenticity, the inclusion of a real unsolved murder was deeply disrespectful and overshadowed any positive aspects of the book.
