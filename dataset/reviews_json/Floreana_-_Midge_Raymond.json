            "This novel unfolds through the perspectives of Dore in 1929 and Mallory in 2020, both set on Floreana, a small island in the Galapagos archipelago. Dore's chapters captivated me more, as she is among the island's first settlers escaping her life in Berlin. In contrast, I found Mallory's chapters less engaging due to their reliance on telling rather than showing, a style I find less appealing. The middle section of the book drags, weighed down by mundane details, but the vivid setting descriptions and insights into animal conservation efforts maintained my interest. While one of the revelations was predictable, the others provided well-executed surprises that enriched the narrative.",
            "This book tackles sensitive subjects, including infertility, miscarriage, animal death, infidelity, grief, murder, and child loss. It thoughtfully portrays the struggles of infertility and multiple sclerosis, adding depth to its themes.",
            "The story delves into profound themes of grief, motherhood, environmental issues, and the essence of humanity. It offers an emotional reading experience, drawing striking parallels between the two women, despite the century that separates their lives.",
            "I appreciated discovering the real-life inspiration behind the story and the conservation efforts on Floreana. The connection to actual events added an intriguing depth to the narrative."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a compelling and emotional read, despite some pacing issues and a preference for one POV over the other. The atmospheric setting, thematic depth, and surprising twists made it a memorable experience, especially for those interested in historical and environmental narratives.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narrative Structure and POVs:**  \n  The novel is told through two POVs and timelines: Dore in 1929 and Mallory in 2020. Both women’s stories take place on Floreana, a small island in the Galapagos archipelago. I found Dore’s chapters more compelling, as she is one of the first settlers on Floreana, escaping her life in Berlin. Mallory’s chapters, however, were harder to engage with because they relied more on telling rather than showing, which I personally don’t enjoy.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The middle of the novel slumped a bit, becoming slower-paced and bogged down with mundane details. However, the atmospheric setting descriptions and insights into animal conservation efforts kept me interested.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The story explores profound themes such as grief, motherhood, environmental issues, and what it means to be human. It was an emotional read, with many parallels drawn between the two women despite the century that separates their lives.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Secrets:**  \n  One of the secrets revealed was predictable from the start, but the rest were well-executed surprises that added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Historical and Environmental Context:**  \n  I appreciated learning about the real-life inspiration behind the story and the conservation efforts on Floreana. The novel’s connection to a true story added an intriguing layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Content Warnings and Representation:**  \n  The book includes sensitive topics such as infertility, miscarriage, animal death, infidelity, grief, murder, and child death. It also represents infertility and multiple sclerosis.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a compelling and emotional read, despite some pacing issues and a preference for one POV over the other. The atmospheric setting, thematic depth, and surprising twists made it a memorable experience, especially for those interested in historical and environmental narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Although she doesn't want to admit it, she is running from her problems back in Boston that keep weighing her down. She hopes that being back in the place that inspired her all those years ago will help her find her passion again. Dore arrives to Floreana in 1929 with her \"husband\" after being promised a new start to life following their affair. When they arrive, they are the only ones settling on this desolate island. And while they can appreciate its beauty, the harsh ecosystem and lack of materials makes the adjustment to their new world all the more difficult.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The setting is gorgeously described, and as someone who has a deep love for marine life, I absolutely loved Mallory's scientific focus.

The historical elements, such as the flashbacks to early settlers on Floreana Island, felt secondary to the romantic storyline.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Mallory, a conservation scientist, returning to fieldwork after a failed marriage.

The themes are overwhelmingly centered on loss, sadness, sacrifice, and poor personal choices, with no sense of joy or fulfillment.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Mallory's relationships, both past and present, are central to the story.

In the present, Mallory returns a decade after her initial visit, where she followed her lover to conduct research on endangered penguins. The historical narrative chronicles Dore Strauch in the 1930s, who relocates to the island with her partner, Friedrich, seeking to fulfill their dreams and aid her recovery from illness. The plot thickens with the arrival of a self-proclaimed Austrian baroness and her mysterious disappearance, echoing the real events of the Galapagos Affair, which adds a layer of intrigue and tension to the tale.",
            "I admired the bravery of both Mallory and Dore in pursuing their dreams and establishing themselves in a new world. In contrast, I found Friedrich's transformation into a selfish and inconsiderate man on the island disappointing. Both women encountered significant challenges and adapted to their evolving circumstances, ultimately discovering their true selves by the end of the story.",

            "I believe I would have enjoyed the book more if the author had created a fictional story without incorporating real people. Omitting the Mallory narrative and instead focusing on a couple who moves to a wild, rugged island to navigate eccentric neighbors and a murder plot would have been compelling on its own.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I don't really care for narrative type present tense writing that has become very popular.  \n\n- **Character Engagement:**  \n  The story of Dore was much more interesting than that of Mallory. When I found out that the story of Dore is based on an actual memoir of actual events, I was even more intrigued by Dore's story.  \n\n- **Ethical Concerns with Historical Fiction:**  \n  When I realized that the author was making up involvement in a crime and things that Dore can't refute, I'm not sure I was enjoying it anymore. The problem with fictional stories about real people is that rarely do readers search to find out the true story. I have no problem with historical fiction as long as it doesn't twist it to hurt anyone. Nobody really knows what involvement Dore had with the murders, but this writing actually makes it seem like she admitted to murder.  \n\n- **Plot Suggestions:**  \n  I think I would have enjoyed the book more if the author had just made up a story that is similar without bringing real people into it. Leave out the Mallory story. Just focus on a couple that moves to this wild rugged island and deals with crazy neighbors and murder. That would have been interesting all by itself.  \n\n- **Impact of Real-Life Research:**  \n  After watching a documentary on the real-life story, I'm even more dismayed by this book. Dore never gave birth. Frederick was eating chickens that had been poisoned. He thought boiling them would get the poison out. That seems stupid and an obvious way to die. Anyway, I hate the made-up story the author created about these real people. It feels wrong to me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some intriguing elements, particularly the story of Dore, the use of present-tense narrative and the ethical concerns surrounding the fictionalization of real people significantly detracted from my enjoyment. The author's creative liberties with historical facts left me feeling uncomfortable and dissatisfied.

As a reimagining of a true story, the book introduces an intriguing layer, but Dore’s historical storyline often feels overshadowed by the modern timeline.
