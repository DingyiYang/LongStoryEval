The connection between Lexi and Jake was beautifully written, and I felt frustrated for them when his fame jeopardized their future together.

Lexi had me as soon as she mentioned her love for Broadway early into the novel, but she was relatable even before that. I loved the connection that Lexi and Jake had together and was frustrated for them when his fame threatened any chance they had of a future together. While it's fun to idealize being a celebrity, I also do not envy the lack of privacy they have. (In other words, if I want to drive to the bus stop in my pajamas, I don't have to worry about anyone taking pictures!)  \n\n- **Engaging Plot and Themes:**  \n  This is a delicious treat from beginning to end. And I am not only referring to the food descriptions. There's even some steam that is not coming from a boiling pot of matzo ball soup, if you know what I mean. ;) I've seen both seasons of *The Bear*, and the restaurant scenes reminded me so much of that show. I felt stressed out from them, and I wasn't even in the kitchen! (It did remind me of past restaurant jobs in some ways.)  \n\n- **Descriptive Writing and Atmosphere:**  \n  I mentioned the food descriptions earlier. Just thinking about them makes me hungry again. I would not suggest reading this during the week of Passover. I have a feeling matzo meal pancakes will not compare to the ones Lexi makes...  \n\n- **Appeal to Specific Audiences:**  \n  I just had a great time reading this rom-com, and I definitely recommend it! While it will definitely appeal to fans of *The Bear* and anyone who loves Broadway, pop music, and the celebrity/normal person trope, it's also perfect for fans of *What You Do to Me* by Rochelle Weinstein.  \n\n- **Community and Author Engagement:**  \n  This was the March pick for The Jewish Joy Book Club, and there was a wonderful author discussion with Lindsay at Jewish Women Talk About Romance Books on Facebook. (You need to be a member of the group to see it.)  \n\n- **Trigger Warning:**  \n  TW: Death of a parent from terminal illness (mentioned a lot).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Till There Was You* is a delightful, engaging rom-com that combines relatable characters, a compelling plot, and vivid descriptions.

The writing was amazing, and I could literally feel anxiety coming through the page during some of Lexi’s cooking scenes.  \n\n- **Humor and Dialogue:**  \n  The book had multiple funny one-liners that felt authentic, especially between the friends. The humor felt natural, and one of my favorite quotes was from Ali: “I need to go home and set myself on fire.” (Though it’s funnier in context!)  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Resonance:**  \n  I could empathize with Lexi’s career struggles, as I’ve been in a similar position before. The friendships and betrayals in the book added layers to the story and kept me turning the page.  \n\n- **Reader Requests and Personal Connection:**  \n  #JusticeForEthan! Lindsey, if you’re reading this, I’d love an Ethan moment, even if he’s vanilla. This book will definitely be in my top three when I rate my reads at the end of the year.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTill There Was You is a captivating romance with authentic characters, natural humor, and a plot that keeps you hooked. The writing is exceptional, and the emotional depth of the story makes it unforgettable. I can’t wait to read more from Lindsey Hameroff!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThis book will be in my top three reads of the year.  \n\nThank you NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for this ARC in exchange for an honest review."

I loved how she took me into the heart and head of Lexi, allowing me to feel every up and down, fear, and emotion that came with Jake’s re-arrival into her life after being ghosted.\n   - The book is neat and clean, making it easy to read even on a “bad day” with brain fog. This is a high compliment, as it’s a quality I reserve for only a few authors, like Meredith Schorr.\n\n- **Understanding of the Romance Genre:**\n   - Lindsay fully understands the romance genre and the expectations of her readers. She nails the tension in romance—the idea that even though we know and want the two characters together, they can’t be together because of certain obstacles.\n   - In this case, Jake disappears on Lexi for close to a year, and Lexi struggles with her own abandonment issues after her mother’s death and her strained relationship with her father. This makes her fear of falling for Jake understandable, even though he’s portrayed as the most amazing, hottest musician on the planet.\n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**\n   - Lexi’s character is well-developed, with her tendency to want everything organized and in its proper place shining through Hameroff’s writing. Her grief over her mother’s death and her understandable trepidation with Jake add layers of emotional depth.\n   - The book also uses beautiful metaphors, particularly through the lens of cooking, to explore relationships and people.\n\n- **Fantasy and Escapism:**\n   - The book delivers on the fantasy aspect of romance, which I highly value. It includes a sexy musician, cool celebrity moments, and an amazing guy who just wants to love and adore the heroine. These elements make the story a modern-day fairy tale, full of grand gestures and dream-like scenarios.\n   - As someone who loves the escapism of romance, I appreciated how Lindsay gave me everything I wanted—celebrity romance, private jets, and a love story that feels larger than life.\n\n- **Overall Vibe and Atmosphere:**\n   - The book has a distinct vibe that’s hard to describe but easy to feel. Lexi’s personality, her grief, and her cautious approach to Jake are all palpable through Hameroff’s writing.\n   - The metaphors related to cooking add a unique and beautiful layer to the story, making it stand out in the romance genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTILL THERE WAS YOU by Lindsay Hameroff is a truly excellent romance that delivers on all fronts—immersive writing, emotional depth, and the perfect balance of fantasy and realism. It’s a modern-day fairy tale that feels like a dream date in book form. I highly recommend it and am in awe that this is Hameroff’s debut.

However, I felt the Jewish representation could have been more prominent.  \n\n- **Romance and Plot:**  \n  - The romance was well-done, and I particularly enjoyed that the love interest was a rockstar. The celebrity aspect added an intriguing layer to the story.  \n  - The last few chapters were especially engaging, with a lot of action and developments that kept me hooked.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I liked the ending, though I was left curious about what happens next for the characters.  \n  - Overall, I definitely enjoyed reading this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis contemporary romance set in NYC offers a compelling mix of emotional depth, cultural touches, and an engaging celebrity romance.

            "The novel centers on Lexi Berman, a culinary student aspiring to become an executive chef in a Michelin-star restaurant to honor her late mother. Her life takes a pivotal turn when she meets Jake Taylor, a dive bar musician, leading to a passionate weekend. As Jake rises to fame with a breakout single that alludes to their shared moments, Lexi faces the challenges of balancing her culinary ambitions with the budding relationship. The story incorporates familiar tropes such as celebrity romance, friends-to-lovers, second chances, and insta-love, culminating in a well-executed third-act breakup that adds depth. While the plot is engaging and well-structured, it occasionally suffers from a slower pace.",
            "Lexi is an independent, strong, and driven character who struggles with self-doubt in her cooking skills, showcasing significant personal growth throughout the story. Jake, a talented songwriter who rises to overnight fame, is intriguing, though I wished for a deeper exploration of his perspective. The supporting characters—Ali, Chloe, and Mia—are fantastic and truly elevate the narrative.",
            "The author’s writing is intimate, steamy, and heartfelt, showcasing a creative flair. The witty banter and chemistry between the characters are expertly crafted. While the story is narrated from Lexi’s first-person perspective, adding Jake’s POV would have provided a more balanced view.",

            "This charming romcom is a delightful read that I thoroughly enjoyed. Its sweet, heartwarming quality will resonate with readers, particularly those in their twenties. Although it leans toward the New Adult/Young Adult spectrum, it remains enjoyable for a wider audience. A bit of suspension of disbelief is necessary, but the overall experience makes it worthwhile."

It’s a sweet, heartfelt romcom with a well-developed plot, engaging characters, and a meaningful message about balancing love and career. While the pacing is slightly slow and the characters could have been explored more deeply, the story is enjoyable and leaves a lasting impression.

The book felt longer than it was, but not necessarily in a bad way, as a lot happens.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Lexi and Jake were sweet together, and the portrayal of their relationship felt mostly believable.

The characters, including Lexi, often struggled with communication, which added complexity but also frustration.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The book explores the challenges of being in a relationship with a young, famous person, which was well-portrayed. However, it also seemed to suggest that women must choose between a career and a healthy relationship, which I didn’t love. Lexi’s shift from being 100% committed to her career to barely focusing on it when Jake returned felt unrealistic.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  I mostly enjoyed the book!

The idea of a famous singer writing hit songs about the FMC was swoon-worthy and added to the romantic appeal.  \n\n- **Critiques:**  \n  Lexi’s immaturity and the unresolved issues with her dad were a bit much. The lack of communication between characters was a recurring issue. Additionally, the book could have benefited from addressing Lexi’s grief over her mother’s death more deeply, perhaps through therapy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this book enjoyable and engaging, especially for fans of famous MMC tropes and navigating relationships amidst fame.

            "Lexi's career transition felt rushed and underdeveloped. Her startup idea didn't resonate, as her aversion to being a chef wasn't thoroughly explored, and the business model seemed unrealistic. The reunion with her father and stepmother was too swift and lacked the depth warranted by years of emotional pain and abandonment. However, the supporting characters were enjoyable, and I’m particularly interested in future stories featuring Ali, Mia, and Chloe.",

After reuniting with Lexi, he respected her space and communicated his feelings openly. The chemistry between Lexi and Jake was electric, and their instant connection felt authentic. I appreciated the dynamic of two individuals navigating high-stress careers—Lexi as a chef and Jake as a musician—while trying to maintain their relationship.\n\n*What I Didn't Like:* Lexi, as the female main character, felt one-dimensional. Her only notable traits were her ambition to become a chef and the loss of her mother at 16. Her unchanged childhood apartment contributed to a sense of stagnation. Additionally, Jake lacked depth; his primary characteristics were his musical aspirations and a strained relationship with his father. The relationship itself felt unbalanced, with Lexi's emotional investment appearing deeper than Jake's, whose motivations and feelings needed further development.",
            "**Review:**  \n*What I Liked:* The story compellingly explores the tension between personal ambitions and relationships, enhanced by the realistic backdrop of a high-stress job.  \n*What I Didn't Like:* However, the emotional depth is hindered by insufficient character development, particularly for Lexi and Jake. Lexi's grief over her mother's death and Jake's struggles with his father feel underdeveloped, rendering the themes somewhat superficial."

            "I enjoy romances featuring a whirlwind relationship followed by separation and reunion, and this book delivered on that trope. However, I found Jake's behavior during the third-act breakup frustrating. He appeared oblivious, especially given his awareness of his manager's shady actions and Madison's infatuation with him. It was disappointing that he couldn't recognize how these factors were undermining his relationship. Additionally, I wished for clarity on whether Jake ended his friendship with Madison after reuniting with Lexi, as this was left unaddressed.",
            "Jake was a total sweetheart who truly adored Lexi. I admired Lexi for her determination to never sacrifice her career for a man; she firmly believed she could have it all. The side characters, including Chloe, Ali, Mia, and Chad, were fantastic, with Chad's humor particularly shining through—his antics in Times Square had me laughing out loud.",

It’s a short and sweet rom-com that reminded me of why I love romance novels.  \n  - It’s an easy read with a light, enjoyable tone that made me fly through it.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Jake was a total sweetie who really adored Lexi.  \n  - I admired Lexi for never wanting to give up her career for a man.

I especially loved the humor Chad brought, like when he took everyone to Times Square—I was cracking up laughing.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  - I love romances where the FMC and MMC have a short, whirlwind romance, face separation, and then reunite. This book delivered on that trope.  \n  - However, I didn’t love how Jake acted during the third-act breakup. He seemed kinda dumb, especially since he knew his manager was shady and Madison was fawning over him. It was frustrating that he couldn’t see how these factors were sabotaging his relationship.  \n  - I also wanted to know if Jake ended his friendship with Madison after reuniting with Lexi, but this wasn’t addressed.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  - I wish the book had a little more spice. Most of the scenes were closed-door or not very descriptive, which is just a personal preference.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I really enjoyed reading this book. It’s a lovely debut from Lindsay Hameroff, and I’ll definitely be checking out anything she writes in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a delightful, easy-to-read rom-com with charming characters and a satisfying reunion trope.

            "Jake emerged as my favorite character, with the author skillfully portraying his insecurities about his music career and life choices. He candidly acknowledged his mistakes and confided in Lexi that the fame he once craved was less fulfilling than he had imagined. Lexi, on the other hand, had emotional walls—some justified—that made her journey relatable and well-developed. I admired how her friends and Jake worked to dismantle those barriers, helping her recognize her growth. Lexi's strong support system, particularly her two best friends, added depth to her character. I also appreciated Mia, her initially antagonistic co-worker, who ultimately became an ally. The character dynamics enriched the story. As a Jewish reader, I found the representation in the book to be authentic and meaningful. While insta-love isn't typically my favorite trope, I was fully invested in Lexi and Jake's whirlwind romance and their reunion years later; their connection felt genuine and compelling.",

            "The novel is fast-paced, making for an engaging read, though it occasionally feels rushed. Conflicts are resolved swiftly, and some revelations lack clarity. While the insta-love trope is present, the emotional connection and chemistry between characters could have been developed more convincingly.",
            "Jake is a well-liked character—kind, thoughtful, communicative, and quick to apologize—making him a significant draw of the story. In contrast, Lexi struggles with a lack of clear voice and rational motivations. While her journey of self-discovery is relatable, it sometimes feels inconsistent with the narrative. Her communication style often leads to frustration, as she tends to lash out or sulk during challenges. The early romantic tension between Jake and Lexi is built through small, frequent physical connections, creating a natural and blush-worthy dynamic. However, their banter can come off as childish, resembling awkward teenage flirting rather than mature adult conversation, which may not resonate with all readers. On a positive note, Lexi's friendships are well-portrayed, featuring realistic and relatable dialogue that captures the essence of being in your early twenties.",
            "The story has a sweet and light tone, featuring mild romantic scenes that are not overly graphic. However, the pacing and conflict resolution may not appeal to readers who favor slower, more detailed narratives.",
            "This story features familiar tropes such as a one-weekend stand, a rockstar hero, a chef heroine, and instant love. Central themes include second chances, self-discovery, and the complexities of relationships."

        "conclusion": "This is a sweet, fast-paced romance with a thoughtful and likable hero in Jake. While the insta-love trope and quick resolutions may not work for everyone, the natural romantic tension and relatable friendships add charm to the story. Lexi’s character could have been more developed, but overall, it’s an enjoyable read for fans of low-spice, second-chance romances.",

            "Lexi's constant references to making her Instagram private, without ever following through, felt jarring—like a Chekhov's gun that never fired. Her decision to give Jake a second chance after he ghosted her offered an intriguing exploration of forgiveness and societal expectations. The story quickly found its rhythm, blending charming wish fulfillment with genuine emotion. However, the youthful tone made the casual and frequent sex scenes surprising, particularly since Lexi portrays herself as someone who doesn't date or engage in sex right away.",
            "The connection between Lexi and Jake felt somewhat implausible, given how much they relied on their brief pre-fame relationship. A longer history would have made their bond more believable. Jake's teasing of Lexi for her love of rules was a bit too obvious, highlighting their contrasting personalities. Madison, the mean girl, had an interesting arc, but her transformation took too long and lacked a decisive resolution. Lexi's personal growth—navigating her career aspirations, her mother's passing, and her father's quick remarriage—seemed secondary to the romance and lightheartedness of the plot. Despite the love-at-first-sight premise, the skilled writing kept the story from becoming overly sentimental. Chloe and Ali were both likable, though I wondered why Ali was portrayed as Lexi's main friend when Chloe had been in her life longer. Chad, Chloe’s insufferable former client, provided a hilarious touch by the end.",
            "The frequent use of \"intake\" as a verb instead of \"take in\" was a minor yet distracting annoyance.",

            "The conflict felt contrived and veered too much into YA territory, especially during Lexi's breaking point, which contradicted earlier discussions about their goals and insecurities. Her jealous complaints and misunderstanding of PTO came across as immature for a 24-year-old character.",
            "The love between Jake and Lexi is genuine and compelling, shining through the pages. The carefully chosen timeline enhances their relationship's progression, making the insta-love trope feel more natural and realistic.",

            "The characters' professions as a rock star and a chef brought a refreshing depth to the story, enhanced by Ratatouille-level food descriptions that left me craving Lexi's dishes.

            "When Jake reappears after finding success in the music industry, Lexi is uncertain about what to expect but is open to giving him a second chance. This opportunity allows them to deepen their connection. I appreciated that Lexi's journey didn't revolve around finding a man to \"fix\" her; instead, she prioritizes her own needs and explores her aspirations. Additionally, I enjoyed how the story subverted expectations by revealing that the perceived villain was not as antagonistic as initially thought.",
            "I appreciated the strong Jewish representation in the story. Lexi is a charming protagonist who is pursuing her dreams in culinary school when she unexpectedly meets Jake. Although she isn't seeking anything serious, their weekend together feels out of character for her. However, when he ghosts her, she handles it with resilience, moving forward to graduate and secure a job at a NYC restaurant. While she isn't perfect and her naivete sometimes left me shaking my head, her journey is both relatable and inspiring.",

She’s already following her dreams by going to culinary school when she meets Jake. She’s certainly not looking for anything serious, so their weekend together is totally out of character for her.  \n   - Even so, she doesn’t really fall apart after he ghosts her: she moves on with her life, graduates culinary school, and gets a job at a NYC restaurant.  \n   - She is not perfect, and there were times I was shaking my head at her naivete.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development**  \n   - Needless to say, she doesn’t know what to expect when Jake reappears after achieving success in the music industry—but she’s willing to give him a second chance, which gives them both the opportunity to get to know each other better.  \n   - I appreciated that getting a man didn’t “fix” Lexi and that she needed to put herself first and figure out what she wanted to do with herself.  \n   - I also love that the perceived villain of the piece ended up not so villainous.  \n\n- **Narrative Style**  \n   - The narrative is single-perspective, which works well because if the reader was aware of Jake’s thoughts, that would eliminate a lot of the tension.  \n   - We don’t really need Jake’s perspective because he consistently shares his innermost thoughts with Lexi and he doesn’t have a hidden agenda.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation**  \n   - I would absolutely recommend *Till There Was You*. This book was sweet and funny and full of feelings.  \n   - I loved the secondary characters, and the musical references, and I even loved that Lexi lived in a “classic six” in NYC.  \n   - This is a spectacular debut, and I can’t wait to read more from Hameroff in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Till There Was You* is a heartwarming, second-chance romance with a delightful protagonist, strong Jewish representation, and a narrative style that keeps the tension alive. The Broadway references, character growth, and unexpected twists make it a standout debut. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it to fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this novel, we follow the love story of Alexa (Lexi) and Jake, who first connect at a dive bar while bonding over Broadway showtunes. Jake leaves to chase his music career in LA, quickly becoming an overnight sensation but ghosting Lexi in the process, leaving her heartbroken. A year later, he returns, asking for a second chance as Lexi explores a budding romance and focuses on her culinary career. The narrative skillfully weaves a hurt/comfort dynamic, portraying Lexi's struggles with Jake’s betrayal, her efforts to mend her relationship with her father, and her journey through grief over her mother’s death. \n\nHowever, the third-act breakup feels forced, as the characters had already endured a similar separation earlier in the story. Although the plot is engaging and fast-paced, making it a quick read, the new romance in Lexi's life is somewhat exaggerated, consisting of only one date with a coworker. Additionally, the absence of an epilogue is a missed opportunity to provide closure and further insight into the characters’ futures.",
            "Lexi's growth is significant, especially in her ability to navigate grief and mend her relationship with her father. However, her personal development feels somewhat delayed, only fully realized during the third-act breakup.

Jake leaves to pursue his music career in LA, becoming an overnight sensation, but ghosts Lexi, leaving her heartbroken. Over a year later, Jake returns, begging for a second chance, while Lexi is exploring a new romance and focusing on her culinary career.  \n  - The story includes a strong hurt/comfort dynamic, with Lexi struggling to cope with Jake’s abandonment and eventually mending her relationship with her father and processing her grief over her mother’s death.  \n  - The third-act breakup felt unnecessary, as the characters had already experienced a similar separation earlier in the book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Lexi’s growth is notable, particularly in her ability to process grief and repair her relationship with her father. However, her personal growth feels delayed, as it only fully emerges during the third-act breakup.  \n  - Jake’s character is compelling, but his sudden return and plea for a second chance could have been explored more deeply to add nuance to his motivations.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The novel effectively conveys the sharp pain of heartbreak, particularly through Lexi’s emotional struggles. The hurt/comfort dynamic is well-executed, making the reader feel deeply invested in the characters’ emotional journeys.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The story is engaging and fast-paced, with the reader easily devouring the book. However, the advertised new romance in Lexi’s life feels exaggerated, as it only involves one date with a coworker.  \n  - The lack of an epilogue is a missed opportunity to provide closure and further explore the characters’ futures.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  - Themes of love, loss, forgiveness, and personal growth are central to the story.

            "Celebrity romances often don't appeal to me, as they usually emphasize the chaotic lifestyles of the stars. However, this story took a different approach. Jake is a genuinely nice guy who strives to remain grounded amidst the fame. His love for Lexi is palpable, and it's heartwarming to see him fight for their relationship, prioritizing open communication and supporting her dreams.\n\nLexi's journey is more complex. The death of her mother during her teenage years left a significant impact, shaping her life and leading her to chase expectations she believed her mother had for her, even after her own dreams evolved. Jake encourages her to pursue what she truly wants, helping her reflect on whether her past aspirations still fulfill her. This guidance is crucial for her character development and her path toward discovering her true calling. Ultimately, he helps her recognize what has been in front of her all along and come to terms with her past.",

I was invested from the very start and quickly fell in love with both Lexi and Jake! I had so much fun reading this book.  \n\n- **Character Development (Jake):**  \n  Celebrity/rock star romances often aren’t my cup of tea because they tend to focus too much on the crazy lifestyle of these celebrities. However, this one didn’t do that at all. Jake was such a genuinely nice guy who tried his best not to lose himself in all the fame and craziness. He was so in love with Lexi, and it was beautiful to see the way he fought for them, always prioritizing communication (which is refreshing) and supporting her to achieve her dreams.  \n\n- **Character Development (Lexi):**  \n  Lexi had a bit more of a journey to go through. Her mother’s death when she was a teenager left a big mark on her and shaped a lot of her life in the following years. She was stuck trying to live up to the expectations she thought her mother had, even after she realized that her dream had changed. Jake always encouraged her to do what she truly wanted and helped her think about whether what once was her dream still satisfied her. This played a huge role in her character development and her journey toward her true dream job. He ultimately helped her see what had been right in front of her for a while and make amends with the past.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Overall, I had an amazing time reading this book from the very first pages. I loved the characters and the plot. If you’re looking for a fairly fast-paced romcom, check this one out!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful read, with well-developed characters and a refreshing take on the celebrity romance trope. Jake and Lexi’s relationship was heartwarming, and the story’s pacing kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5 stars  \n\nA big thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for sending me an ARC in exchange for an honest review."

Jake is nearly perfect—supportive, understanding, and openly expressive of his feelings. However, Lexi's insecurities and hesitations, while relatable, become repetitive and hinder a deeper connection with her. I found myself wishing for more maturity and less drama leading up to the third-act breakup. The initial whirlwind romance between Lexi and Jake is captivating, and the tension escalates effectively when Jake returns as a famous musician.

However, I felt it was rushed. I would’ve appreciated more scenes of their weekend together and the time immediately after Jake leaves for LA. This would’ve made their feelings more believable and deepened my connection to their relationship.  \n\n- **Characterization of Lexi:**  \n  Lexi reads as very young, even though she’s 23 at the start of the book. Her interactions with her friends came across as immature, which was a bit off-putting. It felt like the characters were trying to appear older and wiser than they actually were, but it didn’t quite work.  \n\n- **Conflict Resolution:**  \n  The conflict at the end felt forced and didn’t ring true. While it somewhat aligned with Lexi’s character, it felt out of place coming from Jake. I didn’t find it believable, which took away from the overall impact of the story.  \n\n- **Potential and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I think this book has a lot of potential and is a solid debut.

            "I appreciated the subtle subplots woven throughout the story, but the main focus remains on Jake and Lexi as they navigate their demanding careers—hers in the kitchen and his on stage. This unique take on second-chance romance captivated me. The narrative follows Jake Taylor and Lexi Berman, who share a memorable weekend filled with love, pancakes, and \"Golden Girls\" before Jake departs for LA to pursue his music career. Eighteen months later, when Jake returns to NYC, Lexi has moved on—graduating, starting a new job, and accepting a date with Ethan—while Jake has achieved fame. The novel beautifully balances themes of food, self-discovery, and romance, which I thoroughly enjoyed.",
            "The main characters felt somewhat mature for their age, but Lexi's maturity is understandable due to her experiences, including the loss of one parent and the other moving to Florida. I particularly enjoyed the supporting characters, like Mia and Ali, who added depth to the story."

While the main characters felt slightly mature for their age, their growth and the supporting cast added richness to the story. The focus on Jake and Lexi’s journey, both personally and professionally, made for an engaging and enjoyable read.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I was initially wary that the relationship might fall into the \"insta-love\" trope, but I was pleasantly surprised by how naturally and thoughtfully it developed. The main characters, Lexi and Jake, communicated well most of the time, even when dealing with difficult emotions and situations.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The book explored intriguing themes, such as what it would be like to be involved with someone famous and the insecurities that might arise from such a relationship. It also delved into the idea of achieving everything you wished for, only to find it different from what you imagined. These themes added depth and relatability to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  The story followed Lexi and Jake as they navigated their challenges, and I appreciated how everything culminated in a satisfying happily-ever-after (HEA) ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The well-developed characters, meaningful themes, and satisfying resolution made it a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 ⭐️  \n\nThank you to NetGalley for the ARC."

Their dynamic is compelling, with clear chemistry and emotional depth.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  While the overall story is enjoyable, the middle section felt slow and could have been tightened to maintain momentum. However, the ending was satisfying and well-executed, leaving a strong impression.  \n\n- **Author’s Debut and Potential:**  \n  This is Lindsay Hamerhoff’s debut novel, and it shows promise. The storytelling is engaging, and the concept is fresh and entertaining. I’m excited to see how her writing evolves in future works.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would definitely recommend this book, especially to support a new local author. It’s a fun and heartfelt read with a satisfying conclusion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel by Lindsay Hamerhoff offers a fun and engaging story with a compelling concept and well-developed characters. While the pacing could have been improved in the middle, the ending is satisfying and leaves a lasting impression. I highly recommend it, particularly to support a promising new author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the absence of a larger, more impactful conflict leaves the narrative feeling somewhat flat. While the predictable third-act breakup and the public gesture at the end were enjoyable, they lacked surprise. Additionally, the lack of an epilogue left me wanting more closure for Lexi and Jake; the ending, though satisfying, could have tied up their story more completely. Centered around Lexi, a culinary student, and Jake, an aspiring musician, the plot follows their whirlwind weekend in New York and their subsequent attempt to navigate a friendship that deepens after a year apart.

            "This story is an emotional rollercoaster, skillfully blending sweetness and insta-love with angst and poignant themes. It delves into found family, second-chance romance, and the complexities of musician lifestyles, adding depth to the narrative.",
            "This romance offers a satisfying happy-ever-after (HEA) and includes a few mildly open-door spicy scenes that are suggestive without being overly explicit, maintaining a moderately clean tone. The female protagonist (FMC) experiences a sudden and somewhat confusing personality shift after meeting the male protagonist (MMC). However, the MMC's charming cinnamon roll character adds a delightful touch to the story.",
            "The writing style is accessible and the pacing is brisk. However, the tone occasionally leans towards that of a YA novel, which creates a disconnect with the more explicit scenes.",
            "The book features trigger warnings for themes such as the death of a parent (recounted), cancer, sexual harassment (recounted), infidelity, manipulation, mild cyberbullying, and misogyny. These elements are thoughtfully integrated into the narrative, enhancing its emotional depth."

These themes are handled within the story and contribute to its emotional depth.\n\n- **Romance and Spice Level:**  \n  The romance features a happy-ever-after (HEA) and includes several mildly open-door spicy scenes. These scenes are suggestive but not overly descriptive, leaning more toward a moderately clean romance.\n\n- **Plot and Emotional Tone:**  \n  The story is a rollercoaster of emotions, blending sweetness and insta-love with angst and hard-hitting topics. It explores themes like found family, second-chance romance, and musician lifestyles, which add layers to the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The female protagonist (FMC) undergoes a personality shift after meeting the male protagonist (MMC), which felt abrupt and confusing. The MMC is portrayed as a cinnamon roll character, which adds charm to the story.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing style is easy to read, and the book is fast-paced.

The front cover is adorable and adds to the book's appeal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had many enjoyable elements, such as the emotional depth, charming characters, and engaging writing style, it fell slightly short of my preferences due to its tonal inconsistencies and reliance on certain tropes.

            "The story unfolds at a brisk pace, blending romance, drama, and conflict effectively. While the pacing generally works, the characters' occasional immaturity can undermine the believability of their actions. Centered around Lexi, a determined chef, and Jake, an aspiring singer, the narrative explores their brief romantic encounter that complicates when Jake rises to fame. The plot weaves in familiar tropes, including insta-love and familial issues, while examining themes of overnight success versus gradual failure.",
            "In this story, Lexi and Jake are portrayed as young and immature, requiring substantial personal growth before they can commit to a relationship. Jake's repeated mistakes, including ghosting Lexi and letting his manager, Vinny, dictate his career, create tension between them. However, Lexi's friends, especially Chloe and Mia, are well-developed characters who add depth to the narrative.",
            "The writing is engaging, featuring vivid food descriptions that inspired me to make fresh pasta while reading. The tone is playful yet slightly off-kilter, as the characters' maturity seems mismatched with their ages (25-26).",
            "The novel delves into themes of ambition, trust, and the struggle to balance personal and professional lives. It includes content warnings for the off-page death of a parent and descriptions of workplace sexual harassment."

However, the immaturity of the main characters and their repeated missteps make the story feel slightly off-kilter. Aging the characters down or maturing their behavior would have improved the narrative. Despite these flaws, the book is an enjoyable read, especially for fans of foodie romances and celebrity-driven plots.",

            "The plot is both entertaining and intriguing, delving into the relationship between chef Lexi and rockstar Jake. A central theme is the struggle to balance personal dreams with romantic commitments. The story opens with Lexi's determination to excel in culinary school, highlighting her passion for cooking and her initial hesitance to embrace a relationship.",
            "Lexi and Jake's relationship felt rushed, with their bond formed over just a few hours at a bar lacking realism. A more gradual development would have made their connection more believable. Lexi's endearing obsession with Jake's dimples reflected her deep feelings for him, but both characters displayed insecurity influenced by rumors, which contradicted their professed love. Additionally, Lexi's interactions with Ethan were underdeveloped; it felt unfair that he learned about her situation through the media rather than directly from her. The subplot involving Lexi's ex living with her while she dated Ethan was problematic and lacked proper resolution.",

While balancing both is undoubtedly challenging, it is not impossible. The detailed portrayal of restaurant life and the culinary world adds depth and educational value to the story."

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the absence of miscommunication in this book. The characters' clear communication and their willingness to listen and resolve issues were the most compelling aspects of the story for me.",
            "The story was somewhat marred by the introduction of a female protagonist who attempted to steal the male main character's affections, suggesting they were destined to be together due to their fame. This was frustrating, as I wished the female lead would assert herself rather than succumb to self-doubt, questioning why the male lead would choose her, a \"normal\" person, over a celebrity. However, I loved that she was a chef, which made her character both fun and relatable. It reminded me of *You, Again* by Kate Goldbeck, another book I enjoyed. I picked this one up because the author was inspired by the line “I met her once and wrote a song about her” from *Carolina* by Harry Styles. Without that connection, I might not have chosen this book, but I'm glad I did.",

This charming rom-com follows Lexi, an aspiring chef, and Jake, an aspiring musician, who meet at a dive bar and share a magical weekend. However, Jake vanishes afterward.

Lexi's friendships with Chloe and Ali also felt superficial and lacked depth. Although the representation of Jewish culture was appreciated, it wasn't a central focus of the narrative. The romance between Lexi and Jake had its moments, but their connection felt uneven, making it hard for me to believe in their chemistry. Additionally, the rekindling of their relationship overshadowed Lexi's career, which was disappointing.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Behavior:**  \n   - Jake repeatedly behaves poorly, such as ghosting Lexi without a valid excuse and showing up at her workplace to intimidate Ethan. Even after realizing his mistake, he continues to act inappropriately.  \n   - Lexi often gets mad at Jake for things outside of his control, which feels unfair and frustrating. Her inability to stand up for herself or address issues directly is disappointing.  \n   - The chemistry between Jake and Lexi is strong initially but becomes inconsistent later, making their relationship feel forced or disconnected at times.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n   - The foundation of their relationship (a weekend fling) is believable and relatable, but the progression of their love story feels underdeveloped.  \n   - Their interactions often lack depth, making it unclear how they truly fell in love beyond their initial connection.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict Resolution:**  \n   - The conflict resolution feels unsatisfying, particularly with Lexi quitting her dream job. This decision seems abrupt and lacks sufficient justification, as there’s little evidence to support that her job wasn’t truly her dream.  \n   - The resolution of their relationship issues feels rushed and unconvincing, leaving the reader questioning how they will make their relationship work long-term.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - The book is an easy and quick read, with a light and engaging tone that makes it enjoyable to fly through in a couple of days.  \n   - However, the story feels underdeveloped, with certain plot points and character arcs lacking depth or proper exploration.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has its charming moments and an engaging premise, it ultimately falls short in terms of character development, relationship dynamics, and conflict resolution. The chemistry between the main characters is strong initially but becomes inconsistent, and the resolution of key plot points feels rushed and unconvincing. Despite these flaws, it’s a cute and easy read that keeps the reader entertained, even if it leaves them wanting more depth and coherence.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel includes a celebrity love interest and insta-love, two tropes I enjoy. The story is fun and engaging, particularly the dynamic between the celebrity and a regular person, which stands out until about 60% in. However, the conflict between the two women felt juvenile and reminiscent of high school drama, which was disappointing.",

Her hot-and-cold emotions, poor communication, and indecisiveness detracted from my overall enjoyment. Conversely, Jake remains consistently impressive throughout most of the story, despite a few early missteps.",

            "The main conflict in the story is predictable, and the resolution leans on clichés that could have been avoided. The novel weaves together elements of celebrity romance, opposites attract, and a hint of second chances. Lexi, a culinary school student with dreams of becoming an executive chef, finds her plans upended by Jake, a dive bar musician who unexpectedly rises to fame. Their relationship transitions from a series of one-night stands to strangers, then friends, and ultimately lovers. The narrative is enriched with Broadway and pop culture references, vibrant NYC settings, and themes centered around Jewish cuisine.",

            "I appreciated Lexi and Jack as individual characters. Lexi, a culinary student aspiring to be an executive chef, and Jack, a musician who skyrockets to fame with his hit song \"Blueberry,\" both have compelling stories. However, I struggled to connect with them as a couple, which made it difficult to invest in their second-chance romance. While their relationship had sweet and spicy moments, I’m not a fan of insta-love. Their connection begins with a one-night stand at a bar, and Lexi quickly assumes that Jack's hit song is about her because she made him blueberry pancakes the next morning. Although the premise of their romance was intriguing, the instant attraction didn't resonate with me.",

Featuring familiar tropes such as second chances, insta-love, a rockstar male lead paired with a chef female lead, and the pursuit of dreams, the premise is enticing. However, while I appreciated the concept and many of the tropes, the execution fell short for me."

It’s a light, fluffy read, but it fell short of my expectations compared to other romcoms I’ve enjoyed.",

This discrepancy affects the authenticity of their references and word choices, which feel outdated for their supposed age group.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Debut Novel:**  \n  Despite the age-related issues, the novel is cute and enjoyable. It shows promise as a debut work, and I believe the author, Lindsay, has a bright future in writing. I look forward to reading more of her work in the future.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments and Gratitude:**  \n  I am grateful to St. Martin’s Griffin, St. Martin’s Press, and NetGalley for providing me with an e-ARC in exchange for an honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has some issues with character age and outdated references, it is a charming debut that showcases the author’s potential. I enjoyed it and am excited to see how Lindsay’s writing evolves in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Initially, she doesn't expect anything to come of it, but she is taken aback when he ghosts her. A year later, Jake has skyrocketed to fame while Lexi continues her culinary studies. When he unexpectedly appears at her doorstep, she grapples with her unresolved feelings for him. However, the pacing of their relationship feels uneven—sometimes racing ahead, then dragging, and ultimately concluding too abruptly. This inconsistency makes it difficult to fully invest in their connection.",

He no longer resembled the sweet guy we first met; fame seemed to change him for the worse, and there was no resolution to his issues.

Lexi's reactions to Jake's actions were inconsistent and at times frustrating, such as when she became angry at him for protecting her privacy. Additionally, the workplace conflict at the restaurant was underdeveloped and resolved in an unrealistic manner.",

The central relationship between Lexi and Jake shines, showcasing Jake as the ideal supportive partner, despite some occasional missteps. However, the characters fall into stereotypes and lack depth. \n\nLexi Berman is portrayed as a flawless young career woman with unrealistic accomplishments, such as landing a prestigious job without experience and dating a famous singer. Jake Taylor, the token sexy Southern bar singer, achieves overnight fame and is depicted as overly perfect. \n\nAri, Lexi’s sex-obsessed best friend, serves little purpose beyond supporting Lexi, while Chloe, a laid-back friend, undergoes minimal development until a sudden revelation about her sexuality. Mia, a grumpy chef, has a brief backstory but lacks clear motivations. Madison St. James, a jealous celebrity, undergoes an unrealistic transformation, and Vinny, Jake’s manager, is presented as a one-dimensional villain. \n\nLexi’s parents are used as plot devices to explain her decisions, with her father's relationship issues feeling overly simplistic. Jake’s parents are typical Southern archetypes with lukewarm conflicts. The kitchen staff is portrayed as one-dimensional, often depicted as sexist or antagonistic. Overall, while the romance is enjoyable, the characters could benefit from greater depth and complexity.",

            "The story was charming but occasionally frustrating due to the characters' choices. Some content could have been trimmed to enhance the pacing and elevate the book to a 4-star rating. While the ending was emotional and satisfying, showcasing the characters' reconciliation after misunderstandings, it felt rushed and would have benefited from an epilogue for added closure. Lexi's personal growth was a highlight, as she repaired her relationship with her father, launched a new business, and ultimately prioritized her relationship with Jake.",
            "Lexi and Jake were a charming couple, and I found myself rooting for them throughout the story. Lexi's drive, supportiveness, and hard work contrasted beautifully with Jake's cheerful persistence in helping her overcome self-doubt. Their relationship was a roller coaster of emotions, marked by Lexi's insecurity and Jake's naivety, which was both endearing and frustrating. Lexi's friends, especially Ali, reminded me of Six from *Blossom* and provided solid support. Jake's mom was a standout character, though I wished she had a larger role. In contrast, Madison felt over-the-top and unrealistic, making her character hard to believe.",
            "The writing occasionally evokes Emily Henry, yet the author maintains a distinct style. The first-person narrative flows smoothly, and the dialogue feels authentic. However, the excessive use of strong language detracts from the overall experience.",
            "While most characters were believable, Lexi's credibility as a chef was undermined by her assertion that roasting a turkey takes all day; in reality, a good-sized turkey can be cooked in just 2 to 2.5 hours. Additionally, Madison's character and certain plot elements, such as Jake landing a role in *Les Misérables*, felt unrealistic.",
            "This book delves into themes of self-doubt, trust, and personal growth, particularly through Lexi's journey.

            "The book feels unpolished, with some extraneous elements, such as the dating arc with Ethan, that could have been trimmed. Certain plot points, like Lexi’s visit to Georgia, seem unnecessary and don’t significantly contribute to the story. The exploration of grief and relationships—particularly Lexi’s friendship with Jake and her connection with her father—could have been more developed. The narrative incorporates several romance tropes, including second chance romance, friends to lovers, forced proximity, celebrity romance, meet-cute, and found family. Set against the backdrop of New York City’s competitive restaurant scene and the allure of dating a chart-topping country singer, the story offers drama and intrigue. While the will-they-won’t-they dynamic kept me engaged, the pacing felt uneven throughout the journey.",
            "While some characters, such as Ethan the pastry chef, felt underdeveloped and functioned more as plot devices than fully realized individuals, others, like Chad, served primarily as comedic relief despite having minimal presence in the story. His character could easily have been omitted without impacting the overall narrative. Additionally, Lexi's grief over her mother's death and her strained relationship with her father were inconsistently portrayed, lacking the depth needed to resonate with readers.",

            "Towards the end of the story, Lexi, the female main character, became increasingly frustrating with her constant self-doubt and repetitive thoughts, such as questioning why Jake, a famous figure, would be with someone like her. This tendency was eye-roll-inducing. Jake, the male lead, was likable and charming, but he faltered by failing to set boundaries with Madison, who persistently touched him in front of Lexi. Madison's insufferable behavior, even after her apologies, made her a character I couldn't stand. Lexi's ex, Ethan, came across as controlling and creepy, so I was relieved they didn't end up together. However, supporting characters like Ali, Chloe, and Mia were enjoyable, and I would be interested in reading more about them.",
            "The writing exudes a fun, lighthearted tone, and I particularly enjoyed the humor, especially the random celebrity mentions like Chad from *The Bachelor* and Taylor Swift.",

He's so famous, and I'm a nobody.\" It became frustrating and eye-roll-inducing.  \n  - Jake, the male lead, was likable and a \"slayer,\" but he was also a bit of a dunce for not setting boundaries with Madison, the girl who kept touching him in front of Lexi.  \n  - Madison was insufferable, even when she apologized, and her behavior made me hate her.  \n  - Ethan, Lexi's ex, came off as controlling and creepy, and I’m glad they didn’t end up together.  \n  - Supporting characters like Ali, Chloe, and Mia were enjoyable, and I’d be interested in reading more about them.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  - The story was enjoyable overall, but Lexi’s constant indecision and overthinking, especially about her relationship with Jake, dragged the plot down in the later chapters.  \n  - The conflict with Madison felt over-the-top, and Lexi’s inability to say no to Jake’s invitations, despite her concerns about her job, was frustrating.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n  - The writing had a fun, lighthearted tone, and I appreciated the humor, like the random celebrity mentions (e.g., Chad from *The Bachelor* and Taylor Swift).  \n  - The Philly mention was a nice touch, and the banter between characters added to the charm.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  - The New York music industry setting was interesting, but some characters, like Jake’s stylist, felt underdeveloped and overly dramatic.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite my frustrations with Lexi, I found the story cute and entertaining.

The third-act breakup felt clichéd and frustrating. Additionally, certain plot points, such as the guard permitting only three people into Times Square, were confusing and jarring.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the kitchen scenes, particularly the line about crying in the walk-in cooler—it resonated deeply! Lexi's grief over her mother's loss was portrayed with great intensity, and I appreciated how she linked cooking to love. Her friendships with her two best friends were engaging and often hilarious, capturing the essence of genuine conversations. Jake Taylor, the male main character, came across as wise beyond his years, and his immediate connection with Lexi was truly compelling.",

The romance blends elements of insta-love and second chances, which I found charming but not entirely compelling. The spice level was mild, featuring a few scenes that hovered between fade-to-black and open door, ultimately rating at 2.5/5. Overall, while enjoyable, the romance could have been more engaging.",

Overall, I’d rate the spice level at 2.5/5.  \n\n- **Genre and Personal Preference:**  \n  - This was my first attempt at reading a Rockstar/Celebrity romance, and I discovered that this subgenre might not be for me.  \n  - Despite my personal preferences, I recognize that this book might appeal to others who enjoy light, quick reads with a mix of insta-love and second-chance romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Till There Was You* is a light and quick read with a relatable protagonist and a cute romance. While the beginning drew me in, the story lost momentum for me as the conflicts and resolution felt rushed and inconsistent. The mild spice level and celebrity romance tropes didn’t fully resonate with me, but I can see how this book might be enjoyable for fans of the genre. Overall, it was an okay read, but not one that fully captured my attention.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: ⭐ 3.5/5  \n- Spice Level: 🌶 2.5/5  \n\nThank you, NetGalley and St. Martin's Press, for this ARC in exchange for an honest review! All opinions expressed in my review are my own."

            "The novel centers on Lexi Berman, a determined chef aspiring to earn a Michelin star, who unexpectedly falls for the charming Jake Taylor. Their whirlwind romance faces challenges when Jake leaves for L.A. to pursue a music career. The story incorporates classic romance tropes, including a predictable meet-cute, a \"will they or won’t they\" dynamic, a strong-willed female protagonist, and a conflicted love interest. Key elements like a love song, a family visit, a third-act breakup, and a New Year’s Eve scene enhance its charm.

Their undeniable chemistry ignites during a whirlwind weekend, but Jake's departure for L.A. to record his first demo catapults him to fame with a breakout single seemingly inspired by Lexi. As they reconnect years later, Lexi faces the risks of losing her privacy to tabloids and jeopardizing her career, all while trying to rekindle their romance amidst the challenges of Jake's newfound stardom.

The ending, where Lexi reunites with Jake after losing her job, was unsatisfying and regressive. A more compelling conclusion would have seen Lexi embracing her independence and focusing on personal growth or exploring new opportunities. Additionally, the scene where Lexi discovers Jake with another woman, reminiscent of Jessica Rabbit, felt clichéd and only added unnecessary drama to an already frustrating relationship.",

It was disappointing to see Lexi willing to jeopardize her job for him, especially given Jake's indifference to her job loss while he expressed frustration over her inability to take time off. Additionally, the reference to the song \"Blueberry Eyes\" by Max ft. Suga as a potential inspiration for the book's title or theme was an intriguing observation."

The book needed a more thorough developmental edit to address these shortcomings and elevate it to its full potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story is well-executed but suffers from repetition and predictability, adhering closely to the familiar rockstar-normal person romance trope. Many characters and scenes seem included merely to fit this mold, failing to add depth or charm to the narrative. The climactic confrontation between Lexi and Jack feels lackluster and emotionally flat. Additionally, the resolution, marked by a grand gesture and swift forgiveness, comes off as a convenient shortcut that doesn't adequately resolve the underlying issues.",
            "Lexi, a driven culinary student, prioritizes her ambitions over romance, adding depth to her character. In contrast, Jack, an aspiring musician who eventually gains fame, lacks a thorough exploration of his character, particularly concerning his unresolved relationship with his father. Both characters grapple with strained paternal relationships; however, while Lexi finds resolution by the story's end, Jack's remains unaddressed.",

While the concept is promising, the execution leaves much to be desired.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - My favorite part of this book was the banter she had with her two friends.  \n\n- **Romance Tropes:**  \n  - Unfortunately, there were too many of my romance book pet-peeves in this story, including insta-love/lust and villainous women who wear heavy makeup.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  - The plotline about her job felt underdeveloped and wasn’t wrapped up properly.  \n  - The ending was wrapped up too quickly, leaving some aspects unresolved.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  - There was no epilogue, so it was never shown how they ended up making their relationship work with their respective careers. This was a little annoying because it was the main conflict of the whole book.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  - There were cute aspects of this book, and it’s not bad for a debut.  \n  - I would not be opposed to reading this author again.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some charming moments, particularly the banter between the protagonist and her friends, it was hindered by overused romance tropes, an underdeveloped job plotline, and a rushed ending. The lack of an epilogue left the main conflict unresolved, which was disappointing. Despite these flaws, the author shows potential, and I’d be open to reading their future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While I appreciated certain aspects of the story, I found the female main character, Lexi, to be quite immature. She seemed to want everything at once—traveling with Jake while also pursuing her career as an executive chef. Her frustration when her boss denied her time off, despite having already exhausted her leave for the year, felt unwarranted. However, I did enjoy the chapters where Jake took her home and would have liked to see more of that dynamic throughout the book.",

The ending feels rushed, especially in the last three pages where they reconcile, which could have been developed more.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - James and Lexi’s relationship starts off strong, but their interactions later in the story involve childish arguments that detract from the depth of their connection.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite some flaws, I enjoyed the book overall. The strong start and engaging premise made it a worthwhile read, even if the latter part of the story and the ending could have been better executed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel has a compelling start and an engaging premise, but the plot loses some of its charm as it progresses, particularly due to the rushed ending and immature conflicts between the characters. Nonetheless, it remains an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They consistently supported each other, no matter the situation, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  Some aspects of the story felt loose, and certain elements were too repetitive, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its charming moments, particularly in the character dynamics and relationships, I found it hard to fully connect with the story due to its loose structure and repetitive elements. It was a light and enjoyable read, but not one that left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️"

Additionally, I would have liked to see her thrive more in her career, as this would have added depth to her character arc.  \n\n- **Potential for Sequels:**  \n  The story set up possible sequels with Lexi’s friends, which was intriguing. I’m hopeful that these characters might get their own stories in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel, particularly for its Jewish representation and the potential for future stories. However, the predictable conflict, lack of detailed world-building, and underdeveloped nuances in Lexi’s professional life left room for improvement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I found myself enjoying the lighthearted tone and the simplicity of the story.  \n\n- **Characters and Dialogue:**  \n  I liked the characters and the dialogue.

Jake and Lexi's relationship requires more development before Jake achieves fame; a weekend fling does not provide a believable foundation. Lexi's frustrations with her career and her overall dissatisfaction need further exploration. Additionally, Jake's reason for ghosting Lexi feels weak and unconvincing. His rapid rise to fame, marked by just one hit song, lacks sufficient buildup to justify an appearance on Fallon. \n\nLexi's relationship with her father is underdeveloped; her anger remains unresolved and is resolved too quickly. The misunderstanding with her mother regarding her career goals also needs a stronger resolution or a more impactful moment of clarity. Furthermore, the story lacks a proper epilogue or post-Happily Ever After content. Overall, the narrative feels constrained by word count, resulting in underdeveloped plot points and characters. Improving the pacing by expanding on key moments and relationships would enhance the story significantly.",
            "Lexi and Jake are endearing characters, making them easy to root for, but their relationship lacks depth. Chloe, the token lesbian friend, is underutilized and should play a more significant role in the plot. Jake's unresolved conflict with his father feels unnecessary and incomplete. The subplot involving Ethan is awkward and unclear, as Lexi's guilt and Ethan's reactions don't logically align. Referring to Lexi's dad as a \"boomer\" is inaccurate and dismissive of Gen X. Additionally, the redhead character advising Lexi to give Jake another chance feels out of place. Having two minor characters named Amir is confusing, and naming a character Alexa in 2023 feels outdated.",

It came close to being a 4-star read due to some unique touches and engaging conversations, but ultimately fell short.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, Jake and Lexi, were well-developed, but neither won over my affections. The peripheral characters also didn’t stand out as memorable. While they made a cute couple and had some endearing moments, I didn’t feel deeply invested in their relationship or care enough about whether they ended up together.  \n\n- **Character Decisions and Consequences:**  \n  Lexi’s poor decisions and her constant surprise at the negative outcomes were frustrating. As someone who understands the demands of a high-pressure job, it was hard to sympathize with her lack of commitment and the resulting consequences.  \n\n- **Romantic Conflict:**  \n  I dislike contrived or overly dramatic conflicts that tear couples apart, preferring romances where the couple works together to overcome challenges. The big dramatic moment in this story didn’t resonate with me, even though I enjoy similar moments in other media (like *Notting Hill*).  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Genre Fatigue:**  \n  The book was enjoyable but not earth-shattering. It’s a well-done debut novel, but I might have enjoyed it more if I hadn’t been on a streak of reading contemporary romances. Sometimes, I need a break from the genre to fully appreciate it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a decent read with a solid plot and well-developed characters, but it didn’t fully win me over. While it had some unique and enjoyable moments, the lack of emotional investment in the characters and the contrived conflict kept it from being a standout for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

Lexi's immaturity, exemplified by her deleting Jake's number, and the unhealthy jealousy from her coworker further complicate matters. However, I appreciated Jake's character as a musician striving to remain authentic amidst his fame. Lexi's friends inject humor and lightheartedness into the story, which I found enjoyable.",

            "I found Lexi to be an unlikable character. The book began with a promising meet-cute and an exciting weekend, but her behavior later became frustrating. She appeared overly jealous and self-centered, particularly in her relationship with Jake. For example, she would instigate fights if he so much as glanced at another girl, despite his constant reassurances. Moreover, she often made Jake's events about herself, which felt inconsiderate.\n\nIn contrast, Jake was a more relatable character. He was consistently supportive and deeply invested in their relationship, even when it felt one-sided. His efforts to remember their shared moments and express his love were endearing. However, the unresolved issue regarding his relationship with his father was disappointing and left a loose end in the story.\n\nOverall, the dynamic between Lexi and Jake felt unbalanced. Jake was clearly more committed and emotionally invested, while Lexi often seemed indifferent or overly reactive. Their reunion after two years of no communication felt unrealistic, as if Jake had never ignored her for so long.",
            "The book appears to target a younger audience, particularly teenagers and women in their 20s. Its pop culture references, such as Liam Thompson—a clear nod to Liam Payne from One Direction—and terms like \"LBD\" (little black dress) may feel out of place and could alienate older readers."

While the book started strong with a promising \"meet cute\" and a whirlwind weekend, her behavior later in the story was frustrating. She came across as overly jealous and self-centered, especially in her relationship with Jake. For instance, she would start fights if Jake even looked at another girl, despite him constantly reassuring her. Additionally, she made Jake's events about herself, which felt irritating and inconsiderate.  \n\n- **Character Development (Jake):**  \n  Jake was a more likable character compared to Lexi. He was consistently supportive and deeply invested in their relationship, even when it felt one-sided. His efforts to remember everything about their time together and show his love were endearing. However, the lack of resolution regarding his relationship with his father was disappointing and left a loose end in the story.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship between Lexi and Jake felt unbalanced. Jake was clearly more committed and emotionally invested, while Lexi often seemed indifferent or overly reactive. Their reunion after two years of no communication felt unrealistic, as if Jake had never ignored her for so long.  \n\n- **Family Relationships:**  \n  Lexi's strained relationship with her father was a significant subplot. While her father moved on quickly after her mother's death and relocated to Florida, he still made efforts to stay in her life, such as sending birthday gifts and letting her keep the apartment. As someone with a deceased father, I found Lexi's decision to keep him at arm's length sad and frustrating.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Target Audience:**  \n  The book seemed aimed at a younger audience, likely teenagers or women in their 20s. The inclusion of pop culture references, like \"Liam Thompson\" (a clear nod to Liam Payne from One Direction), and terms like \"LBD\" (little black dress) felt out of place and might alienate older readers.  \n\n- **Positive Elements:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, there were some charming aspects of the story. Jake's unwavering love and the small, thoughtful gestures he made, like naming the song \"Blueberry,\" were adorable and added a sweet touch to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments of charm, particularly in Jake's character and his efforts to show his love, the unbalanced relationship dynamics, Lexi's frustrating behavior, and the unresolved subplots detracted from the overall experience.
