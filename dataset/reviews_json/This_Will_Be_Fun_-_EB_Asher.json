            "The book primarily centers on the relationship between Beatrice and Clare, particularly their frequent hookups, rather than the actual quest. The summary essentially reveals the entire story, which hinders meaningful plot development. The ending was confusing and undermined the overall narrative, leaving me feeling unsatisfied. It seemed as though the authors were inspired by *Shrek* but overlooked the essential element of a coherent plot. As a result, the story felt disjointed and lacked the depth and structure needed to be truly engaging.",

It disrupted the immersion and seemed out of place for the time period.\n\n- **Collaborative Writing Process:**  \n  I noticed that three different people worked on this book, which, in my experience, often indicates a messy process with numerous rewrites. This made me question the coherence and consistency of the narrative.\n\n- **Focus and Plot Development:**  \n  The book seemed more focused on the relationship between Beatrice and Clare—specifically, their repeated hookups—than on the actual quest. The summary of the book essentially captured the entire story, leaving little room for meaningful plot development.  \n\n- **Ending and Story Resolution:**  \n  The ending, in my opinion, didn’t make sense and undermined the entire story. It felt like the narrative lacked a clear direction or purpose, leaving me unsatisfied.\n\n- **Inspiration and Execution:**  \n  It seemed like the authors drew inspiration from watching *Shrek* but forgot to include the most crucial element—the plot. The story felt disjointed and lacked the depth and structure needed to make it compelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential, its reliance on modern language in a feudal setting, lack of focus on the quest, and unsatisfying ending left me disappointed.

I have a whole shelf in my library dedicated to the movie and the book, including memorabilia like a board game, bobbleheads, Funkos, and wine bottles from a special screening at Alamo Drafthouse. When I saw the comparisons for this book, I knew I had to check it out.  \n\n- **Engagement and Disappointment:**  \n  Despite my excitement, I just could not get into this story. I only read about 30% of it before setting it aside, and I never felt compelled to pick it back up. Instead, I chose to re-read some other favorites for comfort, as every book I picked up after this one also failed to captivate me. I wish I could say it was just me, but I’m fairly certain, at least in this book’s case, that I’m not alone.  \n\n- **Tone and Emotional Undercurrent:**  \n  There was an undercurrent of sadness throughout the story. The remaining hero and heroines did not feel triumphant at all in the wake of losing their fearless leader. They had to face their queen as the ten-year reunion of their victory loomed large. For a book that is supposed to be \"fun,\" none of us were having any.  \n\n- **Anachronisms and World-Building:**  \n  The anachronisms drove me nuts. While I can get behind magic making a medieval-type setting more favorable, I couldn’t accept magic tapestries that acted like texting devices. The Starbucks-like \"brew\" shops on every corner, the \"shadow play\" dramas beamed into homes via magic, and the ride-sharing service for carriages were too modern for my taste. I don’t want modern inventions and conveniences in my cozy fantasy, even if they’re explained by magic.  \n\n- **Authorship and Narrative Cohesion:**  \n  I didn’t realize until I opened the book and saw the copyright that E.B. Asher is actually three people. While this lent individuality to each of the three main characters, I think it might have been to the detriment of the story. The narrative didn’t feel cohesive, except for the shared sense of depression among the characters.  \n\n- **Characterization and Highlights:**  \n  I was a little charmed by Clare, the erstwhile hero and rogue loosely based on Westley. His commentary was humorous, and his banter with Beatrice provided a nice balance to her pithy retorts. However, his character alone could not save this book for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my high expectations and initial excitement, this book failed to engage me. The pervasive sadness, jarring anachronisms, and lack of narrative cohesion overshadowed the few charming moments, leaving me disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The tension stemming from Clare's obsession with Beatrice and Elowen's unresolved feelings for her ex-lover, Vandra, was engaging. However, I would have liked to see more focus on these relationships. The subtle romance woven throughout the narrative added a delightful dimension to the story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  I was really drawn to the premise of this book. The idea of former heroes, once beloved and now fractured by the aftermath of their quest, being forced back together for a royal wedding—and perhaps one last mission—had so much potential!\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was a bit off, with slow introductions that made it hard to care about the plot in the beginning. However, once things picked up, I started to appreciate the light romance, the fun banter, and the character growth, which kept me reading.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I liked how each character developed as they grappled with their past and present. There were some intriguing levels of tension created by Clare's ongoing obsession with Beatrice and Elowen's unresolved feelings for her ex-lover, Vandra. However, I wish more time had been spent developing these relationships.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The subtle romance that ran through the book was really lovely and added a charming layer to the story.\n\n- **Dialogue vs. Introspection:**  \n  I thought the novel relied a little too much on dialogue. It would have been easier to relate to the characters more deeply if there had been more introspection and emotional depth.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Although I enjoyed the setting, I thought the world-building was a little basic. Mythria had potential, but the fantasy aspects could have been expanded on. The tone felt a bit erratic at times due to the mix of magical elements (like caverns and charmed swords) with mundane ones (such as coffee shops and magical games).\n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**  \n  The cozy, light fantasy atmosphere, mixed well with themes of friendship, loyalty, and second chances, made it an entertaining read. Despite its flaws, the book had a lot of potential that wasn’t fully realized, but it was still a pleasant read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book for its charming premise, character growth, and light romance. While the pacing, world-building, and emotional depth could have been stronger, the themes of friendship and second chances, combined with the cozy fantasy atmosphere, made it an entertaining and enjoyable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They must confront their shared guilt, grief, and strained relationships as a familiar threat resurfaces, forcing them to work together to survive. The premise is intriguing, blending fantasy and romance elements, but the execution felt lacking in depth and cohesion.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The novel is a hybrid of fantasy and romance, with hints of romantic comedy. While it attempts to merge the best of both genres, it doesn’t fully commit to either. The fantasy elements, such as world-building and magic, were underdeveloped and inconsistent. The romance had moments of potential but didn’t fully deliver on its comedic or emotional promises.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The relationships between Beatrice, Elowen, and Clare are central to the story. Their shared history of loss and conflict adds emotional weight, but their interactions sometimes felt underdeveloped. The tension and reconciliation between them could have been explored more deeply to enhance the emotional impact.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The fantasy aspect of the story suffered from insufficient world-building. The realm of Mythria and its magic system were vaguely explained, leaving many questions unanswered. A more detailed and consistent approach to these elements would have strengthened the narrative.  \n\n- **Potential and Author Growth:**  \n  Despite its shortcomings, the novel shows promise. The concept of a “romantasy comedy” is appealing, and I believe the author has potential to grow in storytelling, world-building, and narrative flow. I would be willing to read their next book in hopes of seeing these improvements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *This Will be Fun* had an engaging premise and a unique blend of fantasy and romance, it fell short in execution.

The book had a lot of jokes, which I enjoyed.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  The book felt like a slightly snarkier version of *Legends and Lattes*. The blurb mentioned *The Princess Bride*, and I can see the influence, but it didn’t quite capture the same heart and charm. I remember *The Princess Bride* fondly from the 90s, and this book felt flat and unsatisfying in comparison.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The exaggerated *wink wink* writing style was fine at times, but it hindered genuine character development. It felt like the style got in the way of creating deeper, more relatable characters.\n\n- **Sex Scenes:**  \n  The sex scenes were poorly written and insincere. As a romance-loving librarian, I strongly believe that if an author can’t write sex scenes well, they should skip them entirely. A closed-door scene would have been a better choice. Steamy romance needs to be emotionally earned or at least well-crafted, which wasn’t the case here.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I can’t think of any non-teens who would enjoy this book, which limits its appeal. While this might be a personal issue, I also feel that trendiness and ubiquity aren’t good reasons to recommend a book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had its moments of humor, but it fell flat in terms of heart, character development, and execution of romantic elements.

The combination of world-saving stakes, romantic tension, and quirky antics—such as autographing swords—yields a satisfying and cohesive narrative.",

Clare and Beatrice’s unresolved tension, along with Vandra and Elowen’s dynamic relationship, receive nearly equal attention; however, Clare and Beatrice’s romance feels more prominent due to their POV chapters. Both couples exhibit strong chemistry, deliver grand love confessions, and engage in explicit yet tasteful intimate scenes. The characters are richly drawn, with distinct personalities and flaws. Beatrice and Elowen, in particular, are imperfect women in their early thirties, making them relatable and adding depth to the story. The themes of survivor’s guilt and PTSD are thoughtfully woven into the narrative, complementing its humor and sweetness.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The novel blends fantasy, romance, and adventure with a tone reminiscent of *Shrek*—snarky, heartfelt, and full of humor. It also incorporates elements of *Dungeons & Dragons* and *The Princess Bride*, creating a world that feels both familiar and fresh. The story balances antics with emotional depth, maintaining a sense of \"cuddly softness\" throughout.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The book delivers two second-chance romances, both of which are well-developed and emotionally satisfying. Clare and Beatrice’s unresolved tension and Vandra and Elowen’s dynamic relationship are given nearly equal attention, though Clare and Beatrice’s romance feels slightly more prominent due to their POV chapters. Both couples have strong chemistry, grand love confessions, and explicit yet tasteful sex scenes.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are richly drawn, with distinct personalities and flaws. Beatrice and Elowen, in particular, are portrayed as imperfect, \"poorly adjusted\" women in their early thirties, which adds a layer of relatability and depth. The inclusion of survivor’s guilt and PTSD is handled thoughtfully, blending seamlessly into the story’s humor and sweetness.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The fantasy world is vibrant and imaginative, with quirky elements like \"heart healers,\" \"shadow plays,\" and a heroine who’s a \"messy bitch\" post-divorce. The setting feels lovingly crafted, with a playful yet heartfelt homage to classic fantasy tropes and fandoms.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story strikes a great balance between the main quest, romantic subplots, and humorous sidebars. The pacing is engaging, with moments of action, introspection, and levity. The blend of saving the world, romantic tension, and quirky antics (like autographing swords) creates a satisfying and cohesive narrative.\n\n- **Humor and Heart:**  \n  The novel excels in combining humor with emotional depth. The characters’ inner monologues, witty dialogue, and playful interactions add charm, while the underlying themes of friendship, love, and healing give the story weight.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful blend of fantasy, romance, and humor, offering a heartfelt and entertaining read. With well-developed characters, a vibrant world, and two compelling romances, it strikes a perfect balance between fun and emotional depth. It’s a story that feels both nostalgic and refreshing, leaving readers eager for more adventures in this world.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Heat level: 5/10  \n- Overall enjoyment: Highly recommended for fans of fantasy romance with a touch of humor and heart."

It’s impressive to learn that the authors, despite their lack of experience in this genre, managed to collaborate so seamlessly.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I was incredibly excited for this book, especially since I love *The Princess Bride*. However, it turned out to be nothing like *The Princess Bride*, which left me disappointed. The description of the book didn’t align with the actual content.\n\n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The idea of exploring what happens after “The End” of a big battle is fantastic. The book starts right before a major battle, similar to epic battles in *Avengers* or *Troy*, and delves into the aftermath, particularly focusing on the warriors. This concept is intriguing and has great potential.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are introduced through snippets from the perspective of one major hero, but this approach doesn’t provide enough depth. It’s hard to connect with or understand the characters, especially since they aren’t very likable ten years later. The lack of backstory and poor character development made it difficult to care about them.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is minimal. While I didn’t mind the anachronisms, such as the magical horse-drawn Uber or the magical tapestries that function like the internet, these elements lacked explanation or integration into the world. They just existed without context, which was frustrating.\n\n- **Writing and Cohesion:**  \n  The book feels disjointed, likely due to having three separate authors. It seems like each author focused on different characters without much collaboration, resulting in a lack of cohesion. The “Big Misunderstanding” trope used for the characters’ conflicts felt overdone and unsatisfying.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story begins with the Four being brought back together by the queen for a ceremony, which kicks off the adventure. However, the plot lacked excitement, fun, and romance. The pacing was slow, and I kept waiting for moments that never came.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of exploring life after a major battle is compelling, the execution fell short. The lack of character development, minimal worldbuilding, disjointed writing, and slow pacing made it difficult to enjoy. I wanted more depth, excitement, and cohesion, but the book didn’t deliver on these fronts.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars  \n\n***ARC courtesy of Avon Books**"

The cycle of bickering, trying not to admit attraction, making questionable decisions, and rehashing the past in vague terms became tiresome quickly.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was a major letdown.

It took too long to introduce the characters and the world, then rushed through a quest that was resolved early. Another quest, which seemed urgent, included unnecessary detours, like spending time in a magical version of Las Vegas.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I really didn’t like the ending.

Unfortunately, the ending feels a bit unsatisfying; although the characters reunite, grow, and find love, they ultimately return to their comfort zone. This predictable twist felt unnecessary. Happy endings can coexist with grief, and I believe it's crucial to acknowledge that aspect of life.",

It was very important to me that he find his way back to being himself. Clare and Beatrice were my favorite parts of the book.\n\n- **Concept and Theme:**  \n  The concept is really interesting. What *does* happen to a group of heroes once the battle is won? How do they adjust to real life? I think more books should explore this theme, and I’d read them all.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  I do wish we had gotten to the conflict of it all a little sooner. We don’t get there until 50% into the book. The journey to the castle with former friends is fun, but it could’ve moved along a little faster. This would’ve given us more time to build out the quest and the final moments more effectively.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Unfortunately, I think the ending cheapens the story a bit. We brought everyone back together, they all grew and found love, and then they returned to the comfortable. It was a twist I saw coming and one I didn’t need. Happy books can still mean living with grief. It’s life, and I think it’s important to acknowledge that.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a silly, good-time fantasy with an interesting concept and strong character development, particularly with Clare and Beatrice.

While the characters had potential, I felt they could have been more authentic and deeply developed.  \n\n- **Spice Rating:**  \n  N/A (No explicit spice content noted.)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and cozy read, especially for someone like me who isn’t a heavy fantasy reader. While the pacing and execution of the concept could have been stronger, the unique blend of romance, fantasy, and modern elements made it an enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Character Authenticity: 3/5  \n- Overall Rating: 3.75/5  \n\n**Content Warnings:**  \nDeath, grief"

            "The quest features significant moments of waiting and relationship tension between action scenes, which effectively build suspense but occasionally disrupt the pacing. While the ending ties everything together nicely, one plot element felt predictable and left me unsatisfied. The story follows The Four, who saved the realm of Mythria a decade ago but disbanded after losing a member. The remaining trio—Clare, Elowen, and Beatrice—each respond differently to their status as heroes and the conclusion of their original quest. As they reunite for the ten-year anniversary, they are once again called upon by the Queen to help save the realm. The plot is engaging, though it leans heavily on convenience, with magic often feeling more like a plot device than an integral part of the world.",
            "In this story, the three main characters navigate the complexities of their fractured friendship, grief, and unresolved issues. Clare seeks the limelight while concealing her insecurities, Elowen withdraws into solitude, and Beatrice finds comfort in a mundane marriage. The emotional tension largely stems from the contrasting relationships of Clare and Beatrice, and Elowen and Vandra. I found the dynamic between Elowen and Vandra particularly compelling.",
            "This fantasy world cleverly blends modern-day elements like celebrity couple names, coffee shops, and familiar services such as Uber and DoorDash, creating a quirky, playful atmosphere. While these touches enhance the story, they occasionally verge on being overdone. The addition of a celebrity impersonator convention in the fantasy equivalent of Las Vegas injects further fun, underscoring the unique modern twist on a medieval setting.",
            "The playful, tongue-in-cheek humor and quirky vibes are enjoyable, but they often overshadow the heavier themes of grief and insecurity. While the humor adds levity, a deeper exploration of the characters’ emotional struggles would have created a better balance."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I enjoyed the reading experience and appreciated the playful tone and humor. However, I wanted more depth from the premise and characters, as the heavier themes felt underexplored.

As they reunite for the ten-year anniversary, they are summoned by the Queen and find themselves needed to save the realm once again. The plot is engaging but relies heavily on convenience, with magic often serving the plot rather than feeling integral to the world.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The fantasy world is infused with modern-day equivalencies, such as celebrity couple names, coffee shops, Sexiest Man Alive covers, and versions of Uber and Doordash.

The inclusion of a celebrity impersonator convention at the in-world Las Vegas equivalent adds fun but further emphasizes the modern twist on a medieval setting.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The three main characters grapple with their fractured friendship, grief, and unresolved issues. Clare embraces fame while hiding insecurities, Elowen retreats into isolation, and Beatrice seeks security in a boring marriage. The relationship angst between the two couples—Clare and Beatrice, and Elowen and Vandra—drives much of the emotional tension.

The cover and description instantly drew me in, promising a story about four friends who are heroes in the Kingdom of Queendom. However, the actual experience fell short of these expectations.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The biggest issue I had with the story was the lack of a cohesive plot. The narrative felt choppy at times, and I often found myself asking, “What are we doing and why?” The story alternates between the present and the past, with the past being revealed gradually throughout the book. I wondered if focusing solely on the events of ten years prior might have made for a more enjoyable read. The ending also made little to no sense, though I’m willing to overlook it because it’s a cozy fantasy.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The book features three main POVs: Beatrice, Clare, and Elowen. The characters were likable, and the story explored tropes like found family, second-chance romance, and sapphic romance. These elements added charm to the narrative, but they weren’t enough to compensate for the lack of a driving plot.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style felt inconsistent, as if multiple people had worked on the story.

Without a strong plot to carry it, the story dragged, and I often felt lost along the way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *This Will Be Fun* started with promise and had likable characters, it ultimately fell short due to its lack of a cohesive plot, inconsistent writing style, and choppy pacing. The ending was confusing, and the story might have been more enjoyable if it had focused on the events of ten years prior. Despite these flaws, it was a fun journey, though not one I’d highly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ 3 stars"

After disbanding a decade ago, they are reluctantly brought back together by Princess Thessia to find her missing betrothed, Sir Hugh. As they journey through Mythria, secrets emerge, and relationships begin to mend.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The novel features dynamic characters, each with their own complexities and growth. The interactions between Beatrice, Clare, and Elowen are particularly engaging as they navigate their strained relationships and work together toward a common goal.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The medieval setting of Mythria is well-crafted, providing a rich backdrop for the story. The inclusion of magic and a quest adds depth and excitement to the narrative, making it feel immersive and adventurous.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Appeal:**  \n  I found the book to be a fun and entertaining read. As someone who hasn’t read much medieval fiction since my teenage years, this was a refreshing change of pace. The combination of dynamic characters, magic, and a compelling quest kept me thoroughly engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful blend of adventure, character development, and medieval fantasy. It successfully rekindles the charm of the genre while offering a fresh and engaging story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It might have been more effective as an animated short.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The aftermath of defeating the Big Bad has left them all in varying degrees of emotional turmoil.",

On one hand, I question the authors' decision to place this contemporary tale in a fantasy setting. On the other, the trio of authors showcases a keen sense of absurdity and a talent for witty dialogue that adds charm to the story.",

These elements straddle the line between amusing and annoying for me. On the annoying end, I wonder why the authors chose to set this thoroughly modern story in a fantasy land. On the amusing end, the authors (there are three) have an eye for absurdity and snappy dialogue.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**  \n  Romantasy fans will appreciate the deep dive into the characters' anxieties and insecurities as they are thrown back together. The story features second-chance, slow-burn romances all around, with the characters working through their traumas and survivor's guilt. This has left each of them in various degrees of misery since the day they defeated the Big Bad.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The book was not really to my taste, even as a lightweight appetizer. I prefer more \"show\" and less \"tell\" when it comes to the characters' feelings. At 400+ pages, there are a lot of emotions to work through, which felt overwhelming to me.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thanks to NetGalley and Avon for the advanced eARC in exchange for my unfettered opinions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has its strengths, such as its quirky world-building and emotional depth, it didn’t align with my personal preferences due to its heavy focus on telling rather than showing emotions and its lengthy exploration of the characters' feelings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the ultimate aim of defeating the villain was straightforward, the journey was rich with absurd and entertaining moments. The characters, flawed yet endearing, elicited both laughter and tears. Their reactions to chaos made me long for a pint of mead by their side. Burdened by a decade of grief, each character navigated their pain in different but believable, albeit unhealthy, ways. Witnessing their journeys toward forgiveness—both of themselves and one another—was profoundly rewarding. Each character experienced pivotal epiphanies that highlighted their growth and development throughout the story.",

However, the book exceeded my expectations and was absolutely perfect.  \n\n- **Prologue and Setup:**  \n  The prologue, a flashback to the characters’ first quest, which tragically ended in their leader’s death, was a brilliant way to start the book. It showcased the group’s dynamic and happiness before the tragedy, contrasting sharply with their state ten years later. This effectively highlighted how Galwell’s death deeply affected them all.  \n\n- **Tone and Balance:**  \n  The book masterfully balanced humor and tragedy, creating a story that was both fun and cozy while also exploring how different people manage grief. The authors handled this duality exceptionally well, ensuring the comedy and emotional depth complemented each other.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The world-building was simple yet effective. The authors incorporated familiar elements from our world, like coffee shops, elevators, and TV shows, but adapted them with magic to fit seamlessly into the story’s magical setting. The magic system was straightforward but intriguing, with each character possessing a unique type of magic, making it enjoyable to discover their abilities.  \n\n- **Quest and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The quest felt like a perfect Dungeons & Dragons campaign. While the end goal (defeating the bad guy) was simple, the journey was filled with ridiculous and entertaining situations. The characters were flawed yet lovable, making me laugh and cry multiple times. Their reactions to the chaos made me wish I could join them for a pint of mead.  \n\n- **Character Growth and Grief:**  \n  The characters had been drowning in grief for a decade, each dealing with it in different, believable, but unhealthy ways. Watching them learn to forgive each other and themselves, and properly process their grief, was incredibly rewarding. Each character had significant epiphany moments that showcased their growth and development.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I absolutely adored this book.

            "This cozy fantasy novel follows a group of four heroes on a quest to rescue the Princess of Queenland. However, I found the twist predictable, as I guessed it early on, which diminished the story's climax. Ten years later, after one hero's death, the remaining three reunite for the former Princess's wedding and are unexpectedly drawn into another epic adventure. While the premise is intriguing, the execution ultimately fell short.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The novel is a cozy fantasy about a group of four heroes on a quest to rescue the Princess of Queenland. Ten years later, after one hero has died, the remaining three reunite for the former Princess’s wedding and are thrust into another epic quest. While the premise is engaging, the execution fell short for me.  \n\n- **Character Development and Likability:**  \n  The story is told through three POV chapters, each focusing on one of the remaining heroes. Unfortunately, only one of these characters was likable, which made it difficult to stay invested in their journeys. By the 85% mark, I was ready for the book to end and didn’t care much about the outcome.  \n\n- **Twist and Predictability:**  \n  The book includes a twist, but it was so predictable that I guessed it at the very beginning. This lack of surprise diminished the impact of the story’s climax.  \n\n- **Author Collaboration and Personal Bias:**  \n  At the end of the book, I discovered that it was a collaboration between three authors, two of whom are a married couple. I had previously disliked one of their books, and if I had known about their involvement beforehand, I wouldn’t have requested this book. This personal bias may have influenced my overall experience.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book fits well within the cozy fantasy genre and includes sapphic spice, which adds a unique flavor to the story. However, despite these elements, the book didn’t stand out as anything particularly special.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *This Will Be Fun* offers a cozy fantasy with an engaging premise and sapphic elements, its predictable twist, unlikable characters, and my personal bias toward one of the authors made it a mediocre read for me. It’s a decent choice for fans of the genre but lacks the depth and originality to make it memorable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

I’d rate the relatability an 8 out of 10; while the fantasy elements and character imperfections slightly hindered full connection, Vandra's arc was compelling. The spice factor earns a strong 9 out of 10, as the romantic scenes were well-timed and seamlessly integrated into the characters' backstories. I found Vandra and Elowyn's relationship far more engaging than that of Clare and Beatrice. The book markets itself as spicy, appealing to both straight and queer audiences, but it echoes more of Rebecca Thorne’s style than Travis Baldree’s subtlety.",

While I enjoyed the story, it didn’t fully align with what I expected based on the marketing.\n\n- **Authorship and Writing Style:**  \n  The book is co-written by three authors, which I typically dislike due to the risk of disjointed styles or overly sanitized narratives. However, while the dynamics between characters were mildly interesting, the writing felt cohesive enough to keep me engaged. The humor was clever, and the tongue-in-cheek references to the characters' fame and interpersonal dynamics made it a fun read.\n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  The core characters are deeply flawed, with three of them being human disasters in their own ways—a preening pretender, a mopey recluse, and a miserable divorcee. Vandra stood out as the saving grace, as she openly acknowledges her need to grow and pushes the others to confront their pasts. Her character made the story work for me, and I connected with her heavily. The relatability score is 8 out of 10, as the fantasy elements and character flaws made it harder to fully relate, but Vandra’s growth arc was compelling.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was fast-paced and easy to follow, with clever humor and cheeky references to real-world elements. However, the final confrontation felt like a Deus ex Machina, with no prior setup, which detracted from the overall satisfaction. The ending, while conventionally happy, felt forced due to this sudden resolution.\n\n- **Romantic Elements and Spice:**  \n  The spice rating is 9 out of 10, as the romantic scenes were well-timed and tied into the characters' pasts. Vandra and Elowyn’s relationship was more enjoyable to read than Clare and Beatrice’s, which felt less engaging. The book markets itself as \"spicy\" and appeals to both straight and queer audiences, but it leans more toward Rebecca Thorne’s style than Travis Baldree’s subtlety.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I rated the book 8 out of 10. While I enjoyed it more for the personal connections I made (especially with Vandra) and the sarcastic banter, the disjointed ending and authorship-by-committee feel held it back. It’s a solid read with easy prose and a plot that flies by, best enjoyed with a cup of coffee in a short sitting.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Will Be Fun is a clever, fast-paced fantasy novel with relatable character struggles and witty humor. While the marketing misled me slightly and the ending felt contrived, Vandra’s growth and the overall dynamics made it an enjoyable read. It’s not perfect, but it’s worth picking up for its charm and emotional depth.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Relatability Score: 8 out of 10  \n- Spice Rating: 9 out of 10  \n- Overall Recommendation: 8 out of 10"

The charming world-building evokes *Ella Enchanted*, incorporating whimsical elements like magical elevators and Ubers. However, the villain feels underdeveloped and lacks depth, diminishing the story's stakes.

Beatrice, Clare, Elowen, and Vandra are well-developed, with distinct personalities and arcs that evolve throughout the story. While it takes some time to connect with them, their witty banter and interactions make them increasingly engaging. Vandra shines as a morally gray character, challenging the others, especially Elowen, with her strong presence. A side character (unnamed to avoid spoilers) adds a dose of positivity and enthusiasm, balancing the group’s grumpiness and awkwardness. The romance is sweet and well-paced, thoughtfully depicting both MF and FF relationships. The romantic scenes are subtle yet emotionally resonant, reflecting the characters’ growth. The intimacy, blushing, and support among the couples are particularly endearing, especially in the dynamic between Elowen and Vandra.",

I particularly enjoyed exploring what happens after the quest and how the characters deal with the aftermath, as this is a theme I find deeply compelling.  \n\n- **World-Building and Modern Quirks:**  \n  The inclusion of modern-ish elements, such as messaging tapestries, dramas, and carriage rideshares, didn’t bother me personally, though I recognize it’s a divisive choice and is heavily present throughout the book.  \n\n- **Romance Subplots:**  \n  For a book categorized as a romance, I found the romantic relationships underwhelming. While I eventually came around to the resolution of Elowen and Vandra’s tensions by the end, I never warmed up to Beatrice and Clare’s dynamic. Despite being in their 30s, they often acted immaturely, treating their constant fighting as foreplay and dragging others into their frustrating interactions. Clare’s perspective, in particular, felt shallow, focusing excessively on his physical attraction to Beatrice while simultaneously claiming to hate her. I wanted to see more genuine friendship and meaningful interactions among the characters, but they spent most of the book making petty digs at each other instead of addressing their issues like adults.  \n\n- **Ending and Thematic Resolution:**  \n  The ending felt somewhat unsatisfying, as it seemed to negate the emotional journey the characters had undergone. While there were a few sweet moments, they didn’t align with the broader thematic goals I felt the book was striving to achieve.  \n\n- **Collaborative Authorship:**  \n  The book was written by three authors, and while it wasn’t my favorite, I’m still open to exploring their other works. I have another of their books on my TBR and plan to give it a chance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a compelling premise and some intriguing elements, the execution of the romance subplots and the ending left me disappointed. The characters’ lack of meaningful communication and the thematic misalignment at the conclusion detracted from my overall enjoyment. However, I remain curious about the authors’ other works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Many readers criticized the book for lacking a plot, likely due to their expectations of fast-paced, action-driven quests typical of fantasy. However, I appreciated the focus on the emotional and psychological toll of being a hero. The slower, introspective pacing allowed for a deeper exploration of the characters’ trauma and growth, which I found far more compelling than endless battles. My main critique is the decision to resurrect Godwin at the end; it felt unnecessary and undermined the emotional weight of the characters’ healing journeys. The story felt complete and satisfying at Thesia’s wedding, and Godwin’s return seemed like a misstep that detracted from the overall narrative.",
            "I am completely captivated by Vandra. She is the standout character, bringing incredible depth and charm to the story.",
            "I appreciated the blend of medieval and modern elements, even without a full explanation. It was amusing and effective, reminiscent of the anachronistic setting in *Bridgerton*. Fiction doesn't have to mirror real life or rationalize every detail, especially when the emotional core is robust. While the magic system wasn't thoroughly explained, I found that unnecessary; the emotional beats of the story didn't hinge on understanding the mechanics. I was far more invested in the characters' journeys than the specifics of the world-building."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a bold and thoughtful subversion of traditional fantasy tropes, focusing on the emotional and psychological aftermath of heroism. While the pacing and worldbuilding may not appeal to everyone, I found the exploration of trauma and healing deeply moving. Despite my issues with the ending, the story left a lasting impression, and I highly appreciate its unique perspective.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Subversion of Fantasy Tropes:**  \n  I loved how this book completely inverts the typical fantasy tropes. Instead of focusing on teenagers going on a quest, it explores the aftermath and PTSD experienced by adults who have endured such quests. This resonated deeply with me, especially after learning about medieval knights suffering from PTSD, a reality often ignored in cultural narratives. The book’s focus on trauma and healing felt refreshing and necessary, particularly in contrast to stories like *The Wild Huntress*, where traumatic events are brushed aside for a happy ending.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Many readers criticized the book for lacking a plot, likely because they expected the fast-paced, action-driven quests typical of fantasy. However, I appreciated that the plot centered on the emotional and psychological toll of being a hero. The slower, more introspective pacing allowed for a deeper exploration of the characters’ trauma and growth, which I found far more compelling than endless battles.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Setting:**  \n  I didn’t mind the mix of medieval and modern elements, even if it wasn’t fully explained. I found it amusing and effective, much like the anachronistic setting of *Bridgerton*. Fiction doesn’t need to perfectly reflect real life or provide rationale for every detail, especially when the emotional core of the story remains strong.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic system wasn’t deeply explained, but I didn’t feel it was necessary. The story’s emotional beats didn’t rely on understanding how the magic worked, and I was more invested in the characters’ journeys than the mechanics of the world.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I am absolutely obsessed with Vandra. She is the best character, and her presence added so much depth and charm to the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Narrative Choices:**  \n  My main criticism is the decision to bring Godwin back from the dead at the end. I found it unnecessary and believe it undermined the emotional impact of the characters’ healing journeys. The story felt complete and fulfilling at Thesia’s wedding, and Godwin’s return felt like a misstep that detracted from the overall narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a bold and thoughtful subversion of traditional fantasy tropes, focusing on the emotional and psychological aftermath of heroism. While the pacing and worldbuilding may not appeal to everyone, I found the exploration of trauma and healing deeply moving.

Modern elements such as franchised coffee shops, Uber, soap operas, and online forums feel jarring and out of place in a medieval high fantasy setting. Additionally, the tone often resembles subpar Tumblr fanfiction from 2014, which comes off as grating and disconnected from the high fantasy atmosphere."

It follows a group of friends who reunite after a decade for a royal wedding, only to embark on a quest to save their realm and rediscover themselves along the way. The story features three distinct narrative voices—Beatrice, Clare, and Elowen—who take turns driving the plot forward. The prologue establishes the background, and the story unfolds ten years later, skillfully interweaving humor, sexual tension, sorrow, and hope.",
            "The three main characters are richly developed, each possessing a distinct voice, background, and motivation. Beatrice and Clare share a romantic history, while Elowen has withdrawn from society, only to be reluctantly pulled back by Vandra, a former assassin now in the service of the Queen. Supporting characters like Vandra and Hugh are well-rounded, though some play more functional roles. Each character's journey involves grappling with themes of regret, shame, grief, and rekindled passions, ultimately leading to personal growth and self-discovery.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story explores what happens after the epic quest, focusing on the aftermath of the heroes' separation and their struggles with past hurts and misunderstandings. The main heart of the narrative is less about the new quest and more about reconciliation and healing, with the help of \"ye olde tele-therapists\" and improved communication. The anticipated happily ever after initially falls short, but there’s hope for a better outcome this time.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The magic system, divided into hand, heart, and head magic, is intriguing and well-developed. The blending of modern conveniences (like message forums and pumpkin drinks) into a fantasy setting adds a unique and humorous touch. The concept of heroes having trading cards and endorsement deals is both amusing and creative.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book balances humor and heartfelt moments, making it both entertaining and emotionally resonant. It has the potential to become a comfort reread due to its engaging tone and relatable themes.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  Fans of Rainbow Rowell’s *Simon Snow* series, Travis Baldree’s *Legends and Lattes*, and the TV series *Galavant* will likely enjoy this book. The reviewer personally loved it, as it aligns with their tastes in storytelling.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Special thanks to the authors for the Instagram giveaway of a physical ARC, as well as NetGalley and Avon Books for providing the eARC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful blend of humor, heart, and fantasy, with a focus on reconciliation and healing rather than just action. Its unique magic system, creative world-building, and relatable themes make it a standout read. The reviewer highly recommends it, especially to fans of similar works, and considers it a potential comfort reread.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story centers on a group of heroes who saved a kingdom and reunite a decade later for a wedding. It explores two “will they/won’t they” couples as they navigate the potential rekindling of their relationships. While the plot incorporates modern elements such as Uber, texting, FaceTime, and soap operas, these are presented with an old-fashioned twist, often glossed over with a vague reference to “magic.” The pacing is notably slow, which may not resonate with all readers.",
            "The tone is lighthearted and fun, reminiscent of *Shrek 2*. Written from a first-person perspective, each chapter presents a different hero’s viewpoint. The writing is clever, featuring witty dialogue without overwhelming detail about the setting.",
            "This book wasn't for me, as I DNF-ed it at 25%. I prefer stories like *The Magicians* that emphasize saving a magical realm over romance. However, I can see why fans of second-chance romance with a quirky, magical twist would enjoy it. On a positive note, it helped me fall asleep quickly, which is a rarity for me.",

            "This story features a compelling Sapphic relationship that evolves from friends to enemies to lovers, framed within a redemption quest. Vandra stands out as the best character in my eyes. Clare resembles a post-fame Disney Hercules—ubiquitous and adored, yet still an awkward guy who struggles to feel deserving of his popularity. His cockiness also necessitates a humbling moment. Elowen, on the other hand, is captivated by soap operas but is oblivious to the true meaning of a friends-with-benefits arrangement. The characters are often so fixated on their past failures that they fail to recognize their growth over the course of a decade.",

It felt a little forced and like a tool to either make the story more adult or genre shift from Fantasy to Romantasy. I honestly felt the story would have been stronger without it.\n- **Modern References:** All the nods to modern day/ real world companies, products, etc.\n- **Humor:** First time an Adventuring Party needing a coffee break didn’t make me cringe. That first Beatrice chapter had me cackling.\n- **World Building:** Solid world building.\n- **Representation:** SAPPHIC REP 🧡🤍🩷.\n- **Character Dynamics:** Friends to Enemies to Lovers. Redemption quest.\n- **Character Development:** Vandra is hands down the best character (to me). Clare reminded me of Disney’s Hercules post fame. His face had to be on everything, he was the most popular man around, and he STILL was just an awkward guy who didn’t feel like he deserved any of it. He also got a little cocky and had to be brought back to Earth.\n- **Humor in Fantasy Context:** Ride shares are the worst even in a fantasy world.\n- **Character Flaws:** Elowen is obsessed with soap operas but doesn’t understand the meaning behind friends with benefits. Characters being too focused on their failures to see any growth for a decade.\n- **Antagonists:** The bad guys are super generic, but they feel like early campaign adversaries.\n- **Power Growth:** The power growth felt like a Deus ex Machina.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis Will Be Fun is a highly enjoyable novel with strong world-building, humor, and character dynamics. While the spice felt forced and the antagonists were somewhat generic, the overall storytelling and character development were impressive. The collaboration between the three authors was seamless, and the modern references added a unique touch. Despite a few flaws, it’s a standout read for me this year.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n📱📱📱📱 out of five dead spots of spellphone service."

            "This entertaining adventure offers a refreshing perspective on the aftermath of heroism, showing that even after saving the world, challenges remain.

I’m glad I took a chance on this book.  \n\n- **Premise and Theme:**  \n  This is a fun little adventure focusing on what happens to the heroes after they’ve saved the world at a cost. It’s a nice spin to see that not everything is hunky-dory once the day is won.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main cast is well-rounded, and you quickly get a sense of how each is handling their own survivor’s guilt (not well). Elowen has withdrawn from society completely, spending her time watching telenovelas/soap operas. Beatrice relives her worst moment every night due to her magic, and Clare puts on such a brave act that he’s hidden his true feelings from himself.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story starts with the reluctant heroes embarking on a new quest together, and as always, the truth will out. The plot is engaging and easy to follow, making it a nice, cozy read that you can pick up anytime without needing to recall a thousand different plot threads.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  There are some mild spicy bits, but they fit well within the plot and serve as a satisfying conclusion to the character arcs.  \n\n- **World-Building and Real-World Integration:**  \n  I really enjoyed the integration of real-world aspects, such as the soap operas, Elowen discussing plot twists on the “message threads” of her magic tapestry, and the fantasy-style rideshare “carriges-for-you.” These elements reminded me of Terry Pratchett’s *Discworld*, a series I’m a huge fan of, and they added to my enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll in all, this book is a cozy, satisfying, and fun read. The title is spot-on—it delivers exactly what it promises.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

The story delves into the lives of Beatrice, Clare, and Elowen ten years after they saved the realm of Mythria, focusing on how they grapple with the unresolved issues from their past. I found this twist on traditional fantasy tropes refreshing and engaging.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are a standout element of the novel. Each of them has dealt with the aftermath of their quest in unique ways, whether by seeking fame and adulation or withdrawing from the world entirely. Their relationships—ranging from friendships to romantic connections—were deeply affected by their shared experiences, and I appreciated how the story explored these dynamics. The attention to character evolution made the narrative compelling and relatable.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  While the premise and characters were strong, the worldbuilding could have been more developed. Mythria is a realm predicated on magic, but the magic system felt inconsistent and unclear. Magic seemed to occur when convenient for the plot rather than following a structured system, which left me confused at times. Additionally, some of the secondary characters were underdeveloped, appearing more as sketches than fully realized individuals.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The book drags in the middle, particularly when the protagonists spend too much time introspecting and circling around in their thoughts. This slowed the momentum of the story and made certain sections feel less engaging.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *This Will Be Fun* is aptly titled.

The description sounded exactly like what I would love to read—a funny “questmance.” However, it turned out to be a letdown.  \n\n- **Comparison to Galavant:**  \n  The book reminded me a lot of the TV show *Galavant*, which is a cross between *Monty Python* and *The Princess Bride*. I could never fully dislike a book that evokes *Galavant*, but this comparison also highlights where the book falls short.  \n\n- **Structural Flaws:**  \n  The book is told from the perspective of the questers ten years after saving the realm and breaking up the squad. This structure means much of the story lives in the past. The heroic journey is briefly summarized, and the characters spend too much time rehashing past miscommunications and discussing their emotions. This approach makes the character development feel unearned and the relationships dissatisfying, as we never get grounded in their history.  \n\n- **Plot Issues:**  \n  In *Galavant*, the plot is convoluted but intentionally so, with characters breaking the fourth wall to explain it. Here, the first half of the book is spent traveling to a wedding, which feels lackluster. For a book that throws rules and logic out the window in the name of humor and fun, I expected more excitement and entertainment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential and drew comparisons to *Galavant*, its structural flaws, lack of a compelling plot, and unearned character development made it a disappointing read. It didn’t deliver the fun and humor I had hoped for.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Elowen is a grumpy former hero convinced she must remain alone forever, while Vandra, a reformed assassin, brings a contagious optimism.

Beatrice, a stubborn and complex powerhouse, embarks on a refreshing journey to repair her romantic bond with Clare and her platonic relationship with Elowen. The inclusion of two second-chance romances is delightful. Elowen and Vandra’s dynamic is particularly engaging, enriched by their history of fleeting connections during their first quest. Similarly, Beatrice and Clare's relationship unfolds as they confront unresolved feelings and misunderstandings from their past.",

It harmoniously blends a cozy, playful fantasy with deeper, serious themes, resembling more of a romantic drama with magical elements. The narrative explores concepts such as second chances, past loves, and the burdens of loss. While it maintains a light, sweet, and whimsical tone, it occasionally ventures into heavier emotional territory. The villains, though strong, are defeated rather easily, keeping the stakes low. Ultimately, the pacing favors character-driven drama over action-packed adventure.",

Clare's longing for Beatrice, Beatrice's guilt over their shared history, and Elowen's hesitance to face her past with Vandra deepen their interactions. Their reunion reveals unresolved emotions and complex relationships, giving the story a magical soap opera quality.",

It blends romance, comedy, and magic in a cozy, contemporary setting with relatable characters and themes of grief and friendship.

While the plot was engaging and easy to follow, it was very predictable. I guessed most of the plot points before they happened. However, this didn’t detract from my enjoyment, as the book felt like a “brain off” kind of read—light and entertaining.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was slightly lackluster. It seemed like the authors were trying to recreate real-world places but added magical elements to them. This approach didn’t feel particularly original or immersive, leaving the setting feeling underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic system was my biggest issue with the book. It lacked structure and consistency, often changing to suit the plot’s needs. Additionally, some of the magical choices felt silly and out of place, which detracted from the overall believability of the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Accessibility:**  \n  The language was simple and easy to comprehend, making the book a breeze to read. This accessibility makes it a great entry-level fantasy novel for adults who are new to the genre and not looking for a deeply critical or complex read.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The tension and bad blood between the heroes added an interesting layer to the story.

However, the lack of high stakes and the slow reveal of past events made it difficult for me to stay engaged. I personally struggled with the low-stakes plot and the prolonged mystery surrounding the characters' falling out and their friend's death.\n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  The characters' personalities are vividly portrayed through Asher's writing, and their banter and dialogue are highly entertaining. Each character is grappling with grief and trauma in their own way, which adds depth to their interactions. However, the intense level of miscommunication between the characters and the reader being kept \"in the dark\" about their past conflicts became frustrating for me.\n\n- **World-Building and Tone:**  \n  The book creates a whimsical world with very light magic, which contributes to its cozy and character-driven atmosphere. This aspect, combined with the low-stakes quest, makes it appealing to readers who enjoy such settings.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *This Will Be Fun* offers a whimsical world, engaging character dynamics, and a light-hearted quest, the low-stakes plot and prolonged mystery surrounding the characters' past conflicts made it difficult for me to stay invested.

While each character technically had a backstory and a flaw to overcome, they felt more like sketches or outlines rather than fully realized individuals.  \n\n- **Language and Style:**  \n  The language was a significant issue for me.

The romance was also solid and well-earned.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a delightful read that combined whimsical world-building, deeply satisfying character development, and a heartwarming plot. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the world of Mythria with the Four and would recommend it to anyone who loves cozy fantasy with a focus on personal growth and found family.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The book tried to capture the humor of something like *The Princess Bride* without the world-building to back it up.  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building in this book just did not do it for me. There were a lot of modern references that didn’t seem to work as well in the book. I think the book could have benefited from establishing what modern elements existed within this fiction/fantasy realm, like *A Knight’s Tale* or *Ella Enchanted* did. I'd compare the world more to *Shrek* than anything.  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This is much more rom-com and \"ignore the rules of the world\" than fantasy. It’s a cozy quest romantasy with a focus on romance and humor rather than deep fantasy elements.  \n- **Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Don’t get me wrong, this is still an enjoyable story; I just feel that the world-building could have been solidified a bit more. I would recommend it to romance readers who want to dip their toes into fantasy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book didn’t fully meet my expectations, particularly in terms of world-building, it remains an enjoyable read with a strong rom-com vibe. It’s a good choice for romance fans looking to explore fantasy elements, though it leans more toward humor and romance than traditional fantasy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I was quickly disappointed because the story turned out to be much heavier on grief and angst than I anticipated.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There is a lot of good character growth throughout the book. The story delves into how the four heroes have been affected by the loss of their unofficial leader ten years ago and how they cope with their trauma when they are summoned back together for a wedding.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot revolves around the group reliving their past trauma when the groom is kidnapped, forcing them to confront their history. While there is a happy ending, the pacing felt frustrating. The story could have ended satisfactorily after they defeated the enemy and rescued the groom, but instead, it introduced a sudden twist where one character gains powers to bring back their lost member, which felt unnecessary and forced.  \n\n- **Tone and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book is very grief-heavy, filled with angst, fighting, and trauma. While this adds depth to the characters, it made the reading experience emotionally draining, and I had to push myself to finish it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, while the book has strong character development and a compelling premise, the heavy focus on grief and the unsatisfying ending left me frustrated. It didn’t meet my expectations based on its comparisons to lighter, more whimsical stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  I had high hopes for this book, especially as a cozy fantasy, but it fell a bit flat. The concept of “The Four” saving the realm again felt underdeveloped, and I’m unsure if this was due to having three different authors or a lack of thorough planning. The story didn’t live up to my expectations.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  A significant portion of the plot revolved around whether Clare and Beatrice would reconcile, which became overly angsty and eventually annoying. Elowen’s constant complaining and negative outlook, despite her magic allowing her to sense others’ feelings, felt inconsistent. Her feud with Beatrice also seemed exaggerated and unrealistic.\n\n- **Tone and Genre Comparison:**  \n  The book reminded me more of *Ella Enchanted* than *The Princess Bride*. It leaned heavily into cozy romance but lacked the depth and substance I was hoping for.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments, it ultimately left me disappointed. The underdeveloped plot, exaggerated character conflicts, and lack of depth made it feel more like a light, cozy romance than a compelling fantasy. It might appeal to readers seeking a simple, romantic story, but it didn’t meet my expectations for a more substantial fantasy novel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The novel takes time to find its rhythm, and when it does, it struggles with an odd balance between the emotional reunion of the heroes and the resolution of their quest. The quest bears significant stakes but feels ultimately trivial, which undermines the story's more poignant themes. A low-stakes quest might have allowed for a deeper exploration of the characters' emotional fallout from their past journey, rather than diverting attention to a new, high-stakes danger.",

The quest feels unbalanced because it’s incredibly high-stakes yet ultimately unimportant, which detracts from the more touching core themes.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The core of the story, dealing with grief, mistakes, and the aftermath of saving the world, is genuinely touching and well-executed. I appreciated the focus on what happens after the heroes’ victory and how they navigate the fallout.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world is a delightful mix of modern and fantasy elements, with creative touches like spell reception, shadow plays, \"brew\" shops, and tapestry message boards. This unique blend adds a lot of charm and fun to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Focus:**  \n  The story might have worked better if the quest had been low-stakes, allowing more focus on the past quest and its emotional fallout rather than introducing a new, high-stakes danger.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Potential:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the novel is still fun, as the title suggests. I thoroughly enjoyed the concept of heroes dealing with what comes next and would love to see more stories in this vein, especially in such a vibrant and imaginative fantasy world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel struggles with pacing and balancing its high-stakes quest against its emotional core, it shines in its exploration of grief, mistakes, and the aftermath of heroism.

The plot isn’t really introduced until the middle of the book, and even then, it feels more like a device to bring the characters back together to work through their problems.

While they were generally likeable, I would have preferred less time spent in their heads, as listening to them beat themselves up got pretty redundant.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I appreciated that a romantasy book did not give the fantasy part short shrift. There was actual world-building, which I enjoyed.  \n\n- **Modern Sensibility:**  \n  The book has a very modern sensibility, with stand-ins for things like Starbucks, soap operas, and even therapists (referred to as heart healers). I found this aspect kind of cute.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some interesting ideas, such as the three POVs and the world-building, it suffered from pacing issues, excessive introspection, and a lack of a strong, early plot.

            "I thoroughly enjoyed Clare and Beatrice's journey as they navigated personal growth in their relationship while forming friendships and battling villains. Beatrice’s strength shone through as she learned to cope with her pain and grief, finding solace in her friends. Clare, on the other hand, discovered that he could be authentic and accept help from others, even in heroic moments. Elowen's struggle with her sibling's death offered a fresh perspective, as it’s a theme I don’t often encounter. Her character development was compelling, illustrating her growth in trusting her friends and fighting alongside them during challenging times.",

The setting perfectly captured the magical and adventurous essence I enjoy.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved Clare and Beatrice and how they had to grow and mature in their relationship while also developing friendships and fighting villains simultaneously.  \n  Beatrice was so strong and learned how to deal with hurt and grieve properly, turning to her friends for comfort.  \n  Clare learned that he doesn’t need to pretend he’s somebody he isn’t all the time and to let others help him in times of being heroic.  \n  Elowen was a different character for me to read about because I usually don’t read stories where a character’s sibling dies and they go through a grief struggle, but this one worked. Elowen learned to trust people and her friends, and to not give up on them when the going gets tough, but instead to fight alongside them.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story balanced personal growth, relationships, and action well. The themes of grief, trust, and self-acceptance were handled thoughtfully and added depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Altogether, I really enjoyed this book and I’m so glad I read it!

It gives the book a unique charm reminiscent of *The Princess Bride*.  \n\n- **World-Building and Fantasy Elements:**  \n  The fantasy elements and world-building feel underdeveloped, serving more as a backdrop than a central focus. The quest to save the realm lacks depth and urgency, which detracts from the overall stakes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis cozy romantasy has potential with its unique writing style, engaging character interactions, and dual romance plots. However, the underdeveloped plot, pacing issues, and lack of focus on the fantasy elements make it fall short of its full promise.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This cozy fantasy novel features a slow pace, particularly in the first half, which delves deeply into the characters' lives and their pasts from ten years ago. Although the action picks up significantly with the quest to find the queen's fiancé and confront the Order's return, this exciting turn occurs only halfway through the book. As a result, the pacing feels uneven, with the first half dragging while the second half becomes much more engaging.",
            "The characters are richly developed, reminiscent of a classic D&D party, each embodying unique personalities and challenges. Clare struggles to move on from his past with Beatrice, who in turn is burdened by guilt over their separation. Elowen faces difficulties reintegrating into society, especially with the reemergence of her former flame, Vandra. The absence of their former leader, Galwell, is keenly felt by the entire group.",

The second half of the book, with its increased action and quest-driven plot, was more enjoyable, but the first half felt overly drawn out. Despite this, the magic system and character dynamics were highlights, making it a worthwhile read for fans of cozy fantasy.",

While the ending fell short of expectations, the strong character dynamics, queer representation, and well-crafted spicy scenes made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- My Grade: B ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  \n- Spice Level: 🌶️🌶️🌶️ out of 5"

The excessive self-loathing and reliance on miscommunication made it less enjoyable for me, and I feel it may resonate more with a younger audience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

I might revisit this novel in the future, but for now, it’s a DNF (Did Not Finish).  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF (No numerical rating provided).  \n\nThank you to NetGalley, E.B. Asher, Avon, and Harper Voyager for providing me with an eARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review. 🥰"

I was impatient for the actual questing and stuff. There was some excellent quest stuff in here, and I really wanted to delve further into that, but it just kind of got brushed over. The timewalker bit was far more interesting than Beatrice's conflicted feelings over Clare, which took, for some reason, a whole book to go over. I'd love to hear more about the actual questy bits; maybe we'll get more on that.\n\n- **Character Exposition:**  \n  The character exposition was not the most engaging for me. I couldn't care as much as it felt like I was being forced to. Beatrice's conflicted feelings over Clare dominated the narrative, which didn't resonate with me.\n\n- **Romance Elements:**  \n  I'm definitely NOT a fan of romantasy, so any of the romance in this just made me bored, for the most part. Maybe I'm just not the target market. After seeing the author bio, the romance stuff makes way more sense, but it still didn't appeal to me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some intriguing elements, particularly the quest and timewalker aspects, the heavy focus on character exposition and romance detracted from my enjoyment.

This aspect detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story.\n\n- **Tone and Pacing:**  \n  The story had a farcical tone, which made it feel lighthearted and funny. However, the pacing suffered due to the repetition of the characters' self-loathing, making certain parts feel drawn out.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the story is ultimately a feel-good one with potential. It’s a humorous tale, though it didn’t fully resonate with me, possibly because I don’t typically read fantasy or romance.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has its strengths, including likable characters and a humorous tone, it is weighed down by repetitive self-loathing, excessive magical elements, and a simpler-than-expected plot. It’s a feel-good story with potential, but it didn’t fully captivate me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The pacing felt slow, and the story failed to hold my interest.  \n\n- **Tropes and Plot Development:**  \n  I do not like the miscommunication trope, and having almost half the book pass before the characters actually talked about why half of them had issues with each other did not help me become engaged in the story.  \n\n- **Writing Consistency and Cohesion:**  \n  In my opinion, having three different authors write this story did not help. At some points, I felt the story lacked flow, and the characters' POVs were not written cohesively.  \n\n- **Positive Highlights:**  \n  On a positive note, I did enjoy Vandra. Anytime she showed up in chapters, she was a breath of fresh air.

This emotional tone didn’t resonate with me as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story felt cluttered with elements like a reincarnated hero, a sapphic second-chance romance, and a clumsy second-chance romance between two heroes. Additionally, the quest to find the protagonist from 10 years ago added to the confusion. The neverending misunderstandings throughout the plot were frustrating and detracted from my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  I found the inclusion of modern luxuries in a setting reminiscent of Camelot jarring and inconsistent with the world-building. This disconnect made it harder for me to immerse myself in the story.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The romantic relationships, particularly the sapphic second-chance romance and the clumsy romance between the two heroes, felt awkward and underdeveloped. These dynamics didn’t add depth to the story and instead felt forced.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a cozy atmosphere, its overwhelming sadness, cluttered plot, inconsistent world-building, and awkward character dynamics made it a disappointing read for me.

It revisits the lives of the once-heroes ten years after their quest has concluded. However, the story took a while to gain momentum, but once all the characters were introduced, it became more engaging.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters demonstrated significant growth, particularly in learning to cope with their grief. This aspect of their journey was well-portrayed and added depth to the narrative.  \n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending was disappointing. A pivotal moment in the characters' lives was abruptly altered without any meaningful repercussions, which felt unsatisfying and undermined the emotional weight of their growth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is an engaging fantasy story with strong character development and a unique premise. However, the abrupt and unresolved ending detracted from the overall experience, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Its humor and subversion of traditional heroism make for a refreshing read.",

It feels tacky and doesn’t align well with the cozy, light, and fun vibe of the story. However, the book itself is enjoyable, and I hope the title doesn’t discourage too many potential readers.  \n\n- **Narrative and Themes:**  \n  I love the “former young Chosen Ones make for especially messy adults” narrative. The book deconstructs the Chosen One trope and explores what happens to beloved heroes in a world with Shrek-style medieval-meets-modern worldbuilding. It’s humorous and flips the concept of heroes on its head, which I found refreshing.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The main characters—Beatrice, Clare, Elowen, and Galwell—are wonderfully flawed and morally gray, presented with humor and sympathy. Beatrice is navigating a fresh divorce and over-imbibing, Clare is a charming influencer, Elowen is isolated in a treetop home, and Vandra, the former assassin, adds an intriguing dynamic. Their messy lives and interactions are a highlight of the story.  \n\n- **Tone and Worldbuilding:**  \n  The tone is light, goofy, and fun, which makes the book charming if you approach it with the right expectations. The worldbuilding is humorous and doesn’t take itself too seriously, blending medieval and modern elements in a way that feels fresh and entertaining.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot feels lacking in stakes and action until the final showdown, which resolves too conveniently with a deus ex machina. While I appreciate character-driven stories, I wish the plot had more tension and peril to match the potential of the premise.  \n\n- **Genre and Audience:**  \n  This is an adult novel with a cozy, light fantasy vibe. It’s not dark or brooding, nor is it particularly spicy, so it may not appeal to readers looking for intense drama or romance. It’s best suited for those seeking a breezy, fun read.  \n\n- **Author Background:**  \n  E.B. Asher is a pen name for an author team, and this book feels like an irregular foray into fantasy for writers who typically focus on contemporary fiction. The lack of adventure makes sense in this context, as it reads more like a contemporary story set in a fantasy world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*This Will Be Fun* is a light, humorous, and character-driven novel that deconstructs the Chosen One trope with a quirky, medieval-meets-modern world. While the plot lacks stakes and the title is off-putting, the tone, characters, and worldbuilding make it an enjoyable, cozy read for those seeking something fun and breezy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nMiddling rating due to the lack of plot stakes, but overall an enjoyable read."

Asher is a penname for authors Bridget Morrissey, Emily Wibberley, and Austin Siegemund-Broka. While Bridget Morrissey wrote one of my favorite books, I haven’t connected with Emily Wibberley and Austin Siegemund-Broka’s writing. It was very obvious which character and POV was attributed to each author, making the story feel disjointed at times. This improved slightly in the middle, but my initial bias may have influenced my perception.\n\n- **Concept and Premise:**  \n  The concept of the story—heroes who saved the realm being called back for the queen’s wedding after a decade apart—is brilliant and was the saving grace of the book for me. I also enjoyed the ideas behind each character, though I wish they had been executed better.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I wanted more tension between the romantic pairings and between Beatrice and Elowen. This would have made the relationships sweeter and more engaging.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world and world-building were interesting but felt superficial. The real-world comparisons (Vegas, Starbucks, Uber, soap operas, etc.) made it hard to fully immerse myself in the story. It reminded me more of Shrek’s tongue-in-cheek humor than The Princess Bride’s cozy fantasy vibe. I think the setting would have been stronger if the authors leaned into a more robust parody, like the Dungeons and Dragons movie.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot was dull, especially in the second half when the characters are called to save the realm again. I would have preferred a low-stakes plotline focused on characterization and world-building, such as a comedy-of-errors situation at the queen’s wedding, rather than a high-stakes, hastily constructed plot.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI loved the unique concept of this book but felt it was poorly executed. The disjointed writing, superficial world-building, and lack of tension in character dynamics made it a disappointing read. A stronger focus on parody and a low-stakes plot could have made it much richer.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It has a top slot on my favorites shelf, and I rushed immediately to make sure I pre-ordered my own signed copy. This whole book felt like that joyful kick-your-feet fun that I never wanted to end. Books like this remind me why I read and the sheer joy that happens when you find just the right book.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book seamlessly incorporates real depth of character and background for each of the characters. Having 4 different POVs could have made this muddled or superficial, but instead, it made each of the characters so much more complex and real. Having them be in their 30s, I felt that I knew each of them so well and understood their baggage and choices so much better—they felt their age rather than just not being 18-year-olds.\n\n- **Themes and Relationships:**  \n  I appreciated that the friendship difficulties were treated with the same importance as any of the romance-related problems. On top of all the trauma and angst, this book is still so funny, enjoyable, and just a delight.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building felt so unique. I found the mix of the general medieval-style fantasy with the more fun fantastical elements to be so charming and whimsical. I definitely feel the *Princess Bride* comparisons.\n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book is fun, campy, and full of heart. It balances humor and depth perfectly, making it a delightful read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a perfect blend of humor, heart, and depth, with well-developed characters, a unique and whimsical world, and a tone that makes it an absolute joy to read.
