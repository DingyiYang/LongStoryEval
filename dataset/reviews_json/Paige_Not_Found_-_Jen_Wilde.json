            "The break-in at the Nucleus headquarters lacked tension due to minimal stakes. The scenario felt implausible, featuring absent security cameras, unlocked labs, and conveniently missing staff. Kelsey's effortless hacking of a high-security laptop strained credibility. The scientist's quick decision to assist the kids after a brief conversation seemed forced, and the absence of security guards diminished the plot's credibility. The antagonist was a one-dimensional billionaire caricature, failing to present a genuine threat or stakes. Despite claims of high risk, the story lacked a real sense of danger or consequences for the characters.",

Phrases like \"toxic billionaire\" and \"without my informed consent\" are not typical for eleven-year-olds, making the story feel misaligned with its intended age group.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The premise is fantastic, featuring autistic children discovering they had chips implanted in their brains without their consent, with the data being sold to an evil corporation. The plot includes a ragtag group of disabled kids, accurate depictions of autistic meltdowns and joy, and subtle queer representation. Scenes like Paige and Mara finding Kelsey and Marcus were particularly well-executed.  \n\n- **Character Authenticity:**  \n  While the characters are unique and well-intentioned, their dialogue and self-awareness (e.g., listing their identities) feel unrealistic for eleven-year-olds. The story would have been stronger if the protagonist, Paige, were seventeen, as the dialogue and narrative style align more naturally with a teenage perspective.  \n\n- **Author's Background:**  \n  The author, Jen Wilde, has a strong background in YA literature, which may explain why the book feels more suited to that genre. Middle grade requires a different approach, and the transition here feels uneven.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has a compelling premise and strong plot elements, particularly in its representation of autistic experiences and queer identities. However, its execution as a middle-grade novel falls short due to dialogue and narration that feel more appropriate for a YA audience. Adjusting the characters' ages to align with the tone and style could have significantly strengthened the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe review implies a rating lower than five stars due to the genre mismatch, though no specific score is provided."

            "The story presents several overly convenient situations, such as Paige's challenge in the Realm of Wonders game, the security guard abandoning their post, and Paige's easy escape from her teacher during a school trip. The resolution, including the Happily Ever After ending, feels contrived and unrealistic. While the plot is easy to follow and the writing is straightforward, making it suitable for middle-grade readers, the story lacks tension and difficulty. This is particularly evident during the climax, where the protagonists achieve their goals—like infiltrating a research facility, hacking a computer, and persuading a high-ranking official to resign—without facing significant obstacles.",
            "This book features an Autistic protagonist, a rare and significant choice that enhances diversity in literature. The inclusion of varied characters allows readers to connect with and understand different perspectives, particularly those of neurodivergent individuals. However, Paige's journey of exploring her sexuality and gender identity (transitioning from female to nonbinary) feels abrupt and underdeveloped. While it briefly becomes a focal point, the narrative quickly drops it, leading to a sense of inconsistency. Additionally, Paige's parents are portrayed as one-dimensional antagonists, and her refusal to communicate with them—and others—creates unnecessary conflict, even when her closest friend encourages dialogue. The relationship between Paige and her best friend Mara also feels forced, particularly during their mutual coming-out moment at the end, which comes across as abrupt and unrealistic.",
            "The book skillfully delves into the emotions and thoughts of a neurodivergent protagonist, fostering understanding and empathy for their experiences. However, the absence of tension and overly convenient resolutions weaken the story's emotional impact and believability."

The revelation that he plans to sell this business to a social media-connected company known for selling personal data adds a layer of urgency and relevance. The plot thickens as Paige, connected to the program, decides to bring it down. She collaborates with other local autistic children who also have implants, forming a team to uncover the truth. Their mission to sneak into the business and expose its dangers is particularly gripping and well-executed.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Paige is a compelling protagonist, especially as a nonbinary character navigating unspoken feelings for her best friend. Her growth in social skills, aided by her non-autistic best friend, adds depth to her character.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style and Clarity:**  \n   - The writing was poorly executed. The repetitive use of phrases like \"Paige's mom/dad says\" was unnecessary and could have been simplified to \"mom\" or \"dad.\"  \n   - The dialogue felt unrealistic, as the language used by the characters (tweens) didn't align with how tweens actually speak.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n   - I appreciated the Autism representation in females, as it's something we need more of in literature.  \n   - However, the heavy-handed political agenda, particularly the portrayal of rich white men as universally bad, was off-putting. While some may fit that description, it's not fair to generalize any group.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - The story was boring and failed to hold my interest.  \n   - Overall, the writing could have been significantly improved to make the novel more engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some positive elements, such as the representation of Autism in females, it was ultimately let down by its poor writing style, unrealistic dialogue, and heavy-handed political messaging. These factors made the book unenjoyable and led me to not finish it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- DNF (Did Not Finish)"
