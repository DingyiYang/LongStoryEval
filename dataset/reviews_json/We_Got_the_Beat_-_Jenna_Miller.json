            "The story centers on Jordan, who aspires to be the editor of her high school newspaper but is instead tasked with covering the volleyball team. This assignment brings her into contact with her former friend and rival, Mackenzie. However, the absence of conflict between them makes their rivalry feel lackluster, leading to an anti-climactic resolution. Although the ending, where Jordan recognizes that their issues arose from miscommunication, is satisfying, the plot ultimately lacks the depth and stakes needed to fully captivate my interest.",
            "Jordan is a relatable and refreshing protagonist—a book nerd who embraces her queerness and body size. It's refreshing to see a plus-size character whose journey isn't centered on body image. However, the supporting characters feel one-dimensional and overly perfect, which detracts from their believability as teenagers. While their interactions and relationship dynamics are healthy, they lack the depth and complexity needed to make their connection truly compelling.",
            "The book was an easy and enjoyable read, characterized by a light, cute, and fluffy tone. While its simplicity may appeal to some, I found it lacking the depth and emotional resonance I typically seek in a novel, which ultimately detracted from my overall experience.",
            "This book shines in its portrayal of body positivity and queer representation, which I found particularly refreshing. The protagonist's confidence in her identity is a standout feature. Additionally, the focus on communication and healthy relationships is commendable, though it occasionally feels overly idealized for a teen narrative."

        "conclusion": "*We Got the Beat* is a solid, lighthearted read with strong representation and a feel-good tone. While it succeeds in delivering a cute romance and positive messaging, it falls short in character development and tension, making the story feel somewhat flat. Readers looking for a simple, fluffy YA romance will likely enjoy this, but those seeking more depth and complexity may find it lacking.",

This leads to her reconnecting with her former friend-turned-rival, Mackenzie.  \n   - The lack of tension between Jordan and Mackenzie made their rivalry feel underwhelming, resulting in an anti-climactic resolution.  \n   - While the resolution was satisfying (with Jordan realizing their issues stemmed from miscommunication), the overall plot lacked the necessary depth and stakes to fully engage me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Jordan is a relatable and refreshing protagonist—a book nerd who is comfortable with her queerness and body size. It was great to see a plus-size character whose journey didn’t revolve around body image.  \n   - However, the characters felt one-dimensional and too perfect, which made them less believable as teenagers. Their interactions and relationship dynamics, while healthy, came across as surface-level and lacked the complexity needed to make their connection compelling.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n   - The book excels in its body positivity and queer representation, which was a highlight for me. It was refreshing to see a protagonist who was already confident in her identity.  \n   - The emphasis on communication and healthy relationships was a positive aspect, though it sometimes felt overly idealized and unrealistic for a teen narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - The book was easy to read and had a light, cute, and fluffy tone, making it a quick and enjoyable read.  \n   - The simplicity of the story, while appealing to some readers, detracted from my overall experience.

            "The characters feel overly polished and unproblematic, as if they've all undergone therapy, detracting from their depth and relatability. Teen characters, in particular, should be messy and confused, but instead appear sanded down and rounded off. Mack, the protagonist, has a thin personality, and her lack of chemistry with Jordan weakens the narrative. The tension between them, which should have been a highlight given the premise, quickly fizzles out. Although Mack initially resists the dynamic, the energy fails to redirect, resulting in minimal meaningful interaction or connection.",
            "The book combines cheesiness that serves both to enhance and detract from its appeal. It offers a quick, accessible read for those seeking light sapphic romance. However, readers hoping for complex, messy characters and deeper emotional resonance may find it lacking in substance.",
            "The premise of forced allies and proximity is intriguing, particularly the concept of an ex-friend and ex-crush writing enthusiastic articles about her. The friends-to-enemies-to-lovers trope, combined with forced proximity, is generally appealing and may resonate with many readers."

The story felt lackluster and failed to stand out in the crowded YA sapphic romance genre, ultimately leaving me unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "In this story, Jordan is assigned to cover the volleyball team for the semester, a challenging situation made worse by the fact that her former friend Mackenzie, or \"Mack,\" is not only on the team but has also been named captain. The narrative effectively explores Jordan's struggle to determine whether she can trust Mack, who betrayed her in a significant way at the start of high school, all while trying to prove her readiness for an editor role to her journalism teacher. However, the story feels somewhat shallow; conflicts resolve too easily, and I would have preferred a deeper exploration of Jordan and Mack's evolving feelings to make their journey feel more authentic. Additionally, a pivotal moment in the plot mirrors a similar scene from another book I read recently, and the resolution for one character felt unconvincing. This moment, like others, could have benefited from more development.",
            "In this story, Jordan, who describes herself as overweight and somewhat unpopular, is supported by two incredible best friends and is poised to secure an editor's position for her high school newspaper in her junior year. The author excels at portraying realistically flawed characters; neither Jordan nor her friend Mack is perfect, and both must confront their mistakes. Additionally, the side characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional, adding depth to the narrative.",
            "I was pleasantly surprised by the emotional depth of *We Got the Beat*, a YA novel centered on an aspiring journalist and a volleyball player. This charming story of former best friends turned rivals who eventually find love is both engaging and heartfelt.",

        ],
        "conclusion": "We Got the Beat is an emotionally engaging YA novel with realistically messy characters and a cute enemies-to-lovers storyline. While the character development and relationships are well-crafted, the plot feels somewhat shallow at times, with resolutions that could have been more nuanced and earned. Despite these flaws, the story is enjoyable, particularly due to the charm of the characters.",

She doesn’t make Jordan or Mack perfect characters. They each make mistakes and have to account for them.  \n   - The side characters were also multi-dimensional.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n   - Jordan isn’t given an editor role and instead is assigned to cover the volleyball team for the semester—the same volleyball team that Mackenzie (“Mack”) is on, which is bad enough on its own, but is infinitely worse when Mack is named the team’s captain.  \n   - I enjoyed watching Jordan figure out if she can trust Mack in any way, after Mack betrayed her in a truly awful way at the start of high school, while Jordan is also trying to prove to her journalism teacher that she’s ready to be an editor.  \n\n- **Pacing and Depth:**  \n   - Where Miller falters a bit is the story felt a little shallow. Things came together too easily, and I would have preferred more time spent on the development of Jordan and Mack’s feelings to feel like they’re earned.  \n   - The act that caused the climax of tension in this novel is identical to a similar moment in a book I read last year.  \n   - The resolution of this moment in this novel (as it pertains to a particular character) didn’t ring true. It was another moment that Miller could have drawn out more and didn’t.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Personal Preference:**  \n   - I’m rounding up because I liked Mack so much.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWe Got the Beat is an emotionally engaging YA novel with realistically messy characters and a cute enemies-to-lovers storyline.

The premise of Jordan covering the girls' volleyball beat and interviewing her former friend-turned-nemesis, Mackenzie, was particularly engaging. I appreciated the exploration of their past friendship, its unraveling, and their eventual reconciliation. However, the ending felt rushed; I would have liked more time to fully immerse myself in the characters' lives and relationships during the resolution.",
            "Jordan is a thoughtfully crafted protagonist whose passion for journalism, nerdy interests, and strong friendships with Audrey and Isaac bring the story to life. I appreciated her portrayal as an out and proud lesbian who embraces her body, confidently navigating her fat identity despite occasional concerns about societal judgment. Mackenzie’s character enriches the narrative, and the complex dynamic between her and Jordan adds an engaging layer to the story.",

The representation of various identities—fatness, queerness, and cultural backgrounds—is both impeccable and relatable. The inclusion of a non-binary journalist teacher in their late 20s resonated with me, making me feel seen and validated. The characters are delightful and authentically portray the teenage experience, complete with mistakes and occasional immaturity, which feels true to 16-year-olds. Jordan, the protagonist, is unapologetically nerdy and embraces her body, quickly becoming one of my favorite YA characters. Mack, the love interest, is endearing, and their romance is beautifully crafted, a rarity in teen literature.",

It was fun, occasionally emotional, and very easy to read.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters, like Nara, often felt flat in personality, with many of them defined by just one trait, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes Execution:**  \n   - Certain plots and themes, such as Mack’s parental issues, were set up but never fully developed or resolved.  \n   - Tension was built but then resolved too easily, leaving the story feeling shallow.  \n\n- **Potential and Depth:**  \n   - While I liked many aspects of the book—the characters, relationships, friendships, and plot—I felt like so much more could have been done with them. It seemed like the story only skimmed the surface of its potential.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n   - Overall, I wouldn’t say I loved this book. There was just a spark missing for me.  \n   - It was a decent read, but it’s not particularly memorable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*We Got the Beat* is an enjoyable and easy-to-read sapphic romance with themes of second chances and forgiveness. However, its characters and plotlines lacked depth and development, leaving the story feeling underdeveloped and forgettable. While it had potential, it ultimately fell short of being a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Brie’s character comes across as predictable, with her animosity toward Mack evident from the beginning. Furthermore, it seems unfair that the adults disproportionately blame Brie, creating an unbalanced narrative.",

In the author's country, being overweight is not stigmatized, yet the main character frequently interprets negative interactions as a reflection of her weight. This perspective feels both sad and unrealistic. It raises questions about whether this viewpoint mirrors American societal attitudes, prompting concern about its implications.",
            "The book has its entertaining moments, but ultimately, it's forgettable. I found myself struggling to remember the main character's name and details about the side characters, which reflects a weak emotional and intellectual connection to the story."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Cultural Representation and Sensitivity:**\n   - The reviewer notes a cultural disconnect regarding the portrayal of weight in the novel. In their country, being fat is not stigmatized, but the MC in the book constantly assumes negative interactions are due to her weight, which the reviewer finds sad and unrealistic.\n   - The reviewer questions whether this reflects American societal attitudes, expressing concern about the implications.\n\n- **Character Development and Consistency:**\n   - The MC’s actions, such as typing a hateful article out of insecurity, are understandable to the reviewer. However, the friend Aubrey/Audrey’s decision to post the article feels inconsistent with her earlier characterization. The reviewer finds her lack of remorse and the sudden shift in behavior jarring.\n   - The side characters, Isaac and Olivia, are criticized for being underdeveloped and primarily serving as romantic interests with minimal impact on the story.\n   - Brie’s character is seen as predictable, with her hatred for Mack being obvious from the start. The reviewer also feels the adults in the story unfairly place most of the blame on Brie, which feels unbalanced.\n\n- **Memorability and Engagement:**\n   - The reviewer finds the book fun in some places but ultimately unmemorable. They mention forgetting the MC’s name and struggling to recall details about the side characters, indicating a lack of strong emotional or intellectual engagement with the story.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The reviewer finds the plot predictable and notes that certain elements, like Brie’s hatred for Mack, were telegraphed early on, reducing the impact of any intended twists.\n   - The pacing of character interactions, particularly Aubrey/Audrey’s actions, feels rushed and inconsistent.\n\n- **Recommendation:**\n   - The reviewer would recommend the book, but only with reservations. They describe it as “terrible” but not in a way that makes it stand out, suggesting it’s mediocre rather than outright bad.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reviewer found the book enjoyable in parts but had significant issues with its cultural representation, character development, and predictability. While they acknowledge some relatable aspects of the MC’s insecurities, the inconsistent behavior of side characters and the lack of memorable elements left them underwhelmed.

            "The story follows Jordan as she navigates her junior year, facing setbacks such as missing out on the editor-in-chief position and unexpectedly covering the volleyball team. While the romantic tension between Jordan and Mack, rooted in their history, feels underdeveloped and lacks emotional depth, the book remains adorable, hilarious, and an enjoyable read.",
            "Jordan emerges as a well-crafted character, brimming with personality and relatable interests in writing, journalism, and volleyball. In contrast, Mack feels one-dimensional, lacking depth beyond her role as the volleyball team captain. The side characters often take center stage in romantic scenes, which detracts from the development of the main relationship. This novel unapologetically embraces queer and fat-positive themes, portraying Jordan as a fat, nerdy lesbian with a love for Doctor Who, comics, and books—an authentic and relatable representation. By celebrating sapphic romance and incorporating moments of gay panic, the story resonates deeply with fans of sapphic literature.",

While Mack’s character feels underdeveloped and the romantic tension between the main characters is lacking, the book is still an adorable and hilarious treat for fans of sapphic romance. It’s a fun read with strong representation, though it could have delved deeper into the central relationship.",

While they have their immature teenage moments, they also demonstrate maturity by taking responsibility, forgiving when it's difficult, and understanding the consequences of their actions.

Most actions faced minimal consequences, resulting in low stakes and unsatisfying resolutions. For instance, the accidental article publishing was a significant plot point that fell flat. Audrey received insufficient backlash for publishing it without prior consultation, a serious breach of trust. Moreover, Jordan's choice not to delete or save the article seemed unrealistic and poorly conceived. The volleyball team's lack of reaction was also disappointing; despite Mack's insistence to back off, it seemed implausible that no one defended their captain or expressed frustration towards Jordan.",

This lack of clarity made it difficult to connect with her character."

Conflicts were introduced with the potential to be overwhelming, yet they were resolved too quickly, often within a few pages. There were no significant repercussions for most actions—just a slap on the wrist and a \"do better next time\" attitude. This made the stakes feel low and the resolutions unsatisfying.\n\n- **Communication (or Lack Thereof):**  \n  The lack of communication between characters drove me crazy. It felt like no one was willing to have honest conversations, which made the conflicts feel forced and repetitive. For instance, Jordan and Mack's relationship was full of lust and angst, but they never truly talked about their issues, which made their dynamic frustrating rather than compelling.\n\n- **Specific Plot Points:**  \n  The accidental article publishing was a major plot point that didn’t sit well with me. Audrey deserved more backlash for publishing it without consulting anyone first—it was a serious breach of trust. Additionally, Jordan’s decision not to delete the article or save it elsewhere felt unrealistic and poorly thought out. The lack of reaction from the volleyball team was also disappointing. Even if Mack told them to back off, it felt unrealistic that no one stood up for their captain or showed any frustration toward Jordan.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I went into this book with high expectations but was ultimately let down. The characters were underdeveloped, the conflicts lacked depth and meaningful resolution, and the lack of communication made the story frustrating to follow. While there were moments of potential, they were overshadowed by these issues, leading me to skim through the final portion of the book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐.5 (1.5 out of 5 stars)"

            "Jordan is a relatable and passionate protagonist, driven by her love for journalism and her nerdy interests, such as Doctor Who and her father's comic book shop. Her evolving relationship with her brother, now in college, adds a touching depth to her character. The friendship among Jordan, Audrey, and Isaac is heartwarming, showcasing their commitment to one another even as they begin dating other people. However, I wish their characters had more depth. Mackenzie’s arc, transitioning from a former friend who hurt Jordan to someone seeking to rebuild trust, is particularly compelling. The book features a fat lesbian main character and a bisexual supporting character, which is refreshing. However, it does include content warnings for homophobia and fatphobia.",
            "I appreciated the mature communication among the characters; however, at times it felt unrealistically polished for sixteen-year-olds. I longed for the messy, flawed interactions seen in the author’s debut, *Out of Character*. Jordan's reactions, particularly toward the end, struck me as overly mature. For example, her swift forgiveness of Audrey for posting the article and her muted response to the news were hard to believe. Likewise, her rapid reconciliation with Amber, despite her cruel behavior, felt unconvincing.",
            "This book offers a lighthearted and uplifting experience, ideal for readers looking for a feel-good story. It successfully weaves together romance and personal growth, with themes of forgiveness, reconnection, and self-discovery at its core.",
            "*We Got the Beat* presents an engaging premise that creates significant tension as Jordan, an aspiring journalist, is assigned to cover the volleyball beat instead of the coveted editor position. The conflict with Mackenzie, the new team captain and Jordan's former friend, adds depth to the narrative. I appreciated the exploration of their reconnection as they confront their past, particularly Jordan's struggle to trust Mackenzie while guarding her heart."

        "conclusion": "*We Got the Beat* is a cute, lighthearted sapphic romance with an engaging premise and relatable characters. While it delivers on fluffy moments and themes of forgiveness and reconnection, it sometimes lacks the messiness and depth of the author’s debut. The mature communication between characters, while refreshing, occasionally feels unrealistic for teenagers. Overall, it’s an enjoyable read, especially for fans of lighthearted romance.",

            "Jordan is a compelling first-person protagonist who fearlessly pursues the truth, even when it’s uncomfortable. The teenage characters are authentic, embodying the quirks and emotions reminiscent of a John Hughes film. Jordan’s best friends, Audrey and Isaac, navigate their own emotional journeys, adding depth to the narrative. The volleyball team members are portrayed as complex individuals, each carrying their own resentments and desires. The novel features a lesbian protagonist and several queer characters, some of whom are still in the closet. It thoughtfully addresses body image—Jordan describes herself as fat—and sexual orientation without falling into stereotypes or melodrama. Overall, the story presents a rich tapestry of perspectives that blend harmoniously without excessive drama.",
            "The prose is engaging and fluid, brought to life by a compelling first-person narration that captures Jordan's voice. The book is rich with pop culture references, adding a touch of contemporary realism, though these may age poorly over time. The cinematic writing offers vivid imagery and dynamic action that would translate well to a screen adaptation. Overall, the tone remains positive and inclusive while skillfully addressing darker themes.",
            "This novel beautifully navigates the complexities of coming-of-age queer themes, capturing the nuances of teenage yearnings, joys, struggles, jealousies, and mistakes. It expertly balances the lighter and darker moments of being a junior in love, as it explores shifting friendships and evolving emotions. Set against a backdrop of high school drama, manipulative parents, the fear of coming out, and the pressures of college applications, the story unfolds with a rich layer of social dynamics. The evolving relationship between Jordan and Mack adds depth to the narrative, moving from conflict to connection while grappling with trust issues.",
            "This book captures the heartbreak and uncertainty of teenage life, ultimately culminating in an uplifting conclusion. The characters navigate poor choices that jeopardize their futures, highlighting the complexities of the heart rather than any catastrophic events. Readers are invited to experience the emotional highs and lows of adolescence, with an emphasis on personal growth and learning from mistakes."

I was impressed by her professionalism while reporting on the volleyball beat for the school paper, even in the presence of Mackenzie (I’ll admit, I might not have handled it as gracefully!). Additionally, Jordan’s family adds depth to the story, and the author excels at portraying wonderfully nerdy dads.",

Instead, she made excuses and portrayed herself as the victim, never uttering the word \"sorry.\" She seemed to believe she was entitled to Jordan's kindness without making any amends.  \n\n- **Character Development (Jordan):**  \n  I was almost upset with Jordan's actions toward Mac at the end because it gave Mac even more reason to continue playing the victim.  \n\n- **Realism and Relatability:**  \n  Both characters are 16 years old, and their behavior reflects their age. Their underdeveloped prefrontal cortex likely influenced their decisions and emotional responses, which adds a layer of realism to their actions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe review highlights the flawed and immature behavior of both Mac and Jordan, emphasizing Mac's lack of accountability and Jordan's actions that inadvertently reinforced Mac's victim mentality. The portrayal of their teenage behavior is realistic, given their age and developmental stage.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The pacing was slow, and I found myself bored until Chapter 13. The plot felt clichéd and predictable, which diminished my engagement with the story.",

Jordan's frustrating assumption about gossip concerning Mackenzie, without seeking clarification, diminished my appreciation for her character, especially since she faced little consequence for her actions. Additionally, a mean girl character underwent an abrupt change at the end, which felt inconsistent with her development throughout the story.",

Additionally, the dialogue often comes across as unnatural, with phrases like “The parents,” “Everything is fine, you goofs,” and “See you soon, cutie” feeling awkward. Jordan’s nickname, “JoJo,” also lacks authenticity; “Jo” would have been a more fitting choice."

She acknowledged her body without letting it define her entirely, which is the kind of representation I wish I had seen in high school.  \n   - Jordan’s personality was multifaceted, and her being fat wasn’t her only defining trait.  \n\n- **Friend Group Dynamics:**  \n   - The friend group felt incredibly realistic. They were always there for each other, but there was also a natural tension about who they let into the group.  \n\n- **Memorable Scenes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - One of my favorite scenes was when Jojo bought Mack a stuffed animal while checking up on her during her concussion recovery. It was such a sweet and touching moment.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Quotes:**  \n   - The dialogue was memorable and impactful. Some of my favorite quotes include:  \n     - “Hey, paper girl.\"....\" Hey, volleyball girl.\"  \n     - \"I'd gotten enough dirty looks over the years for reading in-store without buying anything.\"  \n     - \"Mom told me once that I have the kind of face people find approachable. I'd never had the heart to tell her that I'm approachable because I'm fat.\"  \n     - \"Well, I am fat. A doctor confirmed it medically and everything.\"  \n     - \"I'm also a lesbian, so it's never a good idea for me to invite a man anywhere, you know? Would be pretty awkward all around.\"  \n     - \"Mack was smiling. Right, she was joking. Or being cute. No. She wasn't being cute. None of this was cute.\"  \n     - \"I think you have a story to tell, whether or not you agree. And there's more to you than volleyball. You're a great poet. You love and respect nature.\"  \n     - \"Then she winked at me. Mackenzie West winked at me.\"  \n     - “But you shared your poems with me.\"... \"It's different with you.\"  \n     - \"Are you calling me your friend now?\".... \"I'd like to, yeah.\"  \n     - “There was a poetry reading at the Strand. It made me think of you.\".... \"You thought about me on your fancy New York trip?\"  \n     - \"You haven't peed since you got here?\"..... \"I didn't want to wake you.\"  \n     - \"I'm going to keep kissing you until we fall asleep, okay?\" .... \"Okay.\"  \n     - \"I wanted to preserve the sound of her laugh in a music box. I wanted to make a drink that gave me the feeling of her lips on mine. I wanted a blanket that secured me like her arms. I wanted her.\"  \n     - \"I kind of love her. It's infuriating.\"  \n     - \"And just like that, I was going to get my girl. Or humiliate myself trying.\"  \n     - \"We'd had victories and many, many failures. But if I knew anything for sure, it was that Operation Heart Eyes would go down as our greatest success.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was my first book by Jenna Miller, and I absolutely loved it. The characters, especially Jordan and Mackenzie, were beautifully written, and their relationship felt genuine and heartwarming. The representation of Jordan as a fat character was handled with care and depth, making her relatable and inspiring. The friend group dynamics were realistic, and the dialogue was filled with memorable and emotional moments.

            "The protagonist, Jordan (JoJo), is a lesbian, and the school paper advisor is nonbinary, using they/them pronouns. JoJo's best friend, Audrey, identifies as bisexual. The story features diverse relationships, including girl-on-girl kissing and hints of deeper intimacy, all while maintaining a wholesome tone. JoJo shares a complicated history with Mackenzie \"Mack\" West, marked by a bond formed in freshman year and subsequent ghosting that leads to emotional turmoil. The characters are intelligent, creative, and mature in many ways, yet they also make typical teenage mistakes.",
            "Set in a small town in Minnesota and culminating during the Christmas/“Christmukkah” season, this story is perfect for a movie adaptation. It follows JoJo and her friends through their junior year as they navigate their ambitions for editorships on the school paper, a successful volleyball season, teenage mischief (including underage drinking), and the complexities of their relationships.",
            "The novel is a heartwarming throwback to the well-scrubbed literature of decades past, exploring themes of steadfast friendships, devoted siblings, well-meaning but misguided parents, and idealized school staff.",

While it excels in representation and nostalgic charm, its overly redemptive narrative and idealized adult characters detract from its potential depth.

The characters' problems felt very high school, and I saw a lot of my high school self in the story, which made it harder for me to fully connect with it.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Character Development:**  \n  I loved Jenna Miller's writing and the way the two main characters, Jordan and Mackenzie, were written. The inclusion of several adult role models who clearly wanted what was best for both characters was a strong point.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  I had a hard time with the romance because Jordan was much further along in her coming-out journey than Mackenzie. Combined with the inherent immaturity of high schoolers, this dynamic felt a little rough and made the relationship less satisfying for me.  \n\n- **Representation and Role Models:**  \n  This book offers great representation for queer kids and includes solid examples of good role models, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Character Complexity and Decision-Making:**  \n  The characters aren't super complex, and they don't always make well-thought-out decisions, which reflects their age but also limits the depth of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I think this is a great book to have in a high school library due to its strong representation and positive role models. However, as an adult reader, I found the story and characters a bit too young and immature for my taste.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The characters in this story are a true delight, including the surprisingly nuanced antagonist. Each character is complex, makes mistakes, and experiences personal growth throughout the narrative. The romance unfolds as a slow burn, following the enemies-to-friends-to-lovers trope, with the main characters only coming together at the very end—a realistic choice given their age and maturity. A friend-breakup replaces the typical third-act breakup, adding emotional depth to the plot. While the conflict leading to this friend-breakup isn't directly caused by either main character, it results in genuine hurt feelings and groveling, enhancing the story's authenticity."

The constant need to point out callbacks, especially when characters repeated phrases, disrupted the flow. These moments could have been playful or meaningful but instead felt over-explained. For example, when Character 2 repeated Character 1's words, the text explicitly reminded the reader of the callback, which felt unnecessary and took away from the immersion.\n\n- **Character Development and Dialogue:**  \n  The dialogue, particularly during the romantic scene at the end, suffered from this over-explanation.

As a former journalist who wrote for several school papers growing up, I found this aspect deeply relatable and nostalgic.  \n\n- **Tone and Emotional Resonance:**  \n  The story struck a great balance between the messy, chaotic feelings of being a teenager and the feel-good vibes that made it an enjoyable and heartwarming read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a fun and engaging read that combined authentic representation, relatable themes, and immersive storytelling. It captured the essence of teenage life with both its awkwardness and its charm, making it a highly enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

It feels highly relevant for high school and even middle school audiences, making it a great addition to school libraries.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were mostly believable, which added depth to the story and made it relatable.  \n\n- **Setting and Realism:**  \n  The portrayal of high school life, with its exaggerated stakes and dramatic moments (like the importance of being a section editor of the school newspaper), felt upsettingly accurate. It reminded me of how intense those years can feel, and I’m glad to be past that stage of life!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a sweet and engaging novel that skillfully balances themes of friendship, betrayal, trust, and romance. Its relatable characters and accurate depiction of high school life make it a great choice for younger readers, and I hope schools consider adding it to their libraries.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the romance between the two leads is well-paced, the plot does rely on melodramatic elements like mean girls and misunderstandings. Fortunately, the story doesn't depend solely on these clichés. I found myself more engaged with the drama within Jordan's friend circle than with her conflicts involving Mack and the volleyball team. However, the subplot featuring Jordan's friends feels underdeveloped and lacks integration with the main storyline.",
            "The characters in this story are both enjoyable and well-developed. Jordan captures the essence of a typical teenager—defensive, insecure, yet genuinely sweet. Her friends are humorous, with distinct personalities that lend authenticity to their banter. Mack pleasantly surprised me with her charm, and I especially loved the quiet moments she shared with Jordan during their interview scenes. However, I felt that Mack's past cruelty towards Jordan could have been explored further, as it would have added depth to her character by highlighting her flaws. The story features a fat lesbian protagonist (Jordan), a queer love interest (Mack), a bisexual Korean best friend, and a teacher who uses they/them pronouns. This is precisely the kind of book I would have adored as a teenager. The representation is handled thoughtfully, and I appreciated the author's openness in portraying Jordan's journey with her queerness and body image.",

Jordan's inner monologue is quippy, funny, and emotive. While some parts of the prose felt redundant at times, it wasn't distracting enough to take away from the melodramatic teen drama in the scenes.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The book doesn't fully fit the \"enemies to lovers\" trope—it feels more like one-sided enemies to lovers. The romance between the two leads is paced nicely, though the plot relies on some melodramatic twists (mean girls, misunderstandings, etc.). Thankfully, the story doesn't hinge entirely on these points. I found myself more invested in the drama within Jordan's friend circle than her angst towards Mack and the volleyball team. However, the subplot involving Jordan's friends felt underdeveloped and not well-integrated with the main plot.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are enjoyable and well-crafted. Jordan is perfectly teenager-ish—overly defensive, insecure, but mostly sweet. Her friends are funny, with well-rendered personalities, and their banter feels realistic. Mack was more charming than I expected, and I particularly enjoyed the quiet moments she shared with Jordan during the interview scenes. That said, I wish Mack's past cruelties towards Jordan were given more weight in the plot, as it might have added depth to her character by showcasing more obvious flaws.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The story features a fat lesbian protagonist (Jordan), a queer romantic interest (Mack), a bisexual Korean best friend, and a teacher with they/them pronouns. This is the kind of book I would've been obsessed with as a teen. The representation is handled in good faith, and I especially appreciated Miller's candidness in writing about Jordan's relationship with her queerness and fatness.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a wonderful little YA romcom with a charming cast and a simple-but-fun plot. While the subplot involving Jordan's friends could have been better integrated, the book delivers an enjoyable and heartfelt story with strong representation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I had high hopes for this book, but it fell short of my expectations. Marketed as a friends-to-enemies-to-lovers story, the enemies phase felt one-sided. Most of the tension stemmed from Jordan's anger towards Mack, while Mack remained consistently kind to her. Flashbacks illustrating their past relationship and how Mack treated Jordan would have added much-needed depth to their dynamic. The tension between them felt underdeveloped; Jordan's animosity lasted less than half the book, and the conflict didn't escalate as I had anticipated. I craved more emotional depth and a stronger sense of rivalry between the characters.",
            "The characters lack flaws, making their actions feel unrealistic. They engage in questionable behavior but are quickly forgiven, with minimal reflection or consequences. This simplicity hinders a deeper connection with them."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Expectations vs. Execution:**  \n  I really wanted to like this more than I did. The book was marketed as a friends-to-enemies-to-lovers story, but the \"enemies\" phase felt one-sided. Most of the tension comes from Jordan being angry at Mack, while Mack is consistently nice to her. I wish there had been flashbacks to show their relationship before and how Mack treated Jordan, as this would have added depth to their dynamic.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are written as if they have no flaws, which made their actions feel less realistic. They do really questionable things but are forgiven almost immediately, with little reflection or consequence. This lack of complexity made it harder to connect with them.  \n\n- **Tension and Conflict:**  \n  The tension between Jordan and Mack felt underdeveloped. Jordan only hates Mack for less than half of the book, and the conflict doesn’t escalate as much as I expected. I wanted more emotional depth and a stronger sense of rivalry or tension between them.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite these issues, I thought the book was really cute! If you’re looking for something simple, fluffy, and with great representation, this is a good choice. It’s an easy, light read that delivers on the feel-good factor.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book didn’t fully meet my expectations in terms of plot execution and character development, it was still an enjoyable, lighthearted read with strong representation. It’s perfect for readers seeking something simple and heartwarming.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I found it difficult to like Jordon, as her first-person perspective often came across as self-absorbed. While her petty actions were frustrating, they did capture the essence of a realistic teenager, which I commend the book for. I appreciated Jordon's recognition of her shortcomings as a friend and her efforts to make amends. The evolution of Jordon and Mackenzie’s friendship into a romantic relationship was particularly enjoyable; Jordon's understanding of Mackenzie’s situation, coupled with her desire to be open about their relationship, felt authentic. However, the 'enemies' trope seemed a bit exaggerated, though I suppose it's plausible in a high school context where betrayal can create animosity. Despite Jordon's flaws as a friend, I loved the dynamic of their trio, especially with the inclusion of a boy who wasn't romantically interested in either of them.",
            "The book came across as stereotypical and overly dramatic, with a tone reminiscent of 2013 publications. While it wasn't to my taste, I recognize that sapphic readers in that era may have appreciated the availability of such extravagant high school romances.",
            "The constant references felt forced and cringe-worthy, as if the book was trying too hard to connect with teens. The frequent use of terms like \"bestie\" made the dialogue awkward and unlikely to age well."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *We Got The Beat* had its strengths, particularly in portraying realistic teenage behavior and a sweet sapphic romance. However, the main character’s personality, forced references, and cringe-worthy dialogue detracted from my enjoyment. While it didn’t fully resonate with me, I can see how it might appeal to readers looking for a nostalgic, over-dramatized high school romance.",

She felt too full of herself.  \n   - While she did some petty, stupid things, those actions made her feel like a realistic teenager, which I commend the book for.  \n   - Jordon realized she hadn’t been the greatest friend and tried to fix it, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Friendship and Relationships:**  \n   - I really enjoyed Jordon and Mackenzie’s transition from friendship to a relationship. Jordon was understanding of Mackenzie’s situation but also didn’t want to stay hidden forever, which felt realistic.  \n   - The ‘enemies’ trope felt a bit far-fetched, though I suppose in a high school setting, someone who backstabbed you could be considered an enemy.  \n   - Jordon wasn’t the greatest friend to her two best friends, but I loved their sweet trio dynamic, especially having a boy in the group who wasn’t romantically interested in them or gay.  \n\n- **Relatability and References:**  \n   - The constant references felt forced and cringe-worthy. It seemed like the book was trying too hard to be relatable to teens.  \n   - The frequent use of terms like “bestie” made the dialogue feel awkward and likely won’t age well.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Themes:**  \n   - The book felt stereotypical and overly dramatic, with a tone that seemed more fitting for a 2013 publication.  \n   - While it wasn’t my cup of tea, I appreciate that sapphic readers in 2013 might not have had access to such over-the-top high school romance books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *We Got The Beat* had its strengths, particularly in portraying realistic teenage behavior and a sweet sapphic romance.

            "This book features a fat lesbian protagonist, Jordan Elliot, and her lesbian love interest, offering a refreshing and underrepresented perspective in literature. The inclusion of diverse characters, such as a bisexual Korean-American side character, a Jewish character, and a non-binary teacher who uses they/them pronouns and the title Mx., enriches the narrative with depth and inclusivity. The open and proud use of the term \"lesbian\" throughout the book is a welcome change in YA literature. Jordan is a well-crafted and relatable character, particularly as she navigates high school and her role on the school newspaper. The evolving dynamics between Jordan and her friends feel authentic, highlighting growth and learning from mistakes. Additionally, the forced proximity between Jordan and her nemesis, Mackenzie West, creates engaging tension that propels the plot forward.",

            "This story centers on two girls who had a falling out two years ago and are now compelled to collaborate. Both characters engage in extreme and unrealistic actions against each other, which detracted from the believability of the plot. The narrative evokes a \"Mean Girls\" vibe, particularly with elements like an angry rant in a burn book and exaggerated reactions to a character’s misfortune. However, these moments felt out of place and inconsistent with the overall tone of the story.",

This frustrating behavior made it hard to connect with or care about the characters.",

            "This book powerfully asserts that forgiveness is not mandatory, even in the face of grand gestures or deep affection. It emphasizes that while you can understand someone's behavior, that understanding does not excuse it; it merely explains it.
