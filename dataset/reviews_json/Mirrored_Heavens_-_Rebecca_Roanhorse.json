            "The initial 100 pages of the book felt slow, primarily due to the absence of Xiala, which made it hard to connect. However, once the pace picked up, the story became gripping and swiftly drew me in, culminating in a satisfying and well-paced conclusion. The climactic scenes, particularly those in the Shadow Palace, were intense and skillfully crafted. The author excelled at balancing multiple perspectives and intertwining their narratives. The epilogue offered a hopeful resolution while hinting at potential future stories.",
            "Xiala's journey was a standout, marked by her transformation into a true siren and her quest for oceanic vengeance. Serapio's storyline reached its peak with his poignant reunion with Xiala and ultimate sacrifice. In contrast, Okoa's arc felt weaker; his death came abruptly and lacked the emotional weight of others. Naranpa's storyline, especially her dreamwalking ability and relationship with Iktan, was compelling, though her ending was bittersweet and complex.",

The narrative explores sacrifice—both personal and for the common good—through the actions of various characters. Additionally, the illusion of power emerges as a recurring motif, especially in the interactions between gods and mortals.",

Characters like Xiala offered solace during a trying year, enhancing the finale's significance. I was left breathless and deeply invested, experiencing a rich tapestry of joy, sorrow, and satisfaction."

            "While the story offers an engaging narrative, some parts felt rushed or underdeveloped, likely due to the multiple points of view. Balancing pacing and characterization proved challenging, and I would have preferred a few different perspectives. The narrative could have benefited from additional length to explore certain areas more thoroughly. However, the ending was well-crafted, presenting genuine consequences for actions and plotlines without resorting to an overly neat resolution. I found myself wanting one more chapter to address lingering questions, as I wasn't ready for the story to conclude. The ending left me with many unanswered queries, and I would eagerly welcome any additional content related to this trilogy.",
            "I appreciate multi-POV stories, yet some perspectives hindered my progress. Naranpa's storyline was particularly contentious; although I adored her character and development, her chapters felt disconnected from the main plot. However, I was deeply invested in the relationship between Naranpa and Iktan—they were my favorite pair.",

            "I give Mirrored Heavens 4.5 stars for its pacing and one unresolved character arc that hints at a potential spin-off. The narrative unfolds as a quest where each character embarks on their own journey, ultimately converging on a central conflict—the war between the clans and the fate of The Carrion King. While some readers might find the pacing slow or the story overly long, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment in this world with these characters, especially knowing it might be my last time with them. My only critique is that certain aspects of the conflict, particularly for Serapio, resolved too easily. However, the story successfully introduces new revelations, expands on powers, and presents unique horrors, putting all characters through significant challenges by the end.",
            "The author skillfully navigates a complex and diverse cast of characters amidst intricate political machinations in a vividly portrayed world. Spending time with Xiala was a highlight, earning her a place among my favorite characters, alongside Amina Al-Sirafi. However, I would have liked to see more development of Naranpa's arc, as it felt somewhat underexplored.",
            "I give this trilogy a full 5 stars for its exceptional love for the characters, the world, and the overall creation. The Between Earth & Sky trilogy stands as a pinnacle of diverse fantasy and truly deserves all the accolades it receives. For anyone seeking to explore diverse high fantasy, this series is one of my top recommendations."

        "conclusion": "The Between Earth & Sky trilogy is a masterful work of diverse high fantasy, with richly developed characters, a vividly imagined world, and a compelling narrative. While the pacing and some character arcs could have been tighter, the work as a whole is a standout in the genre and leaves me eagerly awaiting more from the author.",

            "The story is refreshingly unpredictable, keeping me engaged with its twists and turns. However, I found myself puzzled by the motivations of certain characters, particularly Naranpa, Xiala, and Serapio, especially as the war climax approached. I struggled to grasp Serapio’s reasons for wanting to take over Tova. The ending was an unconventional choice for a fantasy novel, as the main characters ultimately chose to abandon the war and, in some instances, relinquish their power. Nevertheless, I found this conclusion to be beautifully executed and thought-provoking. The characters' realizations—Xiala's support of Serapio, Serapio's rejection of his god and Tova, and Naranpa’s tragic act of burning the city and herself—added depth and uniqueness to the narrative.",
            "The character development is exceptional, especially for Xiala and the Teek, who truly come into their own in this book. Xiala stands out as the most intriguing protagonist, and her arc is expertly crafted.",
            "The author’s writing is remarkable, featuring exquisite prose that truly shines within the fantasy genre. Her skill is so exceptional that few, if any, fantasy authors can match her level."

While I occasionally struggled to recall details from previous books, the quality of the writing and storytelling made it easy to reconnect. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and am excited for the author’s future projects.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Critics who lament that the characters differ from those in the first book seem to overlook a fundamental truth: people change in response to their circumstances. Additionally, it's essential to remember that these characters are Indigenous and pre-Columbian, which means their perspectives and thoughts will differ from contemporary ones.",

As in not gonna think like you.\n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  The fact that all characters are Indigenous and Pre-Columbian adds depth and authenticity to the story, making it clear that their perspectives and actions are rooted in their unique cultural context.\n\n- **Series Conclusion:**  \n  This was a great ending to the series that had me in my feels. I normally don't like endings of books with some type of epilogue, but Rebecca did it well.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book exceeded my expectations, delivering a powerful and emotionally resonant conclusion to the series.

            "As a fan of Xiala, I was largely satisfied with her story's progression. Her relationship with Serapio was unexpectedly moving, and I appreciated how he cherished her. Although romance isn't typically my focus, some of the quotes were truly memorable. I also loved the heartwarming reunions between characters; I prefer when they are together or at least nearby, rather than separated by distance. However, I found Okoa’s and Naranpa’s arcs somewhat anticlimactic. I had expected Naranpa to take on a more prominent role, but she ended up feeling sidelined.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Comparison to Previous Books:**  \n  I enjoyed *Mirrored Heavens* more than *Fevered Star*, but there were moments where I felt underwhelmed, thinking, “Is that it?” After some thought, I settled on a 4.5-star rating (rounded to 5). This trilogy has earned its place among my favorite adult fantasy series, alongside *The Poppy War* trilogy and *The Daevabad* trilogy.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  As a fan of Xiala, I was mostly satisfied with how her story unfolded. Her relationship with Serapio was unexpectedly touching, and I appreciated how he cherished her. While I’m not usually into romance, some of the quotes were truly memorable. I also loved the reunions between characters—they were sweet and heartwarming. I prefer when characters are together or at least in the same vicinity, rather than separated by miles.\n\n- **World-Building and Backstory:**  \n  The additional backstory provided in this book helped me understand the bigger picture, and I was thrilled to learn more about Teek and its women. I admire authors who can create intricate worlds and stories that feel cohesive and satisfying.\n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The final chapters kept me on edge, as the story was dragged right to the last page. I was genuinely worried it would end abruptly, but it didn’t. However, the ending felt a bit open, leaving room for more, which left me hoping for additional stories in this world.\n\n- **Character Arcs and Resolutions:**  \n  I found Okoa’s and Naranpa’s arcs to be anticlimactic. From the first book, I expected Naranpa to play a more central role, but she ended up being sidelined. Okoa also felt underutilized, more like a plot device than a fully fleshed-out character. Despite these gripes, I was mostly satisfied with how the series concluded.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Mirrored Heavens* was a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, though it had its flaws. While some character arcs felt unresolved or underwhelming, the world-building, relationships, and emotional moments made it a memorable read. The open-ended conclusion leaves me hopeful for more stories in this universe.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars (rounded to 5)."

While her relationship with Iktan is a standout element, her overall presence is overshadowed by Balam, who assumes a more central role.",

She evolves from a drunken mess into a de facto queen and leader of her people, navigating grief, trauma, and personal pain along the way. Her compelling journey of embracing her own power and strength is particularly noteworthy as she challenges her people’s traditions and embarks on motherhood. Okoa's inner conflict—between his loyalty to Carrion Crow and his quest for belonging—receives deeper exploration. His arc is impactful, though its abrupt conclusion feels both realistic and unsatisfying, as it signifies the end of a painful cycle he contributed to.

I put off reading it because I wasn’t ready to say goodbye to the characters, and the story left me deeply moved. It felt like having my heart ripped out, shredded, and then stuffed back together. I laughed, I cried, and now I’m left contemplating how long I have to wait before rereading the series.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were incredibly well-developed and memorable. Serapio was the first shadowy man I fell in love with, and he remains my favorite despite his flaws. Xiala was unlike any character I’ve ever encountered, and her growth over the trilogy was remarkable. Naranpa’s arc was also deeply impactful, though I’m not ready to fully process her story yet.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Rebecca Roanhorse’s writing is beautiful and filled with wonder. Her ability to craft such vivid and emotional prose made the story unforgettable. The way she weaves words together kept me captivated from start to finish.\n\n- **Ending and Series Closure:**  \n  The ending felt perfect—it wrapped up the trilogy in a satisfying way while leaving enough openness for potential future stories. I’m hopeful for more in this world, as the conclusion left me wanting to revisit it again and again.\n\n- **Series Evolution:**  \n  I fell in love with this series in 2021 when *Black Sun* was required reading in my Women’s Literature class. Each book in the trilogy only got better, and this finale solidified it as one of my all-time favorite series.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a stunning and emotional conclusion to a perfect trilogy. The characters, writing, and ending left a lasting impact on me, and I’m already looking forward to revisiting the series. Rebecca Roanhorse has created something truly special, and I can’t recommend it enough.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Structure and Reading Experience:**  \n  I initially didn’t realize *Black Sun* was part of a trilogy, and I regret not discovering it later so I could have read all three books—*Black Sun*, *Fevered Star*, and *Mirrored Heavens*—back-to-back. While waiting for each installment was exciting, it made it harder to maintain the stakes, remember the characters, and keep track of the world-building. By the time *Mirrored Heavens* came out, I only vaguely remembered the showdown on Sun Rock, but as I read, everything came back to me.  \n\n- **Character Development and Flashbacks:**  \n  I particularly enjoyed the flashbacks that explored how Sarapio came to be. These moments added depth to the character and enriched the overall narrative.  \n\n- **World-Building and Pacing:**  \n  The sprawling world and numerous characters made for a complex story, but the different points of view complemented each other well, steadily moving the plot toward the confrontation and climax.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  I appreciated the satisfying ending, especially given the complexity of the story. It’s challenging to “land the plane” with such a vast world and so many characters, but the author managed it well.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Unresolved Threads:**  \n  The only disappointment was that Naranpa never got to confront the Jaguar Prince, and it seemed like he forgot about her too. This felt like a missed opportunity for closure in their dynamic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the series was a fun ride with a richly built world, compelling characters, and a satisfying conclusion, despite some minor unresolved threads.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars for all three books in the series."

This representation is refreshing and beautifully executed.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story is deeply moving, with themes of love, loss, and sacrifice resonating strongly. The emotional journey of the characters leaves a lasting impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a spectacular and criminally underrated fantasy trilogy. Roanhorse’s intricate world-building, layered narrative, and bold representation make it a standout read. The emotional depth and high stakes keep readers invested, and the seamless inclusion of diverse gender identities is both beautiful and groundbreaking. I highly, highly recommend this series!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story is excellent, featuring a gripping start and a steady build-up to the climactic battle between the Sun God and Crow God. The unpredictable twists and turns kept me thoroughly engaged. Flashbacks, especially those into Serapio’s past, are seamlessly woven in, enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. The conclusion is satisfying, masterfully tying together all the threads from the trilogy. The final battle and the resolution of the characters’ arcs are executed brilliantly, leaving me feeling emotionally fulfilled.",
            "Xiala's evolution into a formidable leader of the Teek is both compelling and satisfying. Her yearning for Serapio enriches her journey with emotional depth. Serapio's character contrasts his role as the Crow God’s avatar with his humanity and love for Xiala, and his heartbreaking backstory, revealed through dreams of his mother, Saaya, adds significant layers to his character. Although Naranpa's journey is less pronounced, her development as the Sun God’s vessel and her training with Kupshu in the Northern Wastes are pivotal to the story's resolution. The supporting characters, including Balam, Tuun, and Okoa, are thoughtfully crafted and contribute complexity to the narrative. Additionally, the LGBTQIA+ representation, particularly among the Teek, is beautifully woven in, highlighting diverse relationships and family structures.",
            "*Mirrored Heavens* excels in its world-building, further expanding the rich pre-Columbian-inspired setting established in earlier installments. Vividly portrayed new locations, such as Teek and the Northern Wastes, enhance the depth of Meridian. The distinct cultures and magic systems—particularly the transformative sea magic of Teek women and their haunting songs—stand out, as does the portrayal of the desolate yet vibrant Northern Wastes.",
            "The themes of love, destiny, and sacrifice are compellingly examined, especially in the relationship between Xiala and Serapio. The narrative delves deeply into loneliness, longing, and the fight for agency, as seen in Serapio's life, which is dictated by prophecy, adding a poignant depth to the story.",

As the war for Tova escalates, Serrapio, the Carrion King, navigates complex alliances and looming threats to his lover, Xiala. The narrative intricately intertwines numerous character arcs—from Xiala's battle to save her people to Naranpa's quest for revenge and Balaam's ruthless ambitions—culminating in a thrilling and satisfying conclusion.",

The antagonist, Balaam, is fleshed out through flashbacks that reveal his motivations, but his greed and ambition remain unredeemed. However, supporting characters like Iktaan and Akoa receive less attention, leaving their arcs feeling somewhat unfinished.",

Most character endings resonated with me, except for Narampa. She contributed little to the plot and ultimately ends up in a coma, which was frustrating. Although I didn’t care for her in the first book, I enjoyed her chapters in the second, which felt like her story. However, having her as a viewpoint character without significant contributions suggests the author struggled to find a purpose for her.",
            "The world unfolds in an intriguing manner, and witnessing the political maneuvering is truly captivating."

        "conclusion": "This book serves as a satisfying conclusion, with a strong focus on Xiala, the reader’s favorite character, and impressive world-building that includes intriguing political dynamics. While most character arcs were well-handled, Narampa’s lack of contribution to the plot and her unresolved ending were disappointing. Despite this, the book delivers a solid and enjoyable conclusion.",

She contributed nothing to the plot or the ending and ends the whole series stuck in essentially a coma. This was especially frustrating because I didn’t really like her character in book one but grew to enjoy her chapters in book two (which is arguably her book). For her to still be a viewpoint character but contribute nothing overall felt like the author wanted to utilize her but didn’t know what to do with her.  \n\n- **World-Building and Expansion:**  \n   - The world expands in such a cool way, and being able to see the political maneuvering was really awesome.  \n\n- **Series Conclusion and Overall Satisfaction:**  \n   - This book is such a satisfying ending for the series.  \n   - Overall, a very solid ending. Everyone must read this series so I can fangirl!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book serves as a satisfying conclusion to the series, with a strong focus on Xiala, the reader’s favorite character, and impressive world-building that includes intriguing political dynamics.

The invasion of Teek land by Tuun and her forces serves as a crucial turning point, propelling the narrative forward. The political intrigue and the ultimate fate of the gods add layers of depth to the story. Xiala and Serapio's endings are both hopeful and satisfying, providing a sense of closure and optimism. In contrast, Narampa's fate remains ambiguous, leaving room for future possibilities and maintaining emotional impact. The conclusion effectively wraps up the story, with relatable and imperfect characters that keep readers invested.",
            "**Xiala** stands out as a captain, leading her people in resistance while grappling with profound loss that catalyzes her growth. Her journey to embrace her Teek identity and power is both compelling and inspiring. **Serapio** is a complex character, becoming a god by circumstance rather than choice. He struggles with his identity and the moral implications of his role, ultimately choosing love over divinity. His ending is optimistic, providing a sense of peace after enduring immense pain. **Narampa**, despite being ostracized, evolves as a Dreamwalker and embraces her godly nature. Her fate is bittersweet; after delivering justice, she goes dormant, leaving the possibility of future revival open.",

            "Compared to the first two books, this installment felt slightly weaker due to pacing issues. Much of the narrative focused on building up to the climax, which left less room to explore the consequences and resolutions for the characters, cities, and cultural groups in depth. Condensing some early sections by 15-20% could have led to a more cinematic and satisfying conclusion. \n\nThe multiple points of view kept me engaged, as mini-cliffhangers in one perspective seamlessly transitioned to equally gripping events in another city. This book introduced more POVs than its predecessors, allowing lesser-known characters to shine and play integral roles in the story's progression. Some prominent characters from earlier installments took a backseat, providing a refreshing shift in focus and depth.\n\nDespite the pacing issues, the plot held my attention. The twists and turns, while occasionally predictable, maintained suspense until the very end. I found myself on the edge of my seat, eagerly turning pages to see how everything would unfold.",
            "The author’s work is a remarkable addition to the fantasy genre, breaking away from Euro-centric conventions by drawing inspiration from Pre-Columbian civilizations. The incorporation of neopronouns and the acceptance of diverse identities within the societies feels authentic and enhances the world-building. The cities of Tova, Cuecola, Hokaia, and the Teek islands are vividly crafted, each boasting its own unique atmosphere and magical elements.",
            "Mirrored Heavens concluded with a heart-wrenching finale that left me questioning character motivations and morality.

It captivated me in a way no other fantasy novel had, thanks to its lush settings and vibrant characters.  \n   - The *Between Earth and Sky* series as a whole is highly recommendable due to its unique world inspired by pre-Columbian indigenous American cultures, its exciting and fantastical plot elements, and its compelling characters and relationships.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - *FEVERED STAR* suffered from middle chapter syndrome and occasionally lagged in pacing.  \n   - *MIRRORED HEAVENS* starts with too many storylines, making it challenging to track six separate narratives. The frequent jumps between characters (Xiala, Serapio, Iktan, Okoa, Balam, and Naranpa) can feel overwhelming, especially when readers have to wait several chapters to revisit a storyline.  \n   - However, as the characters begin to converge, the pacing improves significantly, and the story becomes more cohesive and engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development and Arcs:**  \n   - The strength of the series lies in its character arcs. Roanhorse does an exceptional job of following these arcs to their logical and satisfying conclusions.  \n   - Not every character gets a happy ending, but each fulfills their destiny in a way that aligns with their individual journey.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - The series stands out for its richly imagined world, inspired by pre-Columbian indigenous American cultures.  \n   - The settings are lush and immersive, contributing significantly to the story's appeal.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The plot is always exciting and fantastical, with a mix of political intrigue, romance, and adventure.  \n   - The finale, *MIRRORED HEAVENS*, brings together the best character combinations, though it takes time for the storylines to merge effectively.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n   - The series features a memorable romantic dynamic, described as \"a steamy romance between the shy but lethal dark messiah of the Crow God and an ebullient, foul-mouthed mermaid queen ship captain.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the *Between Earth and Sky* trilogy is a standout fantasy series with a unique world, compelling characters, and an engaging plot. While *MIRRORED HEAVENS* initially struggles with too many storylines, it ultimately delivers a satisfying conclusion to the series. I highly recommend this trilogy for its rich world-building, character-driven storytelling, and memorable relationships.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Exact Rating: 4.50 stars"

It thoughtfully examines the consequences of power, emphasizing that divine influence always comes at a cost. The ending is bittersweet, with some characters meeting poignant yet appropriate fates.",

Serapio grapples with his identity as the Crow God and the repercussions of his choices, while Xiala is determined to save her people and reunite with him. Naranpa's quest to master dreamwalking in order to save Tova further enriches her character.",

The early chapters skillfully blend political intrigue with thrilling action, ensuring a dynamic and engaging narrative. While the ending is satisfying, it falls short of perfection. Despite the buildup to an epic army clash, the conflict occurs off-page and is only recounted briefly. Nevertheless, the story's true strength lies in its character development, which remains its standout feature.",

To prepare for the final installment, I revisited the first two books—something I rarely do—and it reminded me just how invested I am in Xiala and Serapio's journey. The characters continue to be a strong focus, showcasing impressive growth throughout the story. While there are some romantic elements, they remain subtle and never overshadow the main narrative, allowing the core themes and character arcs to shine.",

To prepare for the final book, I went back and read the first two books again, which is something I rarely do these days. This helped remind me of how deeply engaged I am in the story of Xiala and Serapio. The characters remain a strong focus, and we get to see excellent growth for both Xiala and Serapio throughout the book.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**  \n  After the events of *Fevered Star*, war is brewing, and an invasion is imminent. Early on, the book introduces a prophecy about three wars and how Serapio might win them. The early chapters provide a good mix of political machinations and flashy action, keeping the story dynamic and engaging.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The book continues to build on the rich world established in the previous installments. Naranpa, for instance, is slowly gathering her power to unleash the full might of the Sun God, adding depth to the lore and stakes of the story.  \n\n- **Resolution and Ending:**  \n  While the ending was overall satisfying, a few things keep it from perfection. Despite building up to an epic clash of armies, we never get to see that conflict directly—it happens off the page and is described in passing. However, the focus remains on the characters, which is where the story truly shines.  \n\n- **Romance and Tone:**  \n  There is a little spice in the book, but it doesn’t get particularly explicit. The romance never takes the main focus, which I appreciated, as it allowed the story to stay centered on its core themes and character arcs.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Mirrored Heavens* is a satisfying ending to an excellent trilogy. While it has a few minor flaws, such as the off-page resolution of the climactic battle, the book delivers on its promise of character-driven storytelling and rich world-building.

It was a deeply moving conclusion to the trilogy.  \n\n- **Series Enjoyment and Themes:**  \n   - I really enjoyed this series! It masterfully blends indigenous lore, action, romance, intrigue, murder mystery, and a good amount of gore and darkness, which perfectly matches my taste.  \n\n- **Character Appreciation:**  \n   - Serapio is my absolute favorite character. He fills a void in my heart for Paul Atreides-coded anti-heroes.  \n   - Okoa and Naranpa’s chapters felt a bit shorted in this book. I would have loved more time with each character, and perhaps even a fourth book to focus on their storylines.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - My one critique is that some plot points and storylines could have been fleshed out more. Certain scenes deserved more pages, and the series, particularly this book, could have benefited from being longer.  \n\n- **Accessibility and Representation:**  \n   - This is a great series for anyone looking for a unique and comprehensive fantasy series that isn’t overly daunting or bogged down by complicated magic systems and lore.  \n   - It’s refreshing to see a fantasy series not written by a white man, which adds to its uniqueness and appeal.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n   - I’m eager for more content from Rebecca Roanhorse in the future!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a fantastic series that delivers a rich blend of themes, compelling characters, and emotional depth. While I wished for more development in certain areas, it remains a standout fantasy series that is both accessible and refreshingly unique.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 (rounded up)."

Complicating matters, a new prophecy from the Coyote God warns Serapio of dire consequences if it remains unfulfilled. Xiala, the last hope of the Teek people facing conquest, is reluctantly drawn back into the conflict. She struggles with her connection to the sea and must make sacrifices to unlock her true powers as the Queen of the Teek.

However, enemies are gathering strength to oppose him, both from distant cities and within Tova itself. The plans of the women leaders of the clans to overthrow him add tension to the narrative. Meanwhile, a new prophecy emerges from the Coyote God in the Maw, warning Serapio of misfortune if it is not fulfilled. Xiala, the last hope of the Teek people, is drawn back into the conflict as her people face conquest. Struggling with her connection to the sea, she must make sacrifices to harness her powers and become the true Queen of the Teek.

The pacing kept me fully engaged, and I was consistently surprised by the plot's unexpected twists.",

Book 1 is an explosive countdown, Book 2 focuses on maneuvering pieces into place, and Book 3 ties everything together and concludes the story. The pacing kept me engaged throughout, and I was constantly surprised by the direction of the plot.  \n\n- **Plot and Expectations:**  \n  If you're expecting lengthy battle scenes or drawn-out war sequences, you might be disappointed. The \"war\" aspect is relatively short, as the story emphasizes strategy and alliances over action. The alliances are fragile, held together by thin threads of common interest, which adds tension and unpredictability to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development and Perspectives:**  \n  The multiple points of view (POVs) provide deep insight into each character's motives and the lengths they are willing to go to achieve their goals. This layered approach to character development makes the story fascinating and adds complexity to the alliances and manipulations at play.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Impact:**  \n  The novel was an excellent and invigorating read. It kept me guessing until the very end, and I had no clear idea of how I wanted it to conclude. The intricate plotting and character dynamics made it a truly intriguing experience. After finishing, I felt inspired to explore more epic fantasy novels.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a masterfully crafted epic fantasy that prioritizes strategy, alliances, and character motivations over action-heavy sequences. Its unpredictable plot, well-developed POVs, and engaging pacing make it a standout read.

While it sacrifices some character depth, it excels in plot complexity and keeps readers thoroughly engaged. It’s a must-read for fans of the series and newcomers alike.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It is an amazing, exquisite, and satisfying finale to a powerful epic.  \n  - I’m ashamed to have doubted that she would finish the series, but this book proved to be a worthy conclusion.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  - The story is brutal, filled with intrigue, plotting, treachery, betrayal, cruelty, and death.  \n  - Yet, it also balances these darker elements with kindness, love, and complexity.  \n  - Roanhorse kept me on my toes, playing with my sympathies and emotions throughout.  \n\n- **Characterization of Gods:**  \n  - What I most admire is how Roanhorse writes about gods—she makes them truly incomprehensible, which is how gods should be to humans.  \n  - This approach creates a fascinating and fair world, not in the sense of justice, but in the sense of not cheating.  \n\n- **Moral Complexity:**  \n  - Nobody in the story is all good or all evil; everyone is complex.  \n  - Evil and good things happen, and characters strive to influence the outcome, making the story rich and fulfilling.  \n\n- **Reader Preparation:**  \n  - Like with *Fevered Star*, Roanhorse doesn’t make allowances for readers who might not remember every detail from the first two books.  \n  - A reread of the previous books is recommended, or else prepare for a challenging experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Mirrored Heavens* is a masterful and satisfying conclusion to Roanhorse’s epic series.

Despite its length, the plot kept me engaged, although some sections felt overly drawn out, detracting from the overall experience. While it served as a worthy conclusion, it didn't quite match the brilliance of the first book, though it surpassed the middle installment.",

Iktan's limited perspective facilitated a poignant reunion with Naranpa, providing closure before the climax. Xiala demonstrated significant growth, stepping up to protect her people and moving past her obsession with Serapio. Meanwhile, Serapio's arc underscored the complexities of leadership, reinforcing the theme of being cautious about one's desires.",

Xiala's backstory, previously underdeveloped, was explored more thoroughly, revealing her resilience and earning her respect from those around her.

However, I didn’t mind the pacing too much because I enjoyed spending time with the characters.\n- **Character Development:** I love many of these characters, so much so that I would gladly read about them doing mundane activities like having breakfast or doing chores.\n- **Emotional Engagement:** The story was a fun, yet slightly painful ride, which made it emotionally engaging and satisfying.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book serves as a satisfying conclusion to an imaginative epic fantasy series. While the pacing is slow initially, the strong connection to the characters and the emotional depth of the story make it a worthwhile read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "**Serapio:** I felt a deep concern for his fate and was relieved he survived, even if his survival strained the world-building. **Xiala:** Her transformation from a rugged pirate to someone who forms meaningful relationships while retaining her strength was compelling. Her acceptance of Serapio, flaws included, was a highlight. **Naranpa:** Unfortunately, her storyline felt unfinished; she deserved the chance to confront Serapio directly. Additionally, her tragic, open-ended ending with Iktan left me uneasy. A potential spinoff focusing on Iktan's efforts to awaken her could be intriguing. **Iktan and Naranpa:** Their wedding was both touching and tense, as I sensed foreboding—and my fears were realized. **Okoa:** This book helped me appreciate him more, particularly through his unexpected bond with Serapio. **Overall Dynamics:** I loved the notion that all these characters could have thrived in a better world.",

Her acceptance of Serapio, flaws and all, was a standout moment.  \n   - **Naranpa:** Her storyline felt incomplete. She should have had a chance to fight Serapio, and her tragic, open-ended ending with Iktan didn’t sit right with me.

            "The pacing of the story felt uneven, with extensive character development that occasionally caused certain sections to drag. The abrupt shifts to action were jarring compared to the slower moments. I believe the narrative would have benefited from being a quartet instead of a trilogy, allowing for deeper exploration of the Teek, the Gods Graveyard, and a more satisfying climax. The final battle was simpler than anticipated, featuring a deus ex machina that undermined the extensive build-up. While the ending was solid, it ultimately fell short of my expectations for a perfect conclusion.",
            "The author excels in character creation and trauma exploration, which made me truly appreciate this work. Serapio and Xiala captivated me throughout the story, while characters I initially found unlikable, such as Okoa and Iktan, gradually won me over. Okoa’s struggles with loyalty and morality were compelling, and his relationship with Serapio added significant depth. Iktan’s determination and introspection made xem more relatable and emotionally resonant. Additionally, Balam’s background and motivations were unexpectedly explored, transforming him into a more understandable and terrifying villain.",

Some scenes left me frustrated, while others brought me to tears.\n   - The ending, however, felt rushed and less sentimental than I had hoped, which was disappointing.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**\n   - The audiobook featured multiple narrators, but the original narrators (Cara Gee, Nicole Lewis, Darrell Dennis, Shaun Taylor-Corbett) stood out and delivered exceptional performances. The other narrators were also great, but the originals truly shined.\n\n- **Series Reflection:**\n   - This book marks the conclusion of the series, and I’m in awe of how beautifully it wrapped up. The last sentence of the final chapter left a lasting impression.\n   - I will deeply miss the characters and the world created in this series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a stunning and epic conclusion to the series, with incredible world-building and a mix of fantasy and romance.

The central conflict would have benefited from a deeper exploration of Naranpa and Serapio as they navigate their choices and roles as vessels for opposing gods, rather than focusing on external scheming. Additionally, certain plot elements, such as the dream-walking conflict between Naranpa and Balam, the Darth Vader-style parentage reveal, and Naranpa's unresolved ending, felt underwhelming or misplaced.",

The queer representation is well-executed and seamlessly woven into the narrative, with nonbinary characters treated with respect and gender dynamics thoughtfully examined within the society. In the second book, Naranpa and Serapio serve as foils, highlighting their contrasting relationships to duty, responsibility, and agency. However, I found Naranpa underutilized in the final book, and her dynamic with Serapio was not explored as deeply as I had hoped.",

However, Naranpa was underutilized in the final book, and her dynamic with Serapio was not explored as much as I had hoped.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**\n   - The complex political and religious forces made the series incredibly engaging, with many moving players and moral ambiguity.\n   - The Indigenous representation was enjoyable, though I, as a white reader, cannot speak to its accuracy.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**\n   - The time spent on Balam’s perspective weakened his character, making him seem more like a cartoonishly evil villain rather than a nuanced antagonist.\n   - The core conflict could have focused more on Naranpa and Serapio grappling with their choices and their roles as vessels for opposing gods, rather than on external scheming villains.\n   - Certain plot points, like the dream-walking conflict between Naranpa and Balam, the Darth Vader-style parentage reveal, and the unresolved ending for Naranpa, felt underwhelming or misplaced.\n\n- **Emotional Connection and Critique:**\n   - My criticism comes from a place of deep love and respect for the story. Despite its flaws, I still love these characters and this world.\n   - This is one of my favorite series of the year, and I will be closely following Roanhorse’s work in the future.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I deeply enjoyed this trilogy and found it to be one of my favorites of the year. While I have some criticisms, particularly regarding the underutilization of Naranpa and certain plot choices, my love for the characters and the world remains strong. I highly recommend this series to others and look forward to more from Rebecca Roanhorse.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific numerical rating was provided in the review."

            "The conclusion resolved most loose ends but felt rushed, especially with the sudden time jump and information overload at the end. The battle for Tova, which had been anticipated, ultimately fell flat and didn't deliver the epic scale it warranted. Crucial moments, like Xiala's destruction of the navy and the war's climax, were recounted rather than depicted, which lessened their emotional impact.",
            "The character arcs, especially those of Narampa and Iktan, reach satisfying and well-earned conclusions. Narampa's evolution from a disliked figure in *Black Sun* to a more nuanced and relatable character is commendable. While Xiala's journey to becoming Queen of the Teek and her relationship with Serapio’s son held promise, it felt rushed. Serapio's return to his roots and reunion with Xiala were emotionally impactful, though his healing process could have been explored more thoroughly.",
            "The book's structure would have benefited from being divided into two parts: the battle and its aftermath. This division would allow for a more detailed exploration of events. A longer book or an additional installment could have provided the necessary space to develop the story's conclusion more effectively.",
            "The trilogy excels in world-building, seamlessly integrating Meso-American lore and political intrigue. The well-developed setting and rich lore significantly enhance the story's depth.",
            "The themes of grief, healing, and freedom are present but could benefit from deeper exploration, particularly for characters like Serapio and Xiala.",

        "conclusion": "While the trilogy as a whole is a masterpiece with its rich world-building, compelling characters, and intricate plot, this final book felt rushed and incomplete. The emotional highs, such as the reunions and character resolutions, were satisfying, but the execution of key plot points and the lack of depth in the aftermath left me wanting more. Despite its flaws, the trilogy remains a fantastic story that I would revisit in the future.",

Its characters, setting, and world-building were outstanding and beyond measure.  \n   - Books 2 and 3, while not \"bad,\" couldn't replicate the same level of brilliance as Book 1. They struggled to capture the same magic, akin to the \"True Detective\" issue where the first installment set an impossibly high bar.  \n\n- **Character Development and Arcs:**  \n   - The characters and their arcs were deeply complex and emotionally resonant, with tangible and powerful moments throughout the series.  \n   - However, some characters lacked the final polishing and revisions needed to fully hold up by the end.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - The world was vibrant, tactile, and artistic, providing a palpable arena for the characters to toil in.  \n   - The interplay between the characters and their environment was intricate and immersive.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot, while engaging, suffered from pacing issues and miscalculated resolutions, especially in the 600-page span.  \n   - The buildup and complex political scheming were well-executed, but the ending felt rushed and lacked the attention it deserved.  \n\n- **Reader Experience:**  \n   - Despite its flaws, the series was a transformative and worthwhile read, filled with joyous moments and edge-of-the-seat anticipation.  \n   - The speculative narration and deep character interplay made the journey fulfilling and appreciative.  \n\n- **Author's Craftsmanship:**  \n   - Rebecca Roanhorse is a masterful storyteller, and her creation of this vibrant world and its characters is something to be grateful for.  \n   - While the series didn’t fully live up to its initial promise, it remains a significant and impactful contribution to the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis series, while not without its flaws, is a transformative and worthwhile read.

            "*Mirrored Heavens* is the longest of the three books, and while some chapters slowed the pace, it covered significant ground. Unfortunately, the ending fell flat; I had hoped for something epic, but it felt more like a hubris conclusion. I was disappointed that Xiala had to search for Serapio at the end, as it seemed uncharacteristic of him, especially given his earlier declarations to her. Surprisingly, I found Balam's increased page count enjoyable; exploring the villain's motives and witnessing blood magic in action added a layer of anticipatory dread.",

The call to action is clear: carve a path, mark the days, and shift the tides. The tasks are daunting: transform decay into bloom, confront the unloved god-bride, and compel the son to overthrow the father. Ultimately, victory belongs to the Carrion King, who, in his triumph, sacrifices everything.",

The lore is rich and immersive, with enough material for potential prequels (e.g., Night of Knives or the Spearmaiden wars).  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - *Mirrored Heavens* is the chunkiest of the three books. While some chapters slowed the pace, a lot of ground was covered.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n   - Xiala, Serapio, and Okoa remain my favorite characters. I loved seeing a glimmer of Xiala and Serapio’s banter again, though I wish they had more time together in the last two books—their interactions are the absolute highlights of the series.  \n   - I wasn’t expecting to enjoy Balam’s increased page count, but seeing the villain’s motives and blood magic in action added a lot of anticipatory dread.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n   - Unfortunately, the ending fizzled out. I had envisioned something epic, but it felt more like a hubris ending.  \n   - I disliked how Xiala had to go out in search of Serapio at the end—it felt very un-Serapio-like, especially after all his earlier declarations to her.  \n\n- **Themes and Quotes:**  \n   - The recurring themes of love, sacrifice, and destiny are beautifully captured in quotes like:  \n     - “On earth, in heaven, and within, three wars to lose, three wars to win. Cut the path. Mark the days. Turn the tides. Three tasks before the season dies: turn rotten fruit to flower, slay the god-bride still unloved, press the son to fell the sire. Victory then to the Carrion King who in winning loses everything.”  \n     - “Love is not a prize to be won or a sign of one’s merit. It is a gift freely given.”  \n     - “And through it all, she watched his face. How could she not when he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen? A man of contradictions, dangerous but unbearably gentle, loving but cruel.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Mirrored Heavens* provided a fitting end to the series, it wasn’t as satisfying as I had hoped. The rich lore, compelling characters, and thematic depth made the series a standout, but the ending lacked the epic resolution I anticipated. Despite this, the series remains a memorable and immersive experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The anticipated set-piece battle didn't unfold as expected, with much of the death and destruction occurring off-stage. In some fight scenes, opponents hesitated, allowing protagonists to engage in heartfelt conversations, which felt unrealistic in a life-or-death scenario.

Major events often resolve too quickly, sometimes within a single chapter. Okoa’s perspectives feel especially underdeveloped and hurried. The story picks up right after *Fever Star*, with Xiala returning to Teek, only to confront an invasion and enslavement by Tuun. The unexplained loss of the Teek women’s Song seems like a plot device to enhance Xiala’s character and power. Additionally, the ending leaves several plot threads unresolved, hinting at the potential for future books in this world, which I would welcome.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The final installment of the Between Earth and Sky trilogy involves armies gathering across the pre-Columbian world of the Meridian, leading to a climactic battle between various forces.\n   - The pacing was uneven, with the ending feeling rushed and jumping through time too quickly.\n   - The action builds at a low to medium simmer before reaching a strong climax in the last quarter, which has Shakespearean tragedy vibes.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Xiala’s character arc throughout the beginning and middle of the book was particularly enjoyable.\n   - Naranpa’s continued journey was also a highlight.\n\n- **Themes and Philosophical Questions:**\n   - The book explores big questions about the fixed or mutable nature of destiny, the spiritual toll of amassing power, and the challenges of moral grayness in a world structured around “good” and “evil.”\n\n- **World-Building and Magical Elements:**\n   - The magical and mystical world-building elements were a strong point, adding depth and richness to the story.\n   - The trilogy is set in a pre-Columbian world with queernorm and gender fluidity, non-human animals, ancestral magic, and a non-linear nature of sentience, grief, and time.\n\n- **Overall Satisfaction and Recommendation:**\n   - The conclusion was mostly satisfying, though the trilogy started strong and fell off a little in the middle.\n   - Recommended for readers who enjoy intersecting characters and storylines, pre-colonial queernorm and gender fluidity, and themes of ancestral magic and non-linear time.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**\n   - The book contains graphic descriptions of violence, blood, death, and torture.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I enjoyed the final installment of the Between Earth and Sky trilogy, particularly the character arcs of Xiala and Naranpa, as well as the rich world-building and exploration of deep philosophical questions. However, the pacing felt uneven, and the ending seemed rushed. Despite these issues, it’s a mostly satisfying conclusion to a trilogy that started strong and is recommended for fans of complex, intersecting storylines and themes of queernorm, gender fluidity, and ancestral magic.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4 stars"

            "The books unfold at a slow pace, gaining momentum around the 60% mark, which I appreciate for the deeper engagement it fosters. The third installment centers on the breaking of the treaty, the looming war in Tova, and the conflict among the gods. It also delves into the backstories of key characters such as Balam, Iktan, Nara, and Xiala.",

Serapio's internal struggle between humanity and divinity is captivating and develops beautifully throughout the series, ultimately achieving a poignant balance between life and death in the final installment.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n   - The world-building is marvelous, with a rich history and mythology. Each chapter begins with a citation from this mythology, adding depth to the narrative.  \n   - The story is told from different angles and perspectives, making the world feel expansive and immersive.  \n\n- **Characters and Morality:**  \n   - The morally gray main characters are a highlight, and each book features a standalone story within the same overarching storyline.  \n   - The slow pacing allows time to bond with the characters, which I appreciate.  \n   - Serapio's inner conflict (human vs. god) is compelling and evolves beautifully across the books, culminating in a balance between life and death in the final installment.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The books are slow-paced, with momentum building around the 60% mark, which I enjoy as it allows for deeper engagement with the story.  \n   - The third book focuses on the breaking of the treaty, the impending war on Tova, and the war between the gods. It also provides backstory on key characters like Balam, Iktan, Nara, and Xiala.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Third Book:**  \n   - The \"war within\" theme, particularly Serapio's internal struggle, is executed brilliantly.  \n   - The balance between human and godly aspects, vengeance and forgiveness, and life and death is explored thoughtfully across the series.  \n\n- **Weaknesses of the Third Book:**  \n   - At times, the story feels detached and chaotic.  \n   - Tuun's ambition to colonize Teek feels unnecessary, though it serves to unlock Xiala's full powers.  \n   - Nara's side story adds little to the plot and feels inconsistent with her previously loving and empathetic character.  \n   - The war on Tova ends anticlimactically in the Western Wastelands before it truly begins.  \n   - Several character deaths (e.g., Okoa, Tuun, Kupshu, Nara, and Serapio) feel abrupt or unnecessary.  \n   - Xiala's decision to kill Serapio seems impulsive and lacks emotional depth, despite his eventual resurrection.  \n\n- **Loose Ends and Unresolved Questions:**  \n   - Some elements remain unclear, such as the identities and roles of the other gods, the Jaguar Prince, and the symbolic representations (crow, firebird, mermaid, coyote, etc.).  \n   - The magical system is vague and could have been explored in greater detail.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues, chaotic moments, and unresolved questions, the series excels in world-building, character development, and thematic depth. The morally gray characters, intricate mythology, and Serapio's inner conflict make for a compelling and immersive read.

Highlights include Serapio’s fake wedding and Okoa’s involvement in the assassination plot, which reveal the characters' complex planning and moral dilemmas.

The decolonized fantasy setting, devoid of traditional clichés like dragons and medieval European elements, is particularly noteworthy.",

His motivations, rooted in lost love and a troubled relationship with his father, fuel his thirst for power. The love story between Naranpa and Iktan is particularly compelling. Iktan’s quest for revenge and his rediscovery of Naranpa, alongside her growth in dreamwalking and Sun God powers, adds significant emotional depth. Their poignant reunion and Naranpa’s ultimate sacrifice leave Iktan with a glimmer of hope for her revival. \n\nXiala’s narrative centers on self-discovery and love as she reconnects with her people, embraces her water goddess powers, and rekindles her relationship with Serapio.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storylines:**  \n   - The book had a few storylines that were more engaging than others, making some POVs a struggle to read.  \n   - The pacing issues from Book 2 persisted for the first 80% of this book, with the ending feeling rushed.  \n   - The conclusion wrapped up nicely, though some things were left open-ended, leaving potential for a spin-off.  \n   - The book could have been trimmed back, as the long lead-up to the ending felt drawn out.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Language:**  \n   - The writing is beautiful and strikes a perfect balance between descriptive and concise.  \n   - There were some overused words and phrases (e.g., \"huffed,\" \"puffed,\" \"murmured,\" \"mouth worked\").  \n   - The use of \"belly\" to describe attraction felt awkward and out of place.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n   - The Columbian-indigenous themes created a unique and well-developed fantasy world.  \n   - The complex politics, morally gray characters, and ever-changing alliances added depth to the story.  \n   - Diverse representation, including non-binary characters integral to the plot, was a highlight.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters had complicated backstories and were well-developed, making them memorable.  \n   - Iktan’s blade suddenly not being poisoned was a minor plot hole that stood out.  \n\n- **Series Overall:**  \n   - While neither *Fevered Star* nor *Mirrored Heavens* reached the level of *Black Sun*, the series as a whole was enjoyable.  \n   - The audiobooks, featuring multiple narrators, were well-done, though I found it easier to switch between physical and audio formats after becoming familiar with the world.  \n   - Binge-reading the series within weeks of each other helped keep the details fresh, which I recommend for readers who tend to forget things quickly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues, overused phrases, and minor plot holes, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the series as a whole. The unique world-building, diverse representation, and complex characters made it a memorable read. While the ending felt rushed and some storylines were less engaging, the overall experience was satisfying, and I’d highly recommend the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4⭐️ (Really Liked)"

            "The ending was a significant letdown, causing my rating to drop from 5 to 4 stars. The final 10% felt rushed, with the war barely taking place and many character arcs unresolved. Kupshu, Nasuut, Terzha, Ziha, Powageh, Balam, the matrons, Iktan, the giant crows, and the Tuyon all had unsatisfying conclusions. Okoa's arc was particularly frustrating, as his relationships with Esa and Serapio went unresolved. Naranpa's ending was especially disappointing; she ended up in a dreamworld purgatory after being used as a vessel to burn Tova. Additionally, the magic system and character survivability—such as Serapio surviving a stabbing to the heart despite losing his god—felt inconsistent and poorly explained.",
            "My favorite characters were Balam and Saaya, who were both diabolical and compelling, as well as Serapio and Okoa, both individually and as a pair. I also enjoyed the dynamic between Serapio and Xiala, and Iktan's iconic presence, particularly his friendship with Xiala. The complexity of their relationships, both with one another and within themselves, was a standout aspect of the story. However, I found one character to be underutilized throughout the narrative, and her ending left me feeling unsatisfied.",
            "*Black Sun* was enjoyable, but the writing style leaned too heavily into YA for my preference. I found *Fevered Star* disappointing, as I didn't connect with Naranpa the way I did with Serapio and Xiala. However, *Mirrored Heavens* was mostly fantastic, and I was genuinely invested in witnessing the author's growth.",
            "The world-building in this trilogy is phenomenal, particularly the concepts of dream walking and god flesh, which kept me thoroughly engaged. However, the magic system felt inconsistent. Serapio’s ascension to godhood required generations of effort, while Naranpa’s seemed to occur almost effortlessly. Additionally, Xiala’s ability to turn sound into light was both confusing and underdeveloped."

        "conclusion": "While the trilogy had phenomenal world-building and complex, compelling characters, the inconsistent magic system and rushed, unsatisfying ending significantly detracted from the overall experience. Despite these flaws, the work showcased the author’s growing skill and left me deeply invested in the story.",

While the conclusion is well-crafted, it leaves some dissatisfaction regarding the fates of certain characters.",

Okoa, despite limited page time, remains a standout, as his internal struggles evoke strong emotions. Xiala’s character development is particularly impressive, showcasing her full embrace of her powers. Meanwhile, the relationship between Iktan and Narampa is skillfully portrayed, culminating in a heartfelt acknowledgment of their feelings for one another.",

            "The pacing of *Fevered Star* was slower than I anticipated. Given the dramatic conclusion of the previous book, I expected an immediate plunge into the war, but the action only intensified in the second half. The colonizers' comeuppance, particularly Lady Tun's downfall, was satisfying; her motivations, while infuriating, felt authentic for a colonizer. While the book met my expectations, I found myself wanting more. It provided a solid conclusion, but there were a few missteps. Okoa's death felt undeserved, and I hope his arc was resolved adequately, though it’s not a dealbreaker for me.",
            "I was captivated by the character development in *Black Sun*. Xiala had the most compelling arc, showcasing her growth as she stood up for her people; her god form was stunning—I need to commission some art of it! In *Mirrored Heavens*, Balam's backstory is further explored, shedding light on his past with Saaya and his role in Serapio’s creation. It was no surprise to learn that he is Serapio’s father. However, Naranpa’s arc felt underwhelming, leaving me wanting more from her character.",

            "The pacing of this book is problematic; it feels like it should have been split into two volumes. While a lot happens, the story unfolds at a pace more suited to a sequel, resulting in a confusing blend of rushed and sluggish moments. Key plot points, particularly those involving Naranpa's arc, require more time to develop.",

Her limited appearances left crucial questions about her journey unanswered, such as how she knew to head north, her internal struggle between the Tower's teachings and the old ways, and her significance as the sun god. Additionally, her minimal involvement in the final confrontation was disappointing.",
            "The world-building in this installment greatly surpasses that of the first book, making the narrative feel overly expansive for a trilogy. The multitude of character perspectives and large-scale events diluted the story's focus.

I love this world, the characters, and the project itself, especially Serapio's journey throughout the three books. The characterization, world-building, politics, and exploration of humanity and love are all aspects I deeply appreciate.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The pacing felt off. This book should have been two books. So much happens, but it unfolds with the pace of the second novel, making it feel both rushed and slow simultaneously. New plot points, especially those related to Naranpa's arc, needed more time to develop.  \n\n- **Character Development (Naranpa):**  \n   - Naranpa's role felt underdeveloped. She was set up as one of the most important characters, being the foil to Serapio's god, but she barely appeared in this book. Key questions about her journey—like how she knew to go north, her internal conflict between the Tower's teachings and the old ways, and her role as the sun god—were left unanswered. Her minimal presence in the final fight was disappointing.  \n\n- **World-Building and Scale:**  \n   - The world expanded significantly compared to the first book, making the story feel too large for a trilogy. There were too many character POVs and large-scale events, which diluted the focus. The final battle, which should have been the climax, felt rushed and underwhelming, lasting only about ten pages.  \n\n- **Desire for More Content:**  \n   - I’m hopeful for more stories in this world. Xiala’s line about it being “only the beginning” gives me hope. I want to know more about Naranpa’s fate, the Tuyon, and the coyote god, who was a fascinating but underutilized character. The last two chapters were excellent, and I need more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I loved the trilogy overall and appreciated its rich world-building and character journeys, this final book felt overstuffed and rushed. Naranpa’s underdeveloped arc and the abrupt ending left me wanting more.

While individual events were often surprising and engaging—such as a character switching sides—I found myself questioning their contributions to the overall narrative. The backdrop of the gods' battle added to the confusion instead of clarifying the story. However, the romantic relationships among the main characters were well-developed and ultimately resolved satisfactorily after considerable angst.

While Xiala remains a likable heroine, her narrative arc feels less convincing this time. The relationships are particularly well-developed, especially the chemistry between Serapio and Xiala, which evokes strong memories of Ali and Nahri from the Daevabad trilogy—a significant compliment.

            "The ending felt rushed, particularly in Naranpa's dreamwalking journey and her interactions with Cupshu and Iktan. More focus on her conflict with Balam would have given the conclusion a stronger emotional impact. Expanding the story into a quartet instead of a trilogy could have provided the plot and characters with more room to develop. Despite the pacing issues, the author skillfully resolved complex plot threads while preserving the political intrigue, suspense, and magic established in the first two books. However, some elements, such as Iktan's survival after the zombie battle, were left unexplained, which was disappointing.",

However, Serapio's choice to abandon the prophecy offered a satisfying resolution to his character arc. While the initial conclusion of Xiala and Serapio's story felt frustrating due to the familiar trope of \"your lover is dead, but it's okay because you have a child,\" the length and execution of the epilogue chapters ultimately delivered a rewarding conclusion for their relationship."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Focus and Development:**  \n  - I absolutely adore Serapio; he’s such a darling and cute character. I wish the story had been more focused on him.  \n  - Some POV characters didn’t need as much attention as they received, which took away from the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  - The writing style made everything feel a bit monotonous, even though the events themselves were cool and should have been exciting.  \n  - The pacing was slow, and at times, the story felt boring. I think the book would have worked better as a duology to allow for better pacing and focus.  \n\n- **World-Building and Detail:**  \n  - The extensive details about the city, priests, and their inner squabbles felt unnecessary and didn’t contribute much to the overall story. I would have preferred this information condensed into a chapter or two.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The deaths in the story didn’t evoke strong emotions in me. I felt detached, even though I recognized their significance.  \n\n- **Ending and Satisfaction:**  \n  - The ending was cute and enjoyable, but it didn’t feel entirely satisfying. It was delivered in a very matter-of-fact way, which lessened its impact.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - While the story is fun, visual, and interesting, the slow pacing and writing style made it hard for me to fully enjoy. I wouldn’t recommend these books because of their length and sluggishness.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my love for Serapio and the story’s interesting visuals and ideas, the slow pacing, excessive focus on less important characters, and lack of emotional depth made the book a challenging read for me. While the ending was cute, it didn’t leave me fully satisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed \"Mirrored Heavens.\" It serves as a fitting conclusion in both scope and action, though it doesn't quite match the highs of the first book. Some moments felt abrupt, and the power scaling occasionally seemed excessive, but this is to be expected in a fantasy epic.",
            "The body count felt justified, as many characters had been on the edge in previous installments. Balam’s character arc was both understandable and foreshadowed since \"Fevered Star.\" However, some characters, like Narampa and Serapio, became less dynamic in this book and the last. In contrast, Okoa and Xiala fully embraced their abilities, which was a highlight. Although Okoa was my least favorite viewpoint, I wished the story had explored his anxieties more deeply. While he ultimately emerges as a fully realized warrior and hero, it felt like he was being led along for much of the narrative."

        "conclusion": "Overall, “Mirrored Heavens” was a satisfying conclusion, delivering on action and scope while tying up character arcs. Despite some pacing issues and missed opportunities for deeper exploration of certain characters, the book succeeded in showcasing the growth of key figures like Okoa and Xiala. The standout scenes in Teek and the earned body count added to the epic feel of the story.",

The storyline, character growth, and beautifully written ending made it a worthwhile read, though it didn’t quite match the excellence of the first two books in the trilogy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (instead of 5 due to pacing issues)."

            "The story follows a cast of characters who are largely scattered and unaware of the true threat lurking in the shadows. Serapio, the Carrion King, rules Tova as the city faces attacks from both external and internal forces. Meanwhile, Xiala returns to the Teek, only to find conflict brewing in their floating community, and Naranpa is haunted by the Jaguar in her dreams. The plot is intricate and filled with tension, making for a compelling read. The novel culminates in a satisfying conclusion that ties up loose ends and delivers a grand finale. The resolution effectively brings closure to both the characters' journeys and the overarching narrative.",
            "The characters are well-developed, each grappling with their own struggles and motivations. Serapio, Xiala, and Naranpa confront significant challenges that test their resolve and push them to their limits. However, some characters could use a reality check, as their motivations occasionally come across as misguided or trivial.",

            "The emotional stakes are elevated, especially with the longing for certain characters to reunite and the anticipation of retribution for others. The inclusion of the large crows adds a unique and intriguing layer, enriching both the emotional and atmospheric depth of the story."

It felt like I wanted a bigger payoff. Maybe this book could have trimmed 50 pages elsewhere and put them into the final battle instead.  \n\n- **Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  All in all, I was satisfied with where things ended up, and I did have a good time taking this journey.  \n\n- **Future Expectations:**  \n  Now that the trilogy is over, I'm really hoping that Roanhorse gives us another book in the Sixth World series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a mostly satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, with engaging writing, enjoyable characters, and a unique mythological foundation. While the pacing of the final conflict felt rushed, the overall journey was rewarding, and I look forward to potential future stories in this world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the epilogue (though not explicitly labeled as such) helped to redeem the conclusion, even if it was somewhat predictable.\n\n- **Length and Series Consistency:**  \n  I appreciated that the final installment of the trilogy wasn’t excessively long, coming in at 600 pages instead of the 800+ pages that many trilogies tend to have these days.

This cultural backdrop is incredibly unique and refreshing, offering something different from the typical fantasy fare. I loved this aspect and believe we need more stories like this in the genre.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the slow start and anticlimactic ending, the trilogy as a whole was awesome. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in exploring diverse and unique fantasy settings, especially those that break away from traditional Eurocentric narratives.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some pacing issues and a less-than-satisfying ending, the trilogy as a whole was a fantastic read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  I think the novel suffered from adding too many extra points of view (POVs), though I understand their necessity by the end. The multiple POVs made it harder to focus deeply on individual characters.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I wish we had delved more into the psyche of the characters. With fewer POVs, the story could have explored their inner worlds more thoroughly, which would have added depth to their arcs.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  The mythology elements in the series were cool and intriguing, but I felt they could have been better integrated into the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Conflict and Plot Development:**  \n  The buildup to the conflict towards the end felt a bit rushed. I think a stronger setup for this climax would have made the resolution more satisfying.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was exceptionally well-written, and it stood out as one of the strongest aspects of the novel. This makes me curious to read more of Rebecca’s books to see if romance remains her strong suit.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some pacing and character development issues due to the multiple POVs, the mythology elements were intriguing, and the romance was a standout feature. The conflict could have been better set up, but overall, the story left me interested in exploring more of the author’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book carries over several issues from its predecessor, which undermines its effectiveness. The author struggles to position characters due to time wasted in the previous installment. The Teek storyline feels rushed, and Xiala’s character development should have been better addressed earlier. The massacre of Xiala’s mother, aunt, and the matrons lacks emotional weight due to insufficient buildup. While the beach scene where Xiala begins to Sing is excellent, it doesn't achieve the impact it deserves. However, once the narrative leaves the Teek islands, Xiala’s storyline improves and flows more smoothly.",
            "Xiala and Serapio's reunion is heartwarming, and their relationship stands out as a highlight. Serapio's perspective is particularly compelling, especially in a poignant scene with the man he believes to be his father, which powerfully illustrates his religious trauma and motivations. However, Naranpa's storyline feels extraneous, hastily added, and disconnected from the main conflict. Additionally, Balem's flashbacks and point of view seem unnecessary, contributing to a sense of bloat in the narrative.",

It felt slightly unresolved compared to the others.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel serves as a strong and satisfying conclusion to the series, maintaining the quality and engagement of the first two books. Despite a minor desire for more closure on one character arc, the overall balance and resolution were well-executed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was enjoyable to continue the story and see what Xiala, Serapio, and Naranpa would wind up doing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I was especially excited to see Xiala in full form, and Rebecca Roanhorse did not disappoint. Serapio also delivered on the intensity hinted at in *Fevered Star*, particularly in the scene where he \"brought the smoke\" in *Mirrored Heavens*.  \n\n- **World-Building and Originality:**  \n  This book is perfect for those who want to read about a diverse set of characters and a world that is original. However, I would love a prequel to better understand the original clans—maybe a future project?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Mirrored Heavens* was an exciting and satisfying continuation of the story, with strong character development and a richly original world. While I thoroughly enjoyed it, I’d love to see more backstory on the clans in a potential prequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

My high rating is largely due to my personal stake in wanting the two main characters, Xiala and Serapio, to be together and happy. Seeing them finally happy together was worth it to me, even if the execution could have been better.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Climax:**  \n   - The series seemed to take the easy way out of almost every major plot climax. Many pivotal moments either happened off-page or were explained away in a manner that felt unsatisfactory. I really wish Rebecca Roanhorse had taken a bolder approach, similar to what was done in the first book.  \n\n- **Series Quality Over Time:**  \n   - The series started off excellently with the first book but seemed to decline to a mid-tier level before improving slightly, though it never reached the same greatness as the first book. The potential and buildup were there, but they weren’t fully acted upon.  \n\n- **Character Utilization (Balam):**  \n   - I’m confused about why Balam was made into a main character. His inclusion felt unnecessary and detracted from the central conflict of good versus evil, particularly the Crow God versus Sun God dynamic, which was ultimately resolved in an unsatisfactory way.  \n\n- **Character Attachment and Final Rating:**  \n   - Despite the flaws, I adore Xiala and Serapio so much that I can’t bring myself to rate this book lower. Their happiness together was a highlight for me, even if the overall story could have been executed better.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the series didn’t live up to the brilliance of the first book and had some unsatisfying plot resolutions, my emotional attachment to the main characters and their happy ending kept my rating high. The potential was there, but the execution fell short in several areas.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- High rating (exact score not specified, but implied to be above average due to emotional investment in the characters)."

            "The pacing of the story is problematic, with excessive buildup leading to the finale and too much time spent on unnecessary points of view. Several new plot threads—such as dreamwalking, Serapio's prophecy, and Xiala's Teek arc—are introduced but not satisfactorily resolved, with the exception of Serapio's prophecy, which thematically aligns with his character. While Balam's POV chapters are intriguing, they feel out of place in the final book, overly focused on backstory and exposition. The war plot between Tova and other cities builds tension but culminates in an anticlimactic battle and a lackluster final confrontation between Serapio and Balam. Additionally, the absence of Serapio's POV in the concluding chapters leaves his character arc feeling incomplete. The final chapter featuring Serapio and Xiala feels like a cop-out, sidestepping the consequences of Serapio's actions and neglecting to explore a viable future for their relationship.",
            "**Serapio:** His character arc is the most coherent, showcasing a compelling struggle between destiny and self-determination. However, the author avoids fully addressing the consequences of his actions, leaving his journey feeling unresolved. \n\n**Xiala:** She has improved significantly, with her own goals and powers finally taking center stage. Her personal resolution is the most satisfying, though the unexplained loss of Teek magic feels contrived. \n\n**Okoa:** His chapters become more engaging, featuring a clearer inner conflict and a meaningful bond with Serapio. However, his abrupt and seemingly pointless death, along with the lack of follow-up on Serapio's reaction, is disappointing. \n\n**Naranpa:** Her arc peaked in the previous book but is mishandled here. Her side quest feels irrelevant, her conflict with Balam is jarring, and her ending in a coma is unsatisfying and poorly executed. \n\n**Iktan:** He is reduced to a mourning spouse, which feels both reductive and queerphobic.",

However, the ending felt rushed and lacked the boldness needed for a more impactful conclusion. While Serapio's transformation and return to human form were poetic, they could have been even more powerful and tragic had he remained dead.",
            "Overall, the character arcs were satisfying, particularly in the final chapters. However, some characters, like Naranpa, felt underutilized, and their arcs fell flat in the later books. The romantic relationship between Xiala and Serapio seemed forced and lacked chemistry, despite being heavily emphasized. In contrast, the strong chemistry between Serapio and Okoa was disappointingly unexplored. While the relationship between Naranpa and Iktan was more believable, it still felt underdeveloped. Many characters appeared expendable, with their deaths serving as mere plot devices rather than meaningful moments. The lack of real stakes until the final 70 pages diminished the overall tension, as characters frequently survived near-death situations.",
            "The author's writing is beautifully fluid, with prose that gracefully recedes into the background while occasionally delivering striking phrases, sentiments, and dialogue. A particularly impactful exchange captures this essence: “You never loved her,” Balam hissed. “Not truly. That is why she chose me over you. You wanted to own her, a beautiful thing to preserve. I only want to stand beside her and watch her become a force of nature. She is not mine, I see that. But I am hers, and I will do whatever she wants, even if she asks me to tear out my heart so that she may crush it under her heel. Will it hurt? I do not doubt that it will break me. But I will do it anyway. Once or a thousand times. Because that is what love is.”",

It was harder to connect with the characters during the reread, and it felt very much like a second/middle book.  \n\n- **Engagement with the Plot:**  \n   - For *Mirrored Heavens*, it took me almost half the book to get into it.  \n   - The plot felt like it was trudging along at times.  \n\n- **Character Development and POVs:**  \n   - There are way too many POV characters, and not all of them felt necessary.  \n   - Six POV characters were included, and while most were readable, Balam’s chapters were not enjoyable. I skimmed through his sections the most because he bored me.  \n\n- **Use of Character Abilities:**  \n   - I loved that Xiala’s powers were used to their potential in this book, though I wish I could have seen more of it.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n   - The ending left me feeling both satisfied and underwhelmed.  \n   - One particular aspect of the ending was a bit disappointing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the trilogy had its highs and lows, *Mirrored Heavens* struggled to fully engage me, especially with its pacing and some unnecessary POVs. Despite enjoying certain elements, like Xiala’s powers, the overall experience was mixed, leaving me both satisfied and underwhelmed by the conclusion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Second book: Changed from 4.5 to 3 stars after reread.  \n- *Mirrored Heavens*: No specific rating mentioned, but the tone suggests a mixed or moderate rating."

While it rewards dedicated fans who have closely followed the intricate politics and alliances, it feels like a slog for readers like me who were primarily interested in the overarching plot and resolution.\n\n- **Engagement with Interpersonal and Political Conflicts:**\n   - The focus on interpersonal conflict and internecine warfare in *Mirrored Heavens* (and *Fevered Star*) is not particularly engaging for those not deeply invested in the characters' inner struggles. The first book, *Black Sun*, had a compelling mix of high stakes, romance, action, and clever stratagems, which made it far more captivating.\n\n- **Prose and Narrative Style:**\n   - The prose in the latter two books feels detached, especially during moments of violence, which are described in a surprisingly bloodless and dismissive manner. It seems as though the author is more interested in exploring the characters' internal conflicts and psychological depths, such as the Carrion King's mind, rather than delivering impactful action or resolution.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**\n   - The portrayal of relationships, particularly the women's poor taste in men, is frustrating. The male characters' actions often go unchallenged, with no meaningful consequences for their behavior, which detracts from the story's emotional depth.\n\n- **Audience Reception:**\n   - I acknowledge that the intended audience—dedicated fans of the series—will likely find *Mirrored Heavens* enthralling and satisfying. However, for readers like me, the series lost its magic after the first book.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *Mirrored Heavens* may resonate with fans deeply invested in the series' intricate politics and character dynamics, it falls short for readers seeking a compelling and action-driven conclusion. The first book, *Black Sun*, remains a standout, and I regret that the series did not maintain the same level of excitement and engagement.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "The plot relied heavily on frustrating and unoriginal tropes, particularly the prophecy theme, which felt out of place compared to earlier story elements. Prophecy narratives often follow predictable patterns, and this one was no exception, featuring vague wording, misinterpretation, and unintended consequences. The foreshadowing of Serapio’s true parentage, with Balam as his biological father, was overly obvious, making the reveal anticlimactic. While the ending wasn’t terrible, it left me deeply unsatisfied. The resolution of key storylines felt predictable and uninspired, ultimately diminishing my investment in the characters and their fates.",
            "Some character arcs were deeply unsatisfying. Naranpa, my favorite character, ended up comatose in a glass coffin, leaving her story unresolved and disappointing. Meanwhile, Serapio and Xiala’s love story concluded in a predictable manner: a single night together, Serapio’s supposed death, Xiala’s pregnancy, and a hint that Serapio might still be alive. This felt lazy and uninvolving.",

            "The novel's pace was glacially slow until the very end, creating an uneven reading experience. The multiple perspectives, particularly those of Xiala, Okoa, and Nara, disrupted the momentum established by Serapio and Balam. The conclusions for Okoa, Nara, and Balam felt anti-climactic and unsatisfying. Okoa's story ended abruptly with his stabbing, leaving him unresolved. Nara's arc missed the anticipated dreamwalking confrontation with Balam, and her god's takeover felt rushed and incomplete. Balam's confrontation also concluded too quickly, leaving the Maw plotline unresolved and underdeveloped compared to its prominence in the second book.",
            "Serapio's arc was compelling, particularly the tragic moment when he reconnects with his father—who isn’t his biological parent—and kills him to fulfill the prophecy. Balam's chapters were engaging, and his dynamic with Powageh was enjoyable, though the flashbacks seemed unnecessary, as readers could easily fill in those gaps. Xiala's storyline felt unresolved and disappointing, especially Serapio's lack of devotion to her after promising to return, which undermined the relationship developed in *Black Sun*.",

It struggles to balance emotional depth with extensive plot and worldbuilding, much of which should have been addressed in *Fevered Star*. A new element of the magic system is introduced late in the story, coming across as a deus ex machina. While all plot threads are resolved, the surviving characters are left with a sense of life beyond the narrative. The final chapters are emotionally resonant and satisfying, but the chaotic and underdeveloped events leading to the conclusion detract from the overall experience. The book would have benefited from further development to fully realize its ambitious goals.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Series Comparison and Expectations:**\n   - Mirrored Heavens does not reach the heights of *Black Sun* but is better than *Fevered Star*.\n   - It has the difficult task of wrapping up the epic story while correcting some missteps from earlier in the series.\n   - The finale is satisfying but not earth-shattering, as the series never fully lived up to its hype and potential.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters, particularly Serapio, Xiala, and Balam, have tense and complex arcs that kept me engaged.\n   - Their goals and ambitions are compelling, though their methods often lead to unintended consequences.\n   - Naranpa becomes a non-entity in this book, which was disappointing.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**\n   - The world expands further, with new threats, alliances, and colonizing forces converging.\n   - The factions' motivations are clearer compared to *Fevered Star*, but the sense of place from *Black Sun* is lost.\n   - Much of the story feels like it takes place in a void, lacking the immersive quality of the first book.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Execution:**\n   - The pacing is uneven, feeling both sluggish and rushed at the same time.\n   - The book struggles to balance emotional depth with extensive plot and worldbuilding, much of which should have been addressed in *Fevered Star*.\n   - A new element of the magic system is introduced late in the book, feeling like a deus ex machina.\n\n- **Conclusion and Resolution:**\n   - All plot threads are wrapped up, leaving the surviving characters with a sense of life beyond the story.\n   - The final chapters are emotionally resonant and satisfying, though the events leading to the ending feel chaotic and underdeveloped.\n   - The book might have benefited from being part of a four-book series to fully realize its loftier plans.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - Many readers who connected deeply with the trilogy will likely love *Mirrored Heavens*.\n   - Despite its flaws, it is worth reading for the conclusion of the characters' arcs, even if the plot resolutions are imperfect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Mirrored Heavens* is a mixed but ultimately satisfying finale to the \"Between Earth and Sky\" trilogy. While it excels in character development and emotional resonance, it struggles with pacing, worldbuilding, and plot execution. The book wraps up the series adequately, though it leaves some potential unfulfilled. Fans of the trilogy will appreciate the conclusion, even if it doesn’t fully live up to the promise of *Black Sun*.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3 stars."

            "The epic story arc loses its grandeur, diminishing the overall narrative impact. The deaths of countless common people feel underdeveloped and lack emotional weight. The ending comes across as rushed and overly simplistic, resembling a typical Hollywood conclusion. This abrupt resolution, with its overly optimistic tone, fails to align with the stakes established earlier, ultimately undermining the significance of the sacrifices made throughout the story.",

            "The novel wraps up the story begun in *Black Sun*, focusing on the Carrion King's tenuous rule over Tova and the looming conflict as Lord Balam amasses forces to besiege the city. It weaves together multiple character arcs, including Narampa's journey of self-discovery, Iktan's grief and rage, Okoa's struggle with loyalty, and Serapio's pivotal role. The narrative delves into themes of free will, predestination, and the influence of gods and prophecies on the characters' lives. However, the pacing in the second half feels rushed, as the emphasis shifts to concluding the main plot, leaving side characters' arcs abruptly resolved or unresolved, likely due to the constraints of a trilogy.",
            "**Serapio:** The central character whose journey propels the narrative. His tragic backstory—created, born, and mutilated for others' purposes—is heart-wrenching. While the second book diminished his humanity, this installment rekindles his connection with Xiala, restoring emotional depth. \n\n**Xiala:** A standout character who reclaims her captivating presence in this book. Her relationship with Serapio is integral to the story, and her scenes are among the novel's highlights. \n\n**Iktan and Narampa:** Iktan's grief and Narampa's growth are compelling, but their arcs feel incomplete, as if sacrificed to conclude the trilogy. \n\n**Okoa and Balam:** Their storylines are underdeveloped in this installment, with Okoa's arc ending abruptly and Balam losing his complexity, reduced to a mere plot device. \n\n**Saya:** Serapio's mother, explored through flashbacks, emerges as a fascinating, morally ambiguous character. Her narrative hints at a richer complexity that the trilogy only partially reveals.",

He faced minimal consequences for his actions, and his ending lacked the permanent change or penance I expected. However, his choice to defy destiny was a strong thematic element.  \n   - **Naranpa:** Her conclusion was disappointing, as the buildup didn’t pay off. While her dreamwalking training was interesting, her sacrifice felt underwhelming, and her role in protecting Tova was underdeveloped. The preservation of the Watch Tower, a symbol of inequality, was confusing. Her relationship with Iktan was a highlight.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Subplots:**  \n   - **Tuun:** Received a fitting conclusion.  \n   - **Coyote Clan/The Maw:** Surprisingly absent after *Fevered Star*.  \n   - **Zataya:** Deserved more development beyond her role in delivering the prophecy.  \n   - **Esa:** Lacked any redeemable qualities, standing out as purely antagonistic.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Themes:**  \n   - The Pre-Columbian Americas setting, blending religion, mythology, and politics, was refreshing and unique.  \n   - The inclusion of diverse gender identities was a welcome and much-needed addition to the fantasy genre.  \n\n- **Overall Satisfaction with the Series:**  \n   - While the final book was only partially satisfying, the series as a whole was highly enjoyable.  \n   - The ending didn’t fully meet expectations but wasn’t as disappointing as some other reviews suggested.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe final book of the series delivered a mixed experience, with some character arcs and themes shining while others fell short. Despite its flaws, the series stands out for its innovative setting, rich worldbuilding, and inclusive representation. While the ending wasn’t as strong as hoped, it left me excited for the author’s future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The resolution felt rushed and anticlimactic. While the war preparation dominated 80% of the book, the actual conclusion was swift and lacked the epic stakes I had anticipated. Key characters were dismissed in just a sentence or two, and the final confrontation between Balam, Serapio, and Xiala was underwhelming, resembling a blackout scene.",
            "Naranpa’s story arc felt aimless and disconnected. After her return to Coyote’s Maw in the second novel, her abandonment of the group seemed like a missed opportunity. Okoa had a compelling storyline and inner conflict, but his sudden death at the hands of a minor character felt abrupt and unsatisfying. In contrast, Serapio and Xiala’s journeys were the most engaging. Serapio’s exploration of divinity and destiny, along with Xiala’s confrontation with her past, added depth to the narrative. However, Xiala’s return to Teek felt incomplete, particularly regarding why she was the only Teek to retain her Song.",

Unfortunately, it didn’t live up to my wildest fantasies and dreams.  \n   - While the novel answered many questions and provided further insight and lore into Roanhorse’s world, it also left me with more questions, confusion, and dissatisfaction with some character endings.  \n\n- **Character Arcs and Development:**  \n   - Naranpa’s story arc felt pointless and out of nowhere. After her return to Coyote’s Maw in the second novel, her abandonment of them felt like a lost opportunity.  \n   - Okoa had a compelling storyline and inner conflict, but his sudden and seemingly unjustified death by a minor character felt abrupt and unsatisfying.  \n   - Serapio and Xiala’s paths were the most interesting. Serapio’s realization about divinity and destiny, and Xiala confronting her past, were compelling. However, Xiala’s journey back to Teek felt incomplete, especially regarding why she was the only Teek to retain her Song.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n   - The resolution felt rushed and anticlimactic. The war preparation took up 80% of the book, while the actual resolution was too quick and lacked the epic stakes I imagined.  \n   - Key players were dismissed in a sentence or two, and the final confrontation between Balam, Serapio, and Xiala felt underwhelming, almost like a blackout scene.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n   - I loved learning about the pre-Colombian mythology woven into the story. This aspect of the series was a highlight for me.  \n\n- **Overall Satisfaction:**  \n   - While I’m glad I read the series, I feel the ending needed more work. Perhaps the author needed one more book to fully realize the story she envisioned.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis finale had its moments, particularly in its exploration of mythology and the compelling arcs of Serapio and Xiala.

            "The story often felt aimless, merely setting the stage and hitting plot points without clear motivation. Bizarre shifts in the central conflicts undermined the climax, leaving me confused about the gods' true intentions. The prophecy seemed more like a plot outline for one character, with a lackluster execution and only a slightly more engaging payoff. Many intriguing subplots, such as dream-walking and Teek's arc, received almost no resolution, and previous threads were left dangling. The wandering POVs added little to the narrative and could have been eliminated without consequence. The plot relied heavily on contrived wish-fulfillment elements, and the use of tropes and twists often felt predictable and poorly executed. Additionally, the endings for certain characters came across as clichéd and out of place.",
            "The story suffers from a notable absence of consequences for several characters, both internally and externally. Major traumas are largely forgotten, and a character's status as a mass murderer does not detract from their likability. Additionally, some characters are relegated to mere romantic interests, lacking depth or motivation. In contrast, the transformations of Teek and Xiala are compelling and well-executed, leaving a lasting impact.",

While there are moments to love, the overall execution feels sprawling and chaotic compared to the tighter, more compelling narrative of the first book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book has shining moments that make it worth reading. I understand why others might love the series as a whole, but I personally found it frustrating and less satisfying than I had hoped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its merits and some standout moments, the inconsistent pacing, unresolved plotlines, and chaotic structure make it a frustrating read compared to the excellence of *Black Sun*.

            "I picked up this book primarily to discover the fates of the characters from the first two installments. I thoroughly enjoyed the first book, while the second and third were decent but not as compelling. The protagonists in this trilogy wield both earthly and magical powers, yet they confront equally formidable forces. The central theme explores how these characters choose to wield the powers they possess.",
            "It’s refreshing to see an epic fantasy author present point-of-view characters who are fundamentally decent, yet face circumstances that challenge their moral boundaries. This stands in stark contrast to the typical narratives featuring greedy, despicable characters who harm one another without consequence, or helpless individuals at the mercy of fate, unable to effect change."

        "conclusion": "While the third book didn’t quite live up to the first, it maintained a solid level of engagement and continued to explore compelling themes of power, morality, and choice. The work stands out for its focus on decent characters navigating complex, high-stakes situations.",

I really liked the first book, and while the second and third books were not bad, they were just all right.  \n\n- **Characterization and Moral Complexity:**  \n  It is refreshing when an epic fantasy author has their point-of-view characters be largely decent people put in circumstances that test what lines they're willing to cross. This is a welcome change from following greedy, awful characters doing bad things to each other because they can get away with it, or helpless characters pushed around by fate who lack the power to change anything.  \n\n- **Power Dynamics and Conflict:**  \n  All of Roanhorse's protagonists in this trilogy possess both earthly and magical power. However, they face equally powerful forces, and the central question revolves around what the protagonists choose to do with the powers they’ve been given or gained.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the third book didn’t quite live up to the first, it maintained a solid level of engagement and continued to explore compelling themes of power, morality, and choice. The series as a whole stands out for its focus on decent characters navigating complex, high-stakes situations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The narrative lacked the cohesion I expected, especially compared to the first book.\n\n- **Character Development and Relevance:**  \n  There were main POV characters whose storylines felt unnecessary or poorly resolved.

Their inclusion didn’t seem to add meaningful value to the overall story.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Installments:**  \n  The first book had a tight, well-structured narrative that I thoroughly enjoyed. However, the next two books felt like they veered off course, losing the focus and clarity that made the initial installment so compelling. It’s disappointing to see such a decline in storytelling quality.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile some readers may be satisfied with the series, I found the pacing, direction, and character arcs in the later books to be inconsistent and underwhelming.

The anticipated god-avatar rematch between Nara and Serapio never happens, and the narrative shifts to a less impactful dream-world battle with Balam.\n   - The Coyote Clan’s storyline, which had significant build-up, is abandoned without meaningful resolution.\n   - The final battles, which were heavily foreshadowed, occur off-page, leaving readers without the climactic payoff they expected.\n\n- **World-Building and Conflict:**\n   - The vibrant world and outstanding cast established in the first book are underutilized in the final installment. The potential for major, game-changing machinations among the clans is left unexplored.\n   - The naval battle and destruction of the city, which were set up as key events, are not depicted on-page, robbing the story of its dramatic impact.\n\n- **Writing and Narrative Choices:**\n   - The author’s decision to leave major conflicts and climaxes off-page or to the reader’s imagination is a significant misstep. This choice undermines the tension and resolution that the series had been building toward.\n   - The epilogue, reminiscent of *Harry Potter* and *Pirates of the Caribbean 3*, feels out of place and unsatisfying.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe *Between Earth and Sky* series starts strong with an original and riveting first book but falters in its second and third installments. The final book fails to deliver on the promises and build-up of the earlier novels, leaving major plotlines unresolved and key conflicts off-page. While the characters and world-building are initially compelling, the lack of meaningful payoff and rushed ending leave the reader frustrated and disappointed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- The review does not explicitly provide numerical ratings, but the tone suggests a significant drop in satisfaction from the first book to the final installment."

            "The book disappointingly fails to resolve key plot threads from its predecessors, particularly the much-anticipated confrontation between Naranpa and Serapio, which was meant to be a central conflict. Instead of delivering the promised war, the narrative spends 95% of its time building up to it, only for the conflict to never materialize. New plotlines are introduced and resolved abruptly, lacking emotional resonance, as seen with Teanni's death and the Teek storyline. The prophecy feels overly simplistic and lacks depth in its execution. The ending is underwhelming, leaving several questions unanswered, such as the fate of the Teek's song and the significance of Xiala's avatar. The twist revealing Balam as Serapio's father is predictable and adds little to the overall story. Additionally, the pacing suffers from excessive buildup with minimal payoff, and the inclusion of too many points of view disrupts the narrative flow. Flashback chapters feel unnecessary and contribute little to the plot.",
            "Xiala, Serapio, and Iktan remained strong and consistent characters throughout the story. However, Naranpa regressed to her book one persona, losing the growth she achieved in *Fevered Star*. Okoa's character stagnated, remaining confused and indecisive until his death, which lacked emotional weight. Balam's perspective was overused, rendering him a two-dimensional villain. The relationship between Naranpa and Iktan felt rushed and lacked believable chemistry. While Xiala and Serapio's reunion was satisfying, their ending came across as overly neat and cheesy.",
            "The book falls short in expanding the lore of the gods and fails to deliver the expected clash between the avatars of the Sun and Crow Gods. Additionally, the Teek storyline and Xiala's avatar feel underdeveloped and disconnected from the main plot."

            "In *Mirrored Heavens*, the pacing is the weakest in the trilogy. Excessive backstory, particularly the Balam flashback chapters, unnecessarily lengthen the narrative without adding new insights. Key plot developments, such as Iktan's departure from Hokaia and the killing of Golden Eagle, feel delayed and would have had greater impact if addressed in Book 2. The war, which should have been the central focus, was primarily set up in the previous installment, making this book feel repetitive. Additionally, the last-minute prophecy seems disconnected from the overall story and lacks relevance. Naranpa’s decision to unite the clans under Serapio is undermined by her act of burning Tova to the ground, which has no lasting consequences. The development of Naranpa and Serapio’s relationship, along with their resistance to their gods, is neglected due to Naranpa's absence from Tova. Lastly, the Teek storyline, while intriguing, remains unresolved, leaving questions about the loss of their Song and the future of their island unanswered.",

This issue was also present in the previous book, *Fevered Star*, where it was even more pronounced.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel suffers from unresolved plot threads, excessive and underutilized POVs, slow pacing, and an unrealistic central relationship. While the reunion of Serapio and Xiala provided some motivation to keep reading, their relationship and the overall execution of the story left me disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It felt appropriate considering everything else that happens.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n   - I found the first half of the book VERY slow and had a hard time moving through it. The second half, however, moved much faster and became very interesting, which redeemed the book for me.  \n\n- **Depth vs. Quantity of Ideas:**  \n   - I felt there were too many ideas thrown into this book. I wish the story had focused more on depth rather than the quantity of events.  \n\n- **Organic Storytelling:**  \n   - Some parts of the story felt too convenient. I don’t like when it’s obvious that the author decided to have X happen because it’ll be convenient for the plot later. I prefer the story to feel organic.  \n   - Naranpa’s storyline, in particular, felt forced.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues and a few overly convenient plot points, I still enjoyed *Mirrored Heavens* and would recommend it to fantasy fans looking for something unique.

While the teek lore and certain world-building elements were compelling, the book's bloated structure, unengaging characters, and lack of plot payoff made it a slog to get through. The author's focus on melodramatic character interactions over exploring the rich potential of the story's premise ultimately left me feeling let down.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "I struggled to engage with the book, largely because I had forgotten much of the plot from the first two installments. While familiar names surfaced, my lack of recollection made it frustrating to reconnect with the characters. Although the book provided some context about their identities and motivations, it failed to rekindle my emotional investment. Despite the abundance of action and numerous deaths, I found it difficult to care about the unfolding events. Much of the narrative felt disjointed and aimless, making the reading experience feel like a chore. The ending was particularly disappointing; after all the buildup, I anticipated an epic showdown, but instead, characters either lost their sanity or met untimely ends, leading to a resolution that felt unsatisfying. Ultimately, the lack of payoff for my reading effort was a significant letdown.",
            "I had fond memories of Serapio from previous books, but I struggled to recall the reasons for my attachment, which diminished my connection to him. While lovers reunited, I found myself unable to remember the basis of their affection, making their romance feel unconvincing. Ultimately, the most irritating POV character ended up saving the day, which was disappointing."

            "**Review of Serapio:**\n\nThe protagonist, Serapio, suffers from poor development; his actions come across as inconsistent and lack depth. He approaches the prophecy as a mere checklist, resorting to manipulation and murder, while his relationship with Xiala feels forced and unrealistic. Additionally, his survival after being stabbed in the heart seems like a convenient plot device.\n\nXiala, despite her significant journey, is also underdeveloped. Her emotional responses are shallow, and her infatuation with Serapio is cringeworthy. Her sudden mastery of the sound-into-sight theory and her rapid ascent to becoming the Teek queen feel contrived.\n\nOkoa is largely neglected by the author, resulting in a lack of reader engagement. Balam, the supposed main antagonist, is overshadowed by Saaya, and his paternity reveal fails to impact the plot or Serapio meaningfully.\n\nNaranpa had immense potential, but her magical abilities and dreamwalking training lead to a disappointing conclusion. Her ending feels lazy and unsatisfying. Iktan, while easy to write, is also underutilized, leaving much to be desired in character development."

This confusion might be due to reading it during the COVID period, which affected my focus and retention.\n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  The novel seems to rely heavily on the context of the series, particularly the second book, to make sense. Without revisiting the earlier installment, it’s challenging to follow the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I plan to keep this novel on my to-read list, I believe a re-read of the second book in the series is necessary to fully understand and appreciate the story.
