            "The book begins slowly as it introduces its complex narrative and characters, but it gains momentum rapidly in the second half.",
            "In this compelling narrative, the protagonist, Kenetria “Ken” Nash, grapples with dissociative identity disorder (DID), a condition stemming from severe childhood trauma. Her alters, or “headmates,” vary in age from four to 54 and encompass different genders, each possessing unique personalities and roles. The story is told through multiple perspectives, featuring inner dialogues and a collaborative journal that the headmates use to communicate. This intricate narrative is both overwhelming and captivating, as it delves into the complexities of multiple viewpoints within a single body, often with limited shared knowledge.",
            "Kudos to the author for creating a bold and intricate story. If you're ready for a challenge, I encourage you to dive in with an open mind. This trippy read is filled with shocking twists, reminiscent of an Agatha Christie locked-room mystery but with a gothic flair. My determination to push through made it worthwhile, and I'm glad I didn't give up.",
            "As a fan of thrillers, I found this one to be a mixed bag. Initially, I even questioned whether it was right for me. The dark, stormy atmosphere of a historic estate on a remote Hudson River island certainly enhances the creep factor, but it may not appeal to all readers.",
            "The author deserves high praise for crafting a uniquely structured novel in *One of Us Knows*. It's a refreshing departure from the repetitive thrillers I've encountered, which often evoke a sense of déjà vu. You won't find anything else quite like it."

        "conclusion": "*One of Us Knows* is a daring, unconventional thriller that pushes the boundaries of the genre. While it may not appeal to everyone, its originality, complex characters, and gripping narrative make it a standout read for those willing to embrace its challenges.",

As she grapples with her past, the enigma of her job, and her multiple personalities, the plot unfolds with unexpected twists and surprises. While some developments are predictable, there are also cleverly devised curveballs that hold up under scrutiny.",
            "In this compelling story, the protagonist Kenetria Nash navigates life with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Her distinct and believable personalities are not only integral to the narrative but also drive the plot forward through their interactions with each other and the world around them. Furthermore, Kenetria's identity as a Black woman, like that of the author, adds depth and authenticity to the story.",
            "The novel explores trauma, a common backdrop for individuals with DID, but the author avoids dwelling on cruelty. Instead, the narrative centers on the protagonist's journey and the mysteries she uncovers. With an engaging and immersive tone, the story is a joy to read.",
            "This novel diverges from a conventional thriller or mystery, presenting instead a well-researched and engaging narrative.

It blurs genre lines, leaning closer to contemporary gothic (set in a castle) while straddling the thriller genre. This is the author’s second consecutive book to challenge traditional genre boundaries, and I’m eager to see what she does next.\n\n- **Protagonist and Characterization:**  \n  The protagonist, Kenetria Nash, has Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), and her various personalities are distinct, believable, and integral to the storytelling. Their interactions with each other and the outside world drive the narrative as much as the plot itself. The fact that the protagonist, like the author, is Black and female adds depth and authenticity to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is quick and intense, with Kenetria (through her personality Ken) waking up to find herself in a mysterious caretaker job. As she navigates her past, the mysteries of her job, and her other personalities, the plot unfolds with twists and surprises. While some twists are expected, there are also well-crafted curveballs that stand up to scrutiny.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The novel touches on trauma, a common background for individuals with DID, but the author doesn’t dwell on cruelty. Instead, the focus is on the protagonist’s journey and the mysteries she unravels. The tone is engaging and immersive, making it a blast to read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a highly enjoyable and thought-provoking novel that challenges genre conventions and delivers a compelling story with a well-crafted protagonist. Despite its potential to be underrated due to its complexity, it deserves a high rating for its originality, depth, and execution.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI’d rate this a 4.5, but I’m rounding up to 5 to counterbalance the tendency of genre-challenging books to receive lower ratings on platforms like Goodreads."

The mystery surrounding the castle and its ties to Ken's inner world propel the narrative and captivate readers. It’s wonderfully “cray-cray,” filled with twists and turns that make it nearly impossible to set the book down.",

Della serves as a nurturing grandmother figure, Ken is fiercely protective, and Empress embodies a teenager passionate about anime and video games.

However, this story worked for me because the protagonist’s condition is established from the start, and it’s not used to portray her as broken, dangerous, or lesser. The twists and thrills don’t rely on stigmatizing her illness. That said, I’m not OwnVoices and hope those with lived experience can speak to the accuracy and quality of the portrayal.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book is intentionally challenging, with a multi-POV structure due to the protagonist’s multiple identities. While I found this aspect manageable as a fan of SFF, readers of contemporary thrillers might struggle with it. The author’s craft has improved since her previous work, making this story more believable despite its over-the-top elements. The book is marketed as a thriller but could easily be classified as horror.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Each POV character has a distinct voice, making them easy to differentiate. There was only one instance where I had to double-check who was speaking. I loved the relationship dynamics and how the characters interacted with each other. Empress was my favorite, and I wish she had more screen time. I’m also curious about Souta and his goblin wife—hopefully, the author will explore their story further.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel explores themes of race, class, privilege, and systemic injustice, similar to the author’s previous work, *When No One is Watching*. It also pays homage to horror classics like *Get Out* and *And Then There Were None*, while feeling fresh and original. There’s a moment around 80 pages in that completely caught me off guard and hooked me, which is rare for a thriller.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book delivered exactly what it promised: a thrilling, thought-provoking read. The handling of mental illness, distinct character voices, and exploration of social themes made it stand out. While the multi-POV structure might challenge some readers, it added depth to the story.

            "While the slower pacing in the first half was a minor concern, the character study remained deeply compelling. The author skillfully limits our knowledge to what Ken and a few select headmates possess, which immerses us in the growing urgency, fear, and frustration of the scenario, especially in the second half. The conclusion was satisfying, resonating with my expectations without resorting to gratuitous gore.",
            "This is the first time I’ve encountered a story where the protagonist has dissociative identity disorder (DID) from the outset, without it being a plot twist or tied to villainy. The audiobook narration effectively brings each headmate to life, with distinct tones and styles that make the characters feel unique, while the transitions between them are seamless. I appreciated that we know from the beginning that one headmate is withholding information, reflecting the memory loss and lack of control that Ken, the primary POV character, experiences upon waking.",
            "This thriller perfectly aligns with my tastes—character-driven, rich in nuanced social commentary, and infused with a slow-building tension. The gothic atmosphere, featuring a haunted island castle that resonates both internally and externally, enhances the narrative's intrigue. Its exploration of class, power, and trauma elevates the story beyond mere thrills, making it a compelling read."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a masterfully crafted thriller that combines character-driven storytelling, nuanced social commentary, and a gothic atmosphere to explore themes of class, power, and trauma. The representation of DID as a central element of the protagonist's identity is handled with care and originality. While the pacing in the first half is slower, it serves as a compelling character study, and the tension builds beautifully in the second half.

If this summary doesn’t immediately intrigue you, the book might not be for you.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Character Complexity:**  \n  The protagonist’s DID is central to the story, with almost all of her eight headmates narrating at various points and taking turns \"fronting\" or controlling her body. The author provides a key at the beginning listing the headmates, which I found helpful initially but didn’t need after the halfway mark. However, if keeping track of multiple characters is challenging for you, this might not be the right book.  \n\n- **Contemporary Realism (Covid References):**  \n  The story is set in December 2022, and the author includes references to Covid. Some readers found this detail bothersome, but I appreciated the realism. Different headmates had varying perspectives on Covid, reflecting societal diversity. If this level of realism upsets you, you might want to skip this book.  \n\n- **Content Warnings and Sensitivity:**  \n  The book includes a Content Warning for depictions of physical violence, self-harm, ableism, racism, and sexual assault. While these topics are serious and could be upsetting, I found them handled appropriately—integral to the story without being gratuitous or overly graphic.  \n\n- **Paranormal and Gothic Elements:**  \n  Paranormal elements usually deter me, but in this book, they were presented straightforwardly. The gothic details were clear and concise, with the plot moving forward without lingering excessively on the horror.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I loved this book so much that I’m adding the author’s other work, *When No One Is Watching*, to my to-be-read list. It’s a gripping read that balances complex characters, contemporary realism, and gothic horror effectively.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a compelling blend of psychological complexity, contemporary realism, and gothic horror.

While every system functions differently, there were many similarities between how the Bad Day System operates and how my own system does. The concept of \"mapping\" (figuring out the origins of alters and the system) was particularly relatable and well-portrayed through the reliving of a traumatic event.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The mystery was well-paced, keeping me intrigued and eager to learn more. I enjoyed figuring out the identities of the new characters and appreciated the tension and buildup throughout the story. While I had a sense of where the plot was heading, there were still pleasant surprises that kept me engaged until the end.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was snarky, witty, and often made me laugh out loud, even amidst the tense drama. The humor added a layer of enjoyment to the story and made the characters feel more dynamic and relatable.  \n\n- **Criticism of Negative Reviews:**  \n  I noticed some low ratings for the book, which seemed to stem from unfamiliar terminology or the use of multiple pronouns. I found these criticisms unfair, as unfamiliar concepts can easily be researched, and pronouns are a fundamental part of language. These issues shouldn’t detract from the story itself, which is well-crafted and engaging.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Reflection:**  \n  I deeply appreciated seeing a DID system that functions similarly to my own and felt a strong connection to the characters. It was refreshing to see people I know reflected in the story, and I would love to read more books like this.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It offered a relatable and nuanced portrayal of DID, a well-paced and intriguing plot, and a witty writing style that balanced humor with drama. I look forward to reading more from this author and hope to see more stories that reflect my own experiences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story delves into the dynamics of the system, showing their collective struggles and strengths.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters in the Bad Day System are not just side characters; they are unique and integral to the story. Each member—Solomon, Empress, Mesmer, Keke, Lurk, Della, and Rapunzel—brings their own flaws and strengths, which contribute to their collective survival and deepen their bond. Ken’s journey of acclimating to life after being dormant for six years is particularly compelling.\n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  My biggest issue with the book is that it takes a long time to get to the murder mystery aspect. Most of the story focuses on the Bad Day System, their past and current struggles, and the chaos within their minds as external circumstances worsen.

The story gives off a gothic Agatha Christie vibe, and I absolutely loved it.  \n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n  The protagonist, Ken, is part of a DID (dissociative identity disorder) system, and the story handles this representation beautifully. DID isn’t used as a plot twist but is woven into the narrative from the beginning, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is layered and fast-paced, with plenty of chaos and intrigue. Ken fronts for the first time in six years, only to discover she’s been evicted and is standing on a dock with a cryptic message: “new job starts today.” The job involves caretaking a property on a secluded island, and nothing is as it seems.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The secluded island and the castle, which is an exact replica of the one in Ken’s inner world, create a haunting and immersive atmosphere.  \n\n- **Complexity and Clarity:**  \n  Despite the many layers and characters, the story is easy to follow and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a gripping, fast-paced thriller with excellent representation of DID and a gothic, mysterious atmosphere. I rounded my rating up to 5 stars due to the unfair hate raid of 1-star reviews. I’m excited to see what Alyssa Cole does next!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (rounded up to 5)."

            "Many readers have mentioned that the book has a slow start, with murders occurring only in the final third. My enjoyment of the story largely depended on my connection with Ken and her headmates.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and their unique personalities, especially the clever nerdy references to the isekai genre and fandom—something I always appreciate in the author’s romances. The book thoughtfully explores themes of marginalization, examining who is considered undesirable, mad, or disabled, and how these individuals are intentionally targeted. It also tackles issues of race, gender, and societal inaction during COVID, which I found particularly thought-provoking.",

In contrast, *One of Us Knows* addresses the marginalized and those left to suffer, particularly in the context of COVID, a subject that I don’t think the U.S. is culturally prepared to confront.",

However, I acknowledge that my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  Other readers have noted that the book has a slow start, and the murders don’t begin until the last third of the story. My enjoyment of the book largely depended on how much I connected with Ken and her headmates.  \n\n- **Characterization and Themes:**  \n  I really enjoyed the characters, their distinct personalities, and their interests, particularly the nerdy references to the isekai genre and fandom—something I also appreciate in Cole’s romances. The book delves into themes of marginalization, exploring who is deemed undesirable, mad, or disabled, and how these individuals are deliberately targeted. It also addresses race, gender, and the societal inaction around COVID, which I found thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Cultural and Social Relevance:**  \n  I believe *When No One Is Watching* was more widely accepted because its antagonist—gentrification of historically Black neighborhoods by white people—is something the U.S. is more willing to acknowledge, even if only superficially. In contrast, *One of Us Knows* tackles who is marginalized and left to die, particularly in the context of COVID, a topic I don’t think the U.S. is culturally ready to confront.  \n\n- **Representation of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder):**  \n  DID is not fantasy or sci-fi, but as a reader of speculative fiction (where plurality is often a subtext, such as in December Seas’ work on werewolves), I found it easier to understand. I think many readers struggle to imagine the experience of having headmates, which might account for some of the negative reviews. While I’m not a mystery/thriller reader, I don’t see the genre as one that typically encourages readers to stretch their imagination of what is possible.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its slow start and the delayed introduction of the murders, I thoroughly enjoyed *One of Us Knows* for its rich characterization, nerdy references, and exploration of marginalization. However, I recognize that its themes and representation of DID may not resonate with all readers, especially those unfamiliar with or unwilling to engage with such experiences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars, but rounded up to 5."

She clearly did her research and took the necessary steps to ensure it was a good representation. The confusion I felt at the beginning with all the headmates (alters) mirrored the experience of the main character, Ken, and her known headmates. This confusion is part of the DID experience, as people with DID often deal with time gaps in memory and may not always know everyone in their system. Once I picked up on their different traits and Cole’s writing style, it became easier to follow.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was highly entertaining and kept me guessing. While I could predict most twists by the time they were revealed, it still took me a while to pick up on some of them. Despite this, I really enjoyed the twists and felt the story was pretty believable, even though it’s wild and intense. The pacing was well-done, maintaining my interest throughout.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was very satisfying to me.

I’m pleased to say this book avoids that entirely. Cole does an excellent job of portraying Kenetria’s inner world, which is populated by various headmates, each with distinct roles such as protector, gatekeeper, and host. The care and detail in describing this inner world are commendable and add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Storytelling and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel is a solid suspense story with a spooky, gothic atmosphere that kept me thoroughly engaged.

            "The story masterfully weaves together two captivating narratives: one set on an island where individuals are mysteriously killed, echoing Agatha Christie's *And Then There Were None*, and another centered on a traumatized woman grappling with dissociative identity disorder, reminiscent of *Shattered Island*, *Split*, *Minds of Billy Milligan*, and *Sybil*. Both threads are skillfully crafted, drawing me in and keeping me on the edge of my seat. The unexpected arrival of the house's conversational trust, the shocking death of a character, and Kenetria's emergence as a prime suspect intensify the suspense. The urgent quest to identify the true culprit before she becomes the next victim propels the narrative forward.",
            "The characters are vividly brought to life through their unique voices: Solomon's rational and controlling demeanor, the Empress's quirky nature, Della's sense of responsibility, Mesmer's confidence, Keke's innocent charm, Lurk's confusion, Rapunzel's wild spirit, and Kenetria's self-deprecating humor. The imaginative depiction of the castle and the concept of each character as headmates effectively immerses readers in a fantastical realm.",
            "This novel is a quirky and eerie blend of intelligence and creativity, infused with a uniquely sarcastic tone. The inner dialogues of its multiple dissociative characters are both overwhelming and surprisingly humorous, creating a refreshingly original experience that feels like a bizarre theatrical performance.",
            "The isolated island on the Hudson River and its historic home evoke an eerie and suspenseful atmosphere. The house's resemblance to the one Kenetria envisioned for her personas deepens the mystery, further heightened by the boatman and caretaker's ominous warnings about the house's secrets and curse.",
            "The novel delves into themes of trauma, identity, and survival as Kenetria confronts her dark past. To shield herself from external threats, she must unite her fragmented identities. The narrative thoughtfully explores the origins of her dissociative identity disorder and the construction of her mental castle."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The second thriller by this author is a masterfully executed psychological thriller that combines a unique writing style, compelling characters, and an immersive plot. It is even more captivating than her previous work and is highly recommended for fans of psychological thrillers with a creative twist.",

The portrayal of the castle and the positioning of each identity as \"headmates\" are brilliant inventions that transport readers into a fantastical realm.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The isolated island on the Hudson River and the historic home create an eerie and suspenseful atmosphere. The house's resemblance to the one Kenetria imagined for her personas adds to the mystery, as do the warnings from the boatman and caretaker about the house's secrets and curse.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel explores themes of trauma, identity, and survival.

At first, I found this concept distracting because it was so new to me. I’m unsure if this is the same as “multiple personality disorder” or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), but it seems very similar. Ken, the main character, has these personalities who can talk to each other and take turns controlling the shared body. This disorder creates unusual plot problems, like one personality doing something the others are unaware of, leading to situations where Ken wakes up in strange places with no memory of how she got there.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The first half of the book was mostly about me getting used to Ken’s unique situation and her adjusting to life on an isolated island as a caretaker of a castle—a job one of her other personalities applied for without her knowledge. There were hints of creepy things to come, and the story really took off later. Once a certain term was used, I immediately guessed what was going to happen, and I was correct. It reminded me of a popular, dark short story I read in high school, though this book offers a new twist on that old tale. The latter part of the book is filled with action and scary moments.\n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The story is well-written, and even though I could guess the twist, I still enjoyed it. I think if someone hasn’t read the old story I mentioned, they might not be able to predict the outcome as easily.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Ken’s life is portrayed as very difficult, with her constantly dealing with fears and anxiety. The way her personalities interact and the challenges they create for her make her a compelling and sympathetic character.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book to be an engaging and well-written story with a unique concept. While I could predict the twist due to my familiarity with a similar tale, I still enjoyed the fresh take and the suspenseful, action-packed second half.

The narrative creatively employs Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), elevating the novel beyond a conventional thriller and offering a profound exploration of identity and resilience.

Her life takes a dramatic turn when she becomes the caretaker of a secluded estate on the Hudson River. Ken's seven active alters each contribute unique perspectives and skills, enriching the story and offering a multifaceted view of the unfolding events. The portrayal of DID is both sensitive and innovative, reflecting thorough research that ensures an accurate and respectful depiction of the disorder. The alters are essential to the narrative, adding depth to both the mystery and Ken's internal struggles.",

I didn’t even need to know what it was about—I was automatically excited to read it.  \n\n- **Representation of Mental Health (DID):**  \n  As a licensed mental health professional specializing in trauma and complex trauma, I was both intrigued and wary about the portrayal of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) in this book. DID is incredibly rare, and I’ve often found books misinformed or stigmatizing when it comes to mental health. However, Cole’s approach to DID was unique, well-researched, and captivating. It didn’t feel gimmicky or manipulative, which is often the case when mental health is a significant feature in stories.  \n\n- **Character Development and Narrative Style:**  \n  The “headmates” (alternate identities) were distinct and well-developed, each with their own voice and role in the story. This made it easy to immerse myself in the mysterious atmosphere and want to learn more. The narrative was delicately crafted, with groundwork laid for the escalation into chaos, though it took nearly 70% of the book to dive into the mystery elements. However, I was so engrossed in the characters that I didn’t mind the pacing.  \n\n- **Plot and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story’s mysterious and creepy island setting added to its allure. The gradual buildup of tension and the eventual escalation into chaos were masterfully done. I was so invested in the characters and their dynamics that I didn’t feel the need for the mystery to unfold sooner, though I might reconsider this on a second read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAlyssa Cole’s thriller is a unique and well-researched exploration of DID, with compelling characters and a captivating narrative. While the mystery elements take time to unfold, the groundwork and character development make the wait worthwhile.

I appreciated how each alter has a unique personality and how their dynamics evolve—or sometimes clash—as the story progresses.\n\n- **Unique Concept and Setting:**  \n  I found the concept of the main character having Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and telling the story through her different personas to be fascinating. The idea of a castle in her mind where the alters reside added a creative layer to the narrative. The setting of an isolated island with a historic house, combined with the warning not to spend a night there alone, elevated the story’s tension. The plot twist involving a murder and Ken being the prime suspect added an exciting and suspenseful dimension.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the initial challenges in connecting with the story, the book ultimately proved to be a compelling and unique read. The exploration of DID, the dual storylines, and the atmospheric setting made it a thought-provoking and engaging experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The balance between the protagonist’s internal thoughts and external reality felt skewed, with too much time spent in her head.

While I usually enjoy a bit of attitude, in this case, it felt excessive and hindered my ability to sympathize with her. This didn’t stop me from finishing the book, but it did affect my emotional connection to her.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  This book is well-suited for readers interested in learning about DID or those who enjoy a slower, more gradual buildup in their stories. However, it may not appeal to those who prefer faster-paced narratives or more likable protagonists.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was an educational and thought-provoking read, particularly for its exploration of DID.

Keke was my favorite personality; I could follow along well with her, and she brought an emotional pull to the story.  \n\n- **Subject Matter and Depth:**  \n  I found the DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) focal point so interesting, but it felt like you had to be well-versed in the subject or research it on the side while reading the book.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Future Interest:**  \n  I would not recommend this book, but I may give Alyssa another chance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and a strong start with its character list, the chaotic switching between worlds and the unsatisfying twist left me confused and disappointed.

Her previous book, *When No One is Watching*, was a hit, so I was highly excited for this release.\n\n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  *One of Us Knows* has a great premise, but the imaginative details make the story completely unbelievable. The idea of a protagonist with dissociative identity disorder (DID) combined with a virtual system implanted in her head, where personalities are created rather than born, is overly complex and poorly executed.\n\n- **Execution of the Concept:**  \n  The concept of the virtual system and the personalities within it was confusing and not well-integrated into the story. The idea of personalities dating each other inside the system and the manifestation of a castle from a childhood memory added to the confusion. The story felt like it was building too much without providing clarity, leaving me with more questions than enjoyment.\n\n- **Setting and Context:**  \n  The inclusion of Covid in the story felt unnecessary, though I understand it was likely part of the narrative development for years. This aspect didn’t add much to the overall experience.\n\n- **Characterization and Dialogue:**  \n  The characters, particularly John’s sinister nature and Celeste’s bold personality, were well-developed and served the story effectively. The dialogue was clear and engaging, with moments that made me laugh.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The murder mystery portion of the story was intriguing, but the pacing suffered due to the overwhelming complexity of the DID system and virtual world. The story built up too much, leading to a sense of being lost in a rabbit hole rather than enjoying a cohesive narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *One of Us Knows* has an intriguing premise and strong characters, the overly imaginative and confusing execution of the DID system and virtual world detracted from the overall enjoyment. The murder mystery was engaging, but the story’s complexity and pacing issues made it difficult to fully appreciate.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the execution often felt choppy and confusing, making it challenging to follow. While this disjointedness may have been intended to reflect the DID perspective, it ultimately detracted from my enjoyment. Furthermore, the portrayal of the inner world felt overly fantastical, obscuring the story's core message until near the end."

However, the execution felt choppy and confusing, making it hard to follow at times. While the choppiness might have been intentional to reflect the DID perspective, it detracted from my overall enjoyment. Additionally, the inclusion of the inner world felt too fantastical and made it difficult to grasp the story’s point until near the end.  \n\n- **Character Development and Likability:**  \n  I loved the exploration of the different identities and their roles within the main host. However, I found it hard to care about any of the other personalities. They lacked likable qualities and depth, which made their switching feel almost irrelevant despite their significance to the story. This lack of connection to the characters made the book harder to enjoy.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  The novel is more of a slow burn, with a lot of character building and minimal action until the end. While I appreciated the resolution and finally understanding the trauma that created the multiple identities, the pacing felt uneven. The epilogue, in particular, left me confused and unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Personal Triggers and Irrelevant Elements:**  \n  The constant references to COVID and mask-wearing were unnecessary and distracting. They played no role in the story and served as a trigger for me, given my personal experiences working in a COVID ICU. I read books as an escape, and these reminders disrupted that experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *One Of Us Knows* has an intriguing concept and a satisfying resolution, its execution, character likability, and pacing issues hindered my enjoyment. The unnecessary COVID references further detracted from the story. Despite these flaws, I think many readers will still appreciate this novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5/5 Stars ⭐️⭐️✨"

I also wished the different personalities of the main character had interacted more with the plot itself.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  Despite the shortcomings, I will keep an eye out for what Alyssa Cole writes in the future, especially within the mystery/thriller genre. I enjoy her writing and believe the story that truly works for me is on its way!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s premise and character development were strong, the mystery fell short, and the plot could have better integrated the main character’s personalities. Nonetheless, I remain optimistic about the author’s future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The narrative would have benefited from an earlier murder, allowing for more investigation and character development.

Definitely 4-5 stars for both books in terms of creative takes on old tropes.\n\n- **Execution and Clarity:**  \n  My issue with this one was the execution. The book was unnecessarily hard to keep track of. The narration switched locations and characters too much without much effort to make it clear to the reader. However, the audiobook narrator did a fantastic job of trying to clarify who was talking when, and I enjoyed their performance.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  There was a lot of virtue signaling, which has become my biggest pet peeve in books lately. While I acknowledge the importance of the topics and social issues woven into the book (e.g., Covid needing to be taken seriously), some felt inconsequential to the story or were repeated so often they lost their impact. In *When No One is Watching*, Cole included important topics like racism seamlessly and meaningfully, but in *One of Us Knows*, some themes felt forced or excessive.\n\n- **Repetition and Relevance:**  \n  The excessive descriptions of the right and wrong way to live through Covid bugged me. While some of it set the scene for the time period or built character for one of the “headmates” with OCD or OCPD tendencies, it came up so frequently it lost its meaning. I felt the repetition was a device to display righteousness, which might alienate readers who don’t already share the same views.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated Cole’s creativity and the narrator’s performance in the audiobook, the execution of this novel fell short for me.

Although important themes were included, their repetition and lack of seamless integration made them feel less meaningful compared to Cole’s previous work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4-5 stars for creativity and tropes, but lower for execution and thematic integration."

However, if you’re looking for something unconventional and different, this might still be worth exploring.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the story occasionally dragged, making it difficult to stay fully engaged. I found myself skimming certain sections to reach the explanations and the big reveal. Telling the story solely from the perspective of Kenetria (Ken), who has Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), was a compelling choice. The author skillfully immersed me in Ken’s inner world, allowing me to experience her reality. The revelation regarding why Ken was hired as the caretaker for the isolated Hudson River island, along with the true nature of the events there, was horrifying. Yet, I wasn’t particularly surprised by the big reveal, and it didn’t drive me to the final chapter with the same intensity as the author’s previous work.

I also wish there was more exploration of Empress and Mesmer.  \n\n- **Major Takeaway:**  \n  - I was deeply impressed by the author’s sensitivity and extensive knowledge of dissociative identity disorder (DID).

By the end, I felt like I needed to reread it to fully comprehend everything, but I didn’t enjoy it enough to justify a second read.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  I loved the setting—a creepy gothic castle on a dangerous island with a disturbing history. The atmosphere was well-crafted and added to the overall sense of unease and intrigue.\n\n- **Violence and Gore:**  \n  The novel gets very violent and gory, particularly during the intense final act. While this added to the thriller aspect, it might not be for everyone.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  While I struggled to keep up with the complexities and didn’t enjoy it enough to reread, I acknowledge that others might appreciate it more. My low rating is likely more reflective of my personal experience than the book’s quality.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers a compelling setting and a thrilling, fast-paced finale, but its complex plot and graphic violence made it challenging for me to fully enjoy. While I wouldn’t revisit it, I believe it could resonate more with other readers.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐ (rounded down)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character, Kenetria Nash, and her alters are portrayed with fascinating complexity. Each alter is distinct and well-crafted, making the character dynamics unique and engaging. I had to take a picture at the beginning of the book to keep track of all the alters, but this added to the intrigue and depth of the story.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The plot revolves around Kenetria and her alters being appointed as the resident caretaker of a historic home on an isolated Hudson River island. The island itself exudes a creepy and mysterious atmosphere, which kept me on edge throughout the story. The narrative is intricate, with many moving parts that require close attention, but this complexity made the book stand out.\n\n- **Originality:**  \n  The concept of a protagonist with dissociative identity disorder navigating such a unique and eerie setting is highly original. I have never read a book like this before, and the author’s ability to capture the nuances of the disorder while weaving a suspenseful plot is commendable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating and original read, thanks to its complex characters, eerie setting, and intricate plot. The portrayal of dissociative identity disorder is both fascinating and well-executed, making the story stand out in a way I’ve never experienced before.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I was pretty intrigued by this and found it engaging.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The story kept me hooked, and the final twist was a fun little finale I didn't see coming until near the end.

While the message was clear, it felt somewhat overdone.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  Having Ken end up with Solomon felt...weird. It’s good for her, but it just felt strange to me. I can live with it, but it left me with mixed feelings.  \n\n- **Representation and Authenticity:**  \n  I’d like to hear from anyone with DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) about how they relate to this portrayal or their general experience with the condition. It would be interesting to see how authentic the representation feels to those who live with it.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its quirks, I did enjoy the book.

I was excited about this concept and wanted to love the book because of it.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Clarity:**  \n  I found the story somewhat hard to follow due to the frequent jumping between each character's point of view. This made it challenging to keep track of the storyline, and I’m not entirely sure I fully understood everything that happened.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relevance:**  \n  Some of the character perspectives in the first half of the book felt unnecessary, such as the whole anime obsession. I think those pages could have been better utilized to build out the \"outer\" world and provide more context or depth to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  Despite the confusion, the book was an easy read with lots of twists and turns, which would appeal to readers who enjoy unexpected and unpredictable stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and was engaging with its twists, the narrative structure and some unnecessary character perspectives made it difficult to follow. It’s a good choice for readers who enjoy complex, unexpected stories, but it left me unsure if I fully grasped the entire storyline.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Initially, I thought I had become well-acquainted with the characters and the plot, but the introduction of twists involving an island disrupted the flow. Things became messy, leaving me more baffled and confused than before.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The premise was interesting, but Alyssa Cole didn’t explain any part of it well. The story felt overly ambitious, as if she tried to do too much, and as a result, nothing stood out.\n\n- **Reader Experience:**  \n  I can’t say I enjoyed the book. My only goal was to finish it and find out how it was going to end. The confusion and lack of clarity made it a challenging read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *One of Us Knows* had an intriguing premise, its execution fell short due to excessive ambition and poor explanation. The twists added confusion rather than depth, making it a struggle to stay engaged.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

The concept of headmates in a creepy castle is fascinating and provides a unique perspective.  \n- **Plot Development:**  \n  I started figuring out what was going on about midway through the story. The connection between dissociation and trauma became clear, adding depth to the narrative.  \n- **Ending/Epilogue:**  \n  The epilogue felt a bit too strange for my taste, which slightly detracted from my overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers a compelling and unique perspective on MPD, with intriguing characters and a well-developed plot. However, the epilogue felt somewhat out of place and was less satisfying compared to the rest of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nBook #115 in 2024."

I’m not entirely sure if this was due to my lack of knowledge about DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) or how the book was written. I had to look at a few reviews to understand if I was missing something.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  Alyssa Cole did a great job creating a sense of foreboding and eeriness throughout the novel. This was one of the strongest aspects of the book for me.  \n\n- **Character Likability:**  \n  I did not find the characters very likeable, which made it harder to connect with them emotionally.  \n\n- **Setting and Character Dynamics:**  \n  I loved the setting and the interactions between Ken and her alters. The way their communications were portrayed was intriguing and well-executed.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  Despite some confusion and the lack of likeable characters, I recommend this book for its unique atmosphere and exploration of DID. It’s worth checking out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had some questions about the plot and didn’t connect with the characters, the novel’s eerie tone, compelling setting, and exploration of DID made it an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It wasn’t until around page 260 that I finally felt interested in the story. Even then, I’m not sure I fully understood what happened.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters, who have Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), were not developed enough for me to grasp who was who or why each character acted the way they did. The members of the Bad Day System felt underdeveloped, which made it hard to connect with them or understand their roles in the story.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The lead-up to the thriller part of the story was boring and lacked the necessary buildup to make the eventual payoff satisfying.  \n\n- **Author’s Other Works:**  \n  I haven’t read any of Alyssa Cole’s other books yet, but several are on my TBR list. After this experience, I think I’ll be bumping them further down my list.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a letdown due to its slow pacing, confusing plot, and underdeveloped characters. While I appreciated the representation of DID, the execution fell short, making it difficult to stay engaged or fully understand the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Furthermore, the idea of one personality engaging romantically with another raises questions about the dynamics involved.

It also delves deeply into the complexities of DID, which I found both intriguing and educational, given my limited knowledge of the disorder.  \n\n- **Portrayal of DID:**  \n  The author does a commendable job of capturing the nuances of DID, though I felt the book struggled to convey the dynamic nature of the disorder as effectively as a visual medium like the *Doom Patrol* show does. Each escape into the protagonist’s Inner World felt like it halted the main story, making it harder to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The main story took a while to kick in, and when it did, it felt rushed and overly convenient. Many of the characters outside of Ken and her headmates came across as cartoonishly evil, which detracted from the realism and depth of the narrative.  \n\n- **Twists and Pacing:**  \n  The story took an unexpected and jarring turn into a bizarre sex slave scenario, which felt out of place and poorly foreshadowed. Additionally, the coincidental connection between Lottie and Celeste, both of whom have DID, stretched believability.  \n\n- **Author’s Sensitivity:**  \n  I appreciated the author’s sensitive and thoughtful portrayal of DID, a disorder often misunderstood or demonized. However, I wish the thriller elements had been more developed and integrated into the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel shines in its exploration of DID and its handling of important social issues, it falls short in delivering a cohesive and engaging thriller.

The idea of an alter being in a relationship with the original personality was strange.

Her style just doesn't work for me, although her books REALLY pull me in.  \n  - I'm glad this author works for some people, because I appreciate her presence in a mostly-white-women genre (think Ruth Ware, Lucy Foley, Shari Lapena, etc.), but her books have yet to deliver on their hooky premises for me.  \n\n- **Premise and Setup:**  \n  - The setup was pretty cool with the dual creepy castles.  \n  - I also didn't read the back too closely and didn't realize the main character had DID—that one was on me, but I may have passed on this book if I had known that, too.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I thought each of the alters was super well-defined, and each character was fairly interesting.  \n\n- **Narration:**  \n  - The narrator did a good job as well.  \n  - I wish I had the physical copy to look back at the intro while I was reading.  \n\n- **Pacing and Genre Elements:**  \n  - The pacing wasn't as bad as her first thriller (though there still was some pacing issues).  \n  - The weird genre twist wasn't my fave—so ghosts were real too?? IDK.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the author's unique presence in the thriller genre and found the setup and character development intriguing, her writing style and pacing issues, along with the unexpected genre twist, didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story picked up more toward the end, which intrigued me, but it wasn’t enough to salvage my overall experience.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  While I wouldn’t personally recommend this particular book, I’d still be open to trying some of the author’s other works in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its intriguing premise and strong themes, the book’s confusing narrative structure, uneven pacing, and excessive detail made it a disappointing read for me.

The title and cover were captivating, and the synopsis made me eager to dive into the story. I had high hopes for a unique and engaging read, especially since it featured a character with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), which I had never encountered in a book before.\n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  The book did not meet my expectations. While I was initially excited, I found it difficult to stay engaged. There were moments when I put the book down and hesitated to pick it back up. However, my curiosity about the plot kept me going, even though it felt like a struggle to finish.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  Despite my initial enthusiasm, I was ultimately disappointed with the book. I really wanted to love it, but it fell flat for me. The story didn’t resonate as deeply as I had hoped, and I was left feeling unsatisfied by the end.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and a unique focus on a DID character, it failed to deliver a compelling reading experience. My high expectations were not met, and I finished the book feeling disappointed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The introduction of Ken, a woman with DID who has been dormant for 6 years, and her headmates (all with unique voices and distinct character traits) was compelling. The setting of an old, mysterious castle with cool lore on a basically abandoned island was well-established. Ken suddenly fronting and heading to a new job at the castle, set up by her now missing headmate Della, added to the intrigue. There was also some intriguing social commentary at the beginning.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ken’s character development was a significant letdown. The inner-relationships of the DID system were not explored in a satisfying way.\n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  The dialogue was cringy and unrealistic, which detracted from the overall experience.\n\n- **Villains:**  \n  The villains were portrayed as cartoon-y, lacking depth and nuance.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot barely happened until the end, with predictable twists and excessive convolution.

However, I found the “mystery” element to be underwhelming, as it only became prominent towards the end of the book. This made the pacing feel uneven, and I was often confused about what was happening, especially since I went into the story without much context.\n\n- **Clarity and Structure:**  \n  Going into the story blind, I was frequently confused about the events and the relationships between the characters.

It seemed like the author combined elements from movies like *Ready or Not* and *Split* without understanding the condition. Most people with DID don’t name their “systems” something quirky, and it was unrealistic that both main characters had this rare condition. The idea of headmates having different heights made no sense, and the inclusion of random self-cest was off-putting.  \n\n- **Political Statements:**  \n  The book included long-winded political statements that felt forced and irrelevant to the plot. They seemed inserted solely to make the book appear quote-worthy but added no value to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Coherence and Logic:**  \n  The plot didn’t make sense.

The latter half of the story began to sound like a dumbed-down version of *A Dangerous Game*.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID):**  \n  As someone who studied psychology, I found the portrayal of DID unrealistic. The way it was used as a literary device for Ken and her alters didn’t ring true. Writing and developing a character with DID is challenging, and unfortunately, the author didn’t succeed in this aspect.  \n\n- **Character Development and Likability:**  \n  I didn’t like Ken or any of her alters. Additionally, Landon, his father, and their group were despicable and unmemorable.  \n\n- **Plot and Suspense:**  \n  The mystery lacked suspense and thrill, feeling more like a subplot to the internal drama in Ken’s head. The story didn’t deliver the gripping experience I had hoped for.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  The movie *The Hunt* handled a similar concept much better, making this novel feel underwhelming in comparison.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I was intrigued by the premise and wanted to like the book, the confusing narrative, unrealistic portrayal of DID, unlikable characters, and lack of suspense made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The constant shifting between characters without clear delineation disrupted the flow, ultimately leading me to abandon the book before reaching the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the intriguing premise of a woman with multiple personalities, the novel’s narrative structure and lack of clarity made it difficult to follow and enjoy. I couldn’t finish the book, though I acknowledge the story likely had merit.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
