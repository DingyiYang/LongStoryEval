The pacing is excellent, keeping readers engaged and eager to turn the pages. The balance between emotional depth and romantic development is skillfully handled.",

His strong communication skills and rational thinking make him a standout character, earning him the title of a \"green flag\" golden retriever. The chemistry between Rowan and Zach is palpable, with their flirtatious and genuine interactions adding charm to the narrative. Although there is some drama involving another woman, the way both characters navigate the situation is commendable and enhances the story's emotional depth.",

However, this book fell short of my expectations and ended up being a disappointment.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romance felt too \"insta-lovey\" for my taste. The characters were never in the right place to be in a relationship due to their unresolved trauma, which made their connection feel forced and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Themes and Trigger Warnings:**  \n  The book includes heavy themes like grief and domestic violence, and I highly recommend checking trigger warnings before reading. That said, the author did an excellent job depicting grief, which was one of the stronger aspects of the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I couldn’t connect with the writing as it often felt flat and cringe-worthy. The prose didn’t hold my interest, and I had to push myself to finish the book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The story didn’t captivate me, and it felt like a chore to get through. I wanted more from it, but it failed to deliver the emotional depth or excitement I was hoping for.  \n\n- **Character-Driven Narrative:**  \n  Like most romance books, this one is heavily character-driven. While this approach can work, the characters’ unresolved issues made it hard to root for their relationship.  \n\n- **Setting and Unique Elements:**  \n  One aspect I did appreciate was the inclusion of the film industry as a significant part of the story. It added an interesting layer and made the setting stand out.  \n\n- **Personal Context:**  \n  I read this book as a palette cleanser after finishing *The Prison Healer* trilogy, which left me emotionally drained. While this book didn’t fill the void, it served its purpose as a lighter read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book didn’t meet my expectations. While it had some strong elements, like the depiction of grief and the unique film industry setting, the flat writing, lack of emotional connection, and rushed romance made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 🌟"

Her emotional walls make her relatable and evoke empathy. Zachary Butler, a top Hollywood actor, is surprisingly down-to-earth and seeks more meaning in life beyond his career. Both characters are well-developed, with their personal struggles and growth arcs adding depth to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The novel tackles heavy topics, such as grief, guilt, and personal growth, in a way that feels relatable even for readers who don’t live in the spotlight. The emotional journey of the characters, particularly Rowan’s guilt and Zach’s anger, resonated deeply. The villain in Zach’s story is effectively written, evoking strong negative emotions from the reader.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The romance between Rowan and Zach is compelling and heartfelt. Despite their individual struggles, their connection feels genuine, and the reader roots for their happy ending (HEA) from the very beginning.  \n\n- **Setting and Genre Appeal:**  \n  While the story is set in Hollywood and revolves around celebrities, it avoids feeling overly glamorous or unrelatable. The author presents a fresh and engaging take on the celebrity romance genre, making it accessible even to readers who typically avoid such themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating and emotionally rich story that balances heavy themes with a heartfelt romance. The well-developed characters, relatable struggles, and engaging narrative make it a standout read, even for those who don’t typically gravitate toward celebrity-themed stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this engaging story, Rowan, a Hollywood PA, has abandoned her dreams following a tragic event in her teens. Emotionally unavailable and reckless in her personal life, she crosses paths with Zachary Butler, a talented and humble actor seeking a genuine relationship and family after a toxic past. Rowan's refreshing honesty and wit challenge Zachary, who appreciates being treated as a person rather than a celebrity, though he is aware of her emotional barriers.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Rowan takes charge of her life and seeks help, demonstrating significant growth. Zachary emerges as a sweet hero with a heart of gold, making him highly likable. Their natural rapport and refreshing honesty create an underlying chemistry, although their relationship development feels somewhat rushed at first, marked by miscommunication and reliance on unhealthy coping mechanisms. \n\nOver time, they cultivate empathy and understanding for each other's struggles, striving to support one another. The grumpy-sunshine and hurt-comfort dynamics enrich their relationship. Supporting characters like Zachary's brother Jeremy and Rowan's friend JJ are fun and caring, adding depth to the narrative and leaving room for potential future stories.",

The ending is heartfelt and well-deserved, though a glimpse into their future would have been a welcome addition.",

            "This story follows Zach and Rowan as they navigate a six-month journey of love amidst their heavy emotional baggage. Set in contemporary Hollywood, it explores themes of trauma, healing, and love through a blend of intense, poignant moments. While the narrative delivers ups and downs, lies, and heartfelt support, ultimately it culminates in a satisfying happily-ever-after (HEA). The emotional depth is compelling, balancing sadness with hope. However, the pacing could benefit from refinement, particularly in its focus on Hollywood. Additionally, the characters, both in their 20s, might have felt more credible if they were portrayed as older.",

As a production assistant aspiring to be a costume designer, she struggles with self-worth and relationships. Initially, she comes off as rude and unlikable, but her character grows on you over time. The supporting cast includes the detestable Eva and Rowan’s sweet, thoughtful best friend, JJ. The romance between Zach and Rowan begins as a light friendship and gradually deepens, but at times, their connection feels underdeveloped, making it difficult to fully invest in their relationship.",

His experience with domestic violence was both heart-wrenching and significant, shedding light on the fact that men can also be victims of such trauma. He truly deserves a five-star rating. On the other hand, I struggled to connect with Rowan; she wasn't a character I particularly enjoyed, and her development felt insufficient. However, the last quarter of the book showcased growth for both Zach and Rowan, both individually and as a couple, which made me begin to root for their happiness and a happy ending. Unfortunately, the chemistry between them was largely absent for most of the narrative. I missed the intense connection, tension, and raw emotion that the author usually excels at creating. Their relationship felt more like friendship than romance, and the insta-love trope didn’t resonate with me. I prefer a natural buildup and escalation in romantic relationships.",

            "The story is intense and emotional, delving into themes of love, loss, self-worth, healing, and second chances. However, the drama involving the MMC’s ex-girlfriend seems unnecessary, and the resolution between the FMC and her friend’s mother comes across as rushed.",

The FMC grapples with survivor’s guilt after the loss of her childhood friend, leading her to live aimlessly and engage in self-punishment. Both characters must confront their personal demons before they can forge a healthy relationship. Their innocent meeting and the development of their friendship are endearing, growing organically through mutual respect and understanding, without falling into clichés like the FMC idolizing the MMC’s fame.

            "Zach, a movie star trapped in a toxic relationship, yearns for a quieter life. Rowan, who lost her father as a child and faced emotional withdrawal from her mother, has been unable to form serious connections since losing her first love at fifteen. When they meet on the set of Zach's film, where Rowan works as a production assistant, an instant connection sparks between them.

I fully expected to cry all the tears, because Emma...duh, but surprisingly, it wasn't until 90% when the tears started flowing. Up until then, I had teared up a few times, but I really thought I'd make it through without a full-on cry, even with how emotional the storyline is. But she got me once again.\n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  Zachary and Rowan are each a little broken and damaged, but there's a softness to them that was so endearing and made it easy to love them. They both had a lot to unpack when it came to past (and current) traumas. To see them work through it all and come out on the other side—not unscathed, not miraculously healed, but on their way—is a testament to Emma herself and all that she's gone through.\n\n- **Themes and Message:**  \n  This is a story of love and hope. It's a story about giving yourself grace, allowing yourself the time and space to grieve. It's a story that will captivate and charm you, and you'll have a hard time letting go.\n\n- **Easter Eggs and Nostalgia:**  \n  I loved the Easter eggs that were interspersed throughout the story! They brought back some wonderful and tearful memories and made me want to go back and reread some of my favorites.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Falling Like Stars* is a deeply emotional and captivating novel that combines love, hope, and healing in a way that resonates long after the final page.
