With 16 stories packed into 300 pages, many of the shorter pieces (under 10 pages) felt underdeveloped and failed to leave a lasting impression.

I was particularly drawn to tales that resonate with the unique Nigerian or African experience, such as:  \n- “Ganger,” a novelette depicting an AI-run super-city that shelters millions of environmental refugees at the expense of free will and individualism.  \n- “Nigerian Dreams,” a poignant narrative capturing the enduring aspiration of Nigerians to leave their homeland in search of better opportunities."

Unfortunately, this collection didn’t meet those expectations. While it was good, \"good\" felt disappointing compared to the greatness I was hoping for.  \n   - I wanted an all-stars collection without any misses, like *Incomplete Solutions*, but this book had several stories that fell short.  \n\n- **Quality of Stories:**  \n   - The first half of the book had several stories that felt like second drafts—publishable but not fully developed. They were too short, rushed, and lacked compelling central ideas.  \n   - The shorter stories, in general, were weaker. For example, \"Nigerian Dreams\" was just okay. The SF setting didn’t add much; it could have been written as contemporary literary fiction, and the SF elements felt tacked on.  \n\n- **Strengths and Highlights:**  \n   - Despite the weaker stories, there were no truly bad ones. Even the weakest were \"okay.\"  \n   - The best stories, like \"Lights in the Sky\" and \"A Dream of Electric Mothers,\" were really good and stood out.  \n\n- **Overall Experience and Recommendation:**  \n   - If this had been my first book by Talabi, it would have left me intrigued to read more. However, since I read the superior *Incomplete Solutions* first, this collection felt like a step down.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Convergence Problems* has some strong stories and no outright failures, it falls short of the high standard set by *Incomplete Solutions*. The weaker stories, especially in the first half, make the overall experience feel uneven. However, the best stories demonstrate Talabi’s talent and potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

Notable examples include Ng'endo, a tech supervisor uncovering the artistic potential of AI; an unnamed doctor guiding her lover in harnessing lightning; and Folake, a scientist caught between her heroic aspirations and family obligations. Additional compelling characters include Laide, who struggles with brain technology and societal pressures; Stella, a scientist and mother inspiring alien research; and Dolapo, a military leader navigating thoughtspace.",

            "The stories delve into profound themes of identity, memory, freedom, and societal critique. For example, the line \"Sometimes the only way to be free is to go deeper into the prison\" encapsulates the narrative's depth. In \"Gamma: Love in the Age of Radiation Poisoning,\" love and survival are explored within a dystopian context. Additionally, Laide's satirical take on Apartheid enriches the social commentary."

            "This collection features one novella, three novelettes, and twelve short stories, six of which are under 1,500 words. It includes three original stories alongside thirteen previously published works, four of which I had read before. A recurring theme throughout the collection is the portrayal of unfeeling governments and corporations, examined through various lenses: classic dystopia in \"Ganger,\" the mundanity of bad office jobs in \"Performance Review,\" found document narratives in \"Abeokuta 52,\" and reflections on Nigerian culture in \"Nigerian Dreams.\"",
            "This collection maintains a remarkable consistency in quality. My favorite story, \"A Dream of Electric Mothers,\" which I had read previously, continues to impress as a Hugo/Nebula finalist. While the weird fantasy tale \"Tends to Zero\" was merely average, the other stories ranged from good to very good."

While its dystopian theme isn’t groundbreaking, it’s well-executed and enhanced by snippets of a classic Yoruba folktale that parallels the plot, adding depth.  \n   - Another standout is the new novelette, \"Embers,\" which portrays a once-promising young man’s struggles as his industry collapses and his life spirals. It’s a heartfelt and uncommon perspective.  \n\n- **Themes and Recurring Motifs:**  \n   - Unfeeling governments and businesses are a common theme, explored through various lenses: classic dystopia (*Ganger*), bad office jobs (\"Performance Review\"), found document tales (\"Abeokuta 52\"), and reflections on Nigerian culture (\"Nigerian Dreams\").  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this collection is a strong and consistent offering, with standout pieces like \"A Dream of Electric Mothers,\" *Ganger*, and \"Embers.\" While some stories may not leave a lasting impression, they are engaging and well-crafted, making the collection a worthwhile read for fans of sci-fi and dystopian fiction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nFirst impression: 15/20.

            "Most stories featured strong plots, though some endings fell flat, such as in GANGER and ABEOKUTA 52. SATURDAY'S SONG stood out as a compelling two-in-one narrative with a satisfying conclusion. BLOWOUT offered a touching reunion between Folake and her brother, while SILENCE delivered a brief yet poignant love story that resonated with me. COMMENTS ON YOUR PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FOR AN ETERNAL SPIRIT CORE was initially confusing but ultimately clarified itself. Some tales, like GANGER, felt overly long and convoluted, while ABEOKUTA 52 ended too abruptly, leaving me wanting more. PERFORMANCE REVIEW was concise yet effectively captured the protagonist's situation.",
            "In \"AN ARC OF ELECTRIC SKIN,\" I found Akachi's choices and superhero actions relatable. The protagonist in \"NIGERIAN DREAMS\" struck a chord with me, reflecting the widespread desire to 'japa,' a common aspiration among Nigerians. The emotional and raw storytelling in \"LIGHTS IN THE SKY\" made it particularly relatable and a favorite of mine. While the desperation of the main character in \"EMBERS\" was compelling, the ending left me disappointed.",

            "I appreciate the unique blend of Nigerian and African culture with sci-fi, a refreshing departure from the norm. The reimagined Nigeria, devoid of Western influences, was a captivating aspect of the narrative. I enjoyed the familiar language, names, and locations that grounded the story. The futuristic setting in DEBUT was intriguing, albeit initially confusing. Meanwhile, the dystopian and realistic environments in GAMMA, GANGER, and TENDS TO ZERO enriched the overall experience. Additionally, the Odua Republic and the Yoruba king in A DREAM OF ELECTRIC MOTHERS were particularly fascinating elements.",
            "The stories LIGHTS IN THE SKY, GAMMA, and SILENCE left a profound emotional impact. EMBERS, while sad, effectively conveyed the desperation of its main character. THE MILLION EYES OF A LONELY AND FRAGILE GOD delivered a powerful and realistic narrative."

Tales like *Blombos* and *Shock Absorber* are compelling and leave a lasting impact. The narrative style in *Saura’s story* is insightful, featuring a unique descriptive approach that evokes a sense of fulfilled dissatisfaction. *Gangar* stands out for its relatability, with poignant quotes such as “fake sky, fake city, fake life” and “sometimes the only way to be free is to go deeper into the prison,” making it ripe for adaptation into a dystopian film.",
            "The incorporation of Nigerian lingo was both refreshing and humorous, lending authenticity to the stories. The pride in Nigerian culture shone through, particularly in the delightful realization that non-Nigerians might struggle to pronounce names like *Isale* and *Loke*. Additionally, the complete absence of Western names or surnames was commendable, as it avoided pandering to dual audiences.",
            "This story featuring Akachi’s superpowers powerfully illustrates the harsh realities of Nigeria, encapsulated in quotes like “The country happens to us all” and “Nigeria is where the strong survive.” It resonates deeply, particularly in justifying Akachi’s actions against the political elite. *Performance Review* effectively captures workplace frustrations, where management often downplays achievements and imposes unrealistic metrics, stifling individuality. *SILENCE* evokes strong emotions, especially anger, with its unresolved cliffhanger and the protagonist’s frustrating choices. Meanwhile, *Embers* delves into themes of shattered dreams and despair, as Uduak’s journey takes a dark turn, leading to murder and destruction.",

The seven godlike siblings named after the days of the week collectively tell the story of Saura and her great love for Mobola.\n   - **\"Ganger\":** The longest story in the collection, almost novella length, looks at a future where the environment has been destroyed and humans have to live inside domed cities. The brain control element was fascinating and creepy. The story follows Laide as she tries to find meaning in a world where her brain is under constant surveillance.\n   - **\"ABEOKUTA52\":** A subtly ominous look at a government cover-up, creatively told through a news article and its comment section.\n   - **\"Performance Review\":** Probably my favorite of the whole collection; a sinister story of a young professional woman in her performance review, during which an unusual suggestion is made by her boss. I loved the ambiguous ending!\n   - **\"A Dream of Electric Mothers\":** An award-nominated story about an AI communal consciousness/memory and how it can impact the decisions of a country. An ending filled with hope.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**\n   - I found Talabi's writing a little stiff and dry overall, but I really enjoyed the concepts behind the stories and the creative formats used.\n\n- **Cultural Representation:**\n   - I liked the way that Nigerian culture was interwoven into most of the stories.\n\n- **Author's Potential and Future Interest:**\n   - Talabi is definitely an author I will keep an eye on and would read more by!\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\"Convergence Problems\" is a solid and enjoyable collection of science fiction and speculative fiction short stories by Wole Talabi.

This perspective provides a much-needed alternative to the clichéd, urban, American, Hollywood-centric vision of the future in space. Similar to the Russian sci-fi of the 1950s and 60s, authors like Tade Thompson and Nnedi Okorafor offer a unique viewpoint on space, technology, and their interplay with traditional lifestyles.",
