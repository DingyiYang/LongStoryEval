            "The conclusion beautifully tied everything together, creating a heartfelt moment.",
            "This story features an array of lovable characters that had me laughing out loud. Jalen and Byron stood out as my favorites, thanks to their witty banter and strong friendship. Jalen's endearing cluelessness about relationships made him both hilarious and relatable as he earnestly tried to navigate the boyfriend/girlfriend dynamic. I also adored Ivy, a tall basketball queen; as a fellow tall woman, it was refreshing to see a female lead who isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpocket-sized.‚Äù The bond Ivy shares with her sister and family adds depth to the story, and both Ivy and Jalen come from heartwarming families, including Ivy‚Äôs sister and kids, as well as Jalen‚Äôs charming parents.",
            "I was genuinely impressed with the writing and story, particularly for a debut novel. While the flow was occasionally clunky, this is certainly among the best debut novels I‚Äôve encountered.",
            "The story's relatable elements, such as the roommate dynamics and ‚ÄúNetflix and chilling,‚Äù effortlessly draw you in. The friendly competition dates and adorable puppies add a delightful and charming touch, enhancing the overall experience.",
            "This book provided both plenty of laughs and swoons. One of my favorite quotes, taken out of context, is: ‚ÄúYou would think I was Ted Bundy with how reluctant she is to give me her phone.‚Äù"

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a delightful read‚Äîa sweet, funny, college sports romance with lovable characters, relatable moments, and heartwarming family dynamics. Despite some minor clunkiness in the writing flow, it‚Äôs a standout debut novel that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a lighthearted and enjoyable story.",

            "The conclusion, while brief, is satisfying as Ruby, her family, and Ivy find happiness together. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and lacks depth in certain areas. The story centers on Jalen and Ivy, two competitive athletes who form a bond after a fight at a party leads to Jalen being placed under Ivy's supervision at an on-campus shelter. Key themes include sports romance, college life, anxiety representation, and the significance of communication and support systems. Although the plot has echoes of other works like *Consider Me* and *Mile High*, it doesn't quite achieve the same level of originality.",
            "Jalen, a reformed playboy with a golden retriever personality, genuinely falls for Ivy, a sassy and competitive basketball player. Throughout the story, he remains sincere, supportive, and respectful, while Ivy proves her mettle whenever challenged, despite her struggles with anxiety. Their mature handling of emotions, especially during conflicts, is a refreshing aspect of this college romance. \n\nThe relationship begins with playful banter and Jalen's persistent efforts to win Ivy over, culminating in a natural first date that lays a strong foundation. A significant conflict arises when Jalen's gossip leads to a temporary breakup, but both characters take the time to reflect and communicate, ultimately reconciling in a mature manner. \n\nThe support of friends and family is crucial in guiding them back together, and the well-developed friend group adds depth to the narrative, reminiscent of the *Playing for Keeps* ensemble but with a younger vibe. A heartwarming subplot features Ruby, Ivy‚Äôs sister, as she gets a second chance at love. However, the early hints at future couples, Byron and Lola, feel somewhat predictable. Overall, the story offers a compelling exploration of love, growth, and friendship.",
            "This book offers a charming and straightforward read, featuring endearing moments and genuine chemistry between the main characters. However, several typos and unclear sentences detracted from the overall experience. Additionally, the dog, Riley, who plays a pivotal role in the shelter and the couple's meeting, lacked the expected presence, which was disappointing."

        "conclusion": "This was a light, enjoyable read with a sweet romance and strong themes of communication and support. While the characters and their relationship were well-developed, the book suffered from predictability, typos, and a lack of depth in certain areas. It‚Äôs a solid debut but doesn‚Äôt quite stand out among similar stories in the genre.",

I found myself completely drawn to Jalen, especially when he throws a party for the basketball team just to spend time with Ivy. His dedication to learning about her and being there for her is heartwarming. Ivy, one of my favorite female protagonists, is incredibly relatable and fiercely determined. The dynamic between Jalen, the cocky playboy hockey captain, and Ivy, the shy, goal-oriented basketball captain, is captivating. I‚Äôm always a sucker for a reformed playboy, and Jalen‚Äôs unwavering feelings for Ivy shine through.

            "Jalen's portrayal of patience felt superficial, limited to his physical relationship with Ivy rather than truly understanding her as a person or considering her emotional state. His self-blame came across as manipulative, seeming more aimed at alleviating his own guilt than genuinely addressing his mistakes. The excuses offered by other characters for Jalen's behavior only fueled my anger; it felt as though they were enabling him rather than holding him accountable. \n\nDuring the hockey formal scene, I was overwhelmed with anxiety and frustration, particularly at Jalen's level of cluelessness. His actions, combined with the justifications from those around Ivy, made me intensely dislike him. It was infuriating to see everyone pressuring Ivy to forgive Jalen so easily, citing his supposed love for her or the way he looks at her. His behavior, driven by alcohol and insecurity, was inexcusable. Rather than communicating with Ivy, he chose to reach out to his ex, which was deeply frustrating.

Ivy and Jalen are truly adorable together; I particularly enjoyed how Jalen worked to win Ivy over, especially given her initial reluctance.
