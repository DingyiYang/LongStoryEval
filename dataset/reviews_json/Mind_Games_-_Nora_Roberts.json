While the emotional depth and suspense were strong, the romance felt underdeveloped, and the excessive focus on backstory detracted from the present timeline. The repetitive character traits and dialogue also made it harder to connect with the story.

            "The story centers on Thea Fox, who possesses a unique gift that allows her to see the man who murdered her parents. Over the years, she is determined to stop him. However, the pacing is sluggish, with the setup taking too long and Thea's visions becoming tiresome. The romantic suspense is underwhelming, as the love interest only appears near the halfway mark. While the concept of her gift is intriguing, it remains underdeveloped, and crucial details—such as why the antagonist shares this gift—are overlooked, resulting in plot holes. Additionally, the mind games aspect feels forced, particularly in the messy and unsatisfying ending.",
            "Thea, her brother, and their grandmother lacked the depth to drive the story forward. The antagonist, who shares the same gift, felt like an arbitrary addition without sufficient background—such as the origins of his gift or whether it runs in his family. The only characters that captured my interest were the love interest's child and Thea’s dog.",

However, it felt isolated to the heroine's mind, which made it less intense compared to her other books. I never truly believed anyone else was in danger, which diminished the suspense for me.  \n\n- **Psychic Ability:**  \n  The psychic ability element was a standout feature and really cool. I would have loved to see the heroine use it more to assist the police, but I understood why it was emotionally taxing for her.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was a slower burn, which I enjoyed. I particularly loved the hero as a single dad—his son was adorable, and it was heartwarming to see them both gradually fall in love with the small town they moved to.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending felt a bit anti-climactic to me, but I was still deeply invested in the characters and their story.  \n\n- **Heroine's Job and Plot Setup:**  \n  The heroine's job was fascinating, and the first part of the book, set in the past, was my favorite. The mystery surrounding her parents' murder hooked me immediately and kept me engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was another solid romantic suspense novel from Nora.

            "The story centers on Thea Fox, who, along with her brother, visits their grandmother in Appalachia. Thea's ability to see a man who later murders her parents sets a dark tone for the narrative. However, the plot feels overly drawn out, with excessive focus on Thea's visions and mental struggles. The pacing is slow, only gaining momentum halfway through when a love interest is introduced. The ending is messy and unsatisfying, failing to fulfill the anticipated games aspect. While the concept of Thea's gift is intriguing, its execution is lacking. A significant inconsistency arises with the antagonist also possessing the gift, despite it being unique to Thea's family. This lack of clarity makes the story feel disjointed and raises questions about the logic behind key plot points.",
            "Thea, her brother, and their grandmother lacked depth, making it difficult for me to connect with them as a reader. The antagonist, who possesses a similar gift to Thea, seemed like an arbitrary addition without sufficient explanation or backstory. The only characters that piqued my interest were the love interest's child and Thea's dog; the rest of the cast felt underdeveloped and forgettable.",
            "While I appreciate the author's knack for detailed storytelling, this particular narrative felt overly drawn out. The repetitive emphasis on Thea's visions and internal conflicts became tedious, resulting in a lack of the tension and excitement typically found in a suspense novel.",
            "While marketed as a romantic suspense, the romance in the book is introduced too late, feeling more like an afterthought than an integral part of the story. Additionally, the suspense, focused on Thea's mental struggles, lacked engagement and failed to capture my interest."

        "conclusion": "Overall, Mind Games was a disappointing read. The slow pacing, underdeveloped characters, and inconsistent logic made it difficult to stay engaged. While the premise had potential, the execution fell flat, and the ending left much to be desired. It barely qualifies as a romantic suspense novel, and I found myself bored for much of the story.",

However, the plot felt overly drawn out, with too much time spent on Thea's visions and mental struggles.

This lack of explanation made the story feel disjointed and left me questioning the logic behind key plot points.\n\n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n  The book is marketed as a \"romantic suspense,\" but the romance element was introduced too late in the story, making it feel tacked on rather than integral. The suspense aspect, centered around Thea's mental battles, was not engaging and failed to hold my interest.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  While I appreciate the author's tendency to take time setting up her stories, this one felt unnecessarily prolonged. The repetitive focus on Thea's visions and internal struggles became tedious, and the narrative lacked the tension and excitement expected in a suspense novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, \"Mind Games\" was a disappointing read.

Twelve-year-old Thea revels in the freedom and sensory wonders of her grandmother's home, but tragedy strikes when her parents are killed on their return journey. Thea and her grandmother, Lucy, share a unique ability to perceive the thoughts and souls of others, which they use to identify the killer. As Thea begins to build a life in Redbud Hollow, her gift turns into a curse, as she is haunted by the killer's twisted thoughts from a distance.

I always enjoy her books, whether she writes as Nora Roberts or J.D. Robb.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story begins with the Fox family driving through Appalachia to drop off their children at their grandmother’s house for a two-week stay. Twelve-year-old Thea enjoys the freedom and sensory delights of her grandmother’s home, but tragedy strikes when her parents are killed on their way back. Thea and her grandmother, Lucy, share a special ability to see into minds and souls, which they use to identify the killer. Over time, Thea builds a life in Redbud Hollow, but her ability becomes a curse as she continues to sense the killer’s twisted thoughts and actions from afar. The story culminates in a long, silent battle between Thea and the killer, leading to a dramatic confrontation.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are well-crafted and engaging. I particularly enjoyed Thea’s growth, her relationship with her brother, and the sweet family life with Grammie.

It escalates the tension throughout the book, making the story gripping and suspenseful. While Grammie views it as a gift, Thea often feels it’s more of a curse, especially as she becomes entangled in the killer’s twisted mind.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves a good story with a paranormal twist. The blend of family dynamics, romance, and suspense kept me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling mix of family, romance, and paranormal suspense, set against the backdrop of a charming Appalachian community.

How cool.\"  \n\n- **Suspense and Villain:**  \n  - \"This book delivers on suspense and has a completely unhinged and terrifying villain.\"  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  - \"The love interest somewhat surprised me but in a good way, as I had suspected it may be someone else, but I'm happy with how it turned out.\"  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  - \"Thank you to NetGalley, St. Martin's Press, and Nora Roberts for the ARC in exchange for an honest review.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this Nora Roberts novel has a unique concept, well-developed characters, and a suspenseful plot with a terrifying villain, I personally struggled to connect with it despite its many strengths. The romantic subplot was a pleasant surprise, and I appreciated the creative details, such as Thea's profession. Overall, it’s a great book that will likely appeal to many readers, even if it didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This novel masterfully weaves together romantic suspense, family saga, and paranormal elements, showcasing the author's talent. The chilling psychic connection between Thea and the antagonist, Ray Riggs, adds a distinctive and compelling layer to the story.",
            "Thea Fox emerges as a compelling protagonist, her psychic abilities serving as a force for good in stark contrast to Ray Riggs’ malevolent use of his powers. Grammie Lucy Lannigan embodies the ideal grandmother—supportive, patient, and deeply rooted in family traditions. The heartwarming dynamics among Thea, Rem, and Grammie showcase an unbreakable bond, even amidst the siblings' occasional squabbles. Although Cora and John appear briefly, they leave a lasting impression of love and devotion to their children. The romantic subplot is well-crafted, featuring a satisfying twist that defies predictability.",
            "The author's storytelling is both engaging and emotionally resonant, skillfully balancing suspense with heartfelt moments. The narrative steers clear of excessive graphic violence, instead emphasizing the emotional and psychological impact of events.",
            "The rural setting of Redbud Hollow, Kentucky, is beautifully depicted, immersing readers in its natural beauty and tranquility. The farm-to-table lifestyle, herbal medicine, and traditional practices lend authenticity and depth to the narrative. Sensory details—like the scent of lavender, the taste of fried chicken, and the sounds of nature—further enhance the immersive experience.",
            "The story explores themes of love, family, and the profound impact of sudden, violent loss, delving into grief, resilience, and the enduring bonds that connect us. While a thriller subplot exists, it is skillfully balanced by the emotional depth and emphasis on family relationships.",
            "This novel powerfully evokes emotions, particularly through its exploration of grief, loss, and the senselessness of violence. Thea’s speech to the detectives and the portrayal of Cora and John’s final moments are profoundly moving, often bringing readers to tears. The sense of belonging and sanctuary found in Grammie’s home provides a comforting refuge amid the tragedy."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Mind Games* is a masterful blend of suspense, family drama, and paranormal intrigue, with a strong emotional core centered on love, loss, and resilience. The vivid setting, well-drawn characters, and unique psychic element make it a standout novel. While the thriller aspect is gripping, the heart of the story lies in its exploration of family bonds and the healing power of love and tradition.",

The pacing is sluggish, particularly in the first half, causing the narrative to feel drawn out. Additionally, the romantic suspense aspect falls flat, as the love interest doesn't make an appearance until nearly halfway through the story.",
            "Thea, her brother, and their grandmother lack depth, making them unengaging characters. The antagonist's possession of the same gift feels arbitrary and poorly developed, leaving key questions unanswered, such as its origin and whether anyone else in his family shares it. The only memorable characters are the love interest's child and Thea's dog.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story follows Thea Fox, who has a \"gift\" of seeing visions, and her decades-long struggle to stop a man with the same ability who murdered her parents.\n   - The pacing felt slow, with the story dragging on for too long, especially in the first half.\n   - The romantic suspense element was weak, as the love interest didn’t appear until nearly the 50% mark.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Thea, her brother, and her grandmother were not compelling or interesting characters to spend time with.\n   - The antagonist’s possession of the same \"gift\" felt random and underdeveloped, raising unanswered questions (e.g., why did he have it, and did anyone else in his family?).\n   - The only characters that stood out were the love interest’s child and Thea’s dog.\n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**\n   - The concept of mental battles between characters was not engaging or interesting to read.\n   - The story felt monotonous, with repetitive descriptions of Thea’s visions and struggles.\n   - The ending was messy and unsatisfying, leaving the reader feeling underwhelmed.\n\n- **Genre Expectations:**\n   - The book barely qualifies as \"romantic suspense\" due to the late introduction of the love interest and the lack of a strong romantic thread.\n   - The \"games\" aspect of the story, which was supposed to be a central theme, didn’t work effectively and felt forced.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, \"Mind Games\" was a disappointing read. While the premise had potential, the execution fell flat due to slow pacing, uninteresting characters, and a lack of engagement. The romantic suspense element was weak, and the ending failed to deliver a satisfying conclusion. Despite some intriguing ideas, the story didn’t hold my interest, and I found myself bored and uninvested.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 2.5 stars (rounded up to 3 stars for Goodreads)."

I always enjoy her books, whether writing as Nora Roberts or J.D. Robb.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story begins with the Fox family dropping off their children, including twelve-year-old Thea, at their grandmother’s home in Appalachia. Thea and her grandmother, Lucy, share a special ability to see into minds and souls, which they discover when they both awaken from the same nightmare. This ability becomes central to the story as Thea uses it to help bring her parents’ killer to justice. However, the killer also possesses the same ability, leading to a long, silent battle between them that escalates tension throughout the book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Thea is a compelling protagonist, and her relationship with her grandmother, Grammie, is heartwarming. The family life in Redbud Hollow is sweet, and I loved the dynamic between Thea and her brother. The characters are well-developed, and I found myself liking all of them—except for the killer, which is intentional, as we’re meant to hate him. Even the skeptical detective grew on me by the end.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The setting of Redbud Hollow is charming and idyllic. I could easily imagine living in such a close-knit community.

It escalates the tension and keeps the reader on edge, especially as the killer uses his abilities to seek vengeance. Grammie refers to it as a gift, but for Thea, it often feels more like a curse.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well-crafted story with a paranormal twist. The characters, setting, and plot all come together to create a compelling and memorable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by Nora Roberts delivers a captivating blend of family dynamics, romance, and paranormal suspense.

Thea's character is wonderfully unique—her quirky sword-wielding lessons, her packed schedule, and her deep-seated loneliness, limited to her grandma, brother, and childhood best friend, resonated with me. As someone who often feels similarly isolated, I found a sense of understanding and reflection in her journey. Additionally, her romance with her childhood crush is enchanting; just picture falling in love with someone like Harry Styles one summer.",
            "I appreciated the world-building in this video game. In this universe, Harry Styles has an adorable child who brings joy to his life, while Thea could certainly use some of that light in her darker moments.",
            "Thea's story was a series of impactful moments, each one resonating deeply.",
            "This book left me at a loss for words, and I’m still grappling with its profound impact. The story of Thea struck me deeply, making it difficult to read as I found myself in tears repeatedly. Her journey is a relentless series of hardships, and I can hardly fathom enduring what she faced yet still finding the strength to wake up each day. The weight of her experiences, especially witnessing her parents' murder, creates an ever-present darkness that feels hauntingly real. This narrative resonated with me on a personal level, making it an unforgettable read."

        "conclusion": "This novel by the author is a deeply emotional and immersive experience, with a story that resonates on a personal level. Thea's journey, marked by loss, love, and resilience, is both heartbreaking and inspiring. The unique world-building, relatable characters, and the author's heartfelt storytelling make this book unforgettable.",

And wow did this one hit home because of it.\"  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - \"I loved the world building of video games and what goes into it. I love that Thea was a little weird learning how to wield a sword, a little quirky with her schedule and her seemingly packed away life, and a little lonely to never look past her grandma, her brother, and her childhood best friend.\"  \n   - \"As someone who feels a little lonely for all the same reasons, it was like an understanding and a reflection all in one.\"  \n   - \"Because she also gets to fall in love with her childhood crush, who.... let's just say that you should imagine Harry Styles falling in love with you one summer.\"  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n   - \"I loved the world building of video games and what goes into it.\"  \n   - \"Thea's story was one hit after another.\"  \n   - \"In this universe Harry Styles has an adorable kid who lights up his life, and Thea could use a little light in all her dark.\"  \n\n- **Author's Craftsmanship:**  \n   - \"Nora Roberts puts such heart into her stories and I love getting lost in them.\"  \n   - \"It's hard, and it's special, and it took me on a journey like no other author can.\"  \n   - \"I'm always so thankful to read a Nora Roberts book, but I'm especially thankful to NetGalley for letting me do it early.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by Nora Roberts is a deeply emotional and immersive experience, with a story that resonates on a personal level.

The slow plot and excessive mundane details made it feel drawn out, and the lack of tight editing hindered its potential. Despite some charming character interactions, the story ultimately felt predictable and uninspired.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Thea and Ty were no different.  \n   - This book took a somewhat different direction from Nora's usual style, which I appreciated.  \n   - Nora handles suspense and emotions very well. The beginning of this book was highly emotional and effective, especially with the up-close view of the tragedy that shaped Thea's life.  \n\n- **Weaknesses of the Novel:**  \n   - Nora's recent novels no longer feel primarily like romance. Romance is not the focal point, which is a departure from her earlier works where romance was central, accompanied by an overarching storyline.  \n   - The male main character (Ty) doesn't appear until 46% into the book, leaving little room for the romantic relationship to develop organically.  \n   - Ty doesn't learn about the main issue of the book until around 90%, making it hard to build a strong foundation for the relationship.  \n   - The first third of the book focuses on the female main character's (FMC) childhood, which feels excessive. While background information is important, it detracts from the current timeline and character growth.  \n   - Nora's recent FMCs feel too similar, with unrealistic and long-winded dialogue that takes me out of the story.  \n\n- **Speculation About the Author's Writing Process:**  \n   - I suspect Nora Roberts might be using a ghostwriter, which could explain the changes in her writing structure and why her recent releases don't resonate with me as much.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was entertaining, but it reflects ongoing issues I've noticed with Nora Roberts' recent novels.

The chilling psychic connection between protagonist Thea and antagonist Ray Riggs introduces a fresh twist to the narrative. The thriller subplot is intense yet restrained, with brief and minimal violence that emphasizes emotional impact over graphic detail. The romantic interest is well-crafted, culminating in a satisfying and unpredictable reveal. Additionally, the red herring in the romantic subplot adds an engaging element of surprise, keeping readers hooked throughout.",

In stark contrast, Thea Fox emerges as a compelling protagonist who uses her own psychic gift for good.

The heartwarming dynamics among Thea, Rem, and Grammie highlight their unbreakable bond, showcasing love and resilience throughout the story.",

The novel excels in its portrayal of love, loss, and resilience, with richly drawn characters and a vivid, immersive setting. While the thriller elements are intense, the emotional core of the story—centered on family and heritage—shines through, making it a deeply moving and memorable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Plot and Storyline: 9/10  \n- Characters: 10/10  \n- Themes: 9/10  \n- Setting and Atmosphere: 10/10  \n- Emotional Impact: 9/10  \n- Romantic Subplot: 8/10  \n- Overall: 9/10"

Additionally, the narrative emphasizes the significance of trust and the healing process over time.",

The romantic suspense is underwhelming, as the love interest only appears near the halfway mark. The ending is messy and unsatisfying, failing to cohesively tie the story together, leaving me indifferent. While the concept of Thea's gift is intriguing, it is poorly executed, with key details—such as the antagonist's similar gift—glossed over, resulting in plot holes.

            "The story opens with the Fox family leaving their children, including twelve-year-old Thea, at their grandmother Lucy's home in Appalachia for a two-week visit. Their idyllic summer takes a dark turn when Thea and Lucy share a nightmare that uncovers a tragic event: Thea’s parents are murdered. Thanks to Thea’s unique ability to see into minds and souls, the killer is eventually apprehended. As Thea grows up, she builds a life and finds love, but her ability—deemed a “gift” by her grandmother—often feels like a curse. The murderer, who possesses the same power, seeks revenge, leading to a silent battle that culminates in a tense face-to-face confrontation.",
            "The characters are well-developed and captivating. I especially appreciated Thea’s bond with her brother and the warm family dynamic with Grammie. Her transformation from a traumatized child to a strong, independent woman was compelling. The romance, particularly the teenage crush, added an epic quality that enriched the narrative. Even the initially skeptical detective won me over by the end. The only character I disliked was the killer, but that was intentional—he’s designed to be hated.",
            "Redbud Hollow is a charming and idyllic community that makes me long to live there. The vivid descriptions of the Appalachian setting, with its pine-scented air and handmade candles, create a cozy yet eerie atmosphere that enhances the story.",

            "While the ending felt somewhat anti-climactic, I remained deeply invested in the characters and their journey.",
            "This romance unfolds at a satisfying slow burn, which I appreciated. The hero's role as a single dad introduces a charming dynamic, and I loved how both he and his son gradually fell in love with their new small town, adding warmth and depth to their characters. The heroine's intriguing job further enriches her character. The interactions between the hero, his son, and the heroine are truly heartwarming, making them all the more endearing.",
            "This novel's suspense stands out from the author's previous works, as it is primarily confined to the heroine's mind. While this approach created a unique atmosphere, it diminished the overall intensity for me, as I never felt that anyone else was truly in danger. The inclusion of psychic abilities added an intriguing layer to the narrative, though I wished the heroine had utilized her powers more to aid the police, despite understanding the emotional toll it took on her. The first part of the book, which delves into the mystery of her parents' murder, was especially captivating and drew me in right away."

While the suspense was more internal and less intense than in her other books, the unique psychic element and the engaging characters kept me hooked. The slower-burn romance and the charming small-town setting added depth to the story, even if the ending didn't quite meet my expectations.",

            "The first third of the book delves into the female main character's childhood, which feels excessive. While background information is important, it detracts from the current timeline's character development and emotional connection. The pacing and structure appear to have shifted, raising questions about whether the author has employed a ghostwriter. Despite this, the novel features a compelling storyline and is easy to read. The beginning is particularly emotional, providing an intimate look at the tragedy that shaped Thea's life, marking a departure from the author's typical style.",
            "Thea and Ty, like her other main characters, are undeniably likable, making it easy to root for them. However, the latest female protagonists feel overly similar, sharing a distinct yet unrealistic way of speaking. This results in dialogue that often feels long-winded, pulling me out of the story.",
            "As a devoted fan of this author, whose work inspired my love for reading, I will continue to explore everything she publishes, even if I have mixed feelings about her recent novels.",
            "Recent novels by this author have shifted away from being primarily categorized as romance. While this change isn't necessarily negative, it contrasts with her earlier works, which centered around romance with a cohesive storyline. In this book, the male lead, Ty, doesn't appear until 46% in, limiting the opportunity for an organic development of the romantic relationship. Additionally, Ty only learns about the main conflict around 90% into the story, making it challenging to establish a solid foundation for their connection."

Thea and Ty were no different.  \n   - The beginning of the book was highly emotional and effective, offering an up-close view of the tragedy that shaped Thea's life, which was a departure from Nora's usual approach.  \n\n- **Genre and Focus:**  \n   - Nora's recent novels can no longer be primarily described as romance. Romance is not the focal point, which is not inherently bad, but her earlier works were romance-driven with an overarching storyline.  \n   - In this book, the male main character (Ty) doesn't appear until 46% of the way through, leaving little room for the romantic relationship to develop organically.  \n   - Ty doesn't learn about the main issue of the book until around 90%, making it difficult to build a strong foundation for the relationship.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The first third of the book covers the female main character's (FMC) childhood, which feels excessive. While background information is important, it detracts from the current timeline's growth and connection to the characters.  \n   - The pacing and structure seem to have changed, leading me to wonder if Nora Roberts now uses a ghostwriter.  \n\n- **Character Dialogue and Realism:**  \n   - Nora's latest FMCs seem like the same person, with a distinct and unrealistic way of speaking. This makes the dialogue feel long-winded and takes me out of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Critique:**  \n   - The book was entertaining, but I've been having similar issues with her recent novels.  \n   - I suspect a ghostwriter might be involved, which could explain the changes in structure and why I'm not connecting as much with her new releases.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel had its strengths, such as emotional depth and likable characters, it fell short in areas like pacing, romance development, and character dialogue. The structural changes and repetitive character traits in Nora Roberts' recent works have made them less enjoyable for me compared to her earlier books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**\n   - The audiobook, narrated by January LaVoy, was exceptional. LaVoy excelled at differentiating between the many characters and emoting their grief, heartbreak, and joy. Her narration brought the characters to life, making it easy to picture them in my mind's eye. The emotional depth she brought to the story gripped me and even brought me to tears at times. I highly recommend listening to the audio version.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story was well-paced and cleverly written, captivating me from beginning to end. The plot was riveting and compelling, with a touch of magic that felt perfectly integrated. The ending was satisfying, with all loose ends tied together nicely. I didn’t want the book to end and am hopeful for a sequel.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Nora Roberts is a master at creating compelling, three-dimensional characters. Thea, Rem, Grammie Lucy, and even the antagonist were well-developed and relatable. I found myself empathizing with Thea’s struggles and feeling contempt for the antagonist. The cast of characters was enjoyable, and their growth throughout the story was well-portrayed.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**\n   - The novel beautifully portrayed the true meaning of family, friendship, romance, and finding purpose in life. It explored how the same gift could produce different outcomes—Thea used her abilities for good, while the antagonist used his for evil. The story also highlighted themes of healing, trust, and resilience.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The emotional depth of the story was profound. Thea’s journey of grief, healing, and eventual triumph was moving. The connection between the characters and the reader was strong, making it difficult to say goodbye to them. The antagonist’s lingering torment of Thea added a layer of tension that kept me engaged.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - The settings, from Fredericksburg to Redbud Hollow, were vividly described and added to the story’s charm. Grammie Lucy’s farm, with its homemade remedies and community spirit, felt like a character in itself. The contrast between the idyllic family life and the tragic events added depth to the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Mind Games* by Nora Roberts is a riveting and emotionally impactful novel that masterfully blends family, friendship, romance, and a touch of magic. The audiobook, narrated by January LaVoy, is a must-listen, as it brings the characters and their emotions to life. The story’s pacing, character development, and themes are expertly crafted, leaving a lasting impression. I highly recommend this book and hope for a sequel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 5 Stars"

Over the years, she attempts to stop him, but the pacing is slow, causing the narrative to drag. The setup takes too long, and I found myself weary of Thea's visions. The romantic suspense aspect is underwhelming, as the love interest only appears near the halfway mark. The ending is messy and unsatisfying, and the games element feels out of place, leaving me indifferent. While the concept of Thea's gift is intriguing, it is poorly executed.

Twelve-year-old Thea revels in the freedom and sensory wonders of her grandmother Lucy's home, but tragedy strikes when her parents are killed on their return to Virginia. Both Thea and Lucy possess a unique ability to see into minds and souls, which they use to identify the killer.

Robb.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story begins with the Fox family driving through Appalachia to drop off their children at their grandmother’s house for a two-week stay. Twelve-year-old Thea enjoys the freedom and sensory delights of her grandmother’s home, but tragedy strikes when her parents are killed on their way back to Virginia. Thea and her grandmother, Lucy, share a special ability to see into minds and souls, which they use to identify the killer. Over time, Thea builds a life in Redbud Hollow, but her ability becomes a curse as she continues to hear the killer’s twisted thoughts and witness his evil acts from afar. The story culminates in a long, silent battle between Thea and the killer, leading to a dramatic confrontation.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are well-crafted and engaging. I particularly enjoyed Thea’s relationship with her brother and the sweet family life with Grammie. The romance, especially the teenage crush angle, felt epic and added depth to the story. Even the skeptical detective grew on me by the end. The killer, of course, is intentionally hateable, which adds to the tension and stakes.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The community of Redbud Hollow is charming and idyllic, making me wish I could live there. The descriptions of the setting, from the smells of pine and fresh bread to the handmade candles, create a vivid and immersive atmosphere.  \n\n- **Paranormal Element:**  \n  The shared “gift” of seeing into minds and souls is both intriguing and terrifying. It escalates the tension throughout the book, making the story gripping and suspenseful. While Grammie views it as a gift, Thea often feels it’s more of a curse, especially as she battles the killer who shares the same ability.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves a good story with a paranormal twist. The combination of family dynamics, romance, and suspense kept me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of family, romance, and paranormal suspense, set in a charming and vividly described community. The well-developed characters, escalating tension, and immersive atmosphere make it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
