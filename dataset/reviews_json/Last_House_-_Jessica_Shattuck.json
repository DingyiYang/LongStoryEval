            "The novel begins with a strong hook but gradually loses its momentum. While the pacing slows considerably throughout most of the story, it rushes through the conclusion, quickly advancing to 2026. Additionally, the narrative feels disjointed and lacks depth, despite its rich socio-political backdrop.",
            "The story unfolds through the perspectives of Nick, Bet, and Katherine. While Nick and Bet's backstories are engaging, some pivotal events are treated too lightly. Katherine's political activism in the 60s and 70s is particularly well articulated. However, Harry’s psyche and motivations lack depth; a section from his viewpoint would have added valuable insight. Each character is realistic and thoughtfully developed, but the complexities of the family dynamic are explored only superficially, with the exception of Katherine.",
            "The family’s vacation home in Vermont, “Last House,” serves as a pivotal backdrop that captures their joys, sorrows, triumphs, and losses.",
            "The author poses a timely and relevant question regarding how current generations view the repercussions of the actions taken by their predecessors."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Last House* by the author is an ambitious family saga with a rich socio-political backdrop and well-thought-out characters. While the novel starts strong and offers interesting backstories, it suffers from pacing issues, a disjointed narrative, and a lack of depth in exploring the complexities of the family dynamic. Despite these shortcomings, the novel raises relevant questions and provides a partially enjoyable reading experience.",

            "The novel leans more toward a family saga than traditional historical fiction. It unfolds across two time periods: 1953, focusing on Nick Taylor and his wife Bet, and 1968, seen through the eyes of their daughter Catherine. The narrative opens with Nick’s career as a lawyer for American Oil and their family dynamics before transitioning to Catherine’s post-college life in New York City.",
            "The characters are vividly portrayed and resonate with authenticity. Bet, a suburban wife, sacrifices her own aspirations for her family, while Nick's career decisions significantly impact their lives. Catherine's perspective enriches the narrative, illustrating how the Greatest Generation shaped the Boomers, particularly those reaching adulthood in the late 1960s.",
            "I initially anticipated a greater emphasis on Iran and the political climate of 1953, which would have enriched our understanding of Nick and Carter’s roles. However, the story predominantly centers on American family dynamics. In contrast, the second part, narrated from Catherine’s perspective, effectively weaves in historical context, particularly concerning the late 1960s.",
            "This book delves into themes such as \"the sins of the father\" and poses thought-provoking questions about generational influence and societal change. Its philosophical and introspective nature is enriched by numerous passages that offered new insights, many of which I found myself highlighting.",
            "While the book doesn't fully meet my expectations in terms of historical context, it remains engaging and thought-provoking. Its philosophical themes make it an excellent choice for book clubs, as it is sure to spark meaningful discussions."

The narrative also explores the involvement of oil companies in Middle Eastern politics, particularly in Iran. The 1960s radical movement is effectively captured through Katherine’s connection with a radical group, showcasing the fierce realities of that lifestyle. Although the expansive timeline and numerous events may overwhelm some readers in a 300-page book, the story remains both engaging and entertaining.",

The story progresses through subsequent generations, reflecting the challenges of racial tension, feminism, protests over privilege, and the Vietnam War. The final generation brings the narrative full circle, addressing the end of \"The Age of Oil\" and its implications.  \n\n- **Themes and Issues:**  \n  The novel quietly but effectively highlights a variety of societal issues, including prejudice and climate change, using them as warnings for the future. It explores the evolution of these themes across generations, making them central to the family's story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The story is deeply felt, focusing on the family's emotional journey across generations.

            "The novel spans several decades, beginning in 1953, and centers on the evolving lives of the Taylor family. It opens with Nick Taylor, a WWII veteran and lawyer, who buys a secluded vacation home in Vermont. As the narrative unfolds, we follow his children, Katherine and Harry, who grow up and deviate from their parents' beliefs. Katherine becomes engaged in the social movements of the 1960s, while Harry grapples with depression after being denied enlistment in the Vietnam War. The story traces Katherine's life from youth to old age, encompassing her journey as a mother and grandmother. While the multi-decade timeline enriches the narrative, the pacing occasionally suffers from a repetitive emphasis on Katherine's anger.",
            "Katherine takes center stage in this story, where her activism and struggles with anger towards societal issues are deeply explored. Harry's character arc is particularly poignant as he battles depression, finding momentary purpose through Katherine's influence. The well-developed family dynamics effectively highlight the generational divide and the impact of societal changes on personal relationships.",
            "The novel tackles enduring social issues, such as activism, generational conflict, and mental health, that still resonate today. However, Katherine's persistent anger towards these topics, though understandable, eventually feels repetitive and tiresome.",

While the novel effectively captures the evolution of the Taylor family over decades, the repetitive focus on Katherine's anger detracts from the overall experience.

It intertwines personal stories with key historical events, including the Shah's return to power in Iran, the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War protests, and the Weather Underground. The narrative culminates in a reunion at Last House during a massive blackout, symbolically returning to its central setting. However, the pacing feels rushed towards the end, leaving readers craving more depth. Additionally, the transition from Bet's story to Katherine's creates a disjointed narrative flow at times. Ultimately, the novel would have benefited from a more character-driven approach rather than a heavy focus on historical events.",

Bet's husband, Nick, an attorney with ties to the CIA and the oil industry, also plays a significant role. Additionally, Carter, a CIA operative, becomes an influential character in the family's decision to purchase Last House.

            "Initially, I struggled with this book due to its seemingly plotless and painfully slow start. However, I soon realized that the early chapters lay crucial groundwork for the more engaging second half. The story begins with a family whose father, a lawyer for Big Oil, is implicated in U.S. government interference in Iran. It evolves into a multi-generational family saga, exploring themes such as feminism, racism, radicalization, inequality, and climate change, all intricately linked to the future of civilization. Although the narrative occasionally feels disjointed, this structure enriches the reader's understanding of world events through different generational perspectives. The shift to multiple viewpoints halfway through adds significant depth and complexity to the overall story.",

The story’s evolution into a multi-generational family saga, combined with its exploration of significant themes and unique narrative structure, made for a compelling and thought-provoking read. The anxious undertone was balanced by the comforting family story, creating a truly interesting and memorable reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This sweeping family saga spans nearly eighty years, beginning in 1953 with Nick's oil career. The story delves into multiple generations of the Taylor family, offering an intimate look at each one. However, the narrative occasionally felt disjointed, particularly during Nick’s overseas sections, which I found less engaging.",
            "The novel masterfully develops each generation of the Taylor family, creating characters that feel authentic and multi-dimensional. The quote, “Life is full of minor characters we slough off. In memory, they step forward—bigger sometimes than the people we thought were essential to us,” resonated with me and underscored the nuanced portrayal of its characters.",
            "The segments set in the U.S., particularly those examining the 1960s and their influence on the family, stood out as particularly engaging and well-crafted. The historical context enriched the narrative, making the family's experiences both relatable and compelling.",

While the historical context and U.S.-based sections were captivating, the pacing and engagement faltered during Nick’s overseas storyline. Overall, it’s a thoughtful exploration of family, memory, and the passage of time, though it could have been more consistently engaging.",

            "The book opens strongly, immersing readers in the post-WW2 lives of Nick and Bet Taylor and their involvement in significant historical events, such as the Iranian government overthrow. The first half effectively establishes a potential conflict between the values of the Greatest Generation and their Boomer children, though this theme feels only partially explored. Several intriguing plot threads—Katherine's troubled childhood, Carter Weston's enigmatic role, and the distinction between “citizens” and “patriots”—are introduced but lack full development and resolution.\n\nIn the second half, the narrative feels rushed and muddled, with numerous unresolved plotlines and unclear motivations, which may be a result of multiple rewrites. The ending, while offering a new interpretation of \"Last House,\" comes across as hurried and only semi-satisfying, leaving many threads hanging. The author's afterword confirms the extensive revisions, shedding light on the disjointed nature of this section. Overall, while the book starts strong, it ultimately falters in coherence and resolution.",

Katherine and Harry, the Taylor children, show promise for deeper exploration, but Katherine is underutilized, while Harry’s actions propel the family tragedy forward. Carter Weston is an intriguing figure whose rogue behavior and suggested romantic feelings for Bet remain unresolved, leaving his character underdeveloped.",

He is drawn into an ideological battle between Communism and democracy when a former Yale classmate, now a CIA agent, recruits him. However, contrary to expectations of a thrilling Middle Eastern adventure, the story unfolds as a multi-generational family saga spanning from 1953 to 2026.

While the narrative is engaging, I felt there was a lack of detail regarding Nick's career in the oil industry and a missed opportunity to explore Harry's story more thoroughly.\n\n- **Historical Context:**  \n  The novel effectively captures the historical backdrop of the post-war 1950s, the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the social upheaval of the 1960s. These elements enrich the story and provide a vivid setting for the characters' lives.\n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The story explores themes of family, privilege, generational conflict, and the struggle to reconcile personal beliefs with societal expectations. The absence of Harry's narrative may be intentional, highlighting the idea that we can never fully know those we love.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel for its well-crafted narrative and rich historical context. However, I felt the story could have been more complete with additional details about Nick's career and a deeper exploration of Harry's perspective. Despite these gaps, the novel offers a compelling look at a family's journey through significant historical events.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Title and Symbolism:**  \n   - The title *Last House* has a double meaning, referring to both the original owner, John Last, and serving as a metaphor for a multigenerational family’s final refuge and, by extension, humanity itself.  \n   - Although the house doesn’t appear until Chapter 8, it plays a pivotal role in the narrative.  \n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n   - Much of the story is set during the chaotic 1960s, with themes of protests, radicals, Big Oil, and the CIA’s secret operations.  \n   - The author attempts to fill historical gaps for modern readers, particularly with chapters focusing on the Shah of Iran and the U.S. efforts to protect their oil interests by supporting his corrupt regime.  \n   - However, these historical sections felt disconnected from the main plot and didn’t integrate well with the rest of the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Characterization:**  \n   - The author’s writing is rich and enjoyable, with detailed descriptions that bring many characters to life vividly.  \n   - Unfortunately, Harry, the central character, remains an enigma throughout the story.  \n   - The introduction of multiple generations of characters toward the end felt overwhelming and unnecessary, making it hard to keep track of them.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n   - The novel has been compared to Ann Patchett’s *The Dutch House*, as both focus on a home as the narrative’s touchstone.  \n   - In both books, the house feels like a contrivance that doesn’t serve the story well, and the characters in *Last House* are described as “wooden,” much like the architecture of the house itself.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Last House* is a richly written novel with a compelling historical backdrop and vivid character descriptions. However, its disjointed historical subplots, underdeveloped central character, and overwhelming introduction of multiple generations toward the end detract from its overall impact. The house, while symbolic, feels like a contrived element that doesn’t fully enhance the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel serves as both a meditation on ambition and hubris and a compelling family saga. However, the author sometimes falters in weaving broader themes into the narrative, with characters occasionally engaging in forced philosophizing or overtly stating thematic questions. Additionally, the effort to tie the story to contemporary issues, especially in the 2026 chapters, feels contrived and diminishes the emotional resonance of the narrative."

I wanted to love it due to the important topics and time span it covered, but the quality of the book ebbed and flowed at different points.\n\n- **Historical Context and Themes:**\n   - The book provides a bird's eye view of mid-century America, capturing the country's divisions and growing pains during the Vietnam War, civil rights movements, and women's rights advocacy.\n   - It highlights the parallels between past and present political climates, emphasizing how history repeats itself with different faces and technologies.\n   - The novel explores significant historical events, such as the Nixon presidency, McCarthy-era interrogations, and the assassinations of the 1960s, offering a multigenerational perspective on these events.\n\n- **Character Development and Generational Focus:**\n   - The story is a family saga spanning several decades, with characters growing up and advocating for peace and racial equality.\n   - I preferred the storyline of the older generation, particularly those who returned from WWII and contributed to the baby boom, though I related more to the baby boomers.\n   - The characters' experiences with segregation and interracial relationships were eye-opening, offering a different perspective on issues that were still evolving during my own youth.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**\n   - The plot seemed to jump around, leaving me unsure of the timeline at times. The scope of the novel felt too broad, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.\n   - There were bombings, accidental deaths, student unrest, and an underground movement, but the narrative sometimes missed the mark in tying these elements together cohesively.\n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**\n   - The male narrator's frequent mispronunciations (e.g., Spiro, ethos, Marley) were highly frustrating and detracted from the story. The female narrator performed better, but the overall narration was off-putting.\n\n- **Missed Opportunities and Critique:**\n   - I felt the novel should have included a storyline about a woman's right to choose, especially given the book's focus on the early 1970s when Roe v. Wade was decided. This omission felt significant, considering the issue's relevance today.\n   - The title, \"Last House,\" was not what I expected. While it referred to a family home with historical significance, it didn't fully resonate with the broader themes of the novel.\n\n- **Educational Value:**\n   - The novel taught me about the oil industry, its historical significance, and how it has fueled conflicts and political tensions, which remain relevant today.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\"Last House\" by Jessica Shattuck is a multigenerational family saga that delves into the political and social upheavals of mid-century America.

            "This historical family drama spans from the 1950s to the present, exploring family secrets, coverups, and the Last House, which serves as both a refuge and a symbol of resilience. While the plot is compelling, it occasionally lacks focus, flipping between themes of oil, family dynamics, and generational shifts, which can make it hard to follow. The transitions between generations feel abrupt, introducing characters too quickly and leaving them behind, hindering emotional connections. The pacing is strong at both the beginning and the end, but the middle section drags, straying from the core themes and losing momentum. Overall, the narrative’s disjointedness in this part detracts from the cohesion of the story.",
            "Bet, Nick's wife, is a standout character, yet her compelling backstory, especially her code-breaking during the war, is underdeveloped. Harry's storyline is both shocking and well-crafted, adding significant emotional depth to the narrative. However, the abrupt generational shifts in perspective make it challenging to fully appreciate the characters through their parents' eyes.",
            "The novel showcases impressive writing, especially in its opening and closing sections; however, it struggles with inconsistencies in focus and pacing.",
            "The 1950s slice-of-life sections are captivating, offering a nostalgic glimpse into the era. While the oil-related chapters are historically informative and intriguing, their connection to the family narrative occasionally feels forced.",
            "The Last House is a poignant exploration of a family's resilience amidst secrets, lies, and turbulent storms. The theme of oil haunting the environment serves as a profound and thought-provoking metaphor. Additionally, the novel delves into the counterculture movements of the 1960s, featuring figures like the Black Panthers, Abbie Hoffman, and the Weather Underground, which adds significant historical depth."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Last House* by the author is a novel with significant potential, exploring themes of family, environmental impact, and historical change. However, its lack of focus, jarring transitions, and inconsistent pacing make it a frustrating read. While there are moments of brilliance, particularly in the 1950s sections and the profound metaphor of oil as a haunting force, the novel ultimately falls short of its promise.",

            "The story spans a significant time frame and skillfully weaves a compelling narrative through historical events. However, the pacing quickens toward the end, leading to a rushed feeling as the main characters age and attention shifts to the next generation. Additionally, the ending feels weak and somewhat disappointing, detracting from my overall enjoyment of the book.",
            "Nick Taylor, a WWII veteran and lawyer, navigates a transformation from his wartime experiences to a life steeped in political intrigue. His wife, Bet, a Vassar graduate with aspirations of becoming a writer, ultimately settles into the role of a stereotypical 1950s suburban housewife, which feels like a lost opportunity for her character. Their children, Katherine (Kat) and Harry, embody a generational shift: Kat is opinionated and intelligent, while Harry struggles to carve out his identity. While the characters' arcs reflect the societal norms and challenges of their times, some, like Bet, come across as underdeveloped or overly stereotyped.",
            "This novel spans from the 1940s to 2026, chronicling pivotal historical events such as WWII, the Vietnam War, the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., student sit-ins, the rise of the Black Panthers, and political upheaval in Iran. Well-researched and thought-provoking, it reveals aspects of American history that I had either overlooked or forgotten. The rich historical details, especially regarding U.S. involvement in Iran and the societal transformations throughout the 20th century, are particularly compelling. The narrative shifts from suburban America to international political landscapes, adding significant depth to the story.",
            "The novel delves into themes of dysfunctional families, generational conflict, and the influence of societal norms on individual lives. It highlights the struggles faced by the Greatest Generation and Boomers in understanding and addressing the needs of their children, particularly those who exist outside traditional expectations. Additionally, the book examines political movements, social justice, and the repercussions of government actions on both domestic and international fronts. Central to the narrative is the Last House in Vermont, a powerful symbol representing solace, refuge, and the characters' complex lives."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a richly researched and ambitious exploration of American history, family dynamics, and societal change across generations. While the historical context and some character arcs are compelling, the underdevelopment of certain characters and the rushed, unsatisfying ending prevent it from being a five-star read. Despite these flaws, it offers a thought-provoking journey through pivotal moments in history.",

Nick, the son of a strict pastor, serves in the Pacific Theater, while Bet, a talented codebreaker, is recruited to work in Washington, DC. Their marriage and family dynamics take center stage, portraying Bet's sacrifices of her academic ambitions for the sake of supporting Nick and raising their children, Katherine and Harry.

However, the transition to Katherine’s experiences as a political activist in the 1960s disrupted the narrative flow and was disappointing. The pacing was uneven, with some sections dragging while others felt rushed. The book's ambitious scope seemed limited by its 320-page length, resulting in underdeveloped perspectives, particularly Harry's, and a lackluster ending.",
            "The story effectively portrays Nick and Bet's early years of marriage after WWII, as well as Nick's career as a lawyer in the oil industry during the 1950s. Their daughter, Katherine, is a nuanced character, though her unlikability made it difficult to engage with her storyline. Additionally, Katherine's first-person perspective, filled with hindsight explanations and apologies, often felt repetitive and less authentic. Her transformation would have been more impactful if depicted gradually rather than explicitly stated.",

            "This novel spans roughly 80 years, chronicling the Taylor family from post-World War II America through the social and political upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s. The story opens with Nick Taylor’s return from war, his marriage to Bet, and their life in the postwar era. It then transitions to their children, Katherine and Harry, who grapple with the turbulence of the 1960s—Katherine joins a radical group while Harry becomes radicalized. The climax unfolds in 1971, with Nick and Bet in Iran, while their family grapples with a crisis at home. The narrative effectively highlights the generational divide and the shifting dreams of post-war America.",
            "Nick Taylor, shaped by his wartime experiences, seeks stability and family life after the war. His devoted wife, Bet, manages the household while he pursues his career.

Carter Weston, a CIA operative, significantly impacts Nick and the family's trajectory. Each character is well-developed, reflecting the complexities of their era and personal struggles.",
            "The settings are vividly depicted, ranging from suburban Mapleton to a secluded town in Vermont and the politically charged atmosphere of Iran. The novel effectively captures post-war America, encompassing the optimism of the 1950s and the upheaval of the 1960s, providing a rich backdrop for the characters' journeys.",
            "This novel adeptly examines generational conflict, the aftermath of war, and the tension between the desire for stability and the push for societal change. It probes the post-war American dream, the ascent of corporate America, and the countercultural movements of the 1960s. Through its critique of Big Oil, the Vietnam War, and the era's societal shifts, the story provides a nuanced perspective on how the aspirations of the Greatest Generation contrasted with those of their children."

            "This novel is a sweeping multi-generational saga that spans from the 1950s to 2025, beginning with a compelling exploration of oil's diverse uses, which sets the stage for the Taylor family's journey. The narrative deftly examines the intersection of upper-middle-class privilege, geopolitics, and generational rebellion, seamlessly integrating significant historical events like the Vietnam War and the radical movements of the 1960s and '70s.",
            "Bet and Nick are intricately drawn characters and my personal favorites. Their compelling journey from youth to career and parenthood captivates readers. In contrast, Katherine, the narrator, is less likable but undergoes significant evolution—from a radical to a mindful environmentalist—after a family tragedy. Unfortunately, future generations, including Kate and Harry's children and grandchild, are introduced too late in the novel, resulting in their characterization being underdeveloped and primarily viewed through Kate's sentimental lens.",
            "The writing is often exquisite, with vivid sentences that invite rereading to fully appreciate the descriptions. The settings, from the hills of Vermont to Mapleton suburbia and the radical lifestyles of 60s and 70s activists, are richly portrayed.",
            "The novel examines family, legacy, and the passage of ideals and values through generations. It highlights the tension between reaping the benefits of and opposing the geopolitics of oil. At its core, the story revolves around the impact of generational choices and their far-reaching consequences."

            "The novel opens with a captivating and unique setting in 1953, centering on Nick Taylor, a World War II veteran engaged with international oil companies in Iran. This premise lays the groundwork for a rich exploration of idealism, corruption, and political intrigue. However, the narrative takes an abrupt turn, leaping to 1969 and largely sidelining Nick and Bet to focus on their children and the era's protest movements. This shift feels less original and engaging than the initial setup. The story returns to Nick and Bet in 1971, marking its peak with an intriguing blend of setting and complex family dynamics. Yet, the final 50 pages feel stretched, as numerous loose ends are tied up too neatly. While the novel begins strong and maintains a compelling pace, the shift in focus disrupts its flow. The 1969 section may be brisk, but it lacks depth, while the otherwise strong 1971 segment is weakened by an overly drawn-out conclusion that undermines its impact.",

However, his development falters as the narrative shifts focus, ultimately leaving his arc unresolved. Bet, Nick's wife, is introduced as a potential voice of reason or catalyst for change, yet her character lacks significant depth or influence on the story. The children's participation in the 1969 protest movements feels underexplored and unoriginal, as it revisits familiar themes in fiction.",

However, the transition to 1969 and the protest movements feels less distinctive, lacking the same depth of historical and cultural exploration. The 1971 section shifts back to a more compelling setting, effectively blending historical context with family drama. Unfortunately, the momentum falters in an overly extended conclusion.",

            "The story spans from 1953 to 2024, centering on a family defined by its complex dynamics. Key characters include Nick, a WWII veteran and CIA oilman; Bet, his codebreaker wife; Catherine, their elder daughter who transforms from activist to journalist; and Harry, their son. Part 2 shifts to Catherine's perspective as she immerses herself in journalism and activism, only to distance herself from the group when protests turn violent. She falls for a Black lawyer, but her affections go unreciprocated.

            "The book skillfully avoids the sanctimonious tone prevalent in much contemporary fiction that imposes clear moral judgments. Instead, it delves into how individuals navigate their lives amid the politics and social commentary of their time, providing a nuanced perspective. As expected from the author, the beautiful writing enhances the overall enjoyment of the book.",
            "This book adeptly traces the arc of American history through the lens of a single family's journey from the 1940s to 2026. It insightfully examines the cyclical nature of human choices, drawing compelling parallels between past and present political turmoil, particularly the polarization of the late '60s and early '70s. The narrative illustrates the generational pendulum: parents striving for a better life for their children, who often reject materialism, having benefited from their parents' sacrifices. Additionally, it highlights the historical impact of big oil on modern life, effectively underscored by a striking graphic at the book's start listing everyday items derived from oil, such as gasoline, aspirin, and eye shadow."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, the book is an enjoyable and eye-opening read, offering a rich exploration of American history and societal cycles. While the themes and writing are strong, the character development fell short for me, leaving me less emotionally invested than I had hoped. Despite this, the novel’s insightful commentary and elegant prose make it a worthwhile read.",

Sharpening their edges could have created more familial conflict and emotional intensity.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing is beautiful, as expected from the author, which added to the enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book is an enjoyable and eye-opening read, offering a rich exploration of American history and societal cycles.

            "This multi-generational saga spans from WWII to 2026, starting with a captivating portrayal of Nick and Bet’s life in Connecticut and their summers in Vermont. However, the narrative loses momentum when it shifts to their daughter Katherine, whose activism and less appealing peers detract from the story. The final chapter feels rushed and confusing, introducing too many new characters and eras abruptly, resulting in significant timeline gaps. While the first third of the book is well-paced and engaging, the focus on Katherine makes the narrative heavier and less enjoyable, ultimately diminishing the reading experience.",
            "Nick and Bet are well-developed characters, and Bet's frustration with her limited opportunities post-marriage resonates authentically. However, Katherine's intense activism is harder to relate to, and her roommates and colleagues, with the exception of Brent, lack appeal. Harry's storyline, especially the tragedy he faces, feels underdeveloped, likely due to it being filtered through Katherine's perspective rather than his own.",
            "The historical context surrounding Nick's involvement in Iran's political intrigues and the oil industry's impact on the Shah's reinstatement enriched the narrative. Additionally, the portrayal of 1950s and early 1960s lifestyles resonated with my own childhood experiences, making that portion of the story particularly engaging."

However, the shift in focus to Katherine and her peers, along with the rushed and confusing final chapter, made the latter part of the book less enjoyable. Despite these flaws, the novel offers a compelling look at a family's journey through significant historical events.",

It examines themes of privilege, ethics, and the influence of wealth, particularly in the context of the oil industry. The narrative focuses on the moral dilemmas faced by Katherine and Harry, the younger generation, as they navigate their family's legacy against the backdrop of the societal upheavals of the 1960s.",

            "The final chapters introduced a number of new offspring with challenging names, which made it seem unlikely that a character near Katherine's age would connect with Bet and Nick. Nonetheless, the book consistently held my interest.",

Bet, employed by a large oil company, suppresses her doubts, concerns, and morals in pursuit of comfort and stability, prioritizing her career goals over personal chaos.

The characters accept their circumstances, including the fate of the Last House, navigating life with all its messy contradictions.",

            "This family saga spans several decades, beginning in the 1950s and culminating in a leap to 2026. The narrative unfolds through alternating chapters, primarily featuring Nick, Bet, and Katherine. The buildup to a central tragedy is well-paced and compelling, immersing the reader in the family's dynamics and struggles. However, the conclusion feels abrupt; the sudden jump to 2026 adds little to the narrative and leaves the reader desiring more resolution and depth.",
            "In this story, Nick is a lawyer for a major oil company, frequently absent due to his work in the Middle East. Bet, his wife, is an unfulfilled mother who has sacrificed her own ambitions for the sake of family. As the narrative unfolds, the focus increasingly shifts to their daughter, Katherine. Meanwhile, side characters like Carter, a CIA operative and Nick's friend, enrich the story but do not consistently propel the plot forward.",
            "Set against the Cold War backdrop, Last House in Vermont serves as a retreat from the world's threats. Its off-the-grid nature adds a unique and intriguing layer to the narrative.",
            "The novel delves into themes of family, sacrifice, ambition, and how tragedy shapes relationships.",
            "While the central event carries significant emotional weight, the rushed ending undermines its lasting impact."

        "conclusion": "*Last House* is a compelling family saga with a strong buildup and well-developed characters, set against the intriguing backdrop of the Cold War. While the alternating perspectives and detailed backstory create an engaging narrative, the abrupt conclusion and unnecessary time jump to 2026 detract from the overall satisfaction of the story. Despite this, the novel remains an emotionally resonant and thought-provoking read.",

            "This novel spans roughly 80 years, delving into post-WWII America and the generational divide between the Greatest Generation and their children. It begins with WWII veteran Nick Taylor, who returns home to marry Elizabeth Bet O'Malley and start a family. In 1953, Nick is recruited by CIA operative Carter Weston to assist in Iran, where American oil companies aim to reinstate the Shah. The narrative then shifts to the late 1960s, focusing on their children, Katherine and Harry. Disillusioned with her job and the state of the world, Katherine joins a radical group, while Harry, who avoids Vietnam, becomes increasingly radicalized through his sister's influences. The climax occurs in 1971 at Nick and Bet’s time in Iran during the Shah's controversial desert party, while turmoil unfolds back home.",

His wife, Elizabeth Bet O'Malley, is a traditional homemaker who supports him while managing their household.

Meanwhile, their son Harry, originally eager to fight in Vietnam, becomes radicalized after failing his physical and being influenced by Katherine.",

However, some chapters felt unnecessarily long, and certain characters could have benefited from more development. For instance, Katherine's chapter dragged on, while subsequent characters were only briefly touched upon. The ending, too, seemed rushed compared to the book's otherwise measured pace. Spanning from 1953 to 2026, the narrative centers on Nick Taylor, the father, who works in the oil industry and plays a pivotal role in the 1953 Iranian coup that reinstates the monarchy. His involvement and ties to the oil sector generate conflict for future generations, particularly his children during the 1960s and 1970s.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The novel is a multi-generational story about a family, set against significant historical and social issues such as post-World War II life, the role of women, 1960s protests, and the fight against oil dependency.  \n   - The story explores how external events, like Nick’s involvement in oil negotiations and Katherine’s participation in protest movements, impact the family.  \n   - The narrative moves at an uneven pace, with some parts feeling rushed and others slower, but it remains engaging and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The three narrators—Nick, Bet, and Katherine—are well-developed and provide distinct perspectives.  \n   - Nick is a lawyer for an oil company whose work has far-reaching consequences, including contributing to the Shah’s rise in Iran.  \n   - Bet, a college-educated woman with aspirations for a PhD, becomes a codebreaker during WWII but sacrifices her personal dreams for marriage and motherhood.  \n   - Katherine, their daughter, becomes involved in 1960s protest movements, which leads to tragedy for the family.  \n   - The story effectively portrays the complexities of family dynamics, including how children love, rebel against, and eventually understand their parents.  \n\n- **Historical and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The novel provides a critical look at the role of oil in global politics and the U.S.’s contribution to environmental and geopolitical issues.  \n   - It offers a glimpse into the potential consequences of failing to address these problems in the future.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The story’s pacing is uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others more drawn out.  \n   - Certain subplots could almost stand alone as separate books, but the narrative consistently returns to the central family dynamics, keeping the focus on the characters.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Resolution:**  \n   - The story is emotionally engaging, making readers invested in the family’s journey and whether they will reconcile by the end.  \n   - The narrative comes full circle, providing a satisfying resolution that ties together the characters’ arcs and the broader themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Last House\" is a sweeping, multi-generational novel that skillfully weaves together personal family drama with significant historical and social issues. While the pacing is uneven at times, the story is compelling and thought-provoking, offering a poignant exploration of family dynamics, societal challenges, and the consequences of global decisions.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story is intricately woven, with the house itself, Last House, acting as a central character. As Irene Katz Connelly stated in the *Washington Post*, *Last House* profoundly explores how homes influence and mirror the moral choices of their inhabitants.",
            "Nick and Bet's story is both interesting and compelling. After Nick returns from WWII, Bet sacrifices her career as a codebreaker and her independent life in Washington, D.C., to marry him and settle in affluent Connecticut, where they raise their two children, Katherine and Harry. The family spends weekends and summers at their secluded Vermont mountain home, Last House. Nick's success as a lawyer for an American oil company often takes him on business trips to the Middle East, where he and Bet are even invited to the Shah's opulent celebration in Persepolis in 1971, alongside world leaders and celebrities. However, the narrative shifts to their daughter Katherine, who I found less engaging due to her unlikable demeanor and the story's detached tone. Additionally, Harry's character felt underdeveloped, and the quick transition to the present day detracted from the overall flow.",
            "As a fan of family sagas, historical fiction, and audiobooks featuring multiple narrators, my expectations were high for the story of Nick and Bet Taylor. The exploration of social activism and protest movements in the 1960s evoked memories of Philip Roth's *American Pastoral*, while the portrayal of a house as a character and the sibling dynamics reminded me of Ann Patchett's *The Dutch House*."

However, the shift in focus to their daughter Katherine and the underdevelopment of Harry's character detracted from my enjoyment. The novel's exploration of homes and moral choices is thought-provoking, but the pacing and character development could have been more balanced.",

The contrast between Nick and his wife's wealth—acquired through oil, arms dealing, and covert wartime code-breaking—and their children's ethical dilemmas as they grow adds richness to the narrative.

Additionally, the author alluded to many future reveals and character details, but when those moments arrived, they often fell short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Rating:**  \n  While the book started strong, the issues with Katherine’s perspective and the uneven plot development brought my overall enjoyment down.

            "The novel spans 80 years, from the 1950s to 2026, centering on the Taylor family. It opens powerfully with Nick and Bet's experiences in the post-WWII era, tackling themes of corporate America and the oil industry. The narrative then shifts to their daughter Kat in 1968, immersing readers in the counterculture movement and protests against Big Oil. However, the final section, set in 2026, reads more like an epilogue, leaving me craving additional details, especially about the 1990s and the family's later years.",
            "Nick Taylor, a WWII veteran turned corporate lawyer, and his wife Bet, a former codebreaker turned housewife, are compelling, well-developed characters. Their daughter Kat's involvement in the 1960s counterculture adds depth to the family dynamics, although her chapters are less engaging than those of Nick and Bet. While the generational shifts within the family are intriguing, the later characters and their narratives could benefit from more in-depth exploration.",

            "The story spans from 1953 to 2025, chronicling a family's generational journey. It begins with Nick, an oil company lawyer post-WWII, and his wife, Bet, a former cryptographer who sacrificed her career for motherhood. The narrative delves into their upper-middle-class lifestyle, revealing their children's disillusionment with their parents' choices and the environmental ramifications of their way of life. The Last House, a rustic cabin in Vermont, serves as a recurring backdrop. While the middle section, set during the hippie era, feels slow and drawn out, the final section is particularly engaging. It effectively ties together earlier decisions and explores their generational impacts, leaving me satisfied and captivated.",

This compelling tale explores the theme of escaping societal pressures set against a backdrop of corporate uprising, environmental exploitation, and the struggle for individual rights. It examines the generational divide: one generation benefits from established systems while the next fights against them. The narrative centers on Nick and Bet, who built their lives around International Oil, dreaming of stability and a brighter future for their children, Kat and Harry. Raised in privilege, the children begin to question their circumstances. As turbulent times unfold, the Taylor family is forced to confront their beliefs and rediscover the importance of family.",

It captures the essence of an era where beliefs were shaped by recent events, and the future was uncertain. The story vividly portrays a time when neighbors could become friends and family, something that feels almost impossible in today's climate and political landscape.  \n\n- **Storytelling and Writing Quality:**  \n  The book is so well-written that it’s hard not to \"see\" the era as the story unfolds. The author’s ability to weave historical context into the narrative is commendable, making the past come alive while maintaining a compelling storyline.  \n\n- **Relevance and Reflection on Modern Times:**  \n  The novel highlights how reactions to news have become more immediate over time, setting the tone for politics to become less responsive rather than more. This reflection on the past offers a poignant contrast to today’s world, adding depth to the story.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Family Sagas:**  \n  The book reminds me of many family sagas I’ve read and enjoyed over the years.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n  This is an entertaining family saga set between WWII and 2026. The story spans multiple decades, with the Taylors' lives deeply affected by the politics of their time, which serve as major plot points.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main characters are the matriarch Bett and her daughter Catherine. While I never felt I got to know their deep psychological makeup, I did have empathy for them. They were excellent figures to build the story around. Other characters, both family and non-family, are present but primarily serve to move the story forward.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  Bett and Catherine exemplify how women’s roles in society have changed—and yet, in some ways, remained the same. This contrast is a central theme of the novel.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is very clever, with the story starting in one place and ending in a completely different one. The pacing is excellent, with no dull spots, keeping the narrative engaging throughout.  \n\n- **Geographical and Cultural Elements:**  \n  The story includes a Middle Eastern component, which contrasts nicely with the North East, where most of the narrative takes place. The author seamlessly integrates these two settings, adding depth and richness to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is an engaging family saga that skillfully weaves together historical events, social commentary, and a clever plot. While the characters could have been explored more deeply, they are compelling enough to drive the story forward. The seamless integration of contrasting settings and excellent pacing make this a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel's pacing is uneven, with some moments of depth, particularly in the early sections focusing on Bet, but overall it feels rushed. The plot skims past key events, hindering a deeper engagement with the characters and their experiences, which detracts from the story's potential. The premise is intriguing: a young couple meets during World War II and marries. The wife, a college graduate, takes on a secret role breaking enemy codes, while the husband is sent to combat, grappling with unspoken trauma. He later becomes a lawyer and a CIA agent in Iran, tasked with undermining the government and restoring the Shah. Meanwhile, the wife faces societal pressures in 1950s America, raising two children who eventually rebel against their parents’ values.",
            "The characters in the story lack depth and development, making it difficult to connect with them as the plot unfolds quickly. The wife, Bet, stands out as an exception; her thoughts, resentments, and background are explored in detail early on. However, even her character arc feels incomplete as the narrative shifts focus and accelerates, leaving her development unresolved."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the novel has an engaging premise and explores interesting themes, it falls short due to underdeveloped characters and uneven pacing. The focus on Bet early on shows promise, but the narrative ultimately leaves me wanting more depth and connection with the characters.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Summary and Premise:**  \n  The novel's plot sounded intriguing from the summary. It follows a young couple who meet during World War II and get married. The wife, a college graduate, takes on a confidential job breaking enemy codes, while the husband is sent to combat, with only hints of the trauma he experiences during the war. Later, he becomes a lawyer turned CIA agent working in Iran to undermine the government and restore the Shah. Meanwhile, the wife remains in the States, struggling against the societal expectations placed on women in the 1950s. They have two children who eventually rebel against their parents' values.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, unfortunately, lack depth and development. The plot moves quickly, and the reader doesn’t get to know them well. The exception is the wife, Bet, whose thoughts, resentments, and background are explored in detail early in the book. However, even her development feels incomplete as the plot shifts focus and races forward, leaving her character arc unresolved.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Flow:**  \n  The pacing of the novel is uneven. While there are moments of depth, particularly in the early sections focusing on Bet, the narrative often feels rushed. The plot \"flits along\" without allowing the reader to fully engage with the characters or their experiences. This lack of balance detracts from the potential of the story.  \n\n- **Potential and Missed Opportunities:**  \n  The novel had the potential to be much more impactful. The premise is compelling, and the exploration of themes like war, societal expectations, and generational conflict is promising. However, the lack of character development and rushed pacing prevent the story from reaching its full potential.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an engaging premise and explores interesting themes, it falls short due to underdeveloped characters and uneven pacing. The focus on Bet early on shows promise, but the narrative ultimately leaves the reader wanting more depth and connection with the characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The pacing becomes disjointed, and the story loses momentum. The latter sections, depicting Katherine as a grandmother, appear unnecessary and wasteful.

The delayed revelation of his death and its circumstances only heightened the frustration."

            "The novel begins as a captivating historical fiction, exploring the CIA and oil companies' role in securing oil from Iran in 1953. However, the narrative soon shifts to 1968, where it centers on the daughter’s rebellion against her privileged upbringing, overshadowing the initial themes. This abrupt transition disrupts the momentum built in the beginning, as the gripping historical intrigue gives way to a story that feels tedious and less engaging. The latter half's focus on the daughter's unrelatable and extreme behavior ultimately diminishes the novel's earlier appeal. ",

In contrast, the daughter, who takes center stage in the latter half, becomes increasingly unrelatable and frustrating. Her rebellion results in a life of squalor, neglect of basic needs, and intentions of destructive actions.",

It then shifts to his children, Katherine and Harry. Katherine becomes an activist, while Harry seems disengaged. The narrative touches on many events and themes but doesn’t delve deeply into any of them, leaving the plot feeling scattered.  \n\n- **Historical Context:**  \n  The historical backdrop, including the overthrow of Iran’s leadership and the Shah’s return to power, was intriguing but underdeveloped. Similarly, the wife’s background in wartime decoding and her unrealized dream of pursuing an English PhD added potential depth but weren’t explored enough.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting premise and historical context, the lack of character depth, uneven pacing, and overly broad scope made it difficult to fully engage with the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While they did not consistently resonate with me, their development in the latter part of the story improved my overall impression.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I picked up this book based on a suggestion that compared it to *The Dutch House*. However, I found no meaningful comparison between the two. In my opinion, *The Dutch House* is far superior, and I would recommend reading that instead.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its slow start and frustrating characters, the story improved toward the end, making it a worthwhile read. However, the comparison to *The Dutch House* was misleading, and I would not recommend this book based on that claim alone.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As the story progresses into the 1960s and 1970s, the family's summer house, the Last House, becomes a central setting.

The older sister takes over the narration in the final portion, reflecting on their family's ties to the oil industry and bringing the story full circle.

            "The story opens with Nick and Bet's relationship, chronicling their efforts to build a family and a fortune. It then shifts focus to their daughter, who grapples with her privileged upbringing amid the radical changes of her generation. While the beginning is engaging and enjoyable, the pacing later slows considerably, making it challenging to stay invested in the narrative.",
            "This novel is a historical fiction family saga that unfolds from the post-WWII era to the present day.",
            "Fans of historical family sagas, particularly those who enjoyed *The Dutch House*, will likely find much to appreciate in this novel. It chronicles the lives of Nick and Bet Taylor, detailing their marriage, family dynamics, and their ascent to wealth through The American Oil Company, ultimately leading to the acquisition of their second home, The Last House."

        "conclusion": "While *Last House* offers an intriguing premise and a compelling start, its slow pacing and difficulty in maintaining engagement made it less enjoyable for me. Despite this, I believe it will resonate with fans of historical family sagas, especially those who enjoyed *The Dutch House*.",
