The plot twists were skillfully executed and felt organic, gradually unfolding as the narrative progressed.

He mentioned being allergic and even closed his windows to avoid the scent, yet later seemed unaffected in Quill’s garden. I suspected this inconsistency could suggest he was the antagonist.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters come to life effortlessly. Quill and his family are fantastical and beautifully written, fitting their non-human nature perfectly. Liam is so well-crafted that I’ve already mentally cast him for a hypothetical movie adaptation. Quill and Liam’s sexualities are celebrated without any hint of shame, which is refreshing and long overdue in storytelling.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The author, Devin Greenlee, excels at bringing both the characters and their world to life. The secret garden, with its flowers, fruit trees, and the ever-suspicious conservatory, is vividly described. I could easily visualize the setting, which felt as alive as the characters themselves.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The book is divided into two distinct parts. The first half focuses on introducing Quill, his family, and Liam, as well as exploring the world through Quill’s eyes—his first film, his first friend, and his initial steps into the real world. The second half ramps up the action, tying together elements from the first half. While the two parts are different in pacing, they complement each other perfectly.  \n\n- **Pacing and Suspense:**  \n  The first half is slower, allowing readers to immerse themselves in the world and characters, while the second half is faster and more action-packed.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story revolves around Quill, a seventeen-year-old male dryad who is the first of his kind and lacks any magical abilities. He yearns to escape his family’s garden business and experience the outside world, but his mother insists he’s not ready. The plot takes a turn when Quill’s new neighbor, Liam, enters his life, introducing him to a world of technology and modernity. However, as Quill explores this new world, danger begins to threaten the magical garden he calls home.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Quill is a relatable protagonist, defined by his frustration with his sheltered life and his desire for normalcy. His unique identity as a male dryad without magic adds depth to his character. Liam, the neighbor, serves as a contrast to Quill’s world, representing modernity and technology. Their dynamic is engaging, with Quill finding Liam both irritating and irresistibly attractive.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel creates a fascinating blend of the magical and the mundane.

This juxtaposition enriches the setting and highlights the tension between the two worlds.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The story explores themes of self-discovery, the clash between tradition and modernity, and the desire for freedom. Quill’s journey reflects the universal struggle of finding one’s place in the world while navigating external expectations and dangers.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**  \n  The narrative builds tension effectively as Quill’s exploration of the outside world coincides with the growing threat to his magical garden.

            "The story suffers from significant plot holes, particularly Quill's surprising ignorance about humans despite his access to modern technology. The narrative might have been more effective as a historical fantasy or with a more knowledgeable protagonist. Additionally, the novel could benefit from another round of editing to improve its writing, worldbuilding, and character development.",
            "In this story, the main character Quill is hard to connect with due to his immaturity and pettiness. His cringe-worthy lines aimed at antagonizing the love interest come off as unrealistic, even for a younger audience. The novel’s efforts to resonate with a YA readership feel forced and lack the quality writing and authentic Gen Z representation that one would expect. Additionally, the portrayal of technology use seems unrealistic and disappointing.",
            "The writing often fell into a literal style, relying too heavily on telling rather than showing. The inner dialogue and emotional explanations felt excessive, undermining the reader's intelligence, even for a YA audience. Overall, the prose seemed immature, resembling a rough first draft.",
            "The worldbuilding in this story is confusing and underdeveloped. Key elements, such as the garden and the rules of magic, remain unclear, resulting in numerous unanswered questions. Additionally, the contemporary urban fantasy setting feels inconsistent with the main character's surprising ignorance about humans, despite their access to the internet and media.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Setting:**  \n   - The novel is a queer urban fantasy romance centered around Quill, a half-dryad teenage boy living a sheltered life in his mother’s secret garden filled with magical plants.  \n   - The story explores Quill’s desire to break free from his mother’s plans and experience the normal world, which he begins to do after meeting his new neighbor, Liam.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Quill and Liam’s relationship is tender and heartfelt, chronicling the exploration of friendship and romance between two teenage boys—one from the magical world and one from the mundane world.  \n   - Their interactions, from simple texts to watching movies and driving around town, are sweet and quintessentially teen romance, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n   - The first three-quarters of the book focus on the romance and Quill’s gradual integration into the normal world, which I found engaging and well-paced.  \n   - The last quarter takes an abrupt turn involving the secret garden and a sinister emerging threat. This shift felt sudden and lacked sufficient foreshadowing, making it less impactful.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n   - The conflict surrounding the dying plants and the sinister force in the garden is introduced late and resolved quickly, leaving me wanting more depth and emotional impact.  \n   - The resolution felt rushed, and I believe more hints and development of this storyline would have made it more satisfying.  \n\n- **Genre Balance:**  \n   - The novel delivers more on the tender gay romance than on its fantastical elements. While the romance is well-executed, the fantasy aspects, particularly the garden’s mystery, could have been more developed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Evergreen* is a heartfelt and tender queer romance that beautifully captures the exploration of friendship and love between two teenage boys.

It didn't feel fully developed or immersive.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Liam lacked personality, making him feel flat and unengaging.  \n  - Quill's personality didn't align well with his backstory. Despite having never left his home or interacted with people outside his family, he was overly sarcastic in every interaction. His sudden change in behavior (e.g., accepting his mom's opinion without opposition for 17 years, then falling in love with someone he barely knew) felt inconsistent and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Memorability and Engagement:**  \n  - The book failed to leave a lasting impression. Not a single aspect of the story was interesting enough to stick with me, making it the type of book I’ll likely forget I ever read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book struggled with pacing, underdeveloped world-building, inconsistent character arcs, and a lack of creativity in its plot and setting. These issues made it difficult to stay engaged, and the story ultimately failed to leave a memorable impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The addition of queer representation and the unique idea of Quill being the first male dryad ever adds to the appeal. However, the potential of this premise isn’t fully realized, as many interesting questions (e.g., why Quill is the first male dryad) are left unexplored.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Quill, the protagonist, has a vaguely Rapunzel-like story and is an interesting character in theory, but his development feels incomplete. Liam, the love interest, is described as \"meh\" and lacks depth. The big reveal about Liam toward the end of the book is hand-waved away, which detracts from the story and makes it hard to connect with him. Overall, none of the characters are sufficiently developed to create a strong emotional attachment.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot starts with promise but falls short in execution. The story lacks depth and fails to capitalize on its unique ideas. The ending feels rushed and underdeveloped, to the point where I had to double-check if I had missed chapters.

            "I preferred the mystery elements to the romance, but the plot centered primarily on Quill and Liam's relationship. The romance escalated too quickly, undermining its authenticity.

It’s not one that I’d say translates as well into adult readers, as the feelings and settings have a middle-grade to YA vibe.  \n  - The story feels very high school (not in a negative way, just in a way that matches that maturity level).  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  - The pacing is a little slow at first, but that’s my literal only critique.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - I loved both main characters.  \n  - The complex dynamic of discovering sexuality and navigating parental and sibling relationships as things (including the protagonist) change was well done.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The story is poignant and heartwarming.  \n  - The way the main character discovers his gifts and his role in the new world that builds after the seeming destruction of all he’s ever known is compelling.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - This book was exactly what I needed when I read it.  \n  - It’s a solid read, and I loved it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis YA novel delivers a poignant and heartwarming story with relatable characters and themes of self-discovery, family dynamics, and navigating change.

Additionally, Quill's repetitive self-blame, while characteristic of a teenager, became a bit tiresome.  \n\n- **Plot Twist and Surprise Elements:**  \n  The plot twist was quite unexpected.

            "Quill is a stubborn, selfish, sarcastic, and bitter character, yet he also displays moments of naivety. While I generally enjoy unlikable narrators, it's unclear if Quill's traits were intended. His teenage impulsiveness and poor decision-making initially felt refreshing, but his character development arrives too late and feels abrupt; I would have preferred a more gradual evolution. Additionally, Quill's narration is inconsistent, which seems unintentional. For instance, he claims to know every inch of the garden in one chapter, only to later reveal he’s never been allowed in certain areas and has hardly ventured beyond the front. These inconsistencies contribute to plot holes and convenient excuses that are difficult to overlook.",
            "This book exhibits notable inconsistencies and plot holes that seem to stem from insufficient editing. I often found myself fact-checking details—like the chlorine in tap water and the non-vegan status of most gummy worms—and flipping back to resolve contradictions in the text. Despite its solid foundation and brilliant moments, particularly with the 'big bad' and a compelling creeping horror concept introduced in the final quarter, the overall execution feels rushed and underdeveloped.",
            "The story's strength lies in its soft world-building, which is both engaging and easy to grasp. The gentle, fun fantasy elements create truly shining moments throughout. Particularly captivating is the well-executed concept of a family of dryads.",
            "*Evergreen* is an engaging urban fantasy and coming-of-age tale that highlights the romance between Quill, a male druid with enchanting, Rapunzel-like traits, and Liam, the boy next door. The narrative centers on Quill's efforts to nurture his family’s magical garden while contending with his feelings of inadequacy due to his lack of magical abilities at 17."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Connection to *The Secret Garden*:**\n   - The book is only loosely a reimagining of *The Secret Garden*, which was initially a point of interest for me. However, I’ve learned to take such comparisons with a grain of salt.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**\n   - *Evergreen* is an urban fantasy coming-of-age story with a strong focus on romance between Quill, a male druid with Rapunzel-like qualities, and Liam, the boy next door. The story revolves around Quill’s struggle to care for his family’s magical garden while grappling with his lack of magical abilities at 17.\n\n- **Characterization (Quill):**\n   - Quill is stubborn, selfish, sarcastic, and bitter, yet also naive at times. I typically enjoy unlikable narrators, and Quill fits that mold, though I’m unsure if this was intentional. His teenage impulsiveness and poor decision-making felt refreshing initially, but his growth as a character comes too late and too suddenly. I would have preferred a slower, more gradual development.\n   - Quill’s narration is inconsistent, which doesn’t seem intentional. For example, he claims to know every inch of the garden in one chapter, then later reveals he’s never been allowed in certain parts, and later still admits he hardly strayed past the front. These inconsistencies extend to other areas of the writing, creating plot holes and convenient excuses that were hard to overlook.\n\n- **World-Building and Fantasy Elements:**\n   - The soft world-building is the most developed aspect of the story. The fantasy elements are gentle, fun, and easy to understand, providing moments that genuinely shine. The concept of a family of dryads was intriguing and well-executed.\n\n- **Writing and Editing:**\n   - The book suffers from inconsistencies and plot holes, which could have been resolved with more thorough editing. For example, I found myself fact-checking details (e.g., tap water containing chlorine, most gummy worms not being vegan) and flipping back to confirm contradictions in the text.\n   - The story has a solid foundation and moments of brilliance, such as the ‘big bad’ and the final quarter of the book, which introduced a fantastic creeping horror concept. However, the overall execution felt rushed and underdeveloped.\n\n- **Potential and Future Prospects:**\n   - Despite its flaws, the book has the bones of a great story, and the author, Greenlee, shows promise. With more development and a stronger editorial process, future works could be truly impressive. I’ll be keeping an eye on this author.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Evergreen* is a mixed bag with a compelling premise and moments of brilliance, particularly in its world-building and the final act’s creeping horror. However, inconsistent characterization, plot holes, and a rushed execution detract from its potential. With more editing and development, this could have been a standout debut. While it didn’t fully meet my expectations, I’m optimistic about the author’s future work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2.5/5\n\n[I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own. Huge thanks to NetGalley and Entangled Publishing for this ARC.]"

While there is a secret garden, the connection to *The Secret Garden* is minimal. However, I didn’t mind this because the story stands well on its own.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The basic story and plot were interesting. It follows Quill, a half-human, half-dryad boy, as he searches for his purpose while being sheltered from the world by his mother. The story held my attention well and moved at a good pace.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Quill and Liam’s relationship was enjoyable to watch, especially their secret adventures and the chemistry between them. However, their romance felt rushed. Quill, who had never met a human before, fell for Liam too quickly, and their bond was confirmed by a magical love plant, which felt too convenient.  \n   - Liam’s betrayal of Quill was a significant letdown. While I understood his motivations, taking more than one item and hiding his actions made his quick forgiveness feel unearned. The story needed more effort on Liam’s part to rebuild trust.  \n\n- **Mystery and Villain:**  \n   - The mystery surrounding the garden break-ins was engaging, but the resolution was disappointing. The villain felt underdeveloped, and their defeat lacked impact, though the twist added some intrigue.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Strengths:**  \n   - Despite some weaknesses, I enjoyed the book overall. It’s a simple YA story with magical elements that held my attention. The story could have benefited from more developmental tweaks, but it wasn’t bad by any means.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a decent YA novel with an interesting premise and engaging moments, particularly in the relationship between Quill and Liam. However, the rushed romance, underdeveloped villain, and lack of depth in certain areas hold it back from being exceptional.

            "The romance is a central focus of the book, with Liam's intense approach often feeling excessive and occasionally cringe-worthy. However, I appreciated the snarky banter between him and the protagonist, Quill. While Liam is thoughtful and takes initiative, he does act selfishly at one point, though his intentions are understandable. I found his conventional attractiveness off-putting; I prefer relationships where attraction develops gradually rather than being immediate. Quill's obliviousness to Liam's interest is both frustrating and relatable, given his sheltered upbringing. He embodies typical teenage traits—impulsive, prone to saying regrettable things, and having questionable tastes, like an affinity for royal family documentaries. His motivations and choices feel authentic for a boy who has never ventured outside his comfort zone, making his inexperience with romance both maddening and somewhat justifiable.",
            "I'm not a fan of the typical YA writing style, particularly the first-person, present tense approach. The prose felt awkward at times, with sentences like \"I get so angry at her\" and \"it's too dark to let him see me blush\" lacking nuance. While this style might resonate with younger readers, it didn't connect with me.",

            "In this story, the family dynamics surrounding Quill come across as unrealistic and abusive, particularly with his mother and sister imprisoning him and forcing him into hard labor. Quill's deep attachment to his family and his swift forgiveness after moments of justifiable anger feel inauthentic. The characters lack depth, making it seem as though we’ve been dropped into a fanfiction where their backgrounds are assumed. Quill's motivations and personality, apart from his familial obligations, remain unclear. Laurel's role as the supposed \"prodigy\" and her relationship with Quill warrant further exploration. In contrast, Liam emerges as the most developed character, driven by loneliness and a desire to support his dad, with interests like swimming that flesh him out. The romance between Quill and Liam is sweet and fitting for a YA story. Quill’s fluctuating moods and quick shifts in opinion reflect an authentic teenage experience.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Cover Design:**  \n   - The cover of *Evergreen* is stunning and immediately caught my attention. It perfectly captures the magical essence of the story.  \n\n- **Premise and World-Building:**  \n   - The story revolves around Quill, a seventeen-year-old male dryad who lacks magical abilities but yearns for adventure beyond his family's magical garden.  \n   - The world-building is unique and imaginative, blending magic and technology in a way that feels fresh and intriguing.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Quill's character is relatable, and his desire for normalcy and freedom is compelling.  \n   - The blossoming relationship between Quill and Liam is heartwarming and entertaining. Their interactions are a highlight of the book, and I found myself rooting for their connection to grow stronger.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot is engaging, with Quill's exploration of the outside world leading to escalating danger that threatens both his freedom and the magical garden.  \n   - The pacing keeps the story moving, though there are moments where I wished for more depth and development.  \n\n- **Themes and Exploration of Ideas:**  \n   - The concept of plant magic and the history of dryads are fascinating but underexplored. Additional background information would have enhanced my understanding and appreciation of these elements.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing is enjoyable, though not perfect. It effectively conveys the story's magical and adventurous tone.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Evergreen* by Devin Greenlee is a delightful read that combines magic, romance, and adventure in a unique and imaginative world. While the writing has its flaws and certain aspects of the story could have been more deeply explored, the book is captivating overall.

            "The ending felt rushed, as though the story should have been a duology but was condensed into a single book, resulting in a flat and unsatisfying conclusion. While I generally dislike tropes such as miscommunication and insta-love, this book managed to navigate them well for the most part. However, I did notice some discrepancies in the timeline and character interactions. For instance, in Chapter 29, Quill mentions he hasn't seen Liam for a few days yet later references an interaction from the previous night. This inconsistency occurs at least once more. Quill's rapid mastery of his powers also felt unrealistic, and the climactic battle with Azazel lacked tension, ultimately making the resolution feel unsatisfactory.",
            "The characters experience instalove, which feels unrealistic, particularly with Liam. While Quill's perspective is more believable due to his inexperience with relationships, Liam's rapid descent into true love, despite being handsome and popular, strains credibility.",
            "The wording was occasionally unclear, making it challenging to grasp the storyline.",
            "I was captivated by the concept of this book. Dryads and nymphs are enchanting beings that often lack representation in literature, making this a refreshing addition to the genre of magical creatures.",
            "The book begins with a compelling start that captured my attention right from the first 30%. Despite its length, I found myself fully immersed and finished it quickly."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *Evergreen* had a refreshing premise and a strong start, but it was hindered by inconsistencies, rushed pacing, and some unrealistic character dynamics. Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the book and believe the author has great potential. With some reworking, this story could shine even brighter.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Premise:**  \n   - I loved the idea for this book. Dryads or nymphs are mystical creatures that don’t get enough stories about them, and this was a refreshing take on a magical creature book.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n   - The book started out very strong. The first 30% had me really intrigued and invested. It’s a long book, but I finished it very quickly.  \n\n- **Tropes and Execution:**  \n   - The book included some tropes I’m not the biggest fan of, like miscommunication and insta-love. However, if done well, I can forgive these, and for the most part, this book accomplished that.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - The characters are very instalove, which comes off as unrealistic, especially on Liam’s part. Quill’s perspective is more believable since he’s inexperienced with interactions, but Liam, portrayed as handsome and popular, falling in true love so quickly felt hard to believe.  \n\n- **Plot Consistency and Logic:**  \n   - There are discrepancies in the timeline and character interactions. For example, in Chapter 29, Quill says, “I haven’t seen Liam for a few days,” but later mentions an interaction from the night before. This inconsistency happens at least one other time.  \n   - Quill discovering his powers and instantly mastering them felt unrealistic. The climactic battle with Azazel lacked tension and felt rushed, making the resolution unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Clarity:**  \n   - At times, the wording was hard to follow, making it difficult to understand what was happening.  \n\n- **Ending and Structure:**  \n   - The ending felt rushed, as if the story should have been a duology but was condensed into one book. This left the conclusion feeling flat and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Author Potential and Future Work:**  \n   - This is Devin Greenlee’s debut novel, and I can only see his writing and books improving from here. I would read more by this author and hope he considers reworking this novel to address its issues, potentially expanding it into a series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Evergreen* had a refreshing premise and a strong start, but it was hindered by inconsistencies, rushed pacing, and some unrealistic character dynamics. Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the book and believe the author has great potential. With some reworking, this story could shine even brighter.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The first 80% of the book centers on the playful flirtation between Quill and Liam, which is enjoyable but leaves little space for the main conflict. As a result, the climax feels rushed in the final 20%, making the emotional moments come across as mere plot devices rather than genuine opportunities for character or story development. If Azazel was aware of Quill's powers and feared them, why didn’t he target Quill first?",
            "The story had the potential for a richer exploration of the parent-child relationship, especially between Quill and his mother, which could have better resonated with a teenage audience. Quill's struggle with his lack of powers and his failure to notice the signs throughout the narrative was engaging. However, the abrupt appearance and mastery of his powers at the end felt unrealistic and convenient.",
            "The writing had a youthful tone, which is to be expected in a teen book. While this didn't impact my rating, it's something for other readers to consider.",
            "The concept of a dryad family operating a flower shop is both adorable and unique. I would have loved to see more scenes highlighting their interactions with customers and the daily workings of the shop. Additionally, the portrayal of a sweet gay romance, where being gay isn't a source of conflict, is both refreshing and enjoyable."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The book had a lot of potential, particularly with its charming premise and refreshing take on a gay romance. However, the pacing was uneven, the conflict felt rushed, and the resolution lacked depth and logical consistency. While there were enjoyable moments, the story needed a stronger grasp of its stakes and more thoughtful development of its central conflict.",

I wish there had been more scenes showcasing their interactions with customers and the day-to-day operations of the shop.  \n   - The idea of a cute, gay romance where being gay wasn’t part of the conflict was refreshing and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing felt young, which is understandable given that it’s a teen book. This didn’t affect my rating but is worth noting for other readers.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - The first ~80% of the book focused heavily on Quill and Liam flirting and sneaking out on dates, which was fun but left little room for the main conflict.  \n   - The major conflict felt rushed in the last 20%, making the emotional moments seem like devices for dialogue rather than opportunities for genuine character or story development.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - There was potential for a deeper exploration of the parent/child relationship, particularly between Quill and his mother, which could have resonated more with a teenage audience.  \n   - The struggle with Quill not having his powers and not noticing the signs throughout the book was intriguing, but the sudden emergence and mastery of his powers at the end felt unrealistic and convenient.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n   - The climax and resolution were rushed and unsatisfying. Key plot points, such as Azazel’s motivations and actions, didn’t hold up under scrutiny. For example:  \n     - If Azazel knew about Quill’s powers and feared them, why wasn’t Quill the first mind Azazel targeted?  \n     - If Quill’s mind was protected by the phantom root, why didn’t Azazel just kill him?  \n     - If Azazel was already in Laurel’s mind, why would she have given Quill the phantom root in the first place?  \n   - The flower blooming as a symbol of true love between two seventeen-year-olds who had only known each other for two weeks felt overly sentimental and cringe-worthy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had a lot of potential, particularly with its charming premise and refreshing take on a gay romance. However, the pacing was uneven, the conflict felt rushed, and the resolution lacked depth and logical consistency.

            "The characters, particularly Quill and Liam, felt underdeveloped. Although I found myself rooting for them, they lacked depth and distinctive qualities. Quill's identity as the first male dryad in his family was intriguing, but his budding romance overshadowed opportunities for meaningful introspection. His inexperience with the human world served as his main character trait but remained underexplored. Additionally, the supporting characters failed to make a lasting impact.",

Confined to a magical garden that sustains dryads yet devoid of their powers, Quill's world shifts with the arrival of Liam, a new neighbor. Their relationship oscillates between hostility and fascination, with Liam encouraging Quill to explore the outside world—a challenge for Quill as he grapples with adaptation. The slow-burn romance between Quill and Liam dominates the first thirty chapters, providing a compelling focal point for the narrative.",

Liam helps Quill explore the outside world, which Quill struggles to adapt to.\n   - The slow-burn romance between the boys is a central focus for the first 30 chapters.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The magical garden begins to decay, threatening the entire world. This subplot, with its eerie, horror-like atmosphere and heightened emotions, is what truly defined the book’s vibe for me.\n   - However, this tension only builds in the later chapters, making the narrative feel slow for much of the book.\n\n- **Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n   - The absence of erotic scenes is a refreshing change.\n   - The lush, magical vegetation is so vivid it practically begs for a film adaptation.\n   - The main antagonist ultimately adds momentum to the story.\n   - Despite its strengths, I’m unsure if I’d revisit the book a second time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book has its flaws, particularly in pacing and the delayed buildup of tension, it offers a unique retelling of *Rapunzel* with a magical, atmospheric twist.

            "The story's pacing felt uneven, at times veering into the unrealistic. For instance, when Quill’s family garden—the lifeblood of the dryads—faces a serious issue, Quill surprisingly chooses to focus on his new relationship with Liam instead. Moreover, the resolution of the mystery surrounding the garden break-in felt rushed and oddly executed. \n\nThat said, I absolutely adored the plot and the main character, Quill, a teenage dryad who is both the only male in his family and devoid of powers, leaving him feeling like an outcast. His sheltered upbringing adds depth to his character. The sweet and endearing coming-of-age romance between him and a human boy has immense potential, and I loved this aspect of the story!",
            "Quill's character was well-developed and engaging, but Liam, the love interest, felt underdeveloped in comparison to Quill, his sister, and even their mother. This lack of depth in Liam's character hindered the romantic relationship's development, particularly given his significant presence in the story.",

A teenage dryad who is the only male dryad and doesn’t have any powers, making him feel like an outcast in his family, yet he’s also been sheltered from the world—I LOVE it! The concept of him meeting a human boy and having an adorable, sweet coming-of-age romance has loads and loads of potential.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Quill’s character was well-developed and engaging, but Liam, the love interest, felt underdeveloped compared to Quill, his sister, and even his mother. This lack of depth in Liam’s character hurt the development of the romantic relationship, especially since he had so much on-page time.  \n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  The dialogue was overly cliché.

For example, there was a very concerning issue with Quill’s family garden (the lifesource of the dryads), but Quill seemed content to prioritize his new relationship with Liam over addressing it. Additionally, the resolution of the lifesource-garden-break-in mystery felt rushed and strange.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I’m glad I read this book.

While it features a secret garden, the story diverges significantly from the original and does not present an urban fantasy take.

While there is a garden and it is secret, the story diverges significantly from the classic, and it is not an urban fantasy version of the original.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing is slow at the start, but the story becomes more enjoyable once it picks up.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Tone:**  \n  The book is very much a YA novel, with a strong focus on teenage angst and young love. This shifts the focus away from building the fantasy elements, which may not appeal to readers looking for a more developed fantasy world.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The fantasy aspects, including the magic system and world history, are only vaguely explored. Most of the fantasy elements are introduced towards the end, which feels rushed and leaves the stakes feeling relatively low despite the significant events.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance is sweet and adds a light, enjoyable element to the story.  \n\n- **Replay Value:**  \n  While the book was enjoyable, it is not one I would revisit.  \n\n- **Suitability for Younger Readers:**  \n  I believe a younger audience would enjoy this book much more, as it aligns well with YA themes and tone.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book is a light, easy read with a sweet romance and some enjoyable fantasy elements.

            "The story follows Quill, the first male Dryad in history, who is devoid of the magic that his female relatives possess. To safeguard their secret, his mother keeps him hidden from the outside world. Quill's life takes a turn when he meets Liam, igniting a newfound boldness and curiosity about the human realm. Initially, his desire to explore alongside Liam appears innocent, but a darker, more sinister undercurrent soon emerges. As Quill ventures out, the garden itself begins to transform, and these changes may not bode well for him or his world."

This kept the narrative moving quickly and made it easier to read in shorter sittings.  \n\n- **Potential for Improvement:**  \n  With revisions to the story and prose, *Evergreen* could be significantly improved. There’s potential here, but it feels underdeveloped in its current form.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Evergreen* has a fast-paced narrative and short chapters that make it an easy read, the prose, dialogue, and characterization fall short. The story has potential, but it would benefit from further refinement to enhance its emotional impact and consistency.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
