        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Intent and Misinterpretation:**\n   - I believe the one-star reviewers misunderstood the author's statement in the Q&A section, particularly the phrase “I’ve always had a fascination with the Holocaust.” They failed to read the full context, where the author explains his fascination with the subject matter and its historical significance. Shame on them for misrepresenting his intent.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Difficulty of the Novel:**\n   - This was a tough read for me. At times, I felt other novels had covered similar subject matter in comparable ways. However, most of the time, I found this novel to be even harsher and more disturbing than those previous works—but in a good way. The horrors depicted should not be hidden; they must be confronted.\n\n- **Handling of Subject Matter:**\n   - The author, Richards, does an amazing job with the subject matter. He handles it with care while vividly portraying the sheer terror people endured, the ways families were torn apart, and the desperate measures taken for survival. His approach is both respectful and unflinching.\n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**\n   - I loved the prose. The writing is compelling and adds depth to the narrative, making this a novel not to be missed.\n\n- **Personal Reflection and Identity:**\n   - As a member of the LGBTQ+ community (though not Jewish), I appreciate the importance of confronting uncomfortable truths in literature. This novel challenges readers to face history as it was, not as we might wish it to be.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a hard but essential read. Rather than focusing on a single sentence in the Q&A or the author's background, readers should evaluate the novel for what it is: a powerful, unflinching portrayal of historical horrors. Literature is not always meant to be comfortable, and this novel succeeds in delivering a profound and necessary experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating score is mentioned in the review."

            "The story unfolds from World War II to 1968, tracing Charles' journey from Auschwitz to New York, where he confronts his former abuser, Berthold Werden. The narrative employs a non-linear structure, presenting events from 1968 in chronological order while using flashbacks to reveal Charles' past in reverse. This approach effectively mirrors his journey of self-discovery and identity reclamation.",

Berthold Werden, the Nazi officer, embodies a disturbing blend of abuse and twisted affection, creating a morally ambiguous and unsettling dynamic.

            "Set in 1968 America, the story follows Charles as he spots Berthold in a café, stirring up the possibility of reigniting their past romance. The novel's true beauty emerges as Charles comes to terms with the realization that his memories of Berthold were an illusion. He must confront this truth for the sake of his younger self and his family, who have become mere \"ghosts\" in his life.",
            "The relationship between Karel (Charles) and Obersturmbannführer Berthold Werden is both complex and unsettling. Initially, Karel becomes Berthold's lover as a survival tactic to protect his family, but this strategy ultimately fails. Karel's internal struggle—his hope of holding significance for Berthold—adds emotional depth to the narrative.",
            "The summary piqued my interest, particularly because part of the story unfolds in 1968, which I believed would offer a crucial counterpoint to the darker historical elements. This balance was effectively realized.",
            "The title intricately weaves into the narrative, delving into the concept that individuals can embody numerous identities while remaining unknown, even to themselves—essentially becoming ghosts. The protagonist, Charles Ward (formerly Charles Werden and Karel Benakov), embodies this theme as he navigates his fragmented identity through time and trauma.",
            "The novel *We Are Only Ghosts* captivated me from the start and will linger in my mind for a long time. At first, the cover—showing a concentration camp tattoo on a waiter’s forearm—made me hesitant, as I often find World War II fiction, particularly romantic stories set in Auschwitz, to be unnecessary."

Richards hooked me quickly and will stay with me for a long time.  \n   - The cover, featuring a concentration camp tattoo on a waiter’s forearm, initially made me wary, as I often find fiction set during World War II, especially involving romance in Auschwitz or similar settings, unnecessary.  \n\n- **Setting and Time Period:**  \n   - The summary intrigued me because part of the story takes place in 1968, which I thought would provide a necessary balance to the darker historical elements. This balance was indeed achieved.  \n\n- **Themes and Title Significance:**  \n   - The title is deeply woven into the narrative, exploring the idea that a person can embody countless identities and still remain unknown, even to themselves—essentially, a ghost.  \n   - The protagonist, Charles Ward (formerly Charles Werden and Karel Benakov), embodies this theme as he navigates his fractured identity across time and trauma.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n   - The relationship between Karel (Charles) and Obersturmbannfuhrer Berthold Werden is complex and disturbing. It begins as a survival tactic, with Karel agreeing to become Berthold’s lover to protect his family, though it ultimately fails to save them.  \n   - Karel’s internal conflict—his hope that he might mean something to Berthold—adds layers of emotional depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n   - The story shifts to 1968 America, where Charles recognizes Berthold in a café and grapples with the possibility of rekindling their past relationship.  \n   - The true beauty of the novel lies in Charles’ realization that his past with Berthold was a mirage, and he must confront the truth for the sake of his younger self and his family, who are now “only ghosts.”  \n\n- **Strengths of the Novel:**  \n   - Charles’ journey of self-discovery and self-reflection is both simple and profound, making the story deeply moving.  \n\n- **Critique:**  \n   - One small issue is the decision to make Berthold’s fake identity in America a Jewish jeweler, which feels unnecessary and borderline disrespectful. While the irony aligns with the theme of ghosts, the story could have achieved the same impact without this detail.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its heavy subject matter and one minor critique, *We Are Only Ghosts* is a powerful and emotionally resonant novel. Charles’ story is profoundly moving, and the exploration of identity, trauma, and self-discovery is masterfully executed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars  \n\n**Content Warnings:**  \nRape, murder, mental abuse, physical abuse, and other Nazi-era atrocities.  \n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nI received an early copy of *We Are Only Ghosts* through NetGalley & Kensington in exchange for an honest and original review. All thoughts are my own."

            "In this story, Charles, a Holocaust victim and gay man, is portrayed with limited depth beyond these two identities. The author misses opportunities to delve into Charles's personality and motivations, particularly during pivotal moments like his reunion with Berthold, his personal losses, and the reclamation of his birth certificate. As a result, Charles often comes across as a passive observer, functioning more as a straight man to the surrounding events. This may unintentionally reflect the theme of lost Jewish identity, but it ultimately leaves his character feeling underdeveloped.",

It compels readers to confront uncomfortable truths, such as the presence of homosexuality during this dark period and the complexities of human sexuality in such a harrowing context. While one might wonder if the story could have been set in a different era, the Holocaust backdrop provides an essential layer of discomfort and historical significance.",

Despite the narrative's rich potential for poignant storytelling, the author falls short of fully capitalizing on these opportunities, requiring me to fill in the gaps."

The 1968 sections are electric, vividly portraying Charles's confusion, pain, and surrealism with evocative prose and a tension that approaches thriller-like intensity. In contrast, the World War II flashbacks feel redundant and unoriginal, adding little to the narrative and often echoing other Holocaust stories, such as *Schindler’s List*.",
            "The author, who is not Jewish and lacks personal ties to the Holocaust, addresses this in a discussion section at the end of the book. This raises questions about the decision to portray Holocaust scenes from a Jewish perspective, which can sometimes feel insensitive and emotionally opportunistic. The relationship between Charles and Berthold is complex, navigating the duality of captor and lover, abuser and father figure, as well as war criminal and survivor.",

Richards, is not Jewish and has no personal connections to the Holocaust, which is revealed in a discussion section at the end of the book.  \n   - As a non-Jewish person, Richards’s decision to recreate Holocaust scenes from a Jewish perspective is questionable and, at times, feels insensitive and emotionally opportunistic.  \n\n- **Premise and Themes**  \n   - The novel has a fascinating premise: a gay Jewish Holocaust survivor, Charles, encounters his former Nazi captor and lover, Berthold, in 1968 New York City.  \n   - The story thoughtfully explores themes of identity, trauma, abuse, and morality, focusing on Charles’s struggle to reclaim his selfhood after unspeakable suffering.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing**  \n   - The book follows a non-linear timeline, alternating between 1968 and Charles’s experiences during World War II.  \n   - The 1968 sections are electric, capturing Charles’s confusion, pain, and surrealness with evocative prose and tension that borders on thriller-like intensity.  \n   - The World War II flashbacks, however, feel redundant, unoriginal, and unnecessary, as they add little to the story and are often derivative of other Holocaust narratives like *Schindler’s List*.  \n\n- **Characterization and Emotional Depth**  \n   - Charles is portrayed as a deeply traumatized individual, numb and hollow, yet Richards conveys his emotional state with empathy and clarity.  \n   - The dynamics between Charles and Berthold are complex, exploring the duality of their relationship as captor/lover, abuser/father figure, and war criminal/survivor.  \n\n- **Strengths and Weaknesses**  \n   - Strengths: The 1968 narrative is compelling, emotionally resonant, and thought-provoking, with a strong focus on Charles’s trauma and identity.  \n   - Weaknesses: The Holocaust flashbacks are problematic, redundant, and detract from the overall impact of the story. The book could have been more effective as a novella focused solely on the 1968 narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*We Are Only Ghosts* by Jeffrey L.

As a cis female, I found it hard to reconcile this dynamic, though I acknowledge it as a unique perspective within the story.  \n   - The book offers a thought-provoking narrative that could spark intense discussions in academic settings, particularly in psychology and LGBTQ history courses.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n   - Readers who enjoyed *Lolita* by Vladimir Nabokov and *My Dark Vanessa* by Kate Elizabeth Russell will find this book equally thought-provoking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a powerful exploration of identity, resilience, and justice, set against the harrowing backdrop of WWII and the Holocaust. While some narrative choices were challenging to reconcile, the story’s emotional depth, vivid settings, and well-developed characters make it a compelling and thought-provoking read. The moments of hope and grace provide a necessary balance to the darker themes, leaving a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Additionally, it includes depictions of gay sex and Jewish experiences during WWII. If these topics are sensitive for you, this may not be the right book.  \n\n- **Representation of Gay Men:**  \n  I generally dislike the portrayal of gay men as predators of young boys or as individuals seeking relationships with significant age gaps. This book depicts most gay men in this light, which was surprising, especially since the author is a gay man himself.  \n\n- **Author's Background and Authenticity:**  \n  The author, Jeffrey Richards, is neither Jewish nor a survivor of WWII. While I don’t believe this disqualifies someone from writing such a story, it’s important to be mindful of not overshadowing the voices of actual survivors. I feel the author handled this aspect fairly well.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Jewish Experience:**  \n  The book vividly portrays the hardships, treatment, and torture endured by Jewish people during WWII, as well as the loss of identity many faced in their struggle for survival. This aspect of the story is deeply moving and well-researched.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The protagonist, Charles, is introduced as a young boy in Czechoslovakia during the German occupation. His journey of self-discovery—realizing he is gay, finding his strength, and fighting to survive—is heartbreaking. The loss of his name, family, home, and religion, coupled with the constant threat of death, makes his story both tragic and compelling. The emotional baggage he carries into adulthood is profoundly impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply emotional and harrowing exploration of survival, identity, and resilience during WWII. While the portrayal of gay men as predators was disappointing, the author’s handling of Jewish experiences and the protagonist’s journey was compelling and respectful.

Set against the backdrop of 1968 New York, where Charles works at a French café, the narrative intertwines his present with his wartime experiences. These flashbacks skillfully reveal Charles' past, crafting a compelling and intricate story. The pacing allows for a gradual exploration of the characters' histories and relationships, keeping me thoroughly engaged.",

Berthold, a high-ranking German official from Auschwitz, is a complex figure, grappling with the dangers of being openly gay in that era. The dynamic between Charles and Berthold is marked by power imbalances and coercion, as Charles is compelled to engage in intimacy to evade being sent back to the camp.",

Richards, crafts a slow, seductive, and conditioned narrative that envelops the reader, creating a sense of submission and anticipation for its punishing conclusion.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Depth:**  \n   - The novel is described as a devastating work that annihilates the soul, exploring the cost of undying servitude and the psychological scars of captivity.  \n   - It raises questions about whether Charles can ever escape Berthold’s dominance, adding layers of tension and emotional complexity.  \n\n- **Audience and Maturity Level:**  \n   - The story is intended for adult readers due to its mature and intense themes.  \n   - It is a rewarding but harrowing tale that leaves a lasting impact, altering the reader’s perspective.  \n\n- **Symbolism and Imagery:**  \n   - The barbed wire of Auschwitz serves as a metaphor for Berthold’s steely-eyed dominance, symbolizing both physical and psychological imprisonment.  \n   - The imagery of war robbing youth on “black matador wings” evokes a sense of loss, trauma, and the inescapable scars of conflict.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“We Are Only Ghosts” is a profoundly unsettling yet compelling novel that explores the dark complexities of power, love, and survival in the context of war.

While it is a difficult read due to its heavy themes and triggers, the author's ability to craft memorable scenes and develop a compelling protagonist makes it a powerful story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The first few chapters made me think it might be a romance novel, but my gut told me to stick with it, and I’m glad I did.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n   - The book is a very emotional tale of a survivor of a concentration camp, detailing his life before, during, and after the war.  \n   - It explores themes of love lost and found, suffering and survival, and hitting rock bottom yet clawing one’s way back up.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Realism:**  \n   - While the story is fictional, the backdrop of the Holocaust is very real. Having read several stories and articles about the Holocaust, this book deepened my understanding of how awful it was and the immense suffering people endured.  \n\n- **Personal Reflection and Recommendation:**  \n   - I am glad I gave the book a chance, as it was not the type of novel I initially feared it would be. It deserves the attention and appreciation it receives.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n   - Thank you to Goodreads, Jeffrey L. Richards, and Kensington Books for the advanced copy. I voluntarily reviewed this book with no compensation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel exceeded my expectations, delivering a powerful and emotional story set against the harrowing backdrop of the Holocaust.
