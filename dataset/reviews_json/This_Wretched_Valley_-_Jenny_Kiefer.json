            "This engrossing story is intensely creepy, kicking off with a strong, ominous tone. The execution of the \"adventure into the woods gone wrong\" trope is masterful, and the incorporation of the Donner Party adds a genuinely chilling dimension to the narrative. This unique approach sets the book apart, making it a standout read unlike anything I've encountered before.",
            "The setting is crucial in horror novels, and this book brilliantly transforms the environment into a distinct, omniscient character. The woods and valley serve not merely as a backdrop but as an adversary, which I found highly effective. Vivid descriptions, like \"their tents sitting like blisters in the valley below\" and \"the sun hitting the rock face, showcasing its acne and pockmarks,\" evoke unsettling imagery that enhances the overall chilling atmosphere.",
            "I can definitely see myself rereading this book in the future, and I believe my rating might increase to a 5 with a second read. It truly deserves a nomination for the 2024 Goodreads Choice Award in Horror, as it embodies everything a great horror story should deliver."

The natural environment, particularly the woods and valley, becomes not just a backdrop but the antagonist itself, which I found incredibly effective. The descriptions, such as \"Their tents sitting like blisters in the valley below\" and the sun hitting the rock face showing its \"acne and pockmarks,\" create vivid and unsettling imagery.  \n\n- **Plot and Tone:**  \n  The story is engrossing and intensely creepy, with a strong, ominous start. The \"adventure into the woods gone wrong\" trope is executed brilliantly, and the \"Donner party\" spin adds a genuinely scary layer to the narrative.

It’s a tale best enjoyed in a well-lit, communal setting to stave off nightmares.

This foreshadowing enhances the story's grim tone without diminishing its tension.",

Their reckless choices—failing to pack essential gear and venturing into perilous situations without preparation—can be attributed in part to the valley's influence, but largely stem from youthful naivety. Unfortunately, none of the characters are particularly likable, making it difficult to care about their survival. The only sympathetic figure is Slade, the dog.",

            "The use of a plot device that reveals characters are dead, followed by a time-travel element to explore their roles, is executed brilliantly in This Wretched Valley. The story can be disorienting at times, creating a disconcerting atmosphere that enhances the overall experience.",

            "Before diving into the story, it's essential to review the trigger warnings, as there are several, and some may be quite intense for certain readers.",
            "Despite my biggest trigger being present in the book, I handled it well. I skimmed through those parts but never felt the urge to put the book down. Reading 60 percent of the story with my hand covering my mouth speaks to the visceral impact of the writing.",
            "Readers anticipating a true crime or thriller narrative may find themselves disappointed, as this book firmly resides within the horror genre. However, it is a powerful horror novel that successfully pushed me out of my comfort zone. It delivered an unsettling experience that I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it occasionally made me feel queasy. The body horror is particularly intense, especially for those new to the genre. As a former EMT, I was still taken aback by its gore, yet I found it captivating."

It’s a great creepy survival horror story that I thoroughly enjoyed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial hesitation, I’m so glad I gave this audiobook a chance.

            "This story masterfully blends survival horror with supernatural elements, creating a gripping narrative filled with escalating tension as the characters overlook increasingly ominous signs. The red flags—Slade’s erratic behavior, GPS malfunctions, unnatural flora, and recurring nightmares—function not as plot holes but as deliberate devices that heighten suspense and highlight the characters’ denial. The climactic scene of Dylan trapped in an endless loop while climbing the rock is both terrifying and symbolic, encapsulating the inescapable nature of their predicament.",
            "In this story, the four main characters—Clay, Dylan, Sylvia, and Luke—are motivated by ambition and naivety, blind to the red flags in their quest for fame and discovery. Initially, Dylan, the \"final girl,\" comes across as unlikable due to her arrogance and her willingness to prioritize ambition over her friends' safety. However, her character arc transforms her into someone I can root for, despite her tragic fate. Slade, the dog, acts as a clever narrative device, representing the instinctual awareness that the humans lack. His eventual death highlights the story's relentless brutality.",
            "Set in the backwoods of rural Kentucky, the novel evokes a dual sense of familiarity and eeriness, particularly for nearby residents. The author skillfully instills a feeling of foreboding through the unnerving silence of the woods and the disorienting repetition of the landscape. Historical interludes from the 1700s to the 1980s enrich the narrative, revealing that the valley has long been a site of death and horror.",
            "The novel delves into the perils of human ambition and the repercussions of exploiting nature. The valley emerges as a character in its own right, resisting discovery and punishing intruders. The recurring motifs of a hungry earth and the ghosts of past victims underscore nature’s vengeance. The message is unmistakable: some places are best left untouched, as the quest for fame and glory can lead to ruin.",
            "This story masterfully weaves together visceral and multifaceted horror, capturing the inherent dangers of rock climbing, the primal fear of being lost in the wilderness, and the supernatural menace of ghosts and the earth itself. Grotesque imagery, including red sap, carrion plants, and dead man's toes, enhances the unsettling atmosphere. Meanwhile, historical interludes offer a chilling backstory, revealing that the valley's horrors are both timeless and cyclical."

        "conclusion": "The author’s *This Wretched Valley* is a masterful debut that delivers a blood-soaked, adrenaline-filled horror experience.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The novel is set in the backwoods of rural Kentucky, a location that feels both familiar and eerie, especially for someone living nearby.  \n  - Kiefer masterfully creates a sense of foreboding and dread through the isolated, unnatural silence of the woods and the disorienting repetition of the landscape.  \n  - The historical interludes from the 1700s, 1800s, early 1900s, and 1980s add depth to the setting, showing that the valley has always been a place of death and horror.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  - The four main characters—Clay, Dylan, Sylvia, and Luke—are driven by ambition and naivety, ignoring clear red flags in their pursuit of fame and discovery.  \n  - Dylan, the “final girl,” starts off unlikable due to her arrogance and prioritization of climbing over her companions’ safety. However, her character arc makes her someone the reader roots for, even though her fate is tragic.  \n  - Slade, the dog, serves as a clever narrative device, embodying the instinctual awareness the humans lack. His eventual death underscores the story’s relentless brutality.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story is a gripping blend of survival horror and supernatural elements, with escalating tension as the characters ignore increasingly ominous signs.  \n  - The red flags—Slade’s behavior, the GPS glitches, the unnatural flora, and the recurring nightmares—are not plot holes but intentional devices to heighten suspense and illustrate the characters’ denial.  \n  - The climactic scene of Dylan’s endless loop while climbing the rock is both terrifying and symbolic, representing the inescapable nature of their predicament.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  - The novel explores the dangers of human ambition and the consequences of exploiting nature. The valley itself is a character, resisting discovery and punishing those who intrude.  \n  - The recurring motif of the hungry earth and the ghosts of past victims reinforces the theme of nature’s vengeance.  \n  - The message is clear: some places should remain untouched, and the pursuit of fame and glory can lead to destruction.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  - The horror is visceral and multifaceted, combining the inherent danger of rock climbing, the terror of being lost in the wilderness, and the supernatural threat of ghosts and the earth itself.  \n  - The grotesque imagery—such as the red sap, carrion plants, and dead man’s toes—adds to the unsettling atmosphere.  \n  - The historical interludes provide a chilling backstory, showing that the valley’s horrors are timeless and cyclical.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJenny Kiefer’s *This Wretched Valley* is a masterful debut that delivers a blood-soaked, adrenaline-filled horror experience. The novel excels in creating a foreboding atmosphere, developing complex characters, and weaving a plot that keeps readers on edge. Its exploration of human ambition and nature’s vengeance is both thought-provoking and terrifying. Kiefer’s ability to blend visceral violence with supernatural elements makes this a standout horror story, and I eagerly anticipate her future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Atmosphere: 5/5  \n- Character Development: 4.5/5  \n- Plot and Pacing: 5/5  \n- Horror Elements: 5/5  \n- Overall: 5/5"

The chilling states of decay of their bodies, along with unsettling Instagram live streams, heighten the intrigue.

The author excelled in setting up the atmosphere and gradually unraveling the plot, creating a sense of dread and horror that made the story a page-turner. The valley was portrayed as a living, breathing entity of evil, with vivid descriptions of its eerie silence, horrifying visions, strange fauna, and the glitchy forest. The historical roots of the valley’s evil, shown through flashbacks, added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters’ descent into madness was depicted with great detail, each influenced differently by the environment. Dylan’s bond with the rock wall, Luke’s desperation over his dog’s disappearance and his injury, Clay’s visions, and Sydney’s bafflement toward the geology of the area were all compelling. However, some of the characters’ reactions felt bafflingly dumb at times.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  The novel delivered truly gruesome and gory moments that evoked disgust and discomfort. The mounting despair and horror as the characters became trapped in a looping hell were effectively conveyed. The abrupt ending, which left the valley’s evil unexplained, worked well to maintain the mystery and chills.  \n\n- **Influences and Themes:**  \n  The Dyatlov Pass incident’s influence was minimal, mostly reflected in the state of the victims and the investigators’ bafflement. The theme of an inescapable, malevolent force was central to the story, with the valley continuing to exist as an eternal mystery.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Technical Details:**  \n  The author’s debut was strong, with a knack for creating a chilling atmosphere and detailed descriptions. However, the climbing lingo was a bit overwhelming and went over my head at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a gripping and chilling horror mystery with a well-crafted atmosphere, compelling character arcs, and gruesome horror elements. Despite some minor flaws, such as baffling character reactions and technical jargon, it was a strong debut that left me eager to read more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.75/5"

It hooked me from the very first chapter, where you find out that no one was found alive from the climbing/research expedition the story centers around (not a spoiler—it’s part of the synopsis). I needed to know what happened, and I barely put it down until I finished it.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story revolves around four friends who go in search of an undiscovered rock face to climb in a forest. Their reasons for being there range from academic to professional. As soon as they enter the forest, things start to go... not quite right. There’s a bit of a dual timeline aspect, as we learn more about the history of the area, which I really liked. It added layers to the story without bogging it down with exposition.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each character was deeply developed, so by the time things started to go wrong, I still rooted for all of them to make it (although—fuck Clay, IYKYK). Even knowing the outcome from the beginning, I was invested in their journey.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  The atmosphere of this remote rock in a remote part of the woods was so immersive that it had me looking over my shoulder at every noise (I happened to read a bunch of this on vacation in the mountains). It’s a fantastic survival horror story that is fast-paced, dark, fun, and creepy.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Audience:**  \n  I recommend this book to all horror lovers or any reader with a strong stomach—some of the descriptions get quite graphic.

            "In this horror story, the characters embody a familiar trope: they dismiss clear warnings of danger with a sense of urban superiority, ultimately sealing their fate. This tendency to ignore obvious signs of peril effectively propels the plot forward.",

However, it does so in a self-aware and loving manner, acknowledging these conventions while still making them feel fresh and engaging.\n\n- **Character Behavior and Decision-Making:**  \n  The characters, like many in horror stories, dismiss clear warnings of danger with urban condescension, sealing their fate. This aligns with the common horror trope of characters ignoring obvious signs of peril, which drives the plot forward.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The setting plays a crucial role in the story, with the gloomy, remote Kentucky woods serving as a foreboding backdrop. The atmosphere is effectively built to create a sense of dread and inevitability, luring both the characters and the reader into a false sense of security.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The novel starts with a conventional opening that feels familiar to horror fans, but it cleverly subverts expectations by transitioning into something more unique and unsettling. This shift keeps the reader engaged and adds depth to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJenny Kiefer’s *This Wretched Valley* skillfully embraces and subverts classic wilderness horror tropes, delivering a story that feels both familiar and fresh.

            "The first 30% of the book expertly builds tension through eerie occurrences like rapidly draining batteries, strange sightings, and unreliable signals, creating a suspenseful atmosphere reminiscent of watching *Yellowjackets* for the first time. The uncertainty surrounding whether the threat is human or supernatural is the story's most compelling aspect, and I wish this eerie tension had been sustained longer. \n\nThe narrative follows Clay, a geology student who discovers an uncharted rock face and recruits Dylan, an aspiring climbing influencer, to be the first to scale it. Joined by Dylan’s boyfriend Luke and Sylvia, they venture into the Kentucky wilderness with Luke’s dog, Slade. The book opens with a grim tone, revealing the tragic outcome of their expedition and focusing on how and why this tragedy unfolds. A reassuring note: Slade, the dog, survives, though there are distressing elements involving animals and a traumatic baby death.\n\nIn the latter half, the tone shifts to something akin to *American Horror Story* (Season 1). While still engaging and fast-paced, it doesn't quite match the brilliance of the first half. The tension remains intact, and the flashbacks don’t disrupt the pacing, but the resolution feels less impactful compared to the buildup.",

The striking cover design evokes a sense of mortal dread, reminiscent of watching Alex Honnold’s free solo climb in *Free Solo*. As someone who has always feared climbing, the idea of exploring this fear through a novel was particularly appealing."

It was a nice change in mood and made for some fun times.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  From about a third of the way into the book, I really enjoyed the pacing. The first third wasn’t bad—the author was setting the scene—but the pacing felt a little thick initially.  \n\n- **Opening:**  \n  The opening was super strong and immediately put me on edge.  \n\n- **Accessibility of Subject Matter:**  \n  I don’t hike much, and I know nothing about rock climbing, yet I could follow along just fine with the story. The descriptions and explanations of everything outdoorsy never felt overwhelming or condescending.  \n\n- **Unresolved Questions:**  \n  My only irk with the book is that I have lots of questions, which is probably just me being annoying. Assuming this is a standalone, I’m freaking out that I’ll never get answers. Some of my questions include:  \n  1. How did this all start?  \n  2. Who/what/why is this happening?  \n  3. Why the dog?  \n  4. What the hell was in the car?  \n  5. Why were they all poisonous?  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, this is a fantastic and relatively quick read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a thrilling and engaging read, with a strong opening, well-paced narrative, and accessible descriptions of outdoor activities. While it left me with many unanswered questions, it was an enjoyable and immersive experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Good pacing, good tension, it properly had me hooked.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were intriguing enough, if not overly developed, although in stories like this, the real protagonist is the sinister whatever that is hunting them.  \n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n  I liked the concept of a cursed pocket dimension; it would make the perfect backdrop for a series, actually, as we needed more—more resolution, more information, an ending as captivating as the exquisite opening.  \n- **Accuracy and Detail:**  \n  As other reviewers have pointed out, I have issues with the first aid administered in this story. If this was something reflecting the effect of the valley on people (or simply Sylvia's limited knowledge—you don't give aspirin on head/crushing injuries, you never put warm compresses on anything broken/sprained, etc.), it should have been shown more clearly. I want to be clear that it's the character that doesn't know what to do, not the author.  \n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  There was a dog, and I was bracing myself for something traumatic (however, the dog lives! Half a star solely for that!).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll things aside, *This Wretched Valley* is a solid book that will definitely keep you glued to the pages and (most importantly) make you ask for more.

It doesn’t offer happy resolutions but instead escalates in horror.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are reminiscent of classic archetypes: a smart studious girl, a cool girl, her boyfriend (an NPC-like guy), a goofy guy, and even a dog. While their dialogue and sentence structure feel simplistic and somewhat middle-grade, they still contribute to the story’s charm.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is mediocre in terms of sentence structure and character dialogue, which feels simplistic. However, the detailed and flowery descriptions of the landscape, the characters’ hallucinations, and their trippy, insane experiences stand out and enhance the story.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Suspension of Disbelief:**  \n  I ended up really enjoying the book, but it requires a willingness to suspend disbelief for the sake of entertainment. If you’re not open to that, you might not find it as engaging.  \n\n- **Realism and Inspiration:**  \n  The book is not a realistic interpretation of the Dyatlov Pass incident, so don’t expect it to align with historical or factual events.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its simplistic writing style and middle-grade feel, the book delivers a unique and enjoyable horror experience with vivid descriptions and a trippy, escalating plot. It’s a fun read for those willing to embrace its over-the-top, paranormal elements.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Kiefer does not hesitate to introduce suspense into the story, nor does she let her foot off the gas as the story progresses. The book kept me on my toes with its intensity, even during the more mundane motions the characters go through.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  The horror elements of this novel are very well written. There’s no shortage of bloodiness or brutality, making it a great read for fans of body horror or extreme gore. For me, it was just the right amount of intensity without being overwhelming.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story starts with three dead bodies in different states of mutilation and decay, setting a chilling tone. The quartet of hikers—Clay, Sylvia, Dylan, and Luke—venture into the Kentucky wilderness to explore a new rock climbing trail, only to realize the forest is unsettlingly different from others they’ve visited. The premise is gripping, and the atmosphere is deeply immersive.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The characters are well-defined and serve their roles effectively. Clay is driven by his research, Sylvia supports him, Dylan is ambitious about her climbing career, and Luke provides moral support. Their interactions and motivations add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Critique (Trope Usage):**  \n  My only nit-picky critique is that the story felt a little trope-y at one point. Early on, it’s revealed that Native Americans knew to avoid the land the group is exploring, but they allowed colonizers to use it. This felt like it took away some of the mystery of the land. I think the story would have been just as impactful without this explicit explanation, as the dangerous and almost sentient nature of the land could have been conveyed more subtly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I immensely enjoyed *This Wretched Valley*. It’s a gripping, atmospheric horror novel with well-crafted suspense and horror elements. Despite a minor critique about its use of tropes, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good horror story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It follows four college students venturing into the eerie Kentucky woods in search of a rock formation for their individual goals. The unsettling setting features strange clusters of poisonous plants, a lack of animal life, and an overall sense of foreboding. As the plot intensifies, the group becomes trapped, experiences hallucinations, and grapples with escalating desperation and paranoia.",

Meanwhile, the other characters, initially likable, fall under the sinister influence of the woods, exposing their darker sides.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story follows four college students venturing into the Kentucky woods to find a rock formation for their respective goals. The setting is eerie and unsettling, with strange clusters of poisonous plants, a lack of animal life, and an overall sense of foreboding. The plot intensifies as the group becomes trapped, experiences hallucinations, and faces increasing desperation and paranoia.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters include two PhD students, a rock-climbing influencer (Dylan), and her boyfriend. Initially, Dylan comes across as selfish and obnoxious, driven by her desire to impress her sponsors. However, she evolves into a more sympathetic figure as the story progresses. The other characters, while initially likable, succumb to the malevolent influence of the woods, revealing darker sides to their personalities.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  The novel delivers intense horror, reminiscent of *The Ruins*, *The Blair Witch Project*, and *YellowBrickRoad*. It features gruesome visions, a sense of hopelessness, and the psychological unraveling of the characters. The horror is effective in creating a atmosphere of dread and despair.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  While the story is gripping, it becomes somewhat repetitive in the latter parts, feeling like it could have been resolved a few chapters earlier. Additionally, the origin of the horror in the woods is never fully explained, leaving some unanswered questions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a solid horror novel that effectively captures the desperation and terror of being trapped in a malevolent wilderness. Despite some pacing issues and unanswered questions, it delivers a chilling and immersive experience, particularly for fans of wilderness horror.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story is uneven, particularly during flashbacks that span from the 1700s to the 1980s. While these flashbacks are chilling, they disrupt the main action and detract from the central narrative. The plot follows four ambitious climbers—Clay, Silvia, Dylan, and Luke—who aim to be the first to conquer a new rock face. Seven months later, their bodies are found under mysterious circumstances, with varying stages of decomposition and one climber missing. The mystery surrounding their deaths—whether due to murder, cannibalism, or something more sinister—propels the narrative forward. The real-life inspiration from the Dyatlov Pass incident adds an intriguing layer to the story.",

The climactic ending of the third act is satisfyingly bloody, a challenging feat for any novel. While some horror elements resonated with me more than others, the main antagonist felt somewhat exaggerated. I believe the perilous atmosphere of the valley could have driven the narrative effectively on its own. Nonetheless, I recognize the antagonist's role in advancing the plot to its conclusion.",

The atmosphere was bleak and hopeless, with a descent into madness and terror that was both gripping and frustrating.  \n\n- **Descriptive Power:**  \n  Jenny Kiefer is skilled at vividly describing painful and disgusting injuries in a way that made me feel them down to my bones. The sights and smells of the setting radiated off the pages.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  There was a bit of buildup before the action kicked in, but once it did, things got progressively worse for the characters. The third act ending was satisfying in a bloody, climactic way, which is tough to pull off in a novel.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  It took me some time to keep a couple of the characters straight in my mind as far as who was who. However, I enjoyed the unique perspective of reading about rock climbers, which was a fresh experience for me.  \n\n- **Plot and Horror Elements:**  \n  Some of the horror elements worked better for me than others. The \"big bad\" antagonist felt a bit over the top, and I almost think the dangerous atmosphere of the valley itself could have carried the story without this element. However, I understand that it was necessary for the plot to reach its conclusions.  \n\n- **Reader Experience:**  \n  I got a tiny bit confused a few times, particularly when characters seemed to be in one place and then suddenly back at camp.

There were many times that I wished we could see more of the creepy bits and less time was spent on the buildup in the beginning of the story.  \n\n- **Ambiguity and Resolution:**  \n  You are left questioning what really happened, which to me worked in this story, but I know that can be a point of contention for some readers.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I liked certain characters more than others. Sylvia, for example, seemed like a bit of a waste of space. She's seeing all these unique and dangerous plants and is so nonchalant about it that it just feels unrealistic.

As an avid hiker and backpacker, the story hit particularly hard, especially since I already have unsettling thoughts when I’m in the woods.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  One of the things I most appreciated was the author’s decision to reveal the outcome of the story in the first few pages—three bodies and who they belonged to. The next 250+ pages were spent showing how they came to be. Despite knowing the ending, I was so swept up in the story that I found myself cheering for the characters as though it could change their fate.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This book is a perfect fit for fans of survival horror, rock climbing, campfire stories, botany, and the supernatural. It masterfully combines these elements into a spooky and engaging narrative.  \n\n- **Author’s Skill and Future Work:**  \n  I was thoroughly impressed by Kiefer’s storytelling and can’t wait to see what they come out with next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *This Wretched Valley* is a gripping and chilling survival horror novel that expertly blends local lore, historical tragedy, and supernatural elements. Despite knowing the outcome from the start, the story kept me hooked and emotionally invested. I highly recommend it to fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Inspiration and Premise:**  \n  The novel is inspired by the real-life mystery of the Dyatlov Pass incident, which adds an intriguing layer to the story. It follows a group of students eager to map an unknown geological formation for climbing purposes, setting the stage for a terrifying survival horror.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The book excels as a survival horror, blending technical climbing details with elements of body horror, hallucinations, and grim death. It successfully captures the chilling atmosphere of a group of people having a \"really bad time in the woods.\"  \n\n- **Writing Style and Research:**  \n  The author, Kiefer, demonstrates a strong commitment to research, particularly in the technical aspects of climbing. This attention to detail enhances the authenticity of the story, reminiscent of horror writer Dan Simmons.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  While the atmosphere and tension are well-crafted, the action feels prolonged, and the story might have benefited from being a novella rather than a full-length novel.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the pacing issue, the book is a fun and engaging read, especially during Halloween. It delivers on its promise of horror and suspense, making it a recommended pick for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"This Wretched Valley\" is a well-researched and atmospheric survival horror novel that successfully blends technical climbing details with chilling horror elements. While the pacing could have been tighter, it remains an enjoyable and recommended read, particularly for fans of group survival horror stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars"

The narrative unfolds through four distinct perspectives: Clay, the PhD candidate leading the expedition; Sylvia, his research assistant; Dylan, a rock climbing prodigy; and Luke, Dylan’s boyfriend. This structure offers a well-rounded view of the unfolding events. The story skillfully blurs the line between hallucination and reality, keeping readers guessing until the end.

Knowing the ending upfront—three dead bodies in various states of decay—created a compelling mystery. The fact that four campers went on a scientific expedition, but only three bodies were found, left me desperate to uncover what happened to the fourth camper. The unique decay rates and causes of death, along with the investigators' unease, hooked me immediately.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is slow but deliberate, allowing for deep character development.

Their interactions and conflicts feel authentic, especially as they begin to unravel under the pressure of the strange occurrences in the wilderness.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The setting plays a crucial role in the story, creating a sense of isolation and unease. The eerie reputation of the nearby woods, the abundance of poisonous plants, and the discrepancies in the topographical map all contribute to a growing sense of dread.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Engagement and Pace:**  \n  I really, really enjoyed this novel, and I wasn't sure if I would. It was unputdownable, especially when it picks up momentum. I especially loved the ending. I had an inkling that something might turn this way because one person had such an overwhelming, irresistible pull, but it did go in a way I didn't quite expect.\n\n- **Appeal to Specific Audiences:**  \n  If you are an outdoors/wilderness lover and it is your time, this would be the way to go (this person's only!).\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I think my favorite character was Sylvia, the sensible botanist. She's the only one with any semblance of first aid training, knowledge of edible plants, and just generally the most cool-headed. I didn't care for Dylan at first, but loved her by the end. What might have happened to her kept me reading.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  It is horror, but tragic really, heartbreaking how everything came to be. There is gore, but real things, real horror, that have happened to real people in history - crop failures, bad winters, starvation, disease, mercy killing, cannibalism, Civil War prisoners, Prohibition methanol-blinded moonshiners, people driven mad by real circumstances that are out of their control. Except in these cases, none of these historic events seem to have happened naturally.\n\n- **Supernatural Elements:**  \n  Now we get to the supernatural horror. The current group, at least three of them, felt like they had everything all figured out, all of these historic dangers far behind them in modern times, didn't need maps or compasses, helmets, relying on technology. More concerned with fame and fortune than anything else. Well. Are they in for a rude awakening.\n\n- **Originality and Tropes:**  \n  I found it to be entirely different than the usual tropes. An evil contest where a force seems to use each person's weakness against them, pitting one against the other, all throughout, including the dog's, until the last person, or living creature, is standing. Yes, there are flames, flies, etc. that might lead you to think it is Hell.\n\n- **Re-readability and Adaptation Potential:**  \n  I may have to read it again! I also think it would make a good movie, if done right.\n\n- **Personal Reflection:**  \n  I'll never stop going hiking in the woods, I love it for its beauty and its peacefulness. But this story will cross my mind for sure!\n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  The cover is beautiful, kinda reminds me of Papa Emeritus from the band Ghost.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping, emotionally charged horror story that blends historical tragedies with supernatural elements. It stands out for its originality, compelling characters, and thought-provoking themes. The ending is particularly satisfying, and the story has a strong re-readability factor. It could also make an excellent movie adaptation. The cover art is striking and adds to the overall appeal.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI'm now wavering between a 4 and a 5 rating."

Knowing that three campers will not survive, while the fate of the fourth remains uncertain, heightens the tension throughout the narrative.",
            "The story effectively builds dread and mystery, but the horror imagery towards the end feels clunky. The \"digital\" representation of forest horror didn't resonate; I anticipated a more primal, instinctual terror rather than glitches and GIFs. Furthermore, the portrayal of ghosts is unsatisfying, as the narrative lacks clarity on whether they are conscious entities, a secondary threat, or merely manifestations of the woods' malevolence."

            "The plot is straightforward, making this book less suitable if you seek a horror story that explores the intricacies of its events or motivations. It relies on the reader's willingness to accept the presented world without question. While the tension is established early on, the middle section of the book feels sluggish, with 50-100 pages that seem unnecessary as the characters’ gradual descent into madness in the woods becomes repetitive. Fortunately, the fast-paced ending revitalizes the story and provides a satisfying conclusion.",
            "While the characters lacked depth and complexity, they fit the typical archetypes of horror films and literature, which I found acceptable.",
            "The story opens with a masterful depiction of a haunted valley, shrouded in an eerie atmosphere where people mysteriously vanish or return forever altered. The buildup of dread and tension is skillfully executed, making it evident from the outset that a grim fate awaits.",
            "This horror book is a thrilling read, reminiscent of vacation horror films like *The Ruins* and *The Descent*. It's ideal for fans of these genres, as well as for those who appreciate the concept of such movies but prefer not to watch them. The story grabs your attention right from the opening line: \"What baffled them was the skeleton.\"",

The tension was already established, and the prolonged focus on characters slowly losing it in the woods became redundant.  \n  - The ending, however, was fast-paced and helped save the overall story.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tension:**  \n  - The beginning excelled at creating an atmosphere of a haunted, evil, or creepy valley where people disappear or return changed.  \n  - The dread and tension were built up effectively, especially since it was clear from the start that things would not end well.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters were not the most well-written or deep, but they aligned with standard horror movie/book types, which I found forgivable.  \n\n- **Plot and Complexity:**  \n  - The actual plot was fairly simple. If you’re looking for a horror book that delves into the specifics of what’s happening or why, this might not be the best pick. The story relies heavily on accepting the world as it is presented.  \n\n- **Gore and Horror Elements:**  \n  - The level of gore was a bit much for me, but I’m a squeamish person. I don’t think it exceeded the standard for a horror movie/book.  \n  - The book wasn’t particularly scary but was definitely gross at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I think this was a fun horror book and a solid debut.

It’s an excellent idea, but I wanted it to be explored more deeply. For example, Clay is lured by the illusion of a rock wall, and Dylan is drawn to recklessly climbing it. However, Sylvia and Luke felt underutilized. Sylvia, a botany student, could have been tempted by rare, poisonous plants, making her obsessed with collecting them as the poison affects her. Luke, on the other hand, lacks a distinct personality beyond loving his dog, which made it hard to see how the wood could have targeted him.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters are one-dimensional, making it difficult to care about them.

While this narrative device is clever, it requires the characters to be compelling to keep readers invested. Unfortunately, none of the characters stood out strongly. Dylan and Clay are ambitious but selfish, Sylvia is a bit anal-retentive, and Luke’s defining trait is his love for his dog.

This ambiguity added to the sense of the Unknown, which I found effective and satisfying.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Dylan and Clay were flawed and often annoying characters, though their tragic flaws contributed to the story’s downfall. While I felt some sympathy for Dylan by the end, my empathy was stronger for Sylvia, Luke, and especially the dog. Their flaws made the story feel somewhat typical but didn’t detract from its overall impact.\n\n- **Themes and Reflection:**  \n  The book prompted me to reflect on broader implications about the country, particularly its foundational history. This added depth to the story and made it more thought-provoking.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Potential for More:**  \n  Overall, the book was fun to read, primarily due to its mystery element. I would be interested in another book set in the same universe if the author decides to expand on it.\n\n- **Personal Impact:**  \n  The book left such an impression that I now consider Kentucky a \"maybe-not\" destination for travel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a gripping and thought-provoking read, with a strong mystery and unsettling atmosphere. While some characters were frustrating, their flaws added to the story’s tension. The unresolved questions and thematic depth made it a memorable experience, and I would welcome more stories in this universe.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The writing was tense and compelling, with just the right amount of weirdness to hook me while distancing itself from reality. The prose was good, and the use of disorientation and poor judgment was effective.\n\n- **Genre and Atmosphere:**  \n  It was perfect for what I wanted—part wilderness horror and part paranormal threat. The atmosphere was immersive and unsettling.\n\n- **Characterization and Decision-Making:**  \n  I’m fine with not all of the characters being particularly likable, and I understand that dehydration and heightened emotional states don’t contribute to rational thinking. Their poor decisions felt realistic given the circumstances.\n\n- **Inspiration and Plot Development:**  \n  I had no idea this was inspired by the Dyatlov Pass incident, though it seems obvious in retrospect. The book was far stranger than the real-life event, and I liked how the explanations for what was discovered in the first chapter came together. You couldn’t piece it together from what was left behind, which added to the intrigue.\n\n- **Cautionary Elements:**  \n  The story served as a cautionary tale: be careful out there, kids. Maybe don’t go rock climbing without telling anyone where you’re going or using proper safety equipment. And definitely don’t drink anything you find on the ground.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel was a tense, compelling, and weirdly immersive read that blended wilderness horror and paranormal threats effectively.

For those familiar with the concept, it enriches the psychological and emotional motivations of the characters.  \n  - A hungry ghost is a being driven by animalistic needs and emotions, often resulting from a life of evil deeds or negative emotions like desire, greed, anger, and ignorance. This concept ties into the characters' feelings, motives, and desires, adding depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The author’s repeated use of the same phrases to describe certain things becomes tiresome. For example, the phrase \"the fire followed a path like gasoline\" felt overused by the 4th or 5th instance.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  - Despite the repetitive phrasing, the book is overall a great read.  \n  - I look forward to future releases by this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis survivalist horror novel delivers a gripping and psychologically rich story, though it is slightly marred by repetitive descriptions. The concept of \"hungry ghosts\" adds a unique and compelling layer to the narrative, making it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nInitially rated 3 stars, but the depth added by the \"hungry ghosts\" concept elevated the overall impression."

However, the plot structure, particularly the lack of a final twist, slightly diminished the impact of the final act. Despite this, the author shows great potential, and I’m excited to see her future work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars"

The mention of the skeleton and the mysterious bodies piqued my curiosity, making me eager to uncover the story behind it.  \n\n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  While I’m not typically a horror fan, this book managed to captivate me. It’s a great fit for readers who enjoy paranormal horror, body horror, or psychological horror. The story follows four friends as they spend five days in the Kentucky wilderness, attempting to study and climb an undocumented rock face.  \n\n- **Technical Details:**  \n  The book includes some technical climbing jargon, which might require a quick Google search for non-climbers. However, it’s easy to follow, and climbers will likely appreciate the authenticity.  \n\n- **Pacing and Atmosphere:**  \n  After the first day, the story takes a surreal and unsettling turn. The tension and horror elements were so effective that I found myself sprinting from room to room and constantly scanning my surroundings for anything out of place.  \n\n- **Critique:**  \n  My main critique is the lack of explanation for *why* certain events occurred. This left me with unanswered questions and slightly diminished my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*This Wretched Valley* is a gripping and unsettling read, especially for horror enthusiasts. While it successfully creates a tense and eerie atmosphere, the lack of clear explanations for key events holds it back from being a perfect read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐"

The eerie atmosphere stayed with me long after finishing the book.\n\n- **Plot Inspiration:**  \n  I discovered that the plot was partially inspired by the Dyatlov Pass Incident, which I hadn’t heard of before. This revelation added an extra layer of intrigue and unease, prompting me to research the real-life event, which only deepened my sense of creepiness.\n\n- **Character Resolution:**  \n  My main complaint is that I wanted to know what happened to Slade by the end of the story. The lack of closure regarding his fate left me feeling unsatisfied and wishing for more clarity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was a deeply unsettling and engaging read, with its eerie atmosphere and connection to the Dyatlov Pass Incident adding to its impact. However, the unresolved fate of Slade was a notable drawback that left me wanting more.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This would add an interesting modern twist to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel for its descriptive writing and unique, eerie concept. The idea of an evil forest is compelling, and I’d be curious to see how the story could evolve in a potential sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The haunted forest setting added an intriguing layer to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  Four people go into the woods of Kentucky, and three bodies are found a month later. What happened, and where is the fourth body? This central mystery kept me engaged throughout the book.  \n\n- **Characters and Perspectives:**  \n  Two members of the party are graduate students at the University of Kentucky, and the last two are a rock climber influencer and her boyfriend. The book comes from all four points of view, as well as the past of the haunted forest, which added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Gore and Content:**  \n  The book is very gory, and I could have used less of that. It felt excessive at times and detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Explanation and Resolution:**  \n  I wanted more of an explanation of why all of this was happening. The lack of a clear resolution left me somewhat unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  Despite the gore and unresolved questions, the story was very intriguing and held my interest.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its flaws, particularly in its excessive gore and lack of clear explanation, the intriguing mystery, multiple perspectives, and haunting setting made it a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThanks to Netgalley for a free copy in exchange for an honest review."

It’s a solid thriller that I’ll be recommending.  \n\n- **Horror and Atmosphere:**  \n  The scenario in this book genuinely instilled a creep factor for me in ways I did not expect. The hopelessness of the characters’ situation, paired with the slow unraveling of their psyches, made me feel anxious FOR them.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The dialogue was rough at times, and the writing felt slightly repetitive for my taste.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some minor issues with the writing style, this book was a gripping and unexpectedly creepy thriller that kept me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Dylan, in particular, comes across as insufferable, especially in her indifference to losing her partner’s dog in the woods, a sentiment reinforced by her social media persona. Clay embodies the archetype of a jerk, and his revelation as a murderer aligns perfectly with his character. Sylvia stands out as a compelling character, but unfortunately, she meets her demise early on. Initially, Luke, Dylan’s boyfriend, seems likable, but he too succumbs to the valley's dark influence, becoming a would-be murderer. The valley plays a crucial role in amplifying the characters' worst traits. Dylan’s negligence regarding the dog’s disappearance is evident, though the valley exacerbates her flaws. Luke’s potential transformation into a murderer is somewhat justified by his desire to avenge his beloved pets, despite Dylan’s actions being more negligent than malicious.",

It features some really freaky woods and ghost elements, which made it a fun and engaging read.\n\n- **Character Likability:**  \n  Almost everyone in the story is unlikable, which I found fitting and enjoyable for a horror setting. Dylan, in particular, comes off as a total douche, especially with her indifference to losing her partner’s dog in the woods. Her social media persona further reinforces this impression. Clay is another character who epitomizes douchebaggery, and it’s revealed that he’s a murderer, which aligns with his baseline behavior. Sylvia was a great character, but unfortunately, she dies almost immediately. Luke, Dylan’s boyfriend, is fairly likable at first, but even he is transformed into a would-be murderer by the valley’s influence.\n\n- **Character Development and Motivations:**  \n  The valley plays a significant role in amplifying the characters’ worst qualities. Dylan’s negligence and lack of concern for the dog’s disappearance are highlighted, though it’s clear the valley exacerbates these traits. Luke’s transformation into a potential murderer is somewhat justified by his desire to avenge his beloved pets, even though Dylan’s actions were more negligent than intentional.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  I always enjoy multiple POV stories, and this one delivered on that front.

            "The story centers on a group of young climbers seeking to conquer a new rock climbing wall in the Kentucky wilderness. From the outset, strange occurrences unfold, yet the group dismisses warnings, driven by their selfish desire for fame. This ultimately leads to their downfall, a fate revealed in the opening chapter. I appreciated the narrative technique of presenting the outcome first and then tracing back to reveal how it unfolded. The plot is wild, jarring, and unsettling, keeping me engaged as I sought to unravel the mysteries of the isolated forest and the group's struggle to escape.",
            "The most compelling aspect of the story was the characters' reactions to the crisis. Rather than collaborating, they turned on each other, showcasing the harsh reality of human behavior under extreme stress. This exploration of human nature in crisis is what I love most about survival horror stories, as it often reflects real-life situations.",
            "As a newcomer to survival horror, I was eager to dive into this novel, drawn by its similarities to *The Ruins*, which I enjoyed, and its inspiration from the intriguing Dyatlov Pass incident. The book indeed echoed *The Ruins*, especially in its portrayal of unlikable characters, which made me indifferent to their fates. The unfolding mystery in the forest was thrilling, though I found myself wishing for more clarity by the end. While the ambiguity contributed to the unsettling atmosphere, it also left me wanting a bit more resolution."

The book did remind me of *The Ruins*, particularly in how unlikeable the characters were, which made me apathetic to their fate.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story follows a group of young people attempting to charter a new rock climbing wall in the Kentucky wilderness. Strange occurrences begin immediately, but the group ignores warnings, driven by their selfish quest for fame and acclaim. This ultimately leads to their demise, as revealed in the opening chapter. I appreciated the narrative device of showing the outcome first and then backtracking to explain how it happened. The plot was wild, jarring, and discomfiting, keeping me engaged as I tried to unravel the mystery of the isolated forest and the group’s inability to escape.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Human Behavior:**  \n  The most interesting aspect of the story was seeing how the characters reacted to the crisis. Instead of working together, they snapped at each other, highlighting the biting realism of how humans behave under extreme stress. This exploration of human nature in a crisis is my favorite part of survival horror stories, as it often mirrors real-life scenarios.  \n\n- **Mystery and Resolution:**  \n  The mystery of what was happening in the forest was wildly fun, though I wished for a bit more explanation by the end. The lack of complete clarity added to the unsettling atmosphere but left me slightly wanting.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Author Potential:**  \n  If you’re a fan of works like *The Ruins*, *The Descent*, or *Yellowjackets*, I think you’ll find this novel enjoyable. It could be a great summer vacation read. As this was the author’s debut novel, I’m very interested to see what she does next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis survival horror novel delivers a gripping, unsettling story with a focus on human behavior in crisis. While the characters’ unlikeability and the slightly unresolved mystery may not appeal to everyone, fans of the genre will likely find it engaging and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, there are spatial inconsistencies that occasionally disrupt the immersion.  \n- **Narrative Style:** The third-person narrative is observational and descriptive, with rich metaphors and similes.

Loosely inspired by the Dyatlov Pass incident, the story follows four friends as they venture into the Kentucky wilderness in search of a new climbing spot. The novel starts strong, immersing readers in an unsettling and eerie atmosphere that immediately captivates. As a fan of horror set in the great outdoors, I was initially drawn in. However, the latter half of the book didn’t resonate as much. While the author skillfully conveyed a sense of disorientation that mirrored the characters’ experiences, I found the forest’s history and certain plot elements too ambiguous.",

The only exception was the dog, whose likely grim outcome—common in horror narratives—left me uneasy. I wish the characters had been more fully developed to foster a stronger emotional connection.",

However, the back half of the book didn’t resonate with me as much. While the author effectively created a sense of disorientation that mirrored the characters’ experiences, I felt the forest’s history and some elements of the plot were left too vague.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I wasn’t particularly attached to any of the characters, which made it hard to care about their fates. The exception was the dog, though I knew its fate was likely grim, as is often the case with animal companions in horror media. I wish the characters had been more developed to create a stronger emotional connection.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  This is one of the goriest horror books I’ve read, with some intense body horror that was effective in grossing me out—though this may be due to my relative newness to the genre. If body horror isn’t your thing, I’d recommend skipping this book.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending felt vague and underdeveloped, which left me wanting more closure or explanation.  \n\n- **Author’s Debut:**  \n  Considering this is likely the author’s debut, it’s an impressive effort. I’m excited to read more from them in the future.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  I’m absolutely obsessed with the cover—it’s stunning!  \n\n- **Pet Trope in Horror:**  \n  I wish horror authors would stop killing pets. In my opinion, it rarely adds much to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel excels in creating a vivid, eerie setting and delivering effective horror elements, it falls short in character development and providing a satisfying ending. Despite these flaws, it’s a strong debut, and I look forward to reading more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up to 4."

            "I picked up *Coraline* to satisfy my craving for horror while waiting for new episodes of *The Magnus Protocol*. The book felt reminiscent of a *TMA/TMP* episode, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The first chapter was captivating, effectively establishing the tone and mystery. Overall, I found the narrative satisfying; it struck the perfect balance in length, neither dragging nor feeling rushed."

This book truly felt like a *TMA/TMP* episode, and I had so much fun with it. The first chapter was engrossing and set the tone and mystery really well.

As someone who doesn’t usually care if characters or stories don’t resonate, the fact that I felt sad for them says a lot about the story’s emotional depth.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n  The writing sometimes felt like a debut novel, with certain scenes appearing rushed as if the author was eager to get to the exciting parts. This made the writing feel a bit sloppy in places. However, it didn’t significantly affect my experience because when the book wanted to deliver, it went *hard*.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential and Future Work:**  \n  I haven’t read many horror books, but I really enjoyed this one. I’m excited to see what the author comes up with next because their style of horror aligns so well with my own tastes. I’m hopeful they’ll write something else soon.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Coraline* was a satisfying and engaging horror novel that resonated with my tastes.

They pulled me out of the main story and didn’t hold my interest.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  - While the horror elements were present, I wished there had been more of them to heighten the tension and atmosphere.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had a promising start with its intriguing structure and atmospheric setting, but it fell short in the latter half due to a cheesy plot reveal, uneven pacing, and disruptive flashbacks. I would recommend it to readers who enjoy woods-based horror stories, but I personally wanted more horror and a tighter narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

While I’m unsure if I prefer this upfront honesty or the illusion of hope, the narrative question posed in the very first sentence effectively pulls the reader in.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The setting has a strong, sinister presence that feels uniquely evil, making the story stand out despite familiar tropes like campers lost in the woods. The pervasive dark energy adds depth and originality to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters seemed to spiral into madness too quickly for my liking. Additionally, the protagonist’s professional rock-climbing background, while occasionally relevant, felt underutilized and could have been explored more deeply.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  The eerie and confusing elements were effective in wearing down the characters, but the inclusion of blatantly supernatural scare tactics felt unnecessary and detracted from the story’s potential subtlety. Some parts leaned into campy, tropey 80s slasher flick vibes, which I found less compelling than a more nuanced approach could have been.  \n\n- **Educational and Graphic Content:**  \n  I learned about a real-world climbing equipment company called ‘Petzl,’ which was an interesting tidbit. However, the graphic death scene that spanned six pages felt overly drawn out and excessive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s sinister atmosphere and unique setting kept me engaged, the underdeveloped protagonist, rushed character arcs, and reliance on overt horror tropes left me wanting more subtlety and depth. The graphic content, though impactful, felt excessive at times.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the historical elements and character development could have been more fleshed out to enhance the story further.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Atmosphere and Tension:**  \n  - The first half of the novel is tense, spooky, and brimming with chills, especially with the sense of doom surrounding the characters.  \n  - The anticipation builds almost unbearably until something horrible inevitably happens.  \n\n- **References and Scenes:**  \n  - I loved the Dyatlov Pass references, which added depth and intrigue to the story.  \n  - The classic scene with the waitress trying to warn the characters was particularly effective and memorable.  \n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**  \n  - The second half of the book takes a turn that feels almost cartoony, which detracts from the horror.  \n  - The wordiness of the writing slows the pace down significantly, making the story feel less engaging.  \n  - I found it scarier and more effective to linger in the \"wtf-ery\" rather than revealing the Big Scary Thing too soon.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  - The book peters out instead of ending with a punch, which was disappointing after such a strong start.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe first half of the novel is a masterclass in tension and atmosphere, with chilling moments and a sense of impending doom. However, the second half falters with a cartoony turn, overly wordy writing, and a lackluster ending. Despite these flaws, the first half is truly killer and makes the book worth a read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

As it stands, it’s really hard to care about these people. This critique is similar to what I often feel about horror movies.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential and showed promise for a debut novel, it fell short of my expectations in terms of its central premise and character development. Despite this, I would still consider reading future works by this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the middle section feels lacking, with little action to sustain the momentum established by these strong bookends. The narrative often comes across as vague, leaving me confused about the plot. While the haunted valley is introduced, key questions—such as why it is haunted and the significance of a bleeding rock face—remain unanswered, which is frustrating. The story would have benefited from greater clarity and resolution. The ending, which leaves many questions unresolved, was disappointing. I had hoped for a more satisfying conclusion, perhaps with Dylan discovering that the valley was part of a massive creature or an ancient god manipulating time and space. Instead, the story concludes ambiguously, failing to resolve the mysteries it presents.",
            "The characters in this story felt flat, with their actions and dialogue often lacking realism. Unlike *The Ruins*, where relationships were rich and dynamic, the connections here were shallow. For instance, Dylan and Clay, portrayed as old friends, shared no more depth than Dylan and Sylvia, who had just met. This absence of meaningful relationships made it difficult to invest in the characters or their outcomes.",
            "The use of tropes, particularly the predictable death of the dog Slade, felt uninspired. I hoped for a subversion, such as Slade surviving or being found alive at the end, but that didn’t occur. His death seemed unnecessary, lacking a significant impact on the plot. Overall, the story missed opportunities for surprise and innovation within its genre.",

While this approach can be effective, it feels underdeveloped here. The repetitive scenes of characters vomiting or being pursued by ghosts or one another lack narrative depth. The potential for a more profound horror experience exists but remains unfulfilled."

Supporting her is worthwhile because she’s contributing significantly to the horror community.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel delivers on its horror elements with creepy and unsettling moments, but it falters with flat characters and overused tropes.

Two of them, Clay and Sylvia, are pursuing their dissertations, while Dylan and Luke are there for climbing. The story takes a dark turn when Clay and Luke are found mutilated, Sylvia’s skeleton is discovered clean, and Dylan goes missing. The plot is structured with an introduction detailing the gruesome discoveries, followed by a chronological narrative starting from February 2019, leading up to the tragic events.\n\n- **Horror Elements and Tropes:**  \n  The novel employs classic horror tropes, including a harbinger warning the group at a diner, their dog acting erratically in the woods, and a final girl archetype (Dylan). The story is described as a slasher with gory details, such as the specific body parts missing from the victims and the state of preservation of their remains. The horror is further amplified by the mysterious disappearance of Dylan and the eerie Instagram posts that vanish.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are introduced with clear motivations: Clay seeks a new climbable cliff face for his dissertation, Sylvia is interested in the ecosystem, Dylan aims to be the first to climb the new wall, and Luke is there reluctantly at Dylan’s insistence. However, the reviewer wishes the novel had spent more time developing the characters before the horror unfolds, allowing readers to connect with them more deeply.\n\n- **Comparison to *The Ruins*:**  \n  The novel is compared favorably to *The Ruins*, though it doesn’t quite reach the same level of mastery. The reviewer appreciates the similarities but feels the story could have benefited from a slower pace, more focus on survival, and a deeper exploration of the strange environment rather than leaning into ghostly elements.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its shortcomings, the novel is described as a fun, gory horror story that delivers on its promises. It’s recommended for fans of *The Ruins* or those looking for a quick, entertaining read in the horror genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*This Wretched Valley* is a gripping horror novel that effectively uses classic tropes and delivers a gory, suspenseful narrative.

As an amateur climber, I found the premise of four students venturing into the woods to discover a new climbing wall particularly relatable. The concept of the earth as a source of horror was intriguing. However, I finished the book with mixed feelings; some mysteries were over-explained while others were left vague, leading to an imbalance in how the forest's secrets were revealed. For instance, the chaotic demise of each character raised questions—how could Dylan kill the hatchet-man and escape a pool of blood, only to later be buried under a rock?

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Opening and Premise:**  \n  The book started really great with its description of the fate of the four main characters. The beginning was so creepy and well-written, sizzling with tension. I loved the premise of four students going out into the woods to find a new climbing wall, as I could relate well as an amateur climber. The idea of the earth being the main source of horror was also intriguing.\n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**  \n  In the middle and closer to the end, the book lost some of its pacing for me. While I read it in one go due to my interest in the climbers' fates, the tension diminished. It became too obvious where the book was headed about halfway through, and the ending felt overly long, especially since the outcomes were mostly clear by then.\n\n- **Mystery and Explanation:**  \n  I finished the book with a strange feeling of some mysteries being over-explained while others remained under-explained. There was a lack of balance in how the forest's mysteries were handled. For example, the demise of each character felt chaotic. Why could Dylan kill the hatchet-man and escape the pool of blood but later get buried under a rock? The explanation for Sylvia's skeleton being sucked away by the earth felt flat and inconsequential. The cellphone connection and electricity mysteries also seemed random.\n\n- **Writing and Ideas:**  \n  Despite these issues, the writing itself and the author's ideas that shaped the story were really good. I am curious about any subsequent books by this author.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had a strong start with a creepy and tension-filled premise, but it lost momentum in the middle and end due to pacing issues and uneven explanations of its mysteries. While some aspects felt chaotic or underdeveloped, the writing and creative ideas were compelling enough to leave me interested in the author's future work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Potential:**  \n  - On the surface, *This Wretched Valley* is incredibly intriguing and captivating. The premise of a group of \"researchers\" entering haunted woods known for people going missing (as mentioned by the waitress) is compelling. The series of creepy events leading up to the eventual death of the characters (revealed in the first chapter) adds to the book's potential.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Reader Immersion:**  \n  - One of the main drawbacks for me was the author's tendency to explicitly point out what the characters saw versus what was reality. I would have preferred to fall into the madness with the characters without being told, for example, \"if the character had looked deep inside themselves, they would have noticed that this didn't make sense.\" Similarly, during creepy scenes, the author would interject with statements like, \"if the character looked down, they'd see that there was nothing there.\" I believe the reader should be trusted to understand that the characters are likely hallucinating or losing touch with reality.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters were all unreliable and deeply flawed, which I found interesting. I appreciated how the author gradually made them worse and worse as they fell under the spell of the woods and the land. This slow descent into madness added depth to their personalities and the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite the issues with the narrative style, I still had a spooky good time reading this book. It was fun and engaging enough to make me want to read *The Ruins*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *This Wretched Valley* had a lot of potential with its intriguing premise and creepy atmosphere, the author's tendency to over-explain the characters' perceptions detracted from the immersion. However, the flawed characters and their gradual descent into madness were well-executed, making the book an enjoyable, spooky read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The seemingly endless bottle of moonshine felt unrealistic; who would stumble upon a random bottle in the woods and choose to drink it, fully aware of its hallucinogenic effects?

However, the narrative then shifts to a flashback, detailing the events leading to their deaths.  \n  - The lack of suspense is a drawback, as the reader already knows the fate of three characters from the first chapter.  \n  - The pacing suffers due to repetitive and overly graphic descriptions of the characters’ demises, which become schlocky and over the top by the third death.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  - The primary motivation to continue reading is to discover the fate of the fourth character and the dog, as the other characters’ outcomes are already known.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Editing:**  \n  - The writing is good, but the book would benefit from tighter editing to reduce redundancy and improve the overall flow.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Work:**  \n  - Despite its flaws, I’m looking forward to the author’s next book, as there is potential for growth and improvement.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has a strong setting and an intriguing premise, its pacing, lack of suspense, and repetitive violence detract from the overall experience. The writing shows promise, but tighter editing could elevate the story. I remain hopeful for the author’s future work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

When done well, this can really pay off, but sadly, in my opinion, it wasn't executed effectively in this case.  \n\n- **Writing and Editing Quality:**  \n  - I wouldn't say it was a bad book—I've read bad books, and this isn't that. It's written fairly well and edited well.  \n  - I can tell the author loves horror and is familiar with the genre, and I will be checking out her next release.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  - About a quarter of the way through, I realized this might not be the book I was hoping for.  \n  - I was left disappointed, but it just wasn't for me, I suppose.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential and was well-written and edited, it fell short in terms of character development and narrative execution for me. Despite my disappointment, I appreciate the author's passion for the genre and look forward to her future work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.8 stars."

The connections felt half-baked, and it seemed like the author almost forgot the story was based on that mystery. Things just happened without a strong link to the original incident.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  While you don’t have to be a rock climber to enjoy the book, I think rock climbers might relate to it more than I did.

No. He runs off and is missing through most of the book. Hallucinations cause Luke (his owner) to think he is dead. However, Slade is later found at the end of the book.

            "The dog survives, going missing before reappearing at the end, a bit worse for wear but ultimately unharmed. An emotional scene features a fake version of the dog being killed, but it’s made clear that it’s not the real one. The book evokes strong vibes reminiscent of *Blair Witch Project (1999)* and *The Endless (2017)*, which I found both accurate and enjoyable. The unexpected reveal of the sentient forest and cannibal zombie ghosts added a fun and unique twist to the story. However, the ending felt somewhat drawn out, especially since it’s evident from the start that most characters will die and the mystery is largely resolved by the three-quarters mark.",

However, the author shows potential, and I’m open to exploring their future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Creepiness: 2.75/5  \n- Overall: 1/5"

I felt like I needed more of a backstory on the valley. While it was interesting to see the characters spiral into madness and insanity due to the valley, I still wanted more details about how the valley came to be.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I did love the characters. Their development and descent into madness were compelling and engaging.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I am not a person who loves the outdoors, so I feel like climbers or people who enjoy camping might appreciate this book more than I did.\n\n- **Author’s Future Work:**  \n  I am looking forward to seeing what Jenny Kiefer comes out with next. This book has piqued my interest in her writing.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thanks to Quirk Books for the ARC.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t love the book as much as I hoped, I still found it enjoyable, particularly the characters and their descent into madness.

However, the execution falls short, as the themes of curse and violence aren't fully fleshed out, leaving the atmosphere feeling incomplete.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an interesting premise and sets up a mysterious atmosphere, it lacks clarity and depth in explaining the events and developing its characters. The unresolved nature of the curse and the killings left me wanting more.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

The eerie and unsettling vibe of the book mirrored my own experience of exploring an unknown rock face in Livingston, Kentucky, which was so unnerving that we had to abandon the trip. The fact that the road wasn’t even on Google maps added to the surreal and atmospheric quality of both the book and my real-life experience.  \n\n- **Engagement and Immersion:**  \n  Reading this book at Red River Gorge and camping at Miguel’s heightened the sense of immersion. The story’s setting and tone felt so aligned with my surroundings that it made the reading experience uniquely atmospheric and memorable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivered an intensely atmospheric and immersive experience, especially given the serendipitous overlap between the story’s setting and my own camping trip.

This made it harder for me to stay engaged as the plot progressed.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The first chapter revealed too much, which diminished my interest in the ending. I found myself not caring about how the story concluded because the suspense was undermined early on.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had strong writing and an intriguing start, its repetitive nature, overhyped reputation, and lack of suspense due to early revelations made it a disappointing read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Kiefer's ability to scare—and describe scenes of horror—is strong.\n\n- **Supernatural Thread and Emotional Resonance:**  \n  The supernatural thread of the story was intriguing, but I felt like we weren't given a \"reason\" for why what was happening happened. With this storyline not tied to reality or a relatable emotion/historical issue, it didn't resonate as much with me as it could have.

            "While I appreciated the narrative, I occasionally struggled to suspend my disbelief. The characters' choices and behaviors seemed implausible for a group with their level of experience—such as lacking a satellite phone, proper first aid, or an emergency plan. Their attitudes toward the environment felt inconsistent with their outdoorsy backgrounds. I enjoyed the interplay of timelines and the glimpses of horror woven throughout the story, but the tantalizing hints were never fully realized. I would have preferred a stronger common thread connecting the elements beyond the overarching theme of an 'evil forest,' though this is a matter of personal taste. Overall, the pacing was generally good; while it occasionally lagged, I remained engaged and eager to see what would happen next.",
            "The author attempted to juggle too many characters, sacrificing depth for breadth. As a result, the characters came across as flat and one-dimensional. While there were intriguing hints of deeper motivations and tensions that could have enriched the horror narrative, these elements were never fully developed.",

It shifts the focus from \"who will survive\" to \"how things happen,\" creating a puzzle-like narrative.  \n\n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n  - The novel is a solid entry in the \"haunted/bad place\" concept, appealing to fans of similar books like *The Ruins* or *Annihilation*.  \n\n- **Comparative Analysis:**  \n  - While the book doesn’t execute its concept as effectively as *The Ruins* or *Annihilation*, it still holds its own within the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a fun and spooky read, particularly for those who enjoy seeing bad things happen to unlikeable characters. Its unique narrative structure and thematic alignment with the \"haunted/bad place\" concept make it a worthwhile choice for fans of the genre, even if it doesn’t quite reach the heights of comparable works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

While I anticipated the fate of the missing girl—an outcome that made sense and I was hoping for—it didn't detract from my experience.

The setting, along with its haunting presence, could have claimed their lives instantly, yet it chose to torment them instead, gradually eroding their hope for rescue or escape. This element was particularly effective.",

The latter didn’t captivate me, and the way it played out felt underwhelming.  \n\n- **Mystery and Pacing:**  \n  The book hinges on the mystery of the death of three group members and the disappearance of the fourth, with emphasis on the eerie detail of one body being a squeaky-clean skeleton. However, the death of that character was entirely underwhelming, and what happened to her afterward lacked impact since she was already dead.  \n\n- **Predictability and Satisfaction:**  \n  I predicted what happened to the girl who disappeared, which wasn’t necessarily bad because it made sense and I wanted it to happen. However, there was only one very gruesome death that truly made me squirm.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Aside from the climber girl who disappeared, I didn’t find the characters as compelling as they could have been. They had a good base and a few interesting traits, but these didn’t lead to satisfying conclusions.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  What saved the book for me were the descriptions of being stuck in the woods, left to the elements with an injured party member and no cellphone service. The place (and its ghosts) could have killed everyone immediately, but instead, it toyed with them, slowly wearing them down and removing any hope of rescue or escape. This aspect was fairly effective.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some intriguing elements, particularly the atmospheric descriptions of the woods and the slow psychological torment, it fell short in character development, plot execution, and delivering satisfying conclusions.

I didn’t really like any of them except for the dog and Sylvia.  \n\n- **Plot Logic (Dog-Related):**  \n  I have to say, don’t bring your dog to places you’re working in the woods.

The dog's disappearance and the indifference of most characters, particularly the girlfriend's initial reluctance to involve the dog, diminished my investment in the story.

Their interactions are marked by tension and conflict, particularly as they repeatedly attempt to leave the area but fail.  \n\n- **Pacing and Repetition:**  \n  While the concept is rich, the execution feels redundant. The characters' repeated attempts to leave and their constant shouting of \"We need to leave!\" and \"We can't leave!\" become repetitive, detracting from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was disappointing to me. It felt familiar and lacked originality, resembling conclusions I've encountered in many other books. There was nothing particularly new or standout about it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents a great and odd concept with a strong hook and atmospheric imagery, but the execution falls short due to repetitive pacing and a lackluster ending. While it has its chilling moments, the overall experience is mixed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Clay is egotistical and irritating, while Dylan, though somewhat relatable, is excessively obsessed with climbing.

While the dog’s fate provided a small highlight, the overall experience felt repetitive and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 to 2.5 out of 5 stars."

This repetition detracts from the overall experience. However, the concept of a sentient landscape is intriguing, and the author skillfully immerses the characters in this world. There are genuinely effective horror elements, particularly the tension in the free solo scene, which stands out as one of the novel's highlights. Overall, the setup is solid, and the execution aligns well with the initial premise.",

They lack memorable qualities, making them feel like mere plot devices destined to meet their demise, which is predictable from the outset. This predictability diminishes any potential tension in the story.",

It’s a celebration of creativity and freedom, which is always awesome.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The plot isn’t the issue. I liked the concept of the sentient landscape and how the author effectively brought the characters into that world. There are some genuinely effective horror elements, particularly the tension in the free solo scene, which stands out as one of the novel’s best moments. The setup is generally solid, and the execution makes sense from the starting point.  \n\n- **Redundancy in Plotting:**  \n  The plotting becomes repetitive. All four main characters repeatedly trip over roots while trying to escape, which feels overdone despite the setting being the woods. This repetition detracts from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are flat and one-dimensional. For example, Dylan’s sole trait is her desire to become a famous professional climber, which is reiterated too often. There’s nothing quirky or memorable about them, and they feel like they exist solely to die, which is predictable from the start. This predictability undermines any potential tension.  \n\n- **Language and Writing Style:**  \n  The language is my biggest issue. Poorly chosen verbs and confusing usage (e.g., “slapped in the nostrils by cigarette smoke”) disrupt the flow. The similes and metaphors are often awkward or nonsensical (e.g., “knotted skein of doom,” “hot, bitter pill”). Words and phrases are used redundantly, with excessive mentions of nostrils, esophagus, goosebumps, and hair standing up. Additionally, the overuse of the f-word becomes tiresome, with characters dropping f-bombs excessively and predictably.  \n\n- **Memorable Moments:**  \n  Despite the criticisms, there are moments that stand out, like the free solo scene and the humorous haiku-like line: “‘Fuck,’ Clay said. ‘Fuck, fuck, fuck, what the fuck is that?’”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the book’s existence and some of its creative elements, the flat characters, repetitive plotting, and poor language choices ultimately left me disappointed. The novel has potential, but its execution falls short in several key areas.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Engagement and Atmosphere:**  \n  The first chapter is very intriguing and atmospheric. The discovery of three bodies in the woods, in strange and inexplicable states of decomposition, sets a strong, creepy vibe. If the entire novel had maintained this liminal, unexplained tone, I would have loved it.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Ambiguity:**  \n  Unfortunately, the book tries to explain far too much, which left me annoyed. The plot involving a flesh-eating forest and time-traveling ghosties felt ridiculous and undermined the horror for me. I prefer horror that remains ambiguous and leaves room for theories and questions.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters felt one-dimensional. The flashback structure introduced four young adults—Dylan, Luke, Clay, and Sylvia—but their personalities and motivations didn’t feel fully developed or compelling.  \n\n- **Stylistic Choices:**  \n  There were odd stylistic choices, such as repeated references to trees and bushes looking \"pixelated\" and comparisons to animated GIFs. These felt out of place and didn’t seem to lead anywhere meaningful. Additionally, the omniscient narrator drained tension by explicitly commenting on the characters’ experiences, leaving no room for surprises or gradual revelations.  \n\n- **Reader Experience and Recommendations:**  \n  While I was ultimately disappointed, I recognize that many readers are enjoying this book. I would still encourage anyone interested to give it a try, as it might work better for them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel started strong with an intriguing and atmospheric opening but ultimately fell short for me due to over-explained plot elements, one-dimensional characters, and stylistic choices that detracted from the tension and mystery.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  I was initially drawn to the setting of *This Wretched Valley* by Jenny Kiefer, with its mysterious, impenetrable forests reminiscent of *The Ritual* and the untouched cliff that the characters felt compelled to conquer for their careers. However, while the premise was promising, the execution fell flat. The ghosts and hallucinations appeared as early as the first 40 pages, and the opening chapter felt like a script for a true-crime documentary, which didn’t quite set the right tone for a horror novel.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot became repetitive quickly, with the characters repeatedly finding themselves in the same situations. This lack of variety made the story predictable, and I often figured out what was happening long before the characters did. The pacing didn’t help build tension or suspense, which is crucial for a horror novel.\n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  While there were plenty of violent scenes, they were described in a straightforward manner without much creativity or depth. The violence didn’t evoke disgust or fear, which left me feeling underwhelmed. Additionally, some details, like the characters going on a hike without power banks, felt unrealistic and took me out of the story.\n\n- **Characters and Concepts:**  \n  The characters lacked depth, and their motivations felt shallow. The high-concept ideas introduced in the story didn’t live up to their potential, making the overall experience less engaging. Compared to other horror novels like *Twisted Ones* or *Hollow Places*, which also feature American backdrops and are written by women, the characters and concepts in *This Wretched Valley* were far less compelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *This Wretched Valley* was a disappointing read. Despite an intriguing setting, the repetitive plot, lackluster horror elements, and underdeveloped characters made it fall short of expectations. I would recommend exploring other horror novels like *Twisted Ones* or *Hollow Places* for a more satisfying experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The characters are ambitious and driven, yet they frequently make frustratingly poor decisions, resembling more horror movie archetypes than relatable individuals. Clay is consumed by his dissertation, Dylan is preoccupied with her influencer career, Sylvia is merely trying to survive the trip, and Luke is on a quest to find his dog. Their lack of depth makes it difficult to fully engage with their fates, but their flaws effectively underscore the story’s themes of hubris and ignorance.",

The forest feels alive and menacing, characterized by winding paths, malfunctioning technology, and an overwhelming sense of dread. While the ambiguity surrounding the valley's malevolent force heightens the terror, it may leave some readers craving more clarity. Overall, the novel effectively delivers a haunting experience filled with dread and just the right amount of gore to leave a lasting impression."

It’s a great choice for fans of creepy, isolated settings and stories that leave you questioning what’s lurking in the woods.",

While suspension of disbelief is acceptable in genres like fantasy, extreme horror, or when the narrator is a psychopath, it feels out of place here. For example, when a dog is terrified to enter the woods, at least one of the four characters should acknowledge it, especially after several anomalies and warnings. Bringing a dog to a climbing destination is also unrealistic, as it would be left alone for hours, vulnerable to predators like coyotes.\n\n- **Genre Expectations and Recommendations:**  \n  I was recommended this book by a horror site and Goodreads as a must-read horror novel. However, it failed to meet my expectations, and I now consider both sources unreliable.\n\n- **Accuracy of Climbing and Mountaineering Details:**  \n  As an experienced climber and mountaineer, I found the technical inaccuracies frustrating. A climber would never forget a helmet, as it’s second nature. Boots are for hiking or mountaineering, not climbing, and climbers wear specific shoes. Dylan, a sponsored climber with over eight years of experience, wouldn’t wear the same footwear for climbing and walking. Additionally, her inability to solo belay and her belayer’s lack of engagement (standing on the ground instead of climbing with her) are unrealistic. Climbing into the sun without protective eyewear is another glaring oversight. My own climbing accident occurred due to a belayer’s negligence, making these inaccuracies particularly jarring.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The book does pick up later with more action, but the lack of common sense throughout the story is distracting. The author could have maintained the plot’s momentum while allowing characters to make smarter decisions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I was deeply disappointed by this book. The unrealistic character behavior, technical inaccuracies in climbing, and failure to meet genre expectations overshadowed any positive aspects of the story. While the plot eventually gains momentum, the persistent lack of common sense made it difficult to enjoy.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5 stars, rounded up to 2."

            "The characters' ineptitude and lack of preparation are strikingly evident. While their incompetence ultimately leads to their downfall, the book presents them as somewhat capable, creating an inconsistency. Their extreme poor planning and decision-making suggest that even in a safe environment, they would likely still fail.",
            "The story highlights several critical missteps in backpacking safety. The characters neglected to leave a flight plan or trail information with anyone at home, a fundamental rule for any outdoor adventure. They also brought a hard-sided cooler for beer on a 3+ hour hike, adding unnecessary weight. Carrying only one climbing rope for a multi-week expedition with multiple routes, without backups, was another significant oversight. Their reliance on a single GPS, while dismissing hard copy maps, further compromised their preparedness. Additionally, they had only one 5L jug for water storage, lacking a filter or purification tablets—insufficient for even one person for a single day. Bringing three tents for four people was excessive and impractical, especially given the cold conditions in the Kentucky backwoods. However, the book excels in creating a sense of dread and building tension through the repetitive scenery, which kept me engaged throughout."

In this case, the author’s background as a climber added an exciting layer of authenticity to the story. The climbing sections were the best parts of the book, showcasing the author’s expertise. Unfortunately, these sections made up only about 5% of the story, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Pacing and Filler Content:**  \n  The majority of the book felt like filler, with a lot of meandering around the woods and painfully useless exposition. The pacing was uneven, and the story often got bogged down by repetitive and unnecessary details.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Repetition:**  \n  The writing suffered from excessive repetition and clichés.

They frequently attributed strange occurrences to dreams, which became tiresome after a while. While nightmares are a staple of horror, overusing this trope undermined the tension and realism.  \n\n- **Narrative Choices and Predictability:**  \n  Revealing the fates of three out of four characters in the opening chapter was a bold narrative choice, but it didn’t work here. It eliminated much of the suspense and left little room for surprises.  \n\n- **Integration of Horror and Climbing:**  \n  I had hoped the story would integrate climbing more deeply with the horror elements, similar to the intro of *Wrong Turn* but with a sustained focus on climbing. Unfortunately, the potential for combining these aspects was largely untapped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the climbing sections were a highlight, they were too sparse to carry the book.

Additionally, the excessive vomiting scenes (occurring every other page) felt overdone, and the descriptions lacked variety.  \n\n- **Framing Device and Hook:**  \n  The framing device had me hooked from the very beginning (or rather, the first minute, since I listened to the audiobook). Showing three mutilated corpses and the mystery surrounding them before cutting to the past with four protagonists was an incredible way to draw me into the mystery.  \n\n- **Antagonistic Force and Themes:**  \n  I appreciated the intentionally vague nature of the antagonistic force, which gave the story an almost Lovecraftian bent. It firmly conveyed the idea that humans are insignificant compared to the nature that surrounds us, and I found that theme compelling.  \n\n- **Setting and Character Concepts:**  \n  As a side note, I don’t read many books set in the 2010s onwards, so it was interesting to see concepts like climbing influencers used as character ideas. I always enjoy books with unique character occupations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some issues with pacing and excessive, repetitive descriptions, Jenny Kiefer’s debut novel is a strong entry with a gripping framing device, intriguing themes, and unique character concepts.

It took the thrill out of the story since I knew the outcome beforehand.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had strong character development and an impressive cover, it was weighed down by overused tropes, a lack of explanation, and a structure that diminished the suspense.

Instead of being unsettling, the narrative comes across as contrived and unconvincing, resembling a series of arbitrary occurrences rather than a well-crafted story.  \n\n- **Horror and Atmosphere:**  \n  The attempt to create horror through ambiguity and the unknown falls flat. The lack of logical progression or meaningful stakes makes the villainy feel petty and unthreatening. The atmosphere fails to evoke genuine fear, leaving the reader more confused than scared.  \n\n- **Originality and Execution:**  \n  The story relies heavily on overused tropes without adding anything fresh or compelling. The execution feels lackluster, with the narrative devolving into a chaotic and unsatisfying experience, akin to being misled by a malfunctioning GPS.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel attempts to channel the chaotic, campy energy of a B-movie, it ultimately fails to deliver a coherent or engaging story. The lack of depth, logical progression, and genuine horror makes it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

If you enjoy gore and action, you might find it entertaining, but otherwise, it’s worth skipping.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I thought it might resemble a Blair Witch-style narrative, but it didn’t meet that expectation.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  About halfway through, I could see the ending coming from a million miles away. The story felt overly familiar, as if it had been done before, which made it less compelling.  \n\n- **Genre Execution:**  \n  The supernatural horror elements didn’t work for me. They felt forced and weren’t scary at all. While I’m not a big fan of this genre to begin with, I expected more from the execution.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  You can definitely skip this one. It didn’t deliver on its potential, and I wouldn’t recommend it to others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel started with promise but ultimately fell flat due to its predictability, lackluster horror elements, and failure to meet my expectations. It’s not a book I’d recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Seven months later, three mangled bodies are discovered in the area, missing eyes, fingers, and other body parts. This setup initially piqued my interest, but the story's execution didn't fully deliver on its potential.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  Certain parts of the book felt slow, which detracted from the overall engagement. While others may have found the pacing acceptable, I personally struggled with these slower sections.\n\n- **Reader Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  Based on the reviews I read beforehand, I expected the book to be a \"slam dunk.\" However, my experience fell short of these expectations. While many reviewers rated it highly (4's and 5's), I found myself disagreeing with their assessments.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing premise and some compelling moments, its pacing issues and failure to meet my expectations based on other reviews left me disappointed.

Lengthy, convoluted paragraphs describing physical scenes often left me confused, requiring multiple reads to grasp the action. The incessant focus on blood and vomiting quickly became tedious and monotonous.",

Kiefer relies heavily on repetitive imagery and excessive gore, which bogs down the plot. There are lengthy paragraphs detailing physical scenes, but they are so convoluted that I often had to re-read them to understand what was happening. The constant descriptions of blood and vomiting became tedious and boring.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any growth, making it impossible to root for their survival. (The dog was the only character with any sense, and Sylvia was somewhat tolerable.) The characters consistently made poor decisions, ignoring obvious dangers, which made their actions feel illogical and frustrating. For example, it was hard to believe that an experienced hiker would lack proper equipment or emergency supplies, or that someone would give up their job and apartment for a trip of questionable length.\n\n- **Mystery and Suspense:**  \n  The book lacked mystery because the author didn’t trust the reader to figure things out on their own. Every time a ghost was introduced, the next chapter would provide a flashback explaining exactly who and what they were. Similarly, when Clay started drinking, the author immediately clarified that his perspective was unreliable, and when Luke hallucinated, the author explicitly stated he was brain-damaged. This spoon-feeding of information removed any opportunity for the reader to question or engage with the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I did not enjoy this book. The repetitive and overly descriptive prose, poorly developed characters, and lack of mystery made it a frustrating and unengaging read.

Everything was repeated a hundred times, and there was no reason behind anything that happened—neither factual nor mystical or paranormal.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were shallow, and everybody acted irresponsibly.  \n\n- **Plot Coherence and Explanation:**  \n  Nothing was explained, and the story felt like a fever dream—one that you eagerly want to wake up from, not because it's horrible, but because it's lame and weird, and you can't comprehend anything.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The added gore made me sick to my stomach and didn't add to the story. It felt like an excuse to call this book a horror novel.  \n\n- **Interludes and Lore:**  \n  The interludes didn't make any sense, didn't add to the lore, and didn't provide any reason for their inclusion. They just confused me about which story I was reading.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  I hated every second of reading this book. It was a chore to finish, and I wouldn’t read it again—not ever.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a promising premise and a strong start, the book failed to deliver on multiple fronts. The poor structure, shallow characters, lack of coherence, and unnecessary gore made it a frustrating and unpleasant read. The interludes added confusion rather than depth, and the overall experience felt like a nonsensical fever dream.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned, but the tone suggests a very low rating, likely 1/5 or 2/5."

The pacing was so slow that I just wanted it to end, but it felt like an eternity to reach the conclusion.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The book did not meet my expectations at all. I anticipated a thrilling horror experience, but instead, I was left feeling utterly bored.  \n\n- **Redeeming Qualities:**  \n  The only aspects I found somewhat enjoyable were the gore and the introduction. However, these were not enough to salvage the overall experience.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  The cover is visually appealing and way too pretty for a book that disappointed me so much.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  My dissatisfaction was so strong that I wrote this review before even finishing the book, which speaks volumes about my experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis horror novel failed to deliver on its promise of excitement and suspense. Despite its attractive cover and a few redeeming elements like the gore and introduction, the slow pacing and lack of engagement made it a tedious read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
