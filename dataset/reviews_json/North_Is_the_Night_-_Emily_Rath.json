            "The book begins at a brisk pace, but the exposition drags on until the halfway mark, leaving the story feeling less engaging. Overall, it feels more like a setup for the sequel, *South is the Sea*, than a standalone narrative.",
            "Siiri and Aina are well-developed characters, with Siiri particularly standing out as a strong, protective figure who embodies masculine traits. Their dynamic drives the story, and Siiri's encounter with a bear in the woods adds an intriguing layer to her character.",
            "The novel excels in its world-building, providing a vivid portrayal of Finnish paganism. The plot, centered on Christian invaders seeking to convert the Finns from their native beliefs, is especially captivating.",
            "Despite some pacing issues, the rich cultural portrayal and captivating fantasy elements made the book a highly enjoyable read. I couldn't put it down and eagerly await the next installment.",
            "This book is better categorized as a fantasy with sapphic elements rather than a sapphic romantasy, as it includes male-female relationships that may be off-putting for some sapphic readers. The sapphic romance is limited, offering only glimpses of attraction between the characters, but there is potential for more sapphic content in future installments."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This novel is a captivating fantasy with strong world-building and a rich exploration of Finnish paganism. While the pacing feels slow and the sapphic romance is minimal, the characters and cultural depth make it a worthwhile read. The story sets the stage for what promises to be an exciting sequel.",

The entire novel feels like a prelude to the second book in the duology, *South is the Sea*.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel excels in world-building, offering a rich portrayal of Finnish paganism. The storyline involving Christian invaders attempting to convert the Finns from their native religion is particularly compelling.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  While marketed as \"sapphic romantasy,\" the book is better classified as a fantasy with sapphic content. It includes MF (male-female) content, which may be a dealbreaker for some sapphic readers. The sapphic romance is minimal, with only \"love crumbles\" between the characters, but there is hope for more sapphic content in the sequel.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The two main characters, Siiri and Aina, are well-developed, with Siiri standing out as a strong, protective figure with \"masc top vibes.\" Her dynamic with Aina drives the story, and her encounter with a bear in the woods adds an intriguing layer to her character.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the pacing issues, the fantasy elements and rich cultural portrayal made the book highly enjoyable. The reader tore through the story and is eagerly anticipating the sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating fantasy with strong world-building and a rich exploration of Finnish paganism. While the pacing feels slow and the sapphic romance is minimal, the characters and cultural depth make it a worthwhile read.

The promotional art of girls kissing led me to expect a genuinely queer story, but instead, the book offers a shallow depiction of queer relationships. The women in the story do not desire each other in the same way they desire cis men, which feels like a missed opportunity for authentic queer storytelling.  \n- **Depth of Relationships:**  \n  The relationships between the female characters lack depth and passion. The so-called \"softgirllove\" moment, where they kiss gently once, feels more like a token gesture than a meaningful exploration of their connection. I wanted to see more intensity, such as a real F/F/M love triangle, but the story falls short.  \n- **Authenticity and Boldness:**  \n  The book lacks the boldness and authenticity I was hoping for. Instead of embracing the queerness and exploring it with passion and depth, it feels watered down and safe. I wanted the story to \"get queer,\" \"get gay,\" and \"get freaky,\" but it didn‚Äôt deliver on any of these fronts.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book disappoints in its portrayal of queer relationships, offering a shallow and inauthentic depiction that doesn‚Äôt live up to the expectations set by its promotional material.

Everyone who spoke was either a laughable caricature or insufferable.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was bad.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was ridiculous and exasperating.  \n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  The dialogue was cringeworthy.  \n\n- **Villains:**  \n  Every villain was cartoonishly evil.  \n\n- **Character Consistency and Behavior:**  \n  The leads flip-flopped between being unbearably selfish, hypocritical, dramatic (we get it, you‚Äôre both willing to die for everyone you‚Äôve ever met), delusional, and inconsistent (mostly Aina‚Ä¶what was going on with her dual personalities?).  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The POV swaps every few pages were unnecessary.  \n\n- **Positive Takeaways:**  \n  The best that can be said about this book is that it prompted me to read the Wikipedia article for sauna and look up the detailed instructions for salt-packing fish.  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  My biggest takeaway from this book is that I need to binge-read another book tomorrow (Dec 31st) because I can‚Äôt close out 2024 with this as my final book of the year!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell far short of my expectations. Despite my initial excitement about Finnish mythology, the poor character development, weak world-building, cringeworthy dialogue, and inconsistent behavior of the leads made it a disappointing read. The only redeeming aspect was that it inspired me to learn more about saunas and salt-packing fish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While the premise is intriguing, the lack of detailed descriptions of the setting and characters made it difficult to visualize the world.  \n\n- **Characterization and Relationships:**  \n  The dual perspectives of Siiri and Aina were often indistinguishable, making it hard to connect with them individually. The relationship between the two characters is written ambiguously, with romantic undertones (kisses and shared beds) that are repeatedly denied by the narrative, which felt frustrating and inconsistent.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot relied heavily on repetitive cliffhangers that felt forced, detracting from the overall flow of the story.  \n\n- **Cultural and Social Representation:**  \n  The portrayal of women and indigenous people as evil witches felt problematic and insensitive, especially given the historical context of Christian missionaries targeting and killing indigenous women.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  The glossary at the beginning, detailing Finnish gods/goddesses and lore, was appreciated but slightly overwhelming. It added depth to the world-building but could have been integrated more seamlessly into the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and potential, it left me underwhelmed due to its lack of detailed descriptions, repetitive cliffhangers, and problematic portrayals.

Having some knowledge of the Kalevala from music and books, I enjoyed discovering new aspects of it. Additionally, any mention of the Kalevala brings Turisas's *Cursed Be Iron* to mind, which is always a positive association for me.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Character Development:**  \n  I really enjoyed how the dual threads of the two POVs wove around each other. Each character had their own strengths and used them effectively, avoiding the stereotypical \"strong female lead\" trope. The book demonstrates that strength comes in many forms, which I appreciated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel skillfully integrates Finnish mythology and folklore while presenting a well-structured narrative with nuanced character development.

To do so, she forges alliances with a bear and an eccentric shaman, skillfully navigating the boundary between life and death.",

            "I loved Siiri and her journey through the wilderness to find the famed lost shaman. She was a character I could truly root for and connect with throughout the book. However, I found some of the antagonists in Siiri's story to be underdeveloped and one-dimensional. Aina's storyline, particularly after the halfway point, fell flat for me. I didn't connect with her character, especially regarding her awkward involvement with the god of the dead, which felt unnecessary and uncomfortable. The pregnancy subplot was particularly disappointing, making it hard for me to stay engaged. While I could sense Siiri's yearning and passion for Aina, it often seemed one-sided. In contrast, characters like the goddesses Kalma and Loviatar were layered and intriguing, enhancing the overall narrative.",
            "I absolutely love the Finnish setting and the rich folklore woven throughout *North is the Night*. Finland, often overshadowed by the more famous Scandinavian Vikings, offers a unique backdrop that I truly appreciated. The portrayal of the gods and the realm of the dead was captivating, particularly the vivid depiction of Tuonela, which truly came alive on the page."

While I loved the Finnish setting, folklore, and Siiri's character, Aina's storyline and some underdeveloped antagonists left me wanting more.

The gods and the realm of the dead were well done and intriguing, with Tuonela truly coming alive on the page.  \n\n- **Character Development (Siiri):**  \n  I loved the character of Siiri and her journey through the wilderness to find the famed lost shaman. She was the character I could root for and connect with throughout the entire book.  \n\n- **Character Development (Antagonists):**  \n  Unfortunately, I think some of the antagonists in Siiri's story were a tad underdeveloped and one-note.  \n\n- **Character Development (Aina):**  \n  I did not care as much for Aina and her storyline, especially after about the halfway mark. Aina herself left something to be desired. I did not care for her storyline with the god of the dead and felt like it was a weird addition to the story that gave me major ick vibes at times. Also, the pregnancy? The absolute worst. I kind of disconnected after that.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  I could easily feel Siiri's yearning and passion for Aina but did not feel like Aina had the same yearning for Siiri.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  Characters like the goddesses Kalma and Loviatar were layered and interesting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I have mixed feelings about *North is the Night*.

Aina selflessly volunteers to accompany Kalma to save Siiri, creating a split narrative that explores Aina's trials under the Witch Queen Tuonetar alongside Siiri's quest to rescue her friend.

Meanwhile, Aina struggles in the underworld, tormented by the Witch Queen and forced to bargain with the king of the underworld to return home. The dual POV structure allows readers to experience both Siiri's quest and Aina's struggles, creating a compelling and immersive narrative.  \n\n- **World-Building and Folklore:**  \n  The novel is rich in Finnish folklore, which I found fascinating and educational, as I had little prior knowledge of it. The world-building is detailed, with distinct realms‚ÄîSiiri's journey in the mortal world and Aina's experiences in the underworld‚Äîeach offering unique settings and magical elements. The inclusion of magical animals added to the fantasy appeal.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The strong bond between Siiri and Aina is a highlight of the story. Their friendship is deeply emotional and serves as the driving force behind the plot. The dual POV allows for a deeper understanding of their individual struggles and growth, making their connection even more impactful.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  While I enjoyed the story, I felt the book was too long at times, with certain sections dragging and slowing the momentum. This occasionally made it harder to stay fully engaged.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The audiobook narration was excellent, with the narrators delivering a stunning performance that made it easy to follow and immerse myself in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*North is the Night* is a captivating fantasy novel inspired by Finnish folklore, featuring a strong friendship, rich world-building, and a dual POV structure that enhances the storytelling. While the pacing could have been tighter, the emotional depth, magical elements, and immersive narration made it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book opens with a gripping burst of action, immediately hooking the reader. The narrative follows Aina, who is taken to the realm of death by the goddess, while her best friend Siri embarks on a quest to rescue her, restore the deities, and mend the world. The dual perspectives of Siri and Aina allow for a rich exploration of their intertwined journeys. Each chapter concludes with a cliffhanger that maintains engagement throughout. The plot is straightforward and accessible, making it suitable for newcomers to fantasy. However, around the 60% mark, the story starts to drag, losing momentum despite the ongoing action. The length of the book feels excessive; a more concise version might have enhanced the overall enjoyment.\n",
            "The main characters, Siri and Aina, are designed with distinct personalities‚ÄîSiri as strong and fierce, and Aina as quiet and timid. However, their voices were too similar, making it difficult to differentiate between them. The uniform tone of all the characters further undermines their individuality.",

It got right to the point and hooked me within the first twenty pages.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was a standout aspect for me‚Äî10/10. It was immersive and detailed, and I loved how it was based on Finnish folklore. It introduced me to a whole new world, and now I‚Äôm eager to learn more about these deities and their lore.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I adored the main cast. Siiri‚Äôs drive and attitude were compelling, and I really connected with Aina‚Äôs personality‚ÄîI saw a lot of myself in her. The gods were also fascinating; they felt human yet had an otherness that set them apart. Their complex relationships with each other added depth, and I‚Äôm eager to see more of their dynamics in future books.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my initial surprise about the romance aspect, I really enjoyed this book. It left me hopeful that the series might take a sapphic route, and I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to the second installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful surprise. While it didn‚Äôt fully meet my expectations for a sapphic romance, the pacing, world-building, and characters more than made up for it. I‚Äôm excited to see where the series goes and will be keeping an eye out for the next book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- World-Building: 10/10  \n- Overall Enjoyment: High (no specific score mentioned, but the tone is very positive)."

Just as I got immersed in one side of the story, it would switch, which created a bit of whiplash.  \n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**  \n  The themes, atmosphere, and overall story were strong and compelling. The Finnish-inspired mythology and paganism added a unique and intriguing layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Complexity and Pacing:**  \n  While the story was rich and detailed, there was so much going on that it felt overwhelming at times. It seemed like the story needed to be less rushed but also shorter, which created a bit of confusion for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *North Is the Night* is a fantasy novel with a strong foundation in Finnish mythology and paganism, featuring a mix of Christian and folklore villains. The journey to save a best friend is engaging, though the pacing and dual POV structure could be smoother. The story is rich and atmospheric but occasionally feels overstuffed, making it a bit challenging to follow.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.5 (2.5/5 stars)  \nüå∂Ô∏è: Yes (spice level present)"

As someone who reads mostly romance these days, an almost 600-page Fantasy book was a bit intimidating. Silly me. I should have had faith.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore Integration:**  \n  Rath does a great job of holding our hand and walking us through the Finnish lore and gods. There is a list of the Gods and Goddesses we meet at the front of the book. I expected to need to rely on it, but I did not reference it once. Rath weaves her story clearly and incorporates nuggets of information that clarify powers and roles for the reader.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  This story was beautiful and engaging. Each part is better than the next. Rath hooks the reader, presents some twists and turns, and then wraps the book up with us wanting more.  \n\n- **Personal Impact and Enjoyment:**  \n  I stayed up late to finish this book, which is a rare occurrence. I cannot wait to read the next installment.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I received an ARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEmily Rath's novel is a masterfully crafted fantasy that seamlessly integrates Finnish lore, keeps readers engaged with its pacing and twists, and leaves them eagerly anticipating the next installment.

While there were hints of Siiri‚Äôs feelings for Aina during this time, Aina‚Äôs feelings for Siiri were not clearly indicated. When they finally reunited, their relationship felt rushed and lacked meaningful development. There was so much potential for a compelling sapphic romance, but it fell short. I initially hoped it might be a slow-burn romance, especially since this is part of a duet, but that wasn‚Äôt the case.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I love Emily Rath‚Äôs writing style. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I was drawn to this book, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint in that regard.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the world-building, plot, and characters, the sapphic romance was a significant letdown. The relationship between Siiri and Aina felt underdeveloped and rushed, which was disappointing given the book‚Äôs marketing as a sapphic fantasy. Despite this, I still appreciate the author‚Äôs writing and the overall premise of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

That said, the characters got a little whiny for me toward the end.  \n\n- **Narration and Audio Experience:**  \n  The dual narration was absolutely mandatory to distinguish between the two POVs. The narrator's inflections for the different characters, especially the witches, helped me better visualize which character was speaking.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  Despite the minor flaws, the story is amazing, and I‚Äôll definitely be buying the next installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEmily Rath weaves a magical tale with strong characters and an engaging narrative. While the pacing faltered slightly in the final quarter, the story‚Äôs strengths, including the dual narration and compelling character dynamics, make it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

However, I was pleasantly surprised by how different and unique this story turned out to be.  \n\n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n  This book is based on Finnish folklore, which was a refreshing departure from Rath's usual style. If you're not a fan of folklore or fantasy, you might find it challenging to get through, especially since it lacks the \"spice\" found in her other works.  \n\n- **Length and Pacing:**  \n  The book is quite long, which might make it a bit of a slog for readers who aren't fully invested in the folklore/fantasy elements.  \n\n- **Reader Recommendation:**  \n  A friend from my silent book club, who also only knew Rath from the Jacksonville Rays series, asked me about this book. I assured her it was worth reading, even though it‚Äôs a departure from Rath‚Äôs usual style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial expectations, I found this book to be a delightful and surprising read. It‚Äôs a unique blend of Finnish folklore and fantasy, though its length and lack of \"spice\" might not appeal to everyone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It saved me from absolutely butchering the names in this one. I loved the audio, not just for the pronunciation help, but the narrators did a fantastic job bringing the story of these two women to life.\n\n- **World-Building and Fantasy Elements:**  \n  This is heavy on the fantasy/Finnish lore, which I was super interested in, so the world-building is a lot. It follows two female friends on an epic journey where they are separated, and one is trying to find the other.\n\n- **Dual POV and Character Development:**  \n  There is SO MUCH going on, in both POVs, but I am glad that we had those both. Seeing the struggles of both as they work to get back to one another was fantastic.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot and Anticipation for Sequel:**  \n  The little love triangle tore me apart because I love me a \"why choose\" scenario, haha. But I am so looking forward to the second book to see how that all plays out!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an engaging and immersive read, blending rich fantasy elements with compelling character dynamics. The audiobook enhanced the experience, and the dual POVs added depth to the story. The romantic subplot left me eagerly anticipating the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
