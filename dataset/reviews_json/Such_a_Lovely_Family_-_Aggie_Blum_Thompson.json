The family's dynamics are at the heart of the story, delving into the complexities of familial relationships and the facade of perfection. While most characters are well-developed, Nate and Danit's storyline feels incomplete, as if crucial elements were cut during editing. Their relationship, which appears to have been a focal point, lacks consistent development, leaving Nate's perspective feeling uneven when it resurfaces.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Theme:**  \n   - The premise of the novel revolves around a \"perfect family,\" but this concept falls flat because every POV character dislikes the family and is aware of their flaws.  \n   - The idea of the family being secretly imperfect is undermined by the fact that their flaws are glaringly obvious to everyone in the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - There isn’t a single likable character in the book, which makes reading through its 340 pages a tedious experience.  \n   - The characters are portrayed as mostly awful people, and their lack of redeeming qualities made it impossible for me to connect with or care about them.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n   - The book is supposedly set in DC, but the constant repetition of this fact feels forced and unnecessary.  \n   - The actual setting is in Maryland, which contradicts the DC-centric narrative.  \n   - The author’s portrayal of the DC metropolitan area feels inaccurate and poorly researched, as if she randomly guessed details about the location.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Engagement:**  \n   - The writing is painful to read and fails to engage the reader.  \n   - I stopped caring about the characters and plot from the very first page, and the lack of compelling storytelling made the experience even worse.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel suffers from a flawed premise, unlikable characters, inconsistent setting, and poor writing. The lack of engagement and the tedious narrative made it a genuinely awful read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The killer's identity remains a mystery, adding intrigue, but the lack of emotional investment weakens the overall impact. The plot takes a dramatic and somewhat implausible turn with multiple murders and cover-ups, including Ellie Grace killing her father and Ginny concealing the truth, alongside the revelation of an extramarital affair. These events prompt questions about the family's morality, particularly regarding Nate, who may also be entangled in criminal behavior.",
            "The Calhoun family is portrayed as nasty and scheming, rendering them unlikable. The third-person narrative fosters a sense of detachment, making it difficult to connect with the characters or understand their motivations. Additionally, the twist that nearly all the Calhouns are terrible people comes across as somewhat ridiculous and over-the-top.",

            "The story centers on the Calhoun family during their annual Cherry Blossom Party, which takes a dark turn with a murder that exposes their hidden secrets. The pacing is impressively handled, a rarity in adult mystery novels that often struggle in this area. The main mystery of the murderer's identity and motive offers a satisfying twist, although some smaller revelations are predictable. While the ending feels somewhat rushed, it ultimately aligns with the story's context.",
            "The characters were well-developed and captivating. My favorite was Nate's fiancée, who offered a fresh outsider's perspective on the family's drama. The dynamics within the Calhoun family—Ellie Grace's obsession with perfect photos, Nate's reluctance to discuss his ex-wife, Trey's struggles with sobriety, and Thom's forced smile—added significant depth to the narrative.",
            "The small, ultra-wealthy community setting was captivating, with daily dramas interwoven into the murder investigation. The book's final sentence evokes a sense of foreboding, effectively concluding the story and prompting deeper reflection on such enclaves.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as it offered many elements I seek in an adult mystery. It was highly engaging, and I finished it in just three days instead of the planned five."

Centered around the Calhoun family, this dramatic whodunnit unfolds after the death of patriarch Thom and the shooting of matriarch Ginny during their annual Cherry Blossom Party. With multiple suspects, each harboring their own motives, the plot remains complex and engaging. The story is well-crafted, adhering to a classic whodunnit structure, and strikes a good balance between suspense and character development. The inclusion of the nosy neighbor, Cookie, adds a refreshing touch of levity to an otherwise unlikable cast.",

Specifically, they're all characterized as assholes, except for Nate, Denite, Cookie, and maybe Renee. While I don't mind reading about rich assholes (it's one of my favorite genres), the rich assholes in *Such a Lovely Family* are so trashy that you're happy when almost all of them (except Nate and his fiancée) go to prison.  \n\n- **Motivation and Conflict:**  \n  The set-up of why every single person wanted to kill the victim was actually really good. The victim was so completely terrible that even I wanted to kill him.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was fine, but there's just so little to say about this book overall.

I love a book that constantly has things going on, with multiple mysteries and conflicts.  \n   - The book was unpredictable, and I genuinely couldn’t predict the outcome due to how incriminating everyone looked and the suspicious things everyone did.  \n\n- **Themes and Relatability:**  \n   - The themes of maintaining a perfect family image and hiding behind-closed-doors conflicts were extremely relatable.  \n   - I grew up with family scandals similar to those in the book, and my mother was very similar to Ginny, making the story easy to connect with.  \n\n- **Character Development and Secrets:**  \n   - Everyone had their own extremely interesting secret, and just when you thought the revelation was juicy, it got even juicier.  \n   - There were so many layers to everything, and the development of everyone’s different tropes was incredible.  \n   - For example, the revelation about Malcolm’s parentage—first thinking he was Nate and Helena’s child, then discovering he was Trey’s son with Shawna, and finally learning that Thom was actually the father—was mind-blowing.  \n\n- **Setting and Descriptions:**  \n   - The setting was brilliantly written, with vivid details that made it easy to imagine the cherry blossoms, the house, and the party.  \n   - Aggie Blum Thompson’s descriptions were some of the best I’ve ever read, making the setting come alive.  \n\n- **Author’s Skill and Writing Style:**  \n   - Aggie Blum Thompson is a phenomenal author and a perfect writer.  \n   - The execution of this book was flawless, and I need another book like this from her ASAP.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a suburban, modern version of *Clue* with incredible twists, fast pacing, and a gripping plot. The relatable themes, layered character secrets, and vivid setting descriptions made it an unforgettable read. Aggie Blum Thompson’s talent shines through every page, and I cannot recommend this book enough.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 6/5 stars (if possible)."
