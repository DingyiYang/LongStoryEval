            "The book's pacing felt sluggish, particularly in the middle, and the story's direction became predictable early on. The main conflict—Jack and Bea's unresolved past—wasn't addressed until 75% of the way through. Additionally, the ending felt rushed and clichéd, culminating in a simple decision for them to live together.",
            "Jack's character lacked depth, primarily defined as an introvert who values freedom. While Bea's struggles with infertility and past trauma were well-explored, her growth felt inconsistent. The secondary characters, such as Brigid and Bea's friends, contributed some depth but ultimately did not significantly enhance the story.",
            "While some dialogues came across as repetitive and avoided addressing key issues, the writing shone in its portrayal of Bea’s emotional turmoil. The use of Scrabble and other activities as metaphors for their relationship added a delightful charm to the narrative.",
            "The exploration of infertility and loneliness is both powerful and relatable. The theme of self-discovery and personal growth through life's chapters is well-articulated. While the book touches on grief, forgiveness, and new beginnings, these themes could have been more fully developed.",
            "The romance felt lackluster, lacking both passion and connection. The minimal sex scenes were awkward, especially when Jack requested Bea to take the lead. Rather than developing emotional intimacy, the relationship primarily revolved around casual encounters until the very end."

The pacing was slow, the romance lacked passion, and the character development, particularly for Jack, was underwhelming.

            "This story opens effectively, quickly establishing the heroine Bea's family circumstances, work environment, and future dilemmas in the first chapter. The plot revolves around Bea's move to Ireland for a job, where she reunites with her first love, Jack, now the CTO of her company. The unique premise of a quirky boss compelling employees to commute to a post-divorce castle in Ireland adds an intriguing twist to the narrative.",
            "The attraction between Bea and Jack is beautifully portrayed through quiet moments and lingering glances. Their relationship transitions from a casual fling in Ireland to something deeper, but the shift to love feels abrupt, relying more on serious conversations than on grand gestures or swoon-worthy moments. The love scenes are inconsistent, ranging from closed-door encounters to vague descriptions. Bea's inner turmoil and emotional unavailability can be stressful and frustrating for readers. Her journey centers on personal growth—recovering from a failed marriage, adapting to job changes, being present for her son, and dealing with the reappearance of her ex. As a result, the romance often takes a back seat to Bea's character development.",
            "The Irish castle setting feels underutilized. I would have appreciated a deeper immersion in Irish culture and a more vivid portrayal of the castle's atmosphere.",
            "The book leans towards women's fiction with romantic elements rather than being a full-fledged rom-com. Although it features some witty and humorous dialogue, it lacks the hijinks and comedic scenarios commonly found in traditional rom-coms."

        "conclusion": "This novel offers an engaging premise with a unique setting and a second-chance workplace romance. However, the Irish atmosphere and castle backdrop could have been more immersive, and the romance development felt rushed and lacking in grand gestures. While Bea’s personal growth is a highlight, the story leans more toward women’s fiction than rom-com, with a tone that prioritizes emotional depth over humor and hijinks.",

Bea navigates a demanding job, co-parents her six-year-old son, and manages a divorce, all while avoiding formulaic storytelling. The chapters often leap forward to the next corporate meeting, creating a unique pacing that keeps the narrative fresh.

Both narratives center on a second-chance romance between two witty characters who profoundly understand each other's desires.

This similarity raises an intriguing question: do romance readers seek the comfort of familiar storylines from their favorite authors, or do they crave fresh narratives with each new release?",

            "In this story, we follow Bea, a driven mother navigating her divorce while grappling with two unexpected challenges: frequent work-related travel to Ireland and a rekindled connection with her high school boyfriend, Jack, who is now her colleague. Their initial “when in Ireland fling” gradually evolves into something deeper. Narrated from Bea’s first-person perspective, the story includes only a single flashback to their high school days. While this approach helps distinguish the narrative from the author’s previous work, it leaves their relationship feeling somewhat underdeveloped, as crucial details about their past are revealed only later in the book.",
            "Bea is a relatable, career-driven mother navigating profound life changes. In contrast, Jack's character comes across as less developed, and their relationship would have been strengthened with more backstory introduced earlier in the narrative.",

While this choice avoids making the story feel like a rehash of Rosen’s previous novel, it also leaves the characters’ relationship feeling somewhat underdeveloped, as key details about their past aren’t revealed until late in the book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Bea is portrayed as a relatable, career-focused mother dealing with significant life changes. Jack’s character, however, feels less fleshed out, and their relationship could have benefited from more backstory earlier in the narrative.  \n\n- **Sensitive Topics:**  \n  The novel addresses miscarriage and secondary infertility, which are handled with respect and honesty, adding depth to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing is engaging and maintains a light, enjoyable tone throughout.

However, I found the portrayal of the child character problematic. It frustrates me when six-year-olds are depicted as little geniuses, with their precociousness treated as normal.

Beatrice is a refreshing protagonist—ambitious, career-driven, and a devoted mother, which I found compelling.

Beatrice’s best friends provided unwavering support while also holding her accountable, which added depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was a delightful read, with strong character development, a satisfying slow-burn romance, and meaningful female friendships. While Jack’s character could have been more dynamic, Beatrice’s journey as a multifaceted protagonist made the story truly engaging.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
