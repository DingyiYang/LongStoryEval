            "The story features unrealistic and frustrating plot points, including the heroine's unexpected pregnancy from a one-night stand and her subsequent humiliation as she witnesses the male protagonist's actions. Additionally, the blurb's assertion that he can't get her out of his mind is undermined by his behavior throughout the narrative.",
            "In this story, the male protagonist engages in numerous sexual relationships, including with the heroine's sister and strippers, while hypocritically judging the heroine for her perceived promiscuity. He continues to sleep with the sister even after learning they are siblings, all while the heroine is present in the house. His behavior is both hypocritical and sexist, as he holds the heroine to a different standard than himself. The heroine, portrayed as a doormat, readily succumbs to his advances despite his mistreatment. She suffers from body betrayal syndrome, where her physical attraction to him overshadows her emotional well-being. Additionally, her purity and exclusive sexual involvement with the hero reinforce outdated and sexist notions of female worthiness."

            "The story is unbalanced, relentlessly focusing on Liberty's suffering without offering any moments of uplift or redemption to alleviate the emotional intensity. The pacing is also off, as Liam only begins to treat Liberty slightly better after the 85% mark, which comes too late to provide a satisfying resolution.",
            "Liberty is portrayed as the quintessential downtrodden heroine: at 31, she is broke, alone, and lacking in self-esteem. Her character exhibits little agency or self-respect, only hinting at resistance towards the end before slipping back into passivity. Her age feels inconsistent with her behavior and how others perceive her, making her seem more like an 18-year-old than an adult. \n\nLiam, the 47-year-old president of a motorcycle club, treats Liberty poorly throughout the story. Despite having a grown daughter and grandchildren, his emotional brutality towards Liberty is relentless. He frequently highlights their age difference, which feels exaggerated given Liberty's maturity. While he engages with other women, Liberty remains exclusively devoted to him, creating an unbalanced and unsatisfying dynamic. \n\nLiam's mistreatment of Liberty lacks any meaningful atonement, growth, or change; there is no groveling, revenge, or even a bittersweet resolution. Instead, the narrative leans heavily into emotional turmoil without offering a satisfying payoff. The age gap is overemphasized as a conflict, despite Liberty being in her 30s, rendering it a non-issue.",
            "The writing was adequate—neither particularly good nor overly distracting. It served its purpose but failed to leave a lasting impression.",

Although marketed as a romance, it reads more like emotional torture porn, lacking the self-awareness and depth needed to make such a dark narrative compelling."

        "conclusion": "This book falls short as a romance, offering relentless emotional brutality without any meaningful balance or resolution. The characters lack depth, the relationship dynamics are unsatisfying, and the reliance on outdated tropes makes the story feel frustrating and unfulfilling. While the writing is serviceable, the overall execution leaves much to be desired.",

He has a grown daughter and grandkids, yet his treatment of Liberty is emotionally brutal and relentless.  \n   - He repeatedly emphasizes the age gap, making it seem like a bigger issue than it should be, given Liberty’s age.  \n   - He sleeps with other women while Liberty remains exclusively with him, which feels unfair and outdated as a trope.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n   - The relationship is unbalanced and unsatisfying.

Liam, the hero, initially annoyed me with his snobbish prejudices, but I came to appreciate his sincerity in apologizing and taking responsibility for his actions. His angst and regret were deeply felt, and I admired his willingness to show vulnerability—a hero who can cry freely is a definite plus in my book.

Going in blind, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Years ago, I discovered AB through *The Fallen Too Far Trilogy* and loved her fresh writing style. Reconnecting with her through *Torrid* reminded me why I admired her work—it’s easy to read, sweetly wholesome, and full of sizzling chemistry.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Liberty, the heroine, was a standout character. Despite everything she endured, she remained resilient and strong. Liam, the hero, initially irritated me with his snobbish prejudices, but I appreciated how earnestly he apologized and owned up to his mistakes. His angst and regrets were poignant, and I loved that he wasn’t afraid to show vulnerability—a hero who cries freely is a win in my book.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The age gap (16 years) between the leads could have been a concern, but the way their connection unfolded felt intense and genuine. Their chemistry was undeniable, and the story handled their relationship in a way that felt natural and unforced.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was engaging and well-paced, keeping me hooked from start to finish. However, I felt the nasty sister’s character didn’t face enough consequences for her lies, which left me wanting more closure. Additionally, I would have loved a longer epilogue to see the couple happy as a family.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  AB’s writing remains fresh and captivating. She excels at crafting down-on-their-luck heroines and creating palpable chemistry between her leads. The ease of reading and the wholesome tone of the story were definite highlights.\n\n- **Minor Criticisms:**  \n  The procedure described for the paternity test seemed implausible. While I’m no expert, the science behind it felt unrealistic and took me out of the story momentarily.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Torrid* was a delightful read that reminded me why I love AB’s writing. Despite a few minor flaws, the story was engaging, the characters were well-developed, and the romance was heartfelt. I fully recommend this book to contemporary romance readers—it’s a gem that deserves to be read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.2 stars"

After the encounter, Liberty's stepsister, a pediatrician, initially takes her in but later expels her when Liberty discovers Liam naked in the hallway after a liaison with the stepsister. The narrative is hampered by repetitive conflict, with Liam’s internal musings on Liberty's age and flaws taking up a disproportionate 65% of the text. The plot adheres to a predictable cycle of conflict, breakup, and a conventional happily-ever-after in the final act.",
            "Liberty, a 31-year-old woman, often comes across as more like 21 in her behavior and characterization. After a 14-year relationship with a cheating boyfriend, she leaves him and finds herself living in a cheap motel and relying on public transportation. Liam, a 47-year-old biker and strip club owner, fixates on Liberty's age, perceiving her as a “drunk, drug-using, uneducated, slutty loser” for much of the story, even in light of her pregnancy. While their relationship features some steamy moments, Liam's outdated views and reluctance to embrace modern romantic themes—such as daddy kink or reverse harem—render him somewhat out of touch. The age gap remains a significant issue, as Liam continues to treat Liberty as if she were much younger than her actual 31 years.",
            "The story's angst comes off as \"annoying\" rather than \"gut-wrenching,\" diminishing its emotional impact. The narrative tends to be repetitive, heavily favoring Liam's perspective and repeatedly revisiting the same conflicts, such as the age gap and Liberty's perceived flaws."

He lacked redeeming qualities and didn’t seem to learn from his past mistakes.  \n  - The FMC's (Female Main Character) sister storyline felt unresolved, leaving me unsatisfied with the conclusion.  \n\n- **Tropes:**  \n  - The book included tropes like ONS (One Night Stand) and accidental pregnancy.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact (Angst):**  \n  - The angst level was high, earning a 😱😱😱 rating.  \n\n- **Romantic/Steamy Scenes (Smexy):**  \n  - The romantic/steamy scenes were well-done, earning a 🔥🔥🔥1/2 rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a compelling premise and was well-written with a fast pace, it fell short in character development and resolution of certain subplots. The MMC's lack of growth and the unresolved sister storyline left me wanting more. Despite these issues, the angst and steamy scenes were highlights.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Story: ⭐⭐⭐1/2  \n- Angst: 😱😱😱  \n- Smexy: 🔥🔥🔥1/2"

            "Liam, affectionately known as \"Daddy Liam,\" is a complex character who struggles to recognize his love for Liberty.

She was one of the OGs for me when I started my contemporary romance era years ago. However, reading her book again made me realize she's not the author for me anymore. My tastes and perspectives have evolved, and I now seek different qualities in romance novels.\n\n- **Characterization of the Male Main Character (MMC):**  \n  The MMC in this book was deeply disrespectful, and I found it hard to tolerate. While I've read several morally grey romances, the MMCs in those stories were more pleasant and nuanced compared to this one. Writing a bully romance is one thing, but the portrayal of the MMC here felt lacking in depth and respect.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Authors in the Genre:**  \n  I now have higher standards for dark romance, especially when it comes to anti-heroes. Other authors in the genre manage to craft anti-heroes who show respect and devotion to their female main characters (FMCs), even in morally complex situations. This book fell short in achieving that balance, which left me disappointed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Abbi Glines was a favorite author of mine in the past, this book didn't resonate with me due to the MMC's disrespectful behavior and the lack of depth in his characterization.

            "In this story, Liberty, the female main character, endures significant hardships that evoke deep sympathy. Her journey is filled with emotional challenges that resonate strongly. However, I found Liam to be a disappointing character. Despite frequently emphasizing their age difference and claiming Liberty was too young for him, he displayed a lack of maturity and wisdom. His judgmental and harsh behavior, influenced by his perceptions of Liberty from her sister, made him come across as more of a hormonal teenager than a compassionate partner. This unfair treatment made it difficult to support their relationship. In contrast, Country's kindness and support from the beginning highlighted that Liberty truly deserved someone like him."

Despite my usual aversion to large age gaps in relationships, I found Liam and Liberty’s connection compelling.

She was sweet, resilient, and had a heartbreaking history with her evil stepmother and life circumstances that kept her from getting ahead. I adored everything about her, and my heart melted at how Ozzy gave her his absolute trust and protection. Liam, on the other hand, was a mean and cruel character, but his struggle to resist falling for Liberty added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The story had so much angst and emotional depth that I found myself misting up in several places. I was completely invested in the characters and their journey.  \n\n- **Re-read Value:**  \n  This story is absolutely going on my re-read shelf. It was that good.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful and emotionally charged read that reignited my love for Abbi Glines' storytelling. The characters, especially Liberty, were beautifully crafted, and the angst-filled plot kept me hooked from start to finish. I’m excited to dive into more of her works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story opens with numerous challenges that nearly made me quit reading early on. However, I persevered, and it ultimately turned out to be a decent read. The protagonist has a tragic backstory, having lost her grandmother, mother, and father in quick succession as a child. She ends up living with her father's new wife, who mistreats her, echoing a Cinderella-like scenario. \n\nThe male lead, the head of a motorcycle club, runs a strip bar in a different city and is trying to connect with his recently discovered older daughter. The plot is filled with drama, including lies, misunderstandings, and an unexpected pregnancy. Initially, the male lead has a poor opinion of the female lead, but he eventually decides to raise their child together. \n\nWhile the push-and-pull dynamic between the characters could have been resolved with better communication—especially given that the male lead is 47—it serves as a necessary catalyst for the story. The book concludes with a satisfying happily-ever-after (HEA) ending, which felt rewarding after all the drama. Despite my initial hesitation, the story managed to keep me engaged, though the pacing was uneven at times, with some sections dragging while others felt rushed.",

He embodies the classic alpha male, grappling with his emotions, while also mixing grumpy and sunshine traits perfectly. Liberty was another highlight; she remained authentic regardless of her circumstances or the people around her. The appearances of other characters enriched the narrative and fostered a sense of familiarity. However, Liberty's sister was utterly insufferable—a true antagonist.

However, this wasn’t enough to carry the story for me.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I struggled to stay engaged with the book and found it difficult to get through. The pacing or execution didn’t hold my interest, making it a challenging read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed Liberty’s unique interest in plants and flowers, the lack of originality in the plot and the overall struggle to stay engaged made this book a disappointing read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
