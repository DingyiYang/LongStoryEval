It lacks emotional depth, compelling pacing, and well-developed characters, while its writing style and factual inaccuracies further detract from its credibility. Overall, it fails to meet the expectations of the genre and leaves readers disengaged and dissatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a very low rating, likely 1 or 2 out of 5."

The author jumps between topics like the Waltham murders and the Boston Marathon bombing without clear transitions.  \n   - The timeline is unclear, making it difficult to follow when certain events or interviews took place.  \n\n- **Assumed Knowledge and Accessibility:**  \n   - The author assumes readers are familiar with the Waltham murders and the location itself, which alienates readers like me who have no prior knowledge of these events or places.  \n   - The lack of context made it hard to understand even basic details, such as which state Waltham is in.  \n\n- **Bias and Objectivity:**  \n   - The author’s personal connection to the case leads to a biased perspective. They interpret events in a way that aligns with their preconceived notions rather than presenting an objective analysis.  \n   - The repeated emphasis on the case being an \"unsolved murder\" felt unnecessary and exaggerated, especially since many high-profile cases remain unsolved due to lack of evidence.  \n\n- **Research and Depth:**  \n   - The author’s arguments lack depth and fail to acknowledge broader realities, such as the fact that many murder cases go unsolved. Comparisons to well-known unsolved cases like Jack the Ripper or Jimmy Hoffa highlight this oversight.  \n   - The conspiracy theory angle (e.g., \"the government is hiding things\") feels unoriginal and undermines the credibility of the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n   - The book was frustrating to read due to its lack of clarity, bias, and poor structure.  \n   - The only positive aspect was that it was free, which made the experience slightly more tolerable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a disappointing read due to its disjointed narrative, lack of accessibility, and biased perspective.

The book lost me about halfway through, and I only finished it for the sake of being done with it.  \n\n- **Character and Motivation:**  \n  I admire Susan’s determination and tenacity in finding the truth about what happened to her friend.

To me, this made it feel more like a frantic personal obsession rather than solid investigative journalism.  \n\n- **Impact and Resolution:**  \n  I was deeply shocked by the implications and connections made about the involvement of local, state, and federal investigators.

It left me so disturbed that I felt compelled to watch the docuseries made by Zalkind about the case.  \n\n- **Connection to Historical Events:**  \n  The book effectively links the triple murders to the Boston Marathon bombing, which occurred a couple of years later. This connection adds depth and context to both events.  \n\n- **Legal and Judicial Frustrations:**  \n  It’s both sad and infuriating that the triple murders remain an open case in Middlesex County, with local authorities unable to solve it. The Supreme Court’s refusal to consider this case as a mitigating factor in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s death row sentence is particularly frustrating.  \n\n- **Character Analysis and Moral Dilemma:**  \n  The book suggests that Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was likely involved in the triple murders, had a predisposition for violence and was the mastermind behind the bombing. Dzhokhar, on the other hand, is portrayed as a coerced participant, acting under the influence of his brutal and intimidating older brother.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping and thought-provoking exploration of the unsolved Waltham triple murders and their connection to the Boston Marathon bombing. It highlights the failures of the justice system and raises important questions about coercion, culpability, and the broader implications of these tragic events.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The book delves into many interesting developments, including drugs (back when marijuana was still illegal), corrupt police and politicians, national terrorism, and some sprinkles of abuse and infidelity.  \n\n- **Author's Perspective and Approach:**  \n  The author was friends with one of the victims (a different one than I knew). As an investigative reporter, I thought she did well in remaining unbiased, even as she was looking for her own closure.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a compelling blend of true crime and local history, enriched by personal connections and the author's balanced investigative approach. It tackles complex themes while maintaining a sense of objectivity, making it a gripping read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

By reducing some of the extensive background reporting and honing in on a streamlined narrative, the piece could become more engaging. For instance, emphasizing how the Boston Marathon bomber was involved in a triple murder years earlier could provide a compelling angle. If that crime had been framed as jihad-inspired rather than drug-related, it's possible he could have been caught earlier, potentially preventing the bombing.",

The current format feels dense, and I believe a more streamlined approach could enhance readability.  \n\n- **Focus and Plot Clarity:**  \n  The story could benefit from a sharper focus on the core plot. For instance, a version that omits some of the reportage background and concentrates on a basic plot line would be more engaging. A potential plotline could highlight how the Boston Marathon bomber had committed a triple murder years earlier. If that crime had been investigated as jihad-inspired rather than a drug-related mass murder, he might have been apprehended, and the bombing could have been averted.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nZalkind’s work is undeniably impressive in its depth and research, but the story’s complexity and length may hinder its accessibility.
