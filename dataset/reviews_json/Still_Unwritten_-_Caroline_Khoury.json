            "The romantic relationship in the story was poorly executed. The protagonist's relationship status remains ambiguous until she returns to her hometown, and the dynamic with her partner is awkward. His aggressive displays of affection and his disregard for her readiness to progress in their relationship are off-putting.",
            "I found the portrayal of the aspiring actress in the first chapter unappealing, especially her belief that a role suits her merely based on her appearance as Latin. This notion feels reductive and problematic, as there is no single way to look Latin. Conversely, the friendship between the main characters, MCS and FMC, was well-developed and authentic. The FMC, in particular, benefited from a strong and supportive friend, which was a standout aspect of the story.",
            "The book grapples with numerous heavy themes, including parental suicide, childhood loss, abandonment, and caring for a terminally ill family member. While these topics have the potential to add depth, they ultimately feel overwhelming and underdeveloped, appearing to serve more as dramatic devices than as meaningful explorations.",

While these themes could add depth, they felt overwhelming and underdeveloped, as if they were included merely for dramatic effect.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n   - The friendship between the main characters (MCS and FMC) was well-crafted and felt genuine. The FMC, in particular, had a strong and supportive friend, which was a highlight of the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n   - The romantic relationship was poorly executed. The FMC's relationship status is unclear until she returns to her hometown, and the dynamic with her partner felt uncomfortable. His aggressive affection and disregard for her readiness to take their relationship to the next step were off-putting.  \n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n   - I felt a disconnect with the book overall.

            "The plot is fast-paced, with the main character journeying through four different countries in quick succession, which keeps the story dynamic. It avoids lingering in any one location for too long, maintaining a steady rhythm throughout.",
            "Jae-seung, the K-pop idol, possesses a tragic backstory and is a compelling character. However, the depiction of the K-pop industry is somewhat superficial, lacking the depth that elements like sasaeng fans would bring. In contrast, Francesca, the aspiring actress, feels underdeveloped as the main character. Her relationships and supporting characters are more vivid and engaging, which reduces her to a mere vessel for advancing the plot.",
            "The writing style aligns more closely with Young Adult (YA) or New Adult (NA) fiction, even though the characters are adults—Jae-seung is 26 and Francesca is 28. The tone of the story feels youthful, which makes the characters appear less mature than their ages suggest.",
            "The depiction of the K-pop industry lacks authenticity, particularly the notion of JYNKS serving as a support act for BTS—a scenario rarely seen in real K-pop concerts. While the story's global settings and rapid travel lend an adventurous quality, Francesca's absence of jet lag feels unrealistic.",
            "While the book seems lighthearted at first glance, it delves into profound emotional themes, including anxiety, stress, parental abandonment, dementia, and panic attacks. The narrative is richer than the blurb implies, as it navigates a wide array of complex issues.",

Francesca’s underdevelopment as a protagonist is a notable drawback, but the overall story remains enjoyable and easy to follow.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Themes:**  \n   - The book initially appears lighthearted but delves into heavy emotional topics such as anxiety, stress, parental abandonment, dementia, and panic attacks.  \n   - The story is deeper than the blurb suggests, covering a lot more ground and exploring complex issues.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot is fast-paced, with the main character traveling to four different countries within a short span of time, keeping the story dynamic.  \n   - The story doesn’t linger too long in one place, maintaining a steady pace throughout.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Jae-seung, the k-pop idol, has a tragic backstory and is an interesting character, though the portrayal of the k-pop industry feels somewhat light and lacks depth (e.g., absence of sasaengs).  \n   - Francesca, the aspiring actress, feels underdeveloped as a main character. Her relationships, past, and supporting characters are more vivid and engaging than she is, making her seem like a vessel to move the plot forward.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n   - The writing style feels more aligned with Young Adult (YA) or New Adult (NA) fiction, despite the characters being adults (Jae-seung is 26, Francesca is 28).  \n   - The tone and vibe of the story feel younger than the characters’ ages, making them seem less mature than they are.  \n\n- **World-Building and Authenticity:**  \n   - The portrayal of the k-pop industry lacks some authenticity, such as the idea of JYNKS being a support act for BTS, which is uncommon in real-life k-pop concerts.  \n   - The story’s global settings and fast-paced travel add an adventurous element, though the lack of jet lag for Francesca feels unrealistic.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Readability:**  \n   - Despite its flaws, the book is an easy and enjoyable read, with a compelling mix of romance, drama, and emotional depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Still Unwritten* is a layered and engaging novel that combines a lighthearted premise with heavy emotional themes. While the characters’ ages and the tone of the story feel mismatched, and some aspects of the k-pop industry lack authenticity, the fast-paced plot and exploration of complex issues make it a worthwhile read. Francesca’s underdevelopment as a protagonist is a notable drawback, but the overall story remains enjoyable and easy to follow.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Enjoyment: 4/5  \n- Character Development: 3/5  \n- Plot and Pacing: 4/5  \n- Authenticity: 3/5  \n- Overall: 3.5/5"

            "In this novel, Fran, a struggling actress, enlists the help of Jae-Seung, her landlord's nephew and the elusive lead singer of K-pop sensation JYNKS, to prepare for a crucial TV audition. Their journey unfolds across London, Italy, and the U.S., where Fran aims to confront her estranged mother and access her guarded emotions. However, Jae-Seung's life in Seoul, marked by strict contracts and constant public scrutiny, adds complexity to their relationship, leading to a compelling forbidden romance.",
            "Fran is a multifaceted character—a trained nurse turned actress, haunted by her mother's abandonment and driven by a desire to heal others.

            "The story comes across as implausible and hard to believe. For instance, the female main character (FMC) studies nursing in Italy, abandons it in the UK to pursue acting, and juggles part-time jobs as a waitress and at Zara, yet somehow manages to afford a flat in London. Additionally, the notion that she can perceive pain in the male main character (MMC) every time she looks into his eyes feels unrealistic and repetitive. The narrative lacks flow, largely due to the characters frequently relocating to different parts of the world every few chapters. This disjointed pacing makes it challenging to remain engaged or invested in the story.",
            "The FMC came across as disingenuous and difficult to relate to, largely due to the excessive number of issues packed into her storyline—parental suicide, abandonment, affairs, family death, and unwanted attraction. The characters felt one-dimensional, with their problems serving as their only defining traits, which hindered any opportunity for deeper substance or connection.",

The journey of the female main character (fmc) took her to many countries over the span of one week, and the author described each of these places beautifully. This helped me feel more connected to their stories.  \n\n- **Realism and Pacing:**  \n  The story felt a bit unrealistic at times, particularly the intensity of the relationship between the aspiring actress and the K-pop idol. I felt their connection wasn’t explored deeply enough to make it believable. However, the second half of the book, where the main characters' backstories unraveled, made the story feel more grounded and real. That said, the ending felt a little rushed.  \n\n- **Cultural References:**  \n  While I enjoyed many aspects of the book, I found the frequent mentions of Taylor Swift to be a bit excessive.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some flaws, I found *Still Unwritten* by Caroline Khoury to be a light and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a diverse and beautifully described setting, with a story that becomes more engaging in the second half.

It was cute and had potential, but it didn’t fully blow my mind.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was a bit hard to follow at times, which made it challenging to stay fully engaged.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I would have loved to see the male protagonist's (MMC) point of view (POV) included in the story. The female protagonist (FMC) and MMC seemed to focus more on facing their individual problems rather than developing their relationship.  \n\n- **Romance Element:**  \n  I don’t feel like there was enough romance for it to be classified as a romance novel. The story seemed to center more on the characters’ personal struggles rather than their romantic connection.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The plot could have been developed better. There was a lot going on, and some aspects felt rushed or unresolved. For example, I felt the FMC forgave her mother way too quickly, which didn’t feel entirely realistic.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  It was a cute read, but it didn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story had a cute concept and some enjoyable moments, it fell short in terms of writing clarity, romance, and plot development.
