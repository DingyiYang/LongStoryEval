            "The story takes time to build momentum and often veers into implausibility. Kitty's refusal to recognize clear dangers makes her appear foolish. Nevertheless, the book's exaggerated elements kept me engaged. It follows Kitty, a woman with an unconventional academic background, who is estranged from her wealthy family in Spain. She returns to the family estate, Mariposa, under a strange plan devised by her cousin Bella. The plot weaves together family drama, looming threats, and unresolved tensions with her stepcousins, Ian and Marcus.",
            "Kitty's character is quirky yet somewhat inconsistent. Her impressive vocabulary and academic accomplishments clash with her naivety and denial of danger, making her less believable as a 28-year-old. Meanwhile, her stepcousins, Ian and Marcus, are attractive but flawed, with Ian being particularly unlikable.",
            "This book is an addictive blend of cheesy charm, absurdity, and nostalgia. The writing features vivid sex scenes and delves into the angst of unrequited first crushes, which I found particularly compelling. The foreshadowing and plot elements evoke a classic gothic romance atmosphere."

        "conclusion": "*RETURN TO MARIPOSA* is a bizarre yet addictive read that blends absurdity with nostalgic gothic romance elements. While the plot and characters are often implausible, the book’s cheesy charm and the author’s signature style make it an entertaining choice for her existing fans.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author and Book Discovery:**\n  - Anne Stuart is one of my favorite authors, and I was shocked to discover she had released a new book, *RETURN TO MARIPOSA*, with little fanfare. The book’s first-person gothic style and Colleen Hoover-esque cover were surprising.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n  - The story follows Kitty, a woman with an unusual academic background, who is ostracized from her wealthy family living in Spain. She returns to her family estate, Mariposa, under a bizarre plan orchestrated by her cousin Bella. The plot involves family drama, potential danger, and unresolved feelings with her stepcousins, Ian and Marcus.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n  - Kitty’s character is quirky and somewhat inconsistent. Her advanced vocabulary and academic achievements contrast with her naivety and denial of danger, making her seem less believable as a 28-year-old. Ian and Marcus, her stepcousins, are portrayed as attractive but flawed, with Ian being particularly unlikable.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**\n  - The book is addictive and cheesy, with a mix of absurdity and nostalgia. The writing includes descriptive sex scenes and explores the angst of unrequited first crushes, which I found compelling. The foreshadowing and plot points evoke a classic gothic romance vibe.\n\n- **Pacing and Plausibility:**\n  - The story takes a while to gain momentum and is often implausible. Kitty’s refusal to acknowledge danger, despite clear threats, makes her seem foolish. However, the book’s over-the-top nature kept me engaged.\n\n- **Recommendation:**\n  - I wouldn’t recommend this book to newcomers of Anne Stuart’s work, but fans of her writing and those who enjoy classic, dramatic romances will likely find it entertaining.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*RETURN TO MARIPOSA* is a bizarre yet addictive read that blends absurdity with nostalgic gothic romance elements. While the plot and characters are often implausible, the book’s cheesy charm and Anne Stuart’s signature style make it an entertaining choice for her existing fans.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2.5 to 3 stars"

            "The book's engaging tone and promising story are overshadowed in the second half by Kitty's lack of awareness and an abrupt ending. The plot would have benefited from Kitty demonstrating greater insight, and a more conclusive ending would have strengthened the overall narrative.",
            "In the latter half of the book, Kitty exhibits a frustrating case of TSTL (too stupid to live). Despite several glaring signs of danger—such as failing car brakes, being pursued by suspicious individuals, and receiving graphic threats—she remains oblivious and fails to take the situation seriously. Her insistence on pretending to be Bella, despite clear evidence against it, feels unrealistic and detracts from the overall story. This lack of awareness significantly undermines the narrative.",
            "The author's tendency to leave romantic relationships underdeveloped is a consistent issue across her works. This results in a lack of feel-good resolutions and insufficient explanations of character motivations, which are significant drawbacks."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book had the potential to be a 4-star read, but it fell short due to Kitty's frustrating lack of awareness in the second half and an abrupt, unsatisfying ending. While the tone and chemistry between the characters were enjoyable, the underdeveloped romance and unresolved plot points left me with unanswered questions.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development (Kitty):**  \n   - Kitty suffers from a severe case of \"too stupid to live\" (TSTL) in the second half of the book.  \n   - Despite multiple clear signs of danger (e.g., car brakes failing, being followed by strange men, graphic threats), she fails to connect the dots or take the situation seriously.  \n   - Her insistence on believing she is fooling everyone into thinking she is Bella, despite evidence to the contrary, is frustrating and unrealistic.  \n   - Her lack of awareness and refusal to acknowledge the danger significantly detracted from the story.  \n\n- **Romance (Ian and Kitty):**  \n   - Ian is portrayed as a decent gamma hero, but his behavior is inconsistent and poorly explained.  \n   - The romance lacks depth, particularly in understanding Ian's motivations and feelings.  \n   - The ending feels abrupt, leaving unresolved questions about Ian's actions and emotions.  \n   - The chemistry between Kitty and Ian is enjoyable, but the relationship development feels incomplete.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The tone of the book is engaging, and the story has potential.  \n   - The second half of the book is marred by Kitty's lack of awareness and the abrupt ending.  \n   - The plot could have been stronger if Kitty had shown more sense and if the ending had provided more closure.  \n\n- **Author's Writing Style:**  \n   - Anne Stuart's tendency to leave romantic relationships underdeveloped is a recurring theme in her books.  \n   - The lack of a \"feel-good\" resolution and insufficient explanation of character motivations are notable drawbacks.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had the potential to be a 4-star read, but it fell short due to Kitty's frustrating lack of awareness in the second half and an abrupt, unsatisfying ending. While the tone and chemistry between the characters were enjoyable, the underdeveloped romance and unresolved plot points left me with unanswered questions.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 out of 5 stars."

            "The beginning of the book reminded me of a reversed version of the author's previous work, *Shadow Lover*, which I enjoyed. The central question revolves around whether the family will uncover Kitty's impersonation of Bella. The plot often feels like a checklist of repetitive blunders and clues, leading to predictability. The twists and turns, particularly around the 80% mark, left me dizzy and uncertain about Ian’s awareness of Kitty’s true identity. While the happy ending was satisfying, I found it hard to believe that Ian would genuinely fall for Kitty. The revelation that he had known her true identity all along raised questions about his motivations and actions. Overall, the story felt like a merry-go-round of repetitive mistakes and revelations, which could be frustrating. Despite its predictability, the pacing kept me engaged enough to finish the book.",
            "Kitty, also known as Podge, comes across as gullible and lacks a distinct personality, often molding herself to fit her troublesome cousin Bella. Her constant forgetfulness—such as Bella’s age, accent, and backstory—along with her reliance on the mantra WWBD (What Would Bella Do) makes her seem unintelligent. Ian's behavior is perplexing; I initially believed he was aware of Kitty's true identity, but his actions led me to question that assumption. If he did know, his attraction to Kitty becomes even more baffling."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the book had its moments of engagement, the repetitive plot structure and frustrating character decisions made it a mixed experience. Kitty’s lack of personality and Ian’s confusing behavior detracted from the story, but the twists and eventual resolution kept me reading.",
