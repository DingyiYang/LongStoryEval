            "In this story, Aaron embodies the classic grump archetype, shaped by a poignant backstory that influences his choices. While his past may initially frustrate readers, his growth and eventual warmth make him a compelling character. Tess, a 28-year-old employee at a greeting card company, embarks on a journey of self-discovery, but her breakup with her boyfriend could have been addressed earlier to better highlight her relationship with Aaron. The narrative centers on Tess and Aaron, a cybersecurity consultant brought in to resolve issues stemming from Tess's habit of clicking on scam cat videos. Tess is sassy and outspoken, with a close-knit family, particularly her humorous grandmother, who adds levity with her disdain for technology. Her friendships with Sofia and Kenzie are well-developed, and their subplots are satisfying. Although Tess has a boyfriend for much of the book, he is portrayed negatively, yet there is no infidelity. The slow-burn romance between Tess and Aaron is the heart of the story.",
            "The sharp, enjoyable banter between characters and the well-executed slow-burn romance create an engaging and charming relationship. While the pacing is steady, the extended presence of Tess's boyfriend somewhat detracts from the central romance.",
            "This charming small-town setting in *All the Lost Pieces* is enhanced by the return of Nina and Lucas, offering a delightful nod for readers familiar with the author’s previous work. The novel unfolds in Brown Oaks as a contemporary romance that embraces a slow-burn, grumpy/sunshine dynamic, incorporating the enemies-to-lovers trope and workplace romance. Notably, the story refrains from explicit content, ensuring a more wholesome reading experience."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this was an enjoyable read with well-crafted characters, witty dialogue, and a satisfying slow-burn romance. While the prolonged subplot with Tess's boyfriend was a minor drawback, the story's charm and character dynamics made it a delightful experience. I look forward to the author's future works.",

            "I loved that Tess wasn't your typical perfect female lead. She was a loudmouth who marched to the beat of her own drum, both positively and negatively, making her a joy to read about. Often, female protagonists in romance can feel unrealistic due to their lack of genuine flaws, or they only have superficial ones. Tess, however, felt authentic and relatable. Aaron, too, was perfectly imperfect, and I couldn't help but fall for him. His instinct to care for Tess while grappling with his own past trauma was truly endearing.",

Tess felt real and relatable.  \n\n- **Character Development (Aaron):**  \n   - Aaron was perfect in his very imperfect way, and I couldn’t help but fall in love with him.  \n   - His instinct to take care of Tess while trying to heal his own broken heart from past trauma was too precious.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n   - The only thing I didn’t love was that the ending was a bit abrupt for my liking.  \n   - I wanted to read more about Tess and Aaron reconciling instead of seeing it briefly in the epilogue. However, this wasn’t a big deal.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Acknowledgment:**  \n   - Thank you to the author for my gifted copy!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLara Martin’s newest book is a captivating read with a perfect blend of tropes, relatable characters, and an engaging writing style.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Content:**  \n  The novel is a contemporary romance with elements of makeouts, innuendo, past loss, present grief, and a cheating partner. It was different than I expected but enjoyable overall.  \n\n- **Plot and Expectations:**  \n  The story involves a love triangle, which I didn’t anticipate. Tess is dating Nathan, but there’s clear attraction between her and Aaron, a cybersecurity specialist temporarily working at her greeting card company. While Tess never acts on her feelings for Aaron, their dynamic and banter were highlights for me.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I loved the protective and caring nature of Aaron toward Tess, though his trauma sometimes interfered. Tess, in turn, was good at supporting him during those moments. However, I wish there had been more exploration of Aaron’s mental health journey.  \n\n- **Ending and Satisfaction:**  \n  I was initially worried about not getting a happily ever after (HEA), but Aaron and Tess do get their HEA, which was satisfying. I’m also excited to read about Tess’ sister, Kate, in her upcoming book by Lara.  \n\n- **Favorite Quotes:**  \n  The book had several memorable quotes that stood out to me, including:  \n  - 😂 “Do you need help burying a body?” I shake my head. “He’s still breathing. Unfortunately.”  \n  - 😃 “Don’t mistake safe and comfortable for happy.”  \n  - ❤️ “Why did you stay?” I ask in a small voice. He takes his time answering, as though he’s choosing his words with care. “Because on one of the worst nights of your life, you shouldn’t be alone.”  \n  - 🔥 “The first time you opened that sassy mouth of yours I wanted to teach it a lesson.” …. “Teach me then. Make it a lesson I’ll never forget.”  \n  - 💊 “All I know is, Aaron is my drug. I’m high on the deep timbre of his laugh, the sensation of his oh-so-talented fingers feathering a path across my skin, the way his slow smile ignites a fire deep inside me. The more time I spend with him, the more I crave him. If anything, my addiction is growing, not easing.”  \n  - ‼️ “…there’s a reason the front windshield in a car is a lot bigger than the rearview mirror. It’s because we should spend more time looking out the windshield with its big, bright future. The rearview mirror is small because it has to be small. It’s not good to dwell too long there.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some unexpected elements, such as the love triangle, I thoroughly enjoyed the chemistry between Aaron and Tess, their banter, and their eventual HEA. The story left me looking forward to more from this author, particularly Kate’s story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5 stars)"

The slow burn between the main characters (MCs) begins once both become single.  \n  - The male main character (MMC) reveals a personal tragedy, which felt somewhat contrived, especially the part in the epilogue where his parents die conveniently, freeing him from responsibilities.  \n  - The MMC’s additional tragedy and apparent mental illness are introduced, but the resolution feels rushed, skipping over crucial development and jumping straight to a happily-ever-after (HEA) epilogue.  \n\n- **Character Growth:**  \n  - I felt cheated by the lack of visible growth for the MMC. I wanted to see him actively working on himself, such as attending therapy and making progress, rather than having it mentioned briefly.  \n  - The hasty wedding after only four months, especially given the MMC’s mental health struggles, felt unrealistic and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite the issues with the plot and character development, the book was an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its enjoyable moments, the rushed resolution, lack of visible character growth, and unrealistic elements (like the hasty wedding) detracted from the overall experience. The contrived tragedies and skipped development left me feeling unsatisfied, even though the banter and slow burn were engaging.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Aaron, the love interest, was well-developed and engaging, while Tess’s grandma, with her amusing disdain for Google, provided a unique and humorous touch. However, I found Tess, the main character, somewhat unlikable, which impacted my overall enjoyment of the book.",
