            "In *Where You End*, the novel presents itself initially as a drama rather than a psychological thriller, driven by a dark and unsettling premise that sets a chilling tone. While it lacks escalating suspense and significant twists, the narrative still captivates, keeping readers engaged with the unfolding events. The thriller aspects only fully surface in the final third, where the tension escalates and the plot becomes more gripping. The dual timelines and perspectives enrich the story, particularly in revealing Jude’s hidden truths. However, the climax and conclusion feel somewhat detached, as if merely reported rather than vividly experienced, which slightly undermines their impact.",
            "The characters were masterfully crafted, complex, and deeply unreliable, enhancing the intrigue throughout the story. I often found myself questioning whom to trust. As secrets unfolded, their behavior resonated with unexpected sincerity, though it sometimes felt a bit juvenile, fitting well with their troubled backgrounds.",
            "The prose was clever and captivating, keeping me engaged and eager to turn the pages, even with its slower pace and literary style, which took me by surprise at first.",
            "The story was truly addictive, offering a captivating exploration of identity, memory, and the repercussions of reinventing the past. It deftly addressed themes of trust, deception, and childhood trauma, although the darker elements, such as cults and abuse, added an unsettling layer to the narrative.",

Despite its slower pace and lack of major twists, the well-crafted characters, smart prose, and intriguing dual timelines kept me hooked. While the climax felt somewhat detached, the story remained addictive and thought-provoking, making it a memorable read.",

Ultimately, I doubt I’d read it again.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started with an intriguing premise, it failed to maintain my interest due to its slow pacing, lack of character depth, and absence of twists. The narrative structure didn’t enhance the story, and it fell short of my expectations for a psychological thriller.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5 stars 😕"

            "The novel’s opening was captivating, immediately drawing me into Kat's life as she navigates the uncertainty of amnesia. I was particularly engaged by the initial suspicion that her sister, Jude, might have been involved in the car accident and was attempting to cover it up, which added a layer of tension and kept me hooked. However, the introduction of King Bash and his group disrupted the story's flow for me. This subplot felt confusing and detracted from the focus on the dynamic between Jude and Kat. Additionally, the frequent jumps in timelines occasionally made it challenging to follow, though the short chapters helped maintain some momentum. While the book had its strengths, it ultimately fell short of my expectations. The unexpected plot twists may appeal to some readers, but they didn’t resonate with me as I had hoped. On a positive note, the eerie book cover was a striking feature that initially attracted me to the story.",
            "The dynamic between Kat and Jude is compelling, with Kat increasingly questioning Jude's intentions and behavior as the story unfolds. This growing paranoia heightens the suspense and makes the narrative more engaging. The good twin, evil twin dynamic adds depth to their relationship and enhances the overall enjoyment of the story.",
            "The author masterfully builds suspense and tension throughout the novel, keeping me guessing about Jude's honesty until the final chapters. This uncertainty is one of the book's key strengths."

However, the introduction of King Bash's subplot and the confusing timeline jumps detracted from my enjoyment.

I was intrigued by Kat's life after losing her memory and how her story would unfold. The first half of the book had me convinced that Jude, Kat's sister, was involved in the car accident and was trying to cover it up. This suspicion added a layer of tension and kept me hooked.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Suspense:**  \n  The dynamic between Kat and Jude was compelling. As the story progressed, Kat began to question Jude's intentions and behavior, which heightened the suspense. Kat's growing paranoia around Jude made the narrative even more engaging. The \"good twin, evil twin\" vibe was particularly enjoyable and added depth to their relationship.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**  \n  The introduction of King Bash and his group disrupted the flow of the story for me. I found this subplot confusing and less enjoyable compared to the earlier focus on Jude and Kat's relationship. The frequent jumps in timelines also made some parts of the book hard to follow, though the short chapters helped maintain some momentum.  \n\n- **Suspense and Tension:**  \n  The author excelled at building suspense and tension throughout the novel. The uncertainty surrounding Jude's honesty kept me guessing until the final chapters, which was a strong point of the book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Plot Twists:**  \n  While the book had its strengths, it didn't fully meet my expectations. The plot took unexpected turns, which might appeal to some readers, but it didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped. The creepy book cover was a great touch and initially drew me to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an interesting read with a strong start and compelling character dynamics, particularly between Kat and Jude.

With more emphasis on character development and a stronger ending, this could have been a 4 or 5-star read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall: 2.34/5  \n- Characters: 2/5  \n- Cover: 5/5  \n- Story: 1.75/5  \n- Writing: 3/5  \n- Mystery: 3/5  \n- Horror: 0/5  \n- Suspense: 2/5  \n- Thriller: 2/5  \n\n**Worth?:** Eh  \n**Reaction:** Disliked  \n**Acknowledgments:** Thank you to Netgalley and the publishers for providing me with the opportunity to read this book."

This wasn’t a negative—it just shows how invested I was in the story.  \n\n- **Author’s Background and Inspiration:**  \n   - It was easy to tell that the author has a background in nonfiction writing.  \n   - I’m curious to know what true events or cult this book might have been based on, as it felt very grounded and realistic.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n   - The book was pretty great overall, and it sucked me in so much that I just wanted more.  \n   - I received an ARC courtesy of Henry Holt Books in a Goodreads giveaway, and this is my honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book captivated me with its intriguing plot, alternating timelines, and realistic portrayal of a mysterious group. While some parts felt rushed or unclear, my overall experience was highly enjoyable, and I was left deeply invested in the story and its characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

This sentiment isn’t unique to this tale; I often find thrillers leaving me wanting more. It’s reminiscent of when the mysteries of the island in *Lost* were finally revealed—sometimes, the theories hold more allure than the answers. Throughout the narrative, there were many moments of anticipation that suggested exciting possibilities, only to be met with twists that kept me guessing.",

Getting there is the best part, but the ending isn't that awesome. It was good, but the possibilities were almost better than what actually happened.

The narrative structure, with its shifting POVs and timelines, adds layers of intrigue, while the themes of identity, family, and revenge resonate powerfully.

However, it becomes unclear whether Jude is being truthful or reshaping Kat’s memories entirely.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story unfolds at a slower pace than expected, which may not appeal to all readers.

This atmosphere is effectively maintained throughout the story, contributing to its appeal as a psychological thriller.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  The author employs a dual-timeline and dual-perspective approach, which enhances the storytelling by revealing pieces of the twins’ childhood gradually. While this technique is well-executed, it occasionally leads to moments of confusion.  \n\n- **Themes and Revelations:**  \n  As Kat begins to piece together her past, the story delves into their childhood, which is far from the idyllic picture Jude paints. This exploration raises questions about truth, memory, and the potential dangers of uncovering buried secrets.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling debut with a strong focus on the complex relationship between the twins, Kat and Jude. While the slower pacing and occasional confusion may not suit all readers, the creepy atmosphere and well-structured dual timelines make it an engaging psychological thriller.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story centers on near-identical twins Kat and Jude, following a car crash that leaves Kat with near-total amnesia. As Kat attempts to reconstruct her past and identity, she uncovers inconsistencies in Jude's accounts. The narrative alternates between Kat's present-day investigation and Jude's past perspective, allowing readers to piece together the broader story. This dynamic tests the trust between the sisters and raises questions about whom Kat should believe—her sister or her estranged family. However, I found the plot predictable, with major twists becoming apparent by the 30% mark. Jude's flashbacks provided excessive information, diminishing the impact of the big reveal for Kat. The pacing and structure might have benefited from a singular focus on Kat's perspective, creating a more cohesive and suspenseful experience.",

Kat's character is particularly contentious; her questionable decisions, like defying Jude's reasonable requests and following a stranger, come across as unrealistic and frustrating.

Readers who appreciate character-driven narratives with themes of trust and identity may find value in this book, but those seeking a gripping thriller with surprising twists may be disappointed.",

The narrative alternates between first-person \"Now\" chapters from Kat's perspective, as she attempts to rebuild her life based on Jude's accounts, and third-person \"Then\" chapters that explore Jude's upbringing in a cult-like environment called The Plan. Although Jude seems to protect Kat from certain truths, Kat feels betrayed and embarks on her own quest to uncover their shared past.

It’s wonderful to see a local specialty like this get recognition, and I hope more people get to experience it.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Narrative Style:**  \n  The book opens with a car accident that leaves Kat Bird with amnesia, except for the memory of her twin sister Jude's face and name. The story alternates between first-person \"Now\" chapters from Kat's perspective as she tries to rebuild her life based on Jude's accounts, and third-person \"Then\" chapters that delve into Jude's experiences growing up in a cult-like environment called The Plan. Jude seems to be shielding Kat from certain truths, but Kat, feeling betrayed, decides to uncover her past on her own.\n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**  \n  While the concept of Kat and Jude's upbringing and its consequences was intriguing, the use of flashbacks alongside the present narrative didn’t always work for me. I felt the story might have been stronger with a more linear plot rather than relying on the amnesia device. The journey of Kat and Jude was compelling enough on its own without the added complexity of plot twists.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The relationship between Kat and Jude was central to the story, and their dynamic was both complex and emotionally charged. Kat’s sense of betrayal and her determination to uncover the truth added depth to her character, while Jude’s protective yet secretive nature created tension and intrigue.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel presents an interesting and compelling story about identity, memory, and family, set against the backdrop of a cult-like upbringing. While the narrative structure could have been more streamlined, the emotional journey of the characters kept me engaged.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

These issues made it difficult for me to fully connect with the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "The inclusion of a cult is a welcome element, but it could benefit from deeper involvement and more detailed information to enhance its sinister impact.

The use of an amnesiac twin's memories adds to the sinister atmosphere, especially with the inclusion of a cult, which enhances the dark and twisted nature of the story.  \n\n- **Characterization and Concept:**  \n  The concept of mirror twins is praised as \"clever,\" and the exploration of memory loss and trust issues is effectively conveyed.

It was a challenging read for me, but I’m glad I completed it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "I found the pacing of the book to be ideal for its plot, especially since I read it in one sitting. The slow buildup of suspense through unreliable narrators was skillfully executed and fitting for the story. However, the final 100 pages felt rushed and disappointing, as the long buildup did not culminate in a satisfying climax. The ending was the weakest part for me; the resolution seemed hurried and left much to be desired. I believe the book would have benefited from an additional 100 pages to better develop the conclusion and address loose ends. \n\nThe premise of unreliable narrators and the concept of mirror twins was both unique and intriguing. The symbolism involving halves, mirrors, and parts was fascinating and well-integrated throughout the narrative. Additionally, the unpredictability of the plot was a strong point, with many elements feeling intentionally nuanced rather than overly predictable.",
            "The characters in this story are multi-dimensional, adding depth and enhancing the narrators' unreliability. The dual perspectives are skillfully managed, with each viewpoint anchored in specific time periods, enriching the narrative. Contrary to some reviews that label the characters as one-dimensional, I found them to be complex and engaging.",

            "This book skillfully sidesteps the typical twist often seen in stories about identical twins, offering a refreshing surprise. The originality of the plot and the satisfying way the pieces come together at the end are commendable. However, the pacing is uneven, with lengthy stretches of inactivity and unnecessary details. The narrative alternates between Kat's present-day struggles and Jude's recollections of their past, but the transitions between these timelines can feel slow and disjointed. Key events are often clustered together, followed by extended periods of minimal action.",
            "The characters, especially those from Jude and Kat's background, were depicted with a lack of nuance, appearing in a stark black-and-white manner. Many characters fell into the roles of either saviors or villains, resulting in a portrayal that felt less realistic and more one-dimensional."

After a horrific accident leaves Kat with amnesia, Jude fills in the gaps of her memory, but Kat grows suspicious of her sister's narrative. With the help of a boyfriend she meets at a poker game, Kat begins to investigate. Jude's perspective reveals a convoluted backstory involving their mother, Verona, who becomes involved in a bizarre cult called the “Plan,” known for its strange practices like scavenger hunts in animal costumes. Unfortunately, the cult's backstory feels forced and ultimately dull, lacking the tragic depth it aims for.\n\nAs Kat pretends to be Jude by altering her hairstyle, she uncovers Jude's lies. Their mother is alive but uses a different last name and remains evasive. The story lacks closure, leaving readers indifferent to the characters' fates and the cult's history. Unresolved questions, such as the cult's intentions and the purpose of the car crash, fail to engage the audience. The narrative drags, particularly with the unnecessary and overly grim details surrounding the cult, which detract from the plot. Elements meant to create mystery, like nameplate necklaces and the car accident, are hinted at but do not generate intrigue or suspense.

            "This book skillfully weaves dual timelines and perspectives, primarily from Kat, who seeks to reclaim her past, and occasionally from Jude, who aims to shape Kat's new reality. The timeline shifts are a standout feature, delivering both truths and twists that keep the story engaging. The pacing in the final third is particularly strong, making it hard to put down. Initially, the narrative presents a soapy, YA premise with an amnesiac protagonist, Kat, whose mirror twin is her only connection to lost memories. However, the plot soon darkens, revealing a more sinister undertone. The first third focuses on Kat's struggle to reintegrate into her life, complicated by her twin sister's manipulation of her memories. The gripping latter third, filled with frequent timeline switches and vignettes, propels the story toward a satisfying convergence of parallel narratives.",
            "The romance between Kat and Sab is criticized for feeling flat and unnecessary, detracting from the main plot. While the depiction of the cult is creative, it suffers from absurd elements, particularly in its naming conventions, which often come across as underdeveloped and nonsensical.",
            "The author exhibits exceptional craftsmanship, with nearly every detail serving as a meaningful callback, resulting in a deeply satisfying reading experience. The writing excels in fulfilling its promises, as each element is meticulously crafted to enhance the overall narrative.",

I'm not sure if this was intentional, but it could have been a strength if done purposefully.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Development:**  \n   - I took issue with the insta-love between Kat and Sab—they met twice before she professed her love for him.

It reminded me of actual events from the near past, which added a disturbing realism.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Final Thoughts:**  \n   - While the premise and initial setup were strong, the execution fell short for me.

            "The story's alternating timelines—present day and flashbacks—offer an intriguing structure, though the transitions between them could be smoother.

The narrative shifts between the early 80s and the 70s, gradually revealing their experiences in a New Age cult.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story revolves around Kat and Jude, mirror twins, with Kat waking from a coma with no memory of her life except her sister. Jude begins to reconstruct Kat's memories, but Kat starts to question the truth of what Jude tells her.  \n   - The narrative alternates between the present (early 80s) and flashbacks to the 70s, revealing their time in a New Age cult.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The book has a dark, gritty 80s movie vibe, which aligns well with the subject matter.  \n   - The flashbacks have a trippy, surreal quality, though they felt less seamless compared to the present-day scenes, which disrupted the flow at times.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Kat's journey of rediscovery and her growing suspicion of Jude's narrative are compelling.  \n   - Jude's character is intriguing, especially as her motives and reliability come into question.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The alternating timelines (present and flashbacks) create an interesting structure, but the transitions between them could have been smoother.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending was satisfying and tied the story together well, even though it diverged from initial expectations.  \n\n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n   - The book leans more toward a literary thriller than a psychological thriller, which may influence reader expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a three-star read for me. While I appreciated the dark, gritty tone and the intriguing premise, the disjointed transitions between timelines and the shift in genre expectations slightly diminished my enjoyment. However, the ending was satisfying, and the story had a unique, atmospheric quality that made it worth reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 3/5 stars.  \n\nThank you, Henry Holt & Company and NetGalley, for the e-ARC."

            "The dual timeline structure, alternating between Jude’s past and Kat’s present, effectively maintains engagement and builds suspense. The story culminates in a satisfying yet thought-provoking conclusion, though some questions linger. It follows Kat, who awakens from a coma with no memory of her past, and her twin sister, Jude, who helps her reconstruct their shared history. The narrative shifts between Jude’s experiences in a cult and Kat’s perspective in 1983, creating an atmosphere of mystery and tension. The plot builds toward a climactic revelation about their true identities and the complexities of their world, featuring unexpected twists along the way.",
            "Jude's protective nature shields Kat from the traumatic details of their past, even as she wrestles with her own memories. Kat's journey of self-discovery and her increasing skepticism about the truth enrich her character. While the \"creepy twins\" trope is employed, its effectiveness is questionable, leaving me uncertain whether it enhances the story or feels superfluous.",

While the pacing faltered in the latter half, the book’s themes and storytelling craftsmanship made it a worthwhile experience. I am excited to see how the author’s work evolves in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars, rounded up."

She's therefore at the complete mercy of Jude, who decides — for shocking reasons that emerge, tantalizingly, over the course of this intricate, heart-stopping narrative — to construct an entirely new history for Kat.  \n\n- **Moral Ambiguity and Discussion Potential:**  \n  Whether or not you sympathize with Jude's deception is a question sure to fire up book clubs everywhere.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Literary Style:**  \n  This is a stunningly atmospheric read, reminiscent of *Memento* meets *Before I Go To Sleep* but with the literary flair of Shirley Jackson. Prepare to be enraptured!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating and emotionally layered debut from an author known for her nonfiction work. With its intriguing premise, morally complex characters, and atmospheric storytelling, it’s a book that will leave readers deeply engaged and eager for discussion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This novel follows twin sisters Kat and Jude as they grapple with the aftermath of a life-altering car accident that leaves Kat in a coma and suffering from severe memory loss. The narrative unfolds across two timelines: their childhood in the 1970s and their early twenties in the 1980s, post-accident. The story explores dark themes such as cults, pedophilia, and child abuse, creating an unsettling atmosphere. While the dual timelines are skillfully crafted, the ending ultimately disappointed me and lacked the impact I had hoped for.",
            "Kat's quest to reconstruct her fragmented memories and uncover the truth about her life lies at the heart of the story. As she delves deeper, her twin brother Jude, whom she once trusted, becomes a figure of suspicion as Kat starts to believe he may be deceiving her.",
            "The novel delves into themes of trust, betrayal, and revenge, with a strong emphasis on the latter, which I found particularly engaging. However, the inclusion of cult-related elements was a drawback for me, as I’m not a fan of that trope."

Their struggles and suffering made me care about their journey, and I was emotionally attached to their potential for a happier future.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story was well-told with a unique setup that kept me engaged. However, I delayed finishing the book because I didn’t want the characters’ lives to be ruined just as they seemed on the brink of happiness.  \n\n- **Ending and Ambiguity:**  \n   - The 'vicious twist' mentioned on the cover refers to the unresolved, ambiguous ending. While I can think of many ways the story could have concluded, the lack of a definitive resolution left me wanting a few more paragraphs for closure.  \n   - I typically prefer having all the answers, but I understand that not every story can be neatly tied up. The author’s admission in an interview that she doesn’t know all the answers either helped me accept the ambiguity.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Despite the ambiguous ending, I thoroughly enjoyed *Where You End* and gave it four stars instead of three because of my attachment to the characters and the compelling storytelling.  \n   - I highly recommend this book to others, especially if you appreciate complex characters and thought-provoking narratives.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Where You End* is a gripping thriller with well-developed characters and a unique setup. While the ambiguous ending left me wanting more, the emotional investment in Kat and Jude’s journey and the overall storytelling made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars."

The story alternates between the past, told by Jude, and the present, told by Kat. This dual perspective keeps the reader guessing about the reality of both narratives. The twists and turns are surprising, making it a compelling read.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Kat, the protagonist, wakes from a coma with no memory of her past, relying entirely on her twin sister, Jude, to piece together her history. Jude’s honesty is questionable, adding layers of intrigue and tension to the relationship between the sisters.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narration:**  \n  The book is well-written, with a narrative style that enhances the suspense. The audiobook narration by Megan Tusing and Samantha Desz is excellent, adding depth to the storytelling experience.  \n\n- **Reader Experience:**  \n  The reviewer recommends going into the story \"as blind as possible\" to fully appreciate the surprises and twists. The book is described as a \"great read,\" with its unique structure and suspenseful plot leaving a strong impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis literary thriller is a gripping and creatively told story, with a dual narrative that keeps readers on edge.

I would definitely be interested in a second book with more info and more story build.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  It was not a bad read, but it’s not one of my most favorites.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had great potential, intriguing characters, and an engaging storyline, the ending fell short of my expectations. I hope a sequel will provide more depth and excitement to the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The depiction of how someone might rebuild their identity after losing their memories due to traumatic brain injury was particularly compelling and well-executed.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The romantic subplot added depth to the story and was engaging, contributing positively to the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Relationship Between the Twins:**  \n  The portrayal of the relationship between the twins at the core of the story was less effective. The use of a cutesy, made-up language between them felt unnecessary and unrealistic, especially considering they were in their 20s. This aspect detracted from my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel excelled in its exploration of trauma and identity, as well as in its romantic subplot, the portrayal of the twins' relationship and their use of a made-up language felt forced and unrealistic, which diminished my overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I typically avoid such themes, but I decided to read it because Abbott Kahler is one of my favorite authors.  \n- **Author's Experimentation:**  \n  I appreciate the author's effort to explore a new literary path, even though it deviated from what I expected based on her previous works. My disappointment stems from my own expectations rather than the quality of the book.  \n- **Anticipation for Future Work:**  \n  I am eagerly looking forward to her next book, set in the Galapagos and scheduled for release in 2005. The historical and mysterious elements, along with the setting, have intrigued me ever since I read “Floreana” years ago.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book was not what I typically enjoy due to its dark and creepy tone, I admire Abbott Kahler's willingness to try something new. My expectations may have influenced my experience, but I remain a devoted fan and am excited for her upcoming work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Given the high stakes, both the \"how\" and the \"why\" should’ve been shocking and awe-inspiring, but they fell flat for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some strong elements, such as the portrayal of the mother and the concept of mirror twins, the execution of certain plot points and the ending left me wanting more. The misdirection and unnecessary character inclusion detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While some aspects of the story could have been explored in greater depth, the overall narrative is well-balanced and avoids unnecessary prolongation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

It was that or give up entirely.  \n  - The story provides closure at the end, but it takes too long and feels too slow to get there. The reveal is way too protracted.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot Devices:**  \n  - The premise is interesting, but I really don't like the amnesia angle. It's quite rare in reality but frequently used as a plot point in thrillers. Too many authors use it as a crutch to do a slow reveal, and it's tiresome.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  - I was fascinated by the twins' relationship—one uncovering the other's lies, interfering, and betraying. The cult in their past added an intriguing layer to their dynamic.  \n  - Their mother was a piece of work, and I really wanted her to suffer. However, I don't think she's capable of feeling remorse.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise and the twins' relationship were compelling, the pacing was too slow, and the overused amnesia trope detracted from the story. The prolonged reveal and lack of emotional depth in certain characters made the experience less satisfying overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The twin mistaken identity trope, though overdone, was given a fresh and engaging twist with the cult storyline, which kept me hooked.  \n\n- **Plot Execution and Ending:**  \n  The ending left me feeling unsatisfied. The idea that the character shot himself after everything that happened felt unrealistic and rushed. It seemed like the author might have been trying to imply that the twins were still influenced by the cult's ideology, but the resolution felt too abrupt and poorly executed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was engaging and offered a unique twist on a familiar trope, the ending fell flat and left me disappointed. The rushed conclusion undermined the otherwise compelling story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Suspense:**  \n  The story revolves around an unusual form of amnesia affecting identical twins, forcing them to confront a dangerous past. However, I found the plot lacking in suspense and tension. From start to finish, I was bored and never felt engaged or intrigued by the unfolding events. The story needed to amplify the tension and darkness significantly to make it compelling.  \n\n- **Character Engagement:**  \n  I did not feel emotionally invested in any of the characters. I wasn’t rooting for them, nor did I care about the potentially tragic events they faced. The characters failed to evoke any empathy or connection, which made it difficult to stay engaged with the story.  \n\n- **Authenticity and Inspiration:**  \n  The book is apparently based on true events, but this aspect was not effectively utilized. I would have preferred to read the true story or at least know which parts of the novel were inspired by real events. The lack of clarity on this made the story feel less authentic and more confusing.  \n\n- **Clarity and Understanding:**  \n  I struggled to determine whether the issue was with my comprehension or the story itself. Ultimately, I concluded that the story was poorly executed and lacked depth, making it difficult to appreciate or understand its intended impact.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel failed to deliver on multiple fronts, including suspense, character engagement, and authenticity. The lack of tension and emotional investment made it a tedious read, and the unclear connection to true events left me questioning its purpose. Overall, the story fell flat and did not meet my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
