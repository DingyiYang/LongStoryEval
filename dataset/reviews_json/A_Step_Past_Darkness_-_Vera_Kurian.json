            "The story is a captivating blend of supernatural horror, mystery, and character-driven fantasy, featuring a gripping and atmospheric tone. It follows a haunted priest who gains power from the town's greedy residents, resulting in a series of shocking events. The pacing is exceptional, with intense action sequences thoughtfully balanced by tranquil moments, like the scenes at the lake. Reading this book feels akin to binge-watching a thrilling ten-episode fantasy series.",
            "This book presents a diverse cast of six teenagers, each with their own distinct backgrounds and personalities. I particularly connected with Jia and Kelly, while Maddy didn't resonate with me as much. Their developing friendship amid cultural differences was a standout element. The group's dynamics—marked by conflicts and alliances—added significant depth to the story.",
            "This book delves into themes of friendship, cultural differences, and the tenuous line between Puritanism and devil worship. Its atmosphere strikes a balance between claustrophobic tension and serene moments, enhancing the narrative's appeal. The supernatural elements and the town's mysterious history further enrich the intrigue.",
            "This book stirred powerful emotions, reminiscent of my youth when I would stay up late reading Stephen King's 'It.' I found myself losing sleep again, engrossed in the captivating and thrilling narrative, which made the time spent reading truly worthwhile.",
            "Initially, I was daunted by the book's length and its extensive cast of characters, almost giving up after just a few pages. However, around the 40-page mark, the story captivated me, and I became thoroughly engrossed. I ended up consuming a third of the book during a short break, highly invested in its unfolding narrative."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a captivating supernatural horror, mystery, and character-driven fantasy thriller that keeps readers engaged from start to finish. Despite its length, the story is well-paced, with a mix of intense action and peaceful respites. The diverse group of characters and their evolving friendships add depth to the narrative, making it a memorable and enjoyable read. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a thrilling and immersive experience.",

            "The story is rich in depth and complexity, featuring dual timelines and six narrators. Despite the potential for confusion, it is tightly plotted and expertly paced. Set primarily in the summer of 1995 with a secondary timeline in 2015, the plot centers on six high school students, known as the Capstone Six, who witness an unspeakable crime and pledge to keep it secret. Two decades later, they are reunited by the murder of one of their own. The conclusion is both twisty and shocking, unveiling the dark secrets of the Golden Praise church and the town of Wesley Falls.",
            "The six main characters start as typical high school stereotypes, but they quickly reveal surprising depth. Each one adds a unique dimension to the story: a devoted megachurch member, a quirky bookworm, a cynical burnout, a kind-hearted athlete, a shy brainiac, and an eccentric clairvoyant, all of whom defy expectations and enrich the narrative.",
            "In her latest thriller, *A Step Past Darkness*, the author demonstrates her versatility beyond the realm of psychopaths. It's uncommon for a sophomore novel to surpass a debut, but she has achieved just that. While I thoroughly enjoyed her first book, *Never Saw Me Coming*, which delivered a heart-pounding journey through the protagonist's psyche, *A Step Past Darkness* offers an entirely different yet equally captivating experience.",
            "Wesley Falls, a quaint town rich in small-town lore, harbors a dark underbelly. Dominating the landscape is the Golden Praise church, an ominous force where devout members enjoy high status, while those distant from the church are branded as outcasts. The narrative evokes a strong sense of 1990s nostalgia, with nods to the O.J. Simpson trial and *The Firm* workout videos. This blend of local gossip and the church's enigmatic influence contributes to a tense and foreboding atmosphere.",
            "Despite its 450-page length, the story raced by, especially in audiobook format. There wasn't a dull moment, and I found myself at the twisted finale before I knew it. The narrative is consistently engaging, striking an ideal balance between suspense and character development."

        "conclusion": "The author’s *A Step Past Darkness* is a masterfully crafted thriller that combines complex characters, a richly detailed setting, and a tightly plotted narrative. The dual timelines and multiple narrators add depth and intrigue, while the nostalgic 1990s references and small-town atmosphere enhance the story’s immersive quality. The shocking conclusion ties everything together in a way that is both satisfying and unexpected. This novel not only surpasses the author’s debut but also solidifies their standing as a versatile and compelling storyteller.",

Drawing heavily from Stephen King's *IT*, the book fails to capture its compelling essence. It doesn't fully commit to being a horror novel, mystery, or thriller, resulting in a flat narrative. While there are supernatural and suspense elements, they are not effectively utilized. Additionally, the book is overly long, with the first half bogged down by excessive backstory, leading to a pacing that undermines any thriller potential.",

It was both painful and cathartic in an impactful way.  \n   - Cultish themes are one of my favorites, and Kurian did not disappoint here!  \n   - I highlighted the following: “If you really believed you were saving souls from eternal damnation, why on earth would you care about the color of people’s skin?” 😤  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n   - This book felt a bit slow-moving, although somehow so much really did happen.  \n   - At times, the backstories felt so in-depth that I think there was a limit to their level of necessity, only because I grew a bit tired waiting for the main plotline to continue.  \n   - It is possible that I am just allergic to longer books (hello, ADHD), but I am sure I am not the only one.

            "The book presents an ambiguous perspective on religion. It can be seen as a critique of a church's capacity for brainwashing and cult-like behavior, or as a commentary on human greed and power in a church-dominated town. If the former interpretation holds, Maddy's decline after being exiled from the church becomes more poignant, as her identity seems intertwined with it. Conversely, if the latter is true, her life after adolescence appears superfluous.",

Two decades later, the murder of one of the group forces them to return and confront their past.

The reader reflects on how this external force serves as an excuse for human evil, making the concept even more terrifying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Step Past Darkness* is a deeply unsettling novel that leaves a profound emotional impact. Its exploration of human evil, amplified by an external force, creates a terrifying and thought-provoking narrative. The contrast between mundane moments and the pervasive sense of dread makes the story uniquely disturbing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the ending is satisfying, the final chapters feel somewhat rushed, and the characters seem to have it too easy, leading me to anticipate a darker epilogue.

Two decades later, the victim mysteriously resurfaces, leading to one of the group going missing and forcing the others to unearth the town's buried secrets. The narrative alternates between two timelines: 1995, when the mine incident occurs, and 2015, when the now-adult characters confront its lingering consequences. The pacing is compelling, with each section concluding on a cliffhanger that keeps the reader captivated. However, the resolution feels rushed; the ending ties everything up too quickly, leaving me questioning how such a complex story could be resolved in just 25 pages. ",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n   - I went into this book expecting something similar to Vera Kurian’s debut, *Never Saw Me Coming*, but this novel was entirely different. The back blurb and my anticipation of a thriller left me a bit disappointed.  \n   - This is not a thriller or a novel set solely in the real world. Instead, it’s a character study and an homage to *IT*, which became clear after finishing the book.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n   - I loved the cast of characters and their relationships. The dynamics between them were compelling.  \n   - The slow-building creepiness was well-executed and added to the atmosphere.  \n   - The lore of the mine was intriguing and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Weaknesses:**  \n   - The dual timelines were confusing at times, making it hard to keep track of who was speaking and which time period was being referenced.  \n   - The length of the novel felt excessive. It could have been shorter and tighter without losing its impact.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite the challenges, it was still an enjoyable read.  \n   - I would recommend it to anyone looking for a character-driven, cult-like horror book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t meet my initial expectations, it offered a unique and engaging experience as a character-driven horror story. The strong character dynamics, eerie atmosphere, and intriguing lore made it worthwhile, even though the dual timelines and length were occasionally frustrating.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing in the story was uneven, especially concerning the revelation of the pastor's death. The initial disclosure felt abrupt and confusing, leaving me uncertain if I had missed something. In contrast, the flashback sections provided a detailed buildup to the pastor's murder, making me wish this had been my first encounter with the information.

It masterfully blends thriller elements with supernatural touches, social commentary, and a nostalgic 1990s setting. The characters were compelling, and the pacing kept me hooked from start to finish. It’s a standout thriller of the year for me and a wonderful tribute to classic stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story draws inspiration from *The Breakfast Club*, featuring a group of unlikely students who are compelled to collaborate on a project, and it succeeds remarkably well. Initially, the back-and-forth narrative between past and present, along with various character perspectives, felt somewhat disjointed. However, as the story progressed, it ultimately found its rhythm and became more cohesive.",

            "I’m still adjusting to the idea that 1995 is considered “historical” fiction, but here we are. As an elder millennial, the 90s will always feel like just 20 years ago.",
            "Why would six promising high school students abandon their quaint hometown, pledging never to return? The answer likely lies in the unsettling mine and the church that dominates the town. I am drawn to tales where long-lost friends or rivals reunite at the very place they vowed to avoid. The mystery of what drove them apart, coupled with the haunting power of their shared location, captivates me. If you crave a gripping mystery, a touch of horror, and a dash of 1995 nostalgia, this story is a must-read."

I loved her book *Never Saw Me Coming*.  \n\n- **Premise and Setting:**  \n  Why would six promising high school students leave their small idyllic town, vowing never to return? Surely, the secret isn’t in the creepy mine or the church that both run the town… I love stories where long-lost friends or foes are reunited at the location they swore they’d never return to. I love the mystery behind what tore them apart and the power of the location that has kept them away.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story is a little *Breakfast Club*, with a group of unlikely students forced together to work on a project, and it totally works. The back-and-forth narrative of past and present, combined with many character perspectives, was a little clunky in the beginning but settled into itself as the story found its rhythm.  \n\n- **Characters and Mystery:**  \n  I enjoyed the mystery and the characters.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Nostalgia:**  \n  I am still getting used to 1995 being considered “historical” fiction, but here we are.

            "At nearly 500 pages, *A STEP PAST DARKNESS* starts slowly, demanding patience from its readers. However, as the plot unfolds, it transforms into a gripping read that’s hard to put down. The novel expertly employs dual timelines and multiple perspectives to sustain suspense and enrich the narrative. Set in the seemingly idyllic town of Wesley Falls, the story reveals a chilling atmosphere dominated by its megachurch, Golden Praise, and the shadowy history of a coal mine. The narrative centers around six teens who, after witnessing a horrific event in high school, are drawn back to confront their past when one of them, Maddy, goes missing and is later found dead under suspicious circumstances. The intertwining mysteries of Maddy’s death and the fateful night create an intricately woven tale filled with eerie twists and shocking revelations.",
            "The six main characters—Jia, Padma, Kelly, James, Maddy, and Casey—are richly developed, each facing personal challenges related to racism, queerness, purity culture, and abuse.

The dual timelines effectively reveal how their teenage traumas continue to influence their adult lives.",

            "In this story, Wesley Falls is portrayed as a seemingly idyllic Mayberry-esque utopia. However, beneath its surface lies an oppressive, religiously controlled environment that instills a sense of unease. The stark contrast between Wesley Falls and the decaying, toxic Evansville adds depth to the setting, highlighting the town's hidden secrets and divisions. Central to this narrative is the abandoned coal mine, which serves as a haunting symbol that connects the town’s history with the characters’ shared trauma.",
            "The novel delves into themes of small-town secrecy, religious control, and patriarchal abuses of power, particularly against women. It examines the effects of systemic oppression within both the church and the community, highlighting the resilience of individuals who dare to resist it."

            "The book employs dual timelines (1995 and 2015) with alternating points of view. While I usually appreciate this technique, the frequent shifts disrupted the narrative flow. Some details were unnecessarily reiterated across timelines, contributing to the book's hefty 502 pages. The pacing occasionally lagged, and a more linear structure might have enhanced the story's momentum. The ending, while incredibly happy, felt somewhat like a cop-out given the circumstances. Although I wanted the characters to find happiness, I believe the story would have resonated more deeply if Jia had died. Still, I can't be too upset, as I genuinely connected with the characters.",
            "Maddy, one of the main characters, was portrayed exceptionally well. Initially introduced as a pious Regina George-type, she ultimately became someone I genuinely rooted for. Her death had a significant emotional impact, even though I wished she could have survived. I also appreciated the depth of the characters and their relationships throughout the story.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed *A Step Past Darkness*. The supernatural elements, which veer more towards horror than thriller, were a delightful surprise for me as a horror enthusiast. The homage to *It* particularly resonated, with shared themes of strong childhood friendships, confronting fears in adulthood, and the unity of marginalized groups—some of my favorite tropes. I became deeply invested in the characters and their journeys. \n\nHowever, a significant part of the book felt tonally inconsistent, reminiscent of a 90s TV show, where characters conveniently uncover essential information. This artificiality disrupted my immersion, causing me to set the book aside for a few days. \n\nDespite these flaws, *A Step Past Darkness* is still a solid read with beloved tropes. While the pacing was uneven and one tonal shift was jarring, I would recommend it. I would love to see more horror from this author and would happily follow these characters in future stories.",

I saw her at a panel (Bouchercon 2022) where she really sold me on *Never Saw Me Coming*, which led to my well-annotated and tabbed copy.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Strengths:**\n   - I enjoyed a lot in *A Step Past Darkness*. The supernatural thread, which moves the story more into horror than thriller, was a pleasant surprise. I love horror, and the homage to *It* was a highlight for me. The overlapping themes with *It*—strong childhood friendships, facing childhood fears in adulthood, and the idea of marginalized groups coming together—are some of my favorite tropes. I cared deeply about the characters and their fates.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Maddy, one of the main characters, was handled exceptionally well. Despite being introduced as a pious Regina George-type, she was written in a way that made me root for her. Her death was impactful, though I wished she could have survived. I also appreciated the emotional depth of the characters and their relationships.\n\n- **Structure and Pacing:**\n   - The book uses dual timelines (1995 and 2015) with alternating POVs. While I generally enjoy dual timelines, the constant jumping back and forth disrupted the momentum. Some details were repeated across timelines, which added unnecessary length to the 502-page book. The pacing felt slow at times, and the story could have benefited from a more linear structure.\n\n- **Tonal Shift and Immersion:**\n   - A significant portion of the book felt tonally discordant, resembling a 90s TV show where characters conveniently stumble upon crucial information. This shift made me hyper-aware of the story's artificiality and disrupted my immersion. I had to put the book aside for a couple of days because of this.\n\n- **Horror Elements:**\n   - The horror elements were enjoyable but could have been more intense. The villain provided some chills but wasn’t as terrifying as I hoped. I would have liked the horror aspects to be amped up.\n\n- **Ending:**\n   - The ending was extremely happy under the circumstances, which felt a bit like a cop-out. While I wanted the characters to be okay, I think the story would have been stronger if Jia had died. However, I can’t be mad because I genuinely cared about the characters.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**\n   - Despite its flaws, *A Step Past Darkness* is a good book with tropes I love. The pacing was a bit slow, and one tonal shift really bothered me, but I would still recommend it. I’d love to see more horror from Vera Kurian and would happily follow these characters in future stories.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*A Step Past Darkness* is a compelling read with strong character development and engaging themes, though it suffers from pacing issues and a jarring tonal shift. Fans of horror and supernatural thrillers will find much to enjoy, even if the horror could have been more intense.

The narrative parallels the Jim Jones cult scandal, as explored in A Step Past [Jonestown] Darkness. However, the investigations feel drawn out, and the murder resolution unfolds at a frustratingly slow pace.",

The exploration of 90s conservative Christian culture and its impact on the characters adds depth and emotional resonance. Highly recommended for fans of multi-dimensional horror tales, though readers sensitive to certain themes should approach with caution.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Structure and Themes:**  \n   - The novel is a dual-timeline tale featuring a group of six kids who confront a supernatural evil in their small town as teens and return as adults to finish the fight.  \n   - The story is reminiscent of *IT* and *Stranger Things*, with a strong homage to *IT*. Some may view it as a \"blatant rip-off,\" but the homage is intentional and well-executed.  \n   - The book employs multiple perspectives and timelines, which may not appeal to readers who dislike such narrative structures.  \n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n   - The characters are given realistic Xennial (a blend of Generation X and Millennial) character arcs, including LGBT discovery for at least one character.  \n   - Maddy’s character arc is particularly strong, especially her experiences as a teen immersed in the conservative Christian culture of the early to mid-90s. Her struggles with purity culture and her role in the story resonated deeply with me, as I grew up in a similar environment.  \n   - The portrayal of purity culture and its impact, including its darker aspects, is explored in detail, which may be triggering for some readers.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The rural small-town setting and the 90s backdrop are vividly depicted, adding depth and authenticity to the story.  \n   - The dark and creepy atmosphere is well-crafted, making the supernatural elements feel immersive and compelling.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The story’s exploration of teenage struggles, particularly within a conservative Christian context, felt deeply personal and relatable.  \n   - Maddy’s journey, in particular, mirrored some of my own experiences, making her arc emotionally impactful.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - The novel is a layered, multi-dimensional tale that delivers a satisfying and engaging read.  \n   - Despite its dark themes, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience, and I highly recommend it to readers who appreciate complex, character-driven horror stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a deliciously dark and creepy novel with a richly layered narrative and well-developed characters. While it pays homage to *IT* and *Stranger Things*, it stands on its own as a compelling story. The exploration of 90s conservative Christian culture and its impact on the characters adds depth and emotional resonance.

            "The supernatural elements and overarching mystery were compelling and skillfully executed. The closing line, “Oh, I’ve been had,” was both hilarious and satisfying. The pastor, though frightening, also displayed moments of humor that enriched his character.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the romance between James and Kelly; a touch of romance always enhances these stories for me. However, I wished for more LGBTQ+ representation, particularly from Jia or Padma. Jia's demeanor hinted at it, while Padma's admiration for another girl felt significant to me. There was a moment between James and a friend that seemed poised for romance but ultimately didn’t go in that direction, which is fine—I realize I shouldn’t assume male affection is inherently romantic.\n\nThe book’s structure and character development captivated me. Initially, Maddy comes across as unsympathetic, but her perspective later reveals her struggles, making me regret my judgment. I was heartbroken to learn that the characters had been unable to communicate for 20 years out of fear. Maddy’s journey struck a chord; she was making amends and turning her life around, only for her progress to be abruptly halted. Similarly, Jia’s story was poignant—her uncertainty about her powers was compounded by the intrusion of a creepy pastor. Her bravery in facing a seemingly fatal mission was truly admirable.",
            "I couldn't put this book down, reading until 2 AM and continuing throughout the day. It was the perfect story for me—six kids uncovering a secret that runs deeper than they realize. The unexpected supernatural elements added an exciting twist, making it a delightful discovery as I read. This book has quickly become a favorite of mine, and I will definitely be recommending it to friends and family. The engaging plot, emotional depth, and seamless blend of mystery and character-driven storytelling made for an unforgettable experience."

They fit into stereotypical roles (e.g., the popular athlete, the burnout, the smart ones, the weird girl, and the church-obsessed popular girl), but the addition of the psychic element to the \"weird girl\" adds depth.  \n   - The author does an excellent job of fleshing out the characters, making them relatable and memorable.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n   - The book is a slow burn but remains thrilling, with the audiobook format helping to make it feel faster-paced.  \n   - The mix of suspense, thriller, and supernatural elements creates an unpredictable and engaging atmosphere.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The small town, controlled by a borderline cultish church, adds a layer of tension and danger.  \n   - The abandoned mine serves as a central, eerie location that ties the past and present together.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing is suspenseful and well-balanced, avoiding overdone descriptions or melodrama.  \n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n   - The timeline of the story (1995 and 2015) resonated with me, as the characters were close to my age.  \n   - I enjoyed getting to know the characters in both their past and future selves, which added emotional depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Step Past Darkness* is a gripping and well-crafted novel that blends suspense, thriller, and supernatural elements. The dual timeline and distinct character perspectives keep the story engaging, while the audiobook format enhances the pacing. The characters are memorable and relatable, and the small-town setting adds an extra layer of tension. Despite its length, the book is thoroughly enjoyable, with a writing style that balances suspense and clarity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The comparisons to *It* by Stephen King and *Stranger Things* set high expectations for me.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Disappointment:**\n   - Unfortunately, the book didn’t meet my expectations. I really wanted to love it, as evidenced by the fact that I spent nearly a month pushing through it. Looking back, I probably should have marked it as a DNF (Did Not Finish), but I kept hoping it would improve.\n\n- **Strengths of the Book:**\n   - There were many great aspects, such as the dark, supernatural elements and the exploration of a controlling church/cult. The book reminded me of *It* by Stephen King, *Midnight is the Darkest Hour* by Ashley Winstead, and the Netflix miniseries *Midnight Mass*. My curiosity about the church’s secrets kept me reading.\n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**\n   - The novel is very much character-driven, but I couldn’t connect with any of the characters. There are six different characters, each with their own POV chapters, which made it hard to keep track of them. Additionally, despite a twenty-year time jump between past and present chapters, the characters’ voices didn’t mature—they still sounded like teenagers from 1995.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**\n   - The book felt unnecessarily long. Many chapters added nothing to the plot or character development and could have been cut. The journey to uncover the church’s secrets was drawn out and slow.\n\n- **Target Audience and Recommendations:**\n   - While I didn’t love the book, I think it will appeal to readers who enjoy YA, slow-burn, character-driven novels. Many readers have given it five-star ratings, so it clearly works for some.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*A Step Past Darkness* had promising elements, such as its dark, supernatural themes and exploration of a cult, but it fell short for me due to its pacing, lack of character connection, and excessive length.

            "The plot follows six friends who witness a traumatic event in high school and reunite twenty years later after one of them dies, sparking suspicions of a connection to their past. This narrative echoes Stephen King's *IT*, as the group confronts their long-buried demons. Key elements include a megachurch, a pastor, and a mine, all of which are central to the story. While the premise is intriguing and the story engaging, I found the inclusion of an evil church element to be a personal drawback that diminished my enjoyment. Additionally, the book feels overly lengthy for a thriller, stretching past 400 pages, which seemed excessive. The frequent shifts in timelines and perspectives also hindered full immersion in the narrative. A more concise length and fewer points of view would have greatly enhanced the reading experience.",

            "The novel skillfully weaves together two timelines—1994 and 2015—following six teenagers and five adults, respectively. It begins with Jia Kwon returning to her hometown, Wesley Falls, to leverage her psychic abilities in the search for the missing Maddy Wesley. This dual timeline structure cleverly reveals past events and their lasting effects on the present. The plot unfolds intricately, exposing the town's dark secrets and the church's disturbing practices.

Meanwhile, Jia Kwon's role as a psychic and her bond with the group propel the narrative forward.",

In the summer of 1995, six high school students witness a horrifying crime during a party in the mine, altering their lives forever. This setup evoked memories of *IT*, as a diverse group of childhood friends reunites as adults to confront their past.

I had to switch to the audiobook to help me get through it.  \n   - While the audiobook improved the pacing, it didn't make the story itself more interesting.  \n\n- **Originality of the Storyline:**  \n   - The storyline felt unoriginal and seemed like a combination of many stories I've encountered before.  \n   - It reminded me of certain *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* episodes involving a preacher, which made it feel less unique.  \n   - I also noticed similarities to the real-life town of Centralia, PA, which likely inspired parts of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n   - I enjoyed a couple of the characters and their backstories, which added depth to the narrative.  \n   - The family dynamics were well-written and felt very realistic, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - While the book wasn't entirely for me, it wasn't all bad. I still gave it 3 stars because it had some redeeming qualities.  \n   - Despite my mixed feelings about this book, I plan to continue reading this author's work in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book didn't live up to my expectations, primarily due to its lack of originality and slow pacing. However, I appreciated the well-developed characters and realistic family dynamics. While it wasn't my favorite, I still see potential in the author's work and look forward to their future projects.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3⭐️"

The premise is intriguing, with the friends being reminiscent of the Breakfast Club archetypes: Maddy, the devout churchgoer; Kelly, the bookworm; James, the cynical burnout; Casey, the lovable football player; Padma, the shy straight-A student; and Jia, who begins experiencing unexplained visions. The mysterious incidents from their past and the eerie influence of the local megachurch add a compelling creep factor to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The book starts with a fast-paced and engaging opening, but the momentum wanes in the middle, making the story feel a bit dragged out. However, the pacing picks up again toward the end, delivering a satisfying conclusion.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters are well-drawn and distinct, each with their own quirks and personalities. Their shared history and the bond formed through mysterious events add depth to their relationships.  \n\n- **Structure and Timeline:**  \n  The use of different timelines is effective and adds layers to the story, though the middle section could have been tighter to maintain engagement throughout.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending is well-executed and brings the story to a satisfying close, leaving the reader content with how everything resolves.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a good read with a strong premise, memorable characters, and a compelling mix of mystery and nostalgia. While the pacing could have been more consistent, the story’s strengths, particularly its eerie atmosphere and satisfying ending, make it worth the read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story was frustrating, characterized by frequent time jumps that disrupted the narrative flow. It lingered too long on the past, detailing lengthy and insignificant backstories for each character, which detracted from the main plot. As a result, staying engaged proved difficult. When key plot points finally emerged, they were often confusing and incomplete, lacking the intrigue typical of thrillers; instead, they felt poorly executed and failed to inspire any emotional investment. The book would have greatly benefited from rigorous editing—cutting around 100 pages and rearranging the plot for clarity and impact. Although it contained elements of a compelling thriller, the execution fell short, resembling more of a general fiction story about six individuals grappling with religious trauma.",
            "The characters are portrayed at two stages in their lives—during their teens and again in their 30s. While this dual timeline has potential, it ultimately feels redundant and prolonged, making it difficult to stay engaged with their arcs.",

They are deeply developed, with fleshed-out backstories and unique perspectives. As someone who enjoys literary fiction, I truly appreciated the depth of these characters. Their complexity made the twists and turns of the story even more engaging.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot is solid and enjoyable, though not groundbreaking. It includes some good twists, but nothing that left me completely awestruck. That said, the strengths in other areas, such as the characters and themes, more than made up for the minor shortcomings in the plot.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The settings are vivid and immersive. The novel features multiple locations, all of which feel real and alive. I particularly enjoyed the exploration of small-town America, which added a rich layer to the story.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The themes are deeply woven into the narrative, exploring topics like religion, friendship, and the flaws of small-town life. These themes are thoughtfully integrated, adding depth and resonance to the story.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  This is one of my favorite thrillers. I was thoroughly invested and engaged throughout the entire book. It’s a standout read for me, and I’m eager to explore more works by this author in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling slow-burn thriller with richly developed characters, immersive settings, and thought-provoking themes. While the plot is solid but not extraordinary, the overall quality of the book makes it a highly enjoyable and memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Characters: ★★★★★  \n- Plot: ★★★★☆  \n- Setting: ★★★★★  \n- Themes: ★★★★★  \n- Personal Enjoyment: ★★★★★  \n- Overall Rating: 4.75 stars (rounded up)  \n\n**Recommended if you like:**  \n- Slow-burn twisty thrillers  \n- Deep, well-developed characters  \n- Exploration of diverse human experiences"

            "The story occasionally veers into the goofy and far-fetched, particularly in its resolution. The character development and the lead-up to the climactic battles are far more engaging than the ending itself. With a strong resemblance to *It*, the narrative follows a group of high school students in 1995 who endure a traumatic event at a party in a mine. They witness their peers being thrown down a mine shaft and believe they've killed the entity responsible. However, 20 years later, the entity resurfaces, forcing them to come together again. A cult aspect involving the local Evangelical Church plays a significant role; the church, which has a firm grip on the town, is implicated in the deaths at the mine and others over the years. They believe that making sacrifices to a demon found in the mountain, dating back to the town's founding, is essential for their survival."

The tension was heightened by the secrets and cult elements woven into the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  Despite the slower middle, the twists and plot developments kept me hooked. The story was engaging, entertaining, and downright addicting, making it hard to put down.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Step Past Darkness* is a must-read for fans of slow-burn supernatural thrillers. It combines a gripping premise, well-developed characters, and a tense atmosphere with a plot full of twists that keeps you hooked until the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5 stars)"

She crafts five unique and sympathetic characters, each with their own motivations and distinct arcs. While some readers may view the book as character-heavy, I found a strong balance between character development and plot progression. The dialogue between Kelly and James effectively showcases their complex relationship; Kelly’s emotional vulnerability juxtaposes with James’s aloofness, creating an authentic yet frustrating dynamic.",

In contrast to *What Have We Done* by Alex Finlay, the characters here are more fully developed and relatable, complete with their own endearing flaws.",

While the narrative has potential, it would benefit from deeper character development and tighter editing to eliminate lengthy passages that hinder momentum. Drawing inspiration from classic kid gang tales like *IT* and *Stand By Me*, the book follows six high school friends as they investigate the mysterious activities of a local mega-church in their small town. Though the premise is intriguing, the narrative often drags, necessitating skimming in places to get back to the action.",

This ambiguity dampens the overall immersion and leaves several questions unresolved."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The book draws inspiration from classic \"kid gang\" stories like *IT* and *Stand By Me*. It follows a group of six high school kids who come together to investigate the mysterious activities of a local mega-church in a small town mine. The premise is intriguing, but the story feels overly long and drags at times, with some sections requiring skimming to return to the action.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The six main characters are from diverse backgrounds and wouldn’t typically associate with each other, which adds an interesting dynamic. However, I felt the characters weren’t fully fleshed out, leaving me wanting a more well-rounded understanding of their motivations and personalities.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The small-town setting and the role of the mega-church are central to the story. While the founding families benefit from the church’s supernatural elements, it’s unclear what the rest of the town gains, aside from a sense of hope and community. This lack of clarity detracts from the overall immersion and leaves some questions unanswered.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is uneven, with some parts feeling unnecessarily drawn out. While the story has potential, it could benefit from being both fleshed out in certain areas (e.g., character depth) and trimmed down in others (e.g., lengthy sections that slow the momentum).  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Potential:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the book and found it distinct from the author’s previous work. I’m excited to see what Vera Kurian produces in the future, as her storytelling shows promise.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel has an engaging premise and a nostalgic \"kid gang\" vibe, but it struggles with pacing, character development, and clarity in its world-building. While I enjoyed it overall, the story could benefit from more focused editing to balance its strengths and weaknesses.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded up to 4)."
