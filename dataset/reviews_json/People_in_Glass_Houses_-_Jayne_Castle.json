Amanda Quick was one of my first loves, and I only started reading contemporary romance by swapping to Jayne Ann Krentz when I finished all of AQ's books. It makes sense that my first paranormal romances were Jayne Castle, JAK/AQ's PNR alter-ego.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  *People in Glass Houses* returns to Harmony, a completely different planet where humans don't use fossil fuels or electricity: instead, they use psychic powers as channeled through amber! (By \"completely different planet,\" it's essentially contemporary America except for the psychic powers and some alien ruins. I don't mind, though.)\n\n- **Characters and Plot:**  \n  We've got Molly, a talented \"crystal artist,\" and Josh, a psychic \"navigator.\" Molly's sister just disappeared on an academic expedition into the underworld, and Josh is the only survivor. They team up to rescue the missing academics, and along the way, they exorcise a haunted house, go to the wedding of the season, get double-crossed, and fall in love.\n\n- **Expectations and Consistency:**  \n  Honestly, it's all pretty par for the course for a Jayne Castle novel. If you like her books, you know exactly what to expect, and she delivers. If you have never read her books, you could probably pick this one up, but you might want to start a little earlier in the series!\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  I'm basically addicted to her books, so I had a great time reading this one.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a solid addition to Jayne Castle's Harmony series, offering familiar elements of paranormal romance, engaging characters, and a well-paced plot.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Standalone Potential:**  \n  While this is the 16th book in the author's Ghost Hunters series, I believe it would stand on its own, as the author gives a bit of an introduction to the world fairly early on.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I especially liked the beginning of the book when Molly (the heroine of the book) and her \"sister\" Leone are children at an orphanage. It's clear they're adventurous and curious.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The book was a bit slow for me at points in the \"present\" part of the story, when we spent a very long time with Molly and Joshua at a strange haunted house. It definitely picked up once they left and got to the city.\n\n- **Plot Setup and Continuity:**  \n  There's a clear setup for Leone's story towards the end of the book, as well as a revisit from a villain from an earlier book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book engaging, particularly the early character development and the latter part of the story. However, the pacing in the middle section felt slow, which slightly affected my enjoyment. Despite this, the setup for future stories and the return of a familiar villain added depth to the narrative.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI would give this a B-/B, so am rounding up to 4 stars."

            "The story follows Molly as she searches for Leona, who disappears during an archaeological expedition. The mystery surrounding the villain, Taggert Spooner, provides continuity for long-time readers. While the plot is engaging, certain sections—especially those centered on crystals—tend to drag, detracting from the romance and action.",
            "Molly and Leona, orphaned girls raised as sisters, share a deep bond despite not being blood relatives. Molly's unique psychic ability to tune crystals and her connection with her charming dust bunny, Newton, enrich her character. Meanwhile, Joshua Knight, an enigmatic underworld navigator, shares a magical connection with Molly and harbors a mysterious past. Their romance unfolds organically as they join forces to locate Leona and unravel various mysteries.",
            "Set on the planet Harmony, colonized in the late twenty-first century, this tenth installment of the Harmony series offers a compelling narrative. The author includes a helpful summary of the Harmony world at the beginning, making it accessible for newcomers. The setting features captivating elements, such as the mysterious ruins beneath the city, The Funhouse—a haunted house filled with mirrors—and advanced technologies like self-driving cars.",
            "The author's subtle humor, particularly with the dust bunnies and Newton's surprising rise as an influencer for Zing Chips, adds charm and enjoyment to the story."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This Science Fiction romance offers a blend of mystery, psychic abilities, and a heartwarming romance between Molly and Joshua. While the story occasionally slows down with detailed explanations about crystals, the engaging plot, charming humor, and well-developed characters make it a comforting and enjoyable read.

The story structure didn’t feel Castle-esque, possibly due to my recent intensive Krentz re-read.  \n- **Paranormal Elements:**  \n  There were certainly paranormal elements, which kept the story engaging.  \n- **Character Appeal:**  \n  You can’t go wrong with a story featuring a Harmony dust bunny, which added charm and familiarity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its enjoyable moments, particularly with the inclusion of a Harmony dust bunny and paranormal elements, it didn’t fully capture the Castle-esque feel I was hoping for.
