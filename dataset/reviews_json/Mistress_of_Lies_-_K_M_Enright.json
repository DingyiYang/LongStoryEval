The narrative shifts its focus to an underdeveloped romance, sidelining the main storyline. The conclusion is disappointing, as the main characters forgive the antagonist despite their earlier outrage, which feels inconsistent and unsatisfying. Additionally, the court intrigue lacks depth, with characters being manipulated rather than actively shaping the plot.",
            "The characters in the story are frustrating and difficult to connect with. Shan, while brilliant, often makes poor decisions, and her motivations—such as her desire to overturn the government—are never fully explored. Her revenge arc peaks in the first chapter, leaving little room for further development. Isaac is unlikable, and Shan’s repeated forgiveness of him feels unearned. Samuel is the most tolerable character, but even he lacks depth, and his emotional repetitions become tiresome. The romantic relationship feels rushed and lacks chemistry, relying on insta-lust rather than a believable connection.",
            "The world-building feels underdeveloped. Although we learn about the names of countries and a general aversion to blood workers, the story offers little insight into the reasons behind this animosity or the intricacies of the magic system. While cultural elements like Isaac and the LeClaire family's Tagalan ancestry are mentioned, they remain superficial, primarily limited to food references. Other countries are merely named without any context, leaving the setting lacking in depth. On a positive note, the few vivid descriptions—such as silver claws, woven tapestries, and magic-infused gardens—bring a touch of richness to the world.",

I wanted to see her build her spy network rather than just being told about it.  \n   - The unblooded people’s struggles are mentioned but not deeply explored.

While I knew there would be romance, I didn’t expect it to dominate so much of the story.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was very non-existent. The story could have benefited from more exploration of the setting beyond the four locations it focused on.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Despite the significant page time dedicated to the main characters—Shan, Samuel, and Isaac—none of them showed meaningful growth or learning. Samuel had a likable, golden retriever energy, but Isaac felt bland, and I didn’t connect with Shan at all. As a spymaster, her decisions often seemed illogical and frustrating.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Style:**  \n  The book suffered from excessive telling rather than showing. There were too many unnecessary conversations and inner dialogues that slowed the pacing. I wished for more action, world-building, and opportunities for readers to engage their imaginations.  \n\n- **Potential vs. Execution:**  \n  The premise of *Mistress of Lies* was promising, but the focus on romance detracted from what could have been a more compelling and unique story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Mistress of Lies* had potential, it fell short due to its lack of world-building, underdeveloped characters, and overemphasis on romance. The narrative style leaned too heavily on telling rather than showing, which made the story feel stagnant.

The resolution is rushed and unsatisfying, with the true villain revealed too late, leaving the protagonists' actions feeling unjustified.",

Her spy work lacks credibility, featuring impractical disguises and contradictory behavior. Moreover, her political stance is both selfish and hypocritical; she revels in her privilege while professing to support the unblooded. \n\n**Samuel Aberforth:** Samuel starts with some personality but quickly becomes passive. His dark power is underdeveloped, and his moral compass is inconsistent. His romances with Shan and Isaac feel forced and lack depth.\n\n**Isaac Delacruz:** While Isaac is one of the more intriguing characters, his motivations and relationships are poorly fleshed out. His trans identity is mentioned but not explored in depth. Although his actions in the end can be justified, the narrative portrays him as a villain.\n\n**Anton LeClaire:** Shan's twin brother offers a more compelling perspective, with clear motivations and frustrations. His viewpoint would have enriched the story more than Shan's.\n\n**Minor Characters:** Characters like Bart and Alessi come across as unnecessary and underdeveloped. The Eternal King is intriguing but lacks the mystery and gravitas one would expect from a millennia-old ruler. Additionally, the underutilization of Tagalan culture is a missed opportunity to add depth to Shan and Anton's characters. Notably, Shan lacks meaningful female relationships; her closest connections are all with men. Finally, framing Isaac as the only trans character and casting him as a villain is problematic, especially given the justification for his actions.",

            "The story is propelled by a series of murders among non-magical citizens, heightening political tensions and steering the city toward revolution. The intricate political intrigue unfolds as Shan maneuvers through the ruthless landscape of Blood Worker politics. The plot compellingly illustrates that systemic corruption cannot be resolved by merely eliminating a single despot.",
            "The central romance revolves around Shan, Isaac, and Samuel, showcasing differing levels of romantic intensity. While Shan and Samuel’s relationship ignites swiftly, the tension between Samuel and Isaac is more complex, fueled by their tumultuous exes-to-lovers past. This romantic tension is crucial to the plot and intertwines beautifully with the mystery and fantasy elements, creating a captivating experience. Shan, an ambitious and alluring young woman, seeks to restore her family's reputation. The characters are richly developed, with their intricate relationships and motivations propelling the narrative forward.",

            "The central plot, blending a romantic buildup with a murder mystery, left me disengaged. The murder investigation lacked momentum until the final moments, while the romantic development felt shallow. The pacing was slow, causing both storylines to fall flat. Although the writing itself was competent, the execution of the characters, plot, and romance did not meet my expectations, resulting in overall disappointment.",
            "**Review:**  \nI found Shan to be quite frustrating. Despite being depicted as perceptive and intelligent, she frequently became distracted by high society events and romantic interests, diverting her attention from the murder mystery. Her monarchist beliefs and lack of empathy for the Unblooded rendered her character arc unappealing. \n\nSamuel began with noble intentions to reform the country, but his infatuation with Shan overshadowed his goals, diminishing his character and making his development disappointing. \n\nIsaac emerged as the most intriguing character, kind and dedicated, yet he lacked a point of view, which felt like a missed opportunity. His hidden depth and role in the polyamorous dynamic were compelling but underexplored.\n\nShan's twin brother Anton and his boyfriend Bart were highlights of the story. Anton's hidden agenda and interactions added depth, and I would have appreciated more focus on them, potentially with their own perspectives.\n\nUltimately, the romantic relationships, particularly between Shan and Samuel and Shan and Isaac, fell flat. I found the bonding moments between Samuel and Isaac more engaging, though these interactions were overshadowed by Shan's involvement with both men.",

It served its purpose for the story but lacked originality.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - **Shan:** I found Shan incredibly frustrating. Despite being portrayed as perceptive and smart, she was often distracted by high society events and her love interests instead of focusing on the murder mystery. Her monarchist beliefs and blindness to the suffering of the Unblooded made her character arc unappealing.\n   - **Samuel:** Samuel started with a desire to reform the country but became overly obsessed with Shan, losing sight of his goals. His personality seemed to diminish due to his feelings for Shan, which was disappointing.\n   - **Isaac:** Isaac was the most interesting character, with a kind and dedicated nature, but he lacked a POV, which was a missed opportunity. His hidden depth and role in the polyamorous triad were intriguing but underexplored.\n   - **Anton and Bart:** Shan’s twin brother Anton and his boyfriend Bart were highlights. Anton’s hidden agenda and dynamic with other characters were compelling, and I wished they had more focus, possibly even their own POVs.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The central plot, a mix of romantic buildup and a murder mystery, failed to engage me. The murder investigation made little progress until the end, and the romantic development felt hollow. The pacing dragged, and neither storyline captured my attention.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**\n   - The romantic relationships, particularly between Shan and Samuel and Shan and Isaac, were disappointing.

However, the plot quickly faltered, leading me to stop reading at 62%. The emphasis on the relationships between Shan, Isaac, and Samuel overshadowed the storyline, resulting in prolonged unanswered questions and a sense of boredom.",
            "The romance was marketed as a slow burn but instead unfolded as an intense insta-lust/love dynamic, which was disappointing. The chemistry between Shan, Isaac, and Samuel was lacking, making their interactions feel forced and out of character. While Samuel's trust issues were apparent, his sudden shifts in behavior lacked sufficient explanation, resulting in an inconsistent portrayal. Shan's decision to give Isaac a second chance after he broke her heart felt unconvincing. Samuel's behavior fluctuated between being touch-starved and overly attracted to others, leaving his motivations unclear. Although his inner turmoil and concern for non-blood workers added depth to his character, many others, including Shan and Isaac, exhibited out-of-character moments that felt more like check-the-box solutions than organic developments.",

Determined to regain the King's favor, she recruits Samuel Hutchinson, an Unblooded, to help her execute her plans. However, Samuel proves more challenging to manipulate than she expected. The central conflict centers around a series of murders targeting the Unblooded, with the King threatening severe repercussions if the killer isn't caught. The murder plot is both well-crafted and surprising, cleverly intertwined with the broader civil unrest in the world. While the book may not break new ground, it offers a simple yet engaging read with a well-paced plot. Its standout element is the murder mystery, with its connection to civil unrest adding depth and intrigue.",
            "Shan is a deeply flawed protagonist—clueless, selfish, and often callous. She frequently dismisses the struggles of the Unblooded, including her own brother, failing to recognize her privilege and the necessity of personal sacrifice for meaningful change. This makes her both frustrating and compelling. In contrast, Samuel Hutchinson adds complexity to the narrative by resisting Shan's manipulation, enriching the story's depth.",
            "The magic system offers a fresh take on vampirism and blood magic, where the Blooded enhance their abilities by consuming blood, but without the extremes of traditional vampire lore. This unique approach allows for innovative applications of Blood Magic, distinguishing it from typical vampire narratives. The world is sharply divided between the privileged Blooded and the oppressed Unblooded, mirroring themes of systemic oppression and racism. The story explores privilege, social inequality, and the challenges of enacting meaningful change without personal sacrifice. While the setting leans towards a familiar dystopian tone, the relevant social commentary resonates with contemporary political and social issues."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this novel is a solid read that tackles relevant social issues through its exploration of privilege, oppression, and systemic inequality. While the world-building and themes are familiar, the unique magic system and the surprising murder plot elevate the story. Shan’s flawed character adds complexity, though her selfishness can be frustrating.

The emotional connection between the characters was not adequately developed, and the romantic elements seemed forced rather than organic.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes heavy themes such as murder, public execution, blood, classism, child abuse, off-page rape (not involving main characters), racism, human trafficking, and the death of a parent. These elements may be triggering for some readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its dark political fantasy premise and intriguing setup, it ultimately fell short due to stagnant pacing, shallow world-building, underdeveloped characters, and an unconvincing romance. The story struggled to maintain engagement, and I found it difficult to finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I appreciated how our dishes and family values were depicted, particularly through Shan's interactions with her brother, Anton. As someone raised in Filipino culture, I felt genuinely seen and represented. The characters were all complex and engaging.

Isaac was a compelling character with impressive powers, but I felt his perspective was lacking, and his backstory with Shan could have been better explored.",

The world is rich with political intrigue, scheming, and a plot to overthrow the evil Ever King.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story starts strong, immediately pulling the reader into the action with a dramatic event: one of the main characters murders her father to become the ruling Matriarch. The plot thickens with a series of brutal murders, adding a layer of mystery that becomes central to the narrative.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  A love triangle emerges as a significant plot point, which shifts the story more toward the romantasy genre. While this may appeal to some readers, I personally hope the sequel focuses less on romantic relationships and more on world-building, political intrigue, and mystery.  \n\n- **Character Representation:**  \n  The novel excels in representation, featuring a diverse cast of characters, including a M/M/F romance between a cis man, trans man, and cis woman, all of whom are bisexual. The main characters include a biracial Filipino diaspora FMC and a trans masculine love interest, with additional queer and BIPOC side characters.  \n\n- **Author's Potential and Sequel Expectations:**  \n  K.M. Enright demonstrates stunning potential with this debut novel. I’m excited to see how they hone their skills in the sequel, *Lord of Ruin*, and further develop the series.  \n\n- **Publisher's Role:**  \n  I commend Orbit Books for their commitment to representing queer authors and stories, which is evident in this novel’s inclusive and diverse cast.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Mistress of Lies* is a promising debut with a strong start, rich world-building, and compelling political intrigue.

            "The plot's logic unraveled significantly in the last 15% of the book. Shan's anti-murder stance was undermined by her actions in the first chapter, where she killed her father, leading to glaring hypocrisy, especially given that her victims were slave traffickers. The first half of the book was challenging to engage with, although the pacing improved slightly after the midpoint. However, the final 15% felt disjointed and nonsensical.",
            "Shan's character was a significant disappointment. The blurb and first chapter portray her as a cunning, ambitious antiheroine and brilliant spymaster, but she ultimately comes across as brash, overconfident, and self-absorbed. Despite her stated goal of protecting her brother, she consistently undermines it and exacerbates the plight of the unblooded plebeians she claims to support. Shan's refusal to consider the perspectives of those she despises mirrors the very nobility she criticizes, making her hypocrisy, cowardice, and centrist tendencies frustrating and unlikable. \n\nOn the other hand, Samuel possesses the most intriguing magical abilities, yet his character development feels lackluster and underexplored. His magical growth occurs off-page, and he regresses into a submissive role, becoming Shan's lapdog. This squandered potential is evident in their interactions, which often devolve into repetitive arguments about unblooded representation."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - The fantasy world created by Enright is complex and interesting.  \n   - The political intrigue, mystery, and power dynamics add depth to the setting.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story is full of twists and turns, with mysteries and manipulations that kept me engaged.  \n   - I gasped out loud a few times because I didn’t see some twists coming.  \n   - The task of finding a serial killer, bestowed by the Eternal King, adds tension and intrigue.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - Shan, the protagonist, is a strong and determined Blood Worker who schemes and trains to protect her twin brother and rise in power.  \n   - Samuel, initially seen as a naive means to an end, turns out to be a complex character with hidden connections and depth.  \n   - Isaac, the Royal Blood Worker and Shan’s former best friend and lover, adds emotional complexity to the story.  \n   - The poly romance and love triangle resolution were refreshing and well-executed.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n   - The book features great diverse representation, including a trans character, several characters of Filipino (or fantasy equivalent) descent, and bi/pan and poly characters.  \n   - Themes of class and gender differences and discrimination are explored thoughtfully.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The author has a tendency to \"tell more than show,\" which was a bit frustrating at times.  \n   - Some characters felt more like teens than mid-twenties, and their choices and naivety might have worked better in a YA context.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation:**  \n   - I really enjoyed the book and was fully immersed in the world and characters.  \n   - I’m super curious to see more of this world and characters in the next book, especially after the intriguing ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Mistress of Lies* is a captivating dark fantasy novel with a richly built world, complex characters, and a refreshing poly romance. While the writing occasionally leans toward telling rather than showing, and some character choices feel more suited to a YA audience, the book’s twists, representation, and themes make it a highly enjoyable read. I’m eagerly looking forward to the next installment in the trilogy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 stars)"

            "The book seems more focused on aesthetics than substance. While I appreciate a no-plot, vibes-driven approach, it falls short in a dark political fantasy. The murder mystery plot is undermined by characters who prioritize attending parties and indulging in unearned romantic angst instead of addressing the seriousness of the situation.",
            "Samuel emerges as the least compelling character, exhibiting inconsistent behavior and squandered potential. While his moral conflict is interesting, it doesn't compensate for his failure to understand the struggles faced by the Unblooded. Shan's character also diminishes over time, especially with her implausible actions, like leaping over rooftops in a way reminiscent of anime. Both protagonists struggle to grasp the true costs of revolution versus oppression, which is particularly frustrating in today’s political climate.\n\nThe book leans heavily into Romantasy, prioritizing the romantic relationship over its intriguing premise, yet the romance itself lacks depth. The interactions between Shan, Samuel, and Isaac feel superficial; although Shan and Isaac share some history, Samuel lacks real chemistry with either character. Furthermore, Samuel’s ability to impose his will on others is compelling yet raises moral issues that undermine trust and emotional depth in their relationships.",
            "The worldbuilding fell short, particularly regarding the magic system, especially Blood Working. Key questions about its limitations, the distinctions between using one's own blood versus others', and the hierarchy among Blood Workers went unanswered. The author's choice to present Blood Working as intuitive and convenient for the sake of plot progression came off as lazy, particularly in a narrative focused on power struggles.",
            "I was initially excited about the book but grew apprehensive when I noticed it was recommended to fans of *From Blood and Ash* and *Kingdom of the Wicked*, two Romantasy titles I don’t particularly enjoy. After reading negative reviews following its release, I approached the book with lowered expectations."

His moral conflict is intriguing but not enough to make up for his lack of insight into the struggles of the Unblooded.  \n   - Shan’s character also loses appeal over time, particularly with unrealistic actions like \"zooming over rooftops like some anime character.\"  \n   - Both main characters fail to grasp the cost of revolution versus oppression, which feels frustrating given the political climate.  \n\n- **Overall Disappointment and Potential for Improvement:**  \n   - The book was a disappointment, with many unresolved issues regarding the world, plot, and characters.  \n   - Despite my complaints, I might check out the sequel in the hope that the author has improved.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Mistress of Lies* fell short of my expectations, offering style over substance and prioritizing shallow romantic dynamics over a compelling plot and well-developed characters.

The plot was straightforward, following a murder investigation, but it got too busy and distracted with political intrigue and other ‘side quests.’ These side elements didn’t contribute much to the story or help me understand the world better.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding felt vague, which was surprising for a book of this length. It was difficult to care about the political intrigue because I couldn’t see the whole picture. There was a lot of showing but not enough telling, making it hard to fully grasp the setting.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were okay, and I enjoyed the focus on them. However, they didn’t have that ‘oomph’ to make me obsessed with them.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I loved the writing overall, though the repeated use of certain words (like ‘demure’) became grating.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  There’s a romance subplot that I didn’t care about, which included a love triangle. While I appreciated the trans representation, the romance didn’t add much to the story for me.  \n\n- **Potential and Comparison:**  \n  The book has potential and reminded me of what I imagined Dragon Age would be like—specifically, a non-blood mage in Tevinter going after slavers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed *Mistress of Lies* and am excited to continue with the series. However, the pacing issues, vague worldbuilding, and lack of depth in the romance subplot held it back from being a standout read for me. Despite its flaws, the book shows promise, and I’m rounding up my rating because of its potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded up to 4 stars for potential)."

The murder investigation received little focus, and the characters' poor communication stunted the plot's progression. Several plot points felt unresolved or underdeveloped, contributing to an overall sense of incompleteness. While the story opened with Shan’s dramatic assassination of her father, the pacing declined as it unfolded. There was an imbalance between action, intrigue, and character development, and the tone shifted in ways that often disrupted immersion.",
            "**Shan:** At first, Shan intrigued me as a strong female character with a sharp, cunning personality. However, her actions often contradicted her intelligence and revolutionary goals. Her indifference toward the unmagical population (aside from her twin brother) and her unconvincing scheming diminished her appeal as the story unfolded.\n\n**Samuel:** Samuel's character showed promise with his rare and dangerous magic, but his naivety and \"damsel in distress\" vibe made him less compelling. Although the gender reversal of this trope was refreshing, it lacked emotional depth, and his romantic pursuits overshadowed his character. While the inclusion of queer and polyamorous representation was commendable, the romance felt rushed, particularly for Samuel. His relationships dominated his arc, leaving little room for a more profound exploration of his personality beyond his attractions.",

It started off dark, creepy, and gory, which I found incredibly exciting. However, this momentum didn’t last. The middle of the book felt like it was filled with a lot of filler, making it hard to stay engaged. It seemed like so much happened, yet nothing significant occurred, and I often struggled to remember what the actual plot was.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was good and satisfying, but it felt like it was spread too far apart from the strong start. The gap between the beginning and the end made the overall experience feel disjointed.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The repeated use of the word “demure” throughout the book cracked me up. It became a humorous highlight for me, and I couldn’t help but think Jools would be proud of its frequent appearance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong and captivating start, as well as a satisfying ending, the middle section was bogged down by filler and a lack of clear direction.

Her complexity and struggle to prove herself in a world that often rejects foreigners are captivating. Samuel, on the other hand, is sweet and optimistic, and his journey toward understanding the nuances of life adds depth to the narrative. The book features an authentic portrayal of polyamory, with each relationship feeling genuine and well-developed. I particularly enjoyed the dynamics between Shan and Samuel, as well as Samuel and Isaac, although I felt that Shan and Samuel's attraction developed a bit too quickly.",

            "Review:  \nThough primarily character-driven, the book still offers a compelling plot. From the very first pages, I was immersed in political conspiracies and a gripping investigation into the brutal murders of the Unblooded. With its swift pacing and multi-layered narrative, 'Mistress of Lies' ensures there's never a dull moment.",
            "The strongest aspect of this book lies in its characters. Shan, Samuel, and Isaac are compelling, multidimensional protagonists, each with morally complex motivations shaped by the injustices they've endured within a flawed system. Despite their shared struggles, their goals diverge, adding depth to the narrative. Shan, the standout female protagonist, defies conventional likability; some of her decisions are chilling. Yet, her humanity emerges as she confronts her mistakes, navigates a rejecting society, and fiercely advocates for her beliefs. Fantasy literature could benefit from more heroines like her. The novel also includes a well-crafted romance subplot and commendable representation of transgender characters.",
            "In this book, the worldbuilding transcends decorative elements, serving as a crucial component of the plot. The author skillfully draws from the historical experiences of nations like England and pre-revolutionary France, blending classic horror tropes and vampire narratives to forge a unique story. The unjust nature of a society built on rigid social divisions propels the characters' motivations. Additionally, the well-crafted magic system divides society into two groups: the Blood Workers, who wield power through blood magic, and the Unblooded, who lack such abilities.",
            "This was a delightful read—one of the best debuts I've encountered this year! I was completely absorbed and couldn't put it down, enjoying every moment. I found it hard to identify any significant flaws, as I devoured the novel in a single day."

        "conclusion": "Mistress of Lies is a standout debut that excels in worldbuilding, character development, and plot execution. The novel's dark fantasy setting, enriched by a unique magic system and inspired by historical contexts, provides a compelling backdrop for its morally complex characters. The story's fast pace, intricate political intrigue, and well-crafted romance subplot make it an engrossing read. I highly recommend it to fans of dark fantasy and eagerly anticipate the sequel.",

            "The abrupt conclusion to one character's struggle with their powers was frustrating; I wanted to witness their development unfold on the page rather than being resolved so suddenly. The climax felt rushed, particularly in how the character's power struggles were addressed.",
            "The POV characters, Lady Shan LeClaire and Samuel, are deeply complex and seamlessly integrated into their world. Anton, Shan's brother, is intriguing, and I’m curious to learn more about his societal role. The evolving dynamic between Shan and Samuel is well-crafted as they investigate a series of murders together. However, the instant attraction between Isaac and Samuel comes off as unconvincing; their connection appears based more on lust than a genuine bond. Additionally, Shan’s forgiveness of Isaac feels unjustified, as their relationship seems rooted in superficial traits like looks and charm, rather than deeper compatibility.",
            "The story immerses readers in a world teeming with questionable morals, blood-driven magic, and intricate political intrigue, all of which I found captivating. Vampires add an enjoyable layer, and the Eternal King becomes increasingly terrifying through his final actions in this novel."

Most of the scenes revolved around attending balls or occasionally going out to gather intelligence, but even those moments lacked excitement or intensity.  \n\n- **World-Building vs. Character Development:**  \n   - The idea and world-building were interesting, but it felt like they came at the expense of the characters. The characters didn’t feel as developed or prioritized as the setting and political elements.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Chemistry:**  \n   - I sort of felt the chemistry between the characters, but the emotional and physical (nonsexual) intimacy felt rushed. For example, they were holding hands and offering physical comfort almost immediately after meeting. This might have been due to unlabeled time jumps, which made their bond feel too quick and unrealistic for my taste.  \n\n- **Focus on Politics:**  \n   - Politics seemed to dominate the story, which wasn’t my personal preference. While this might appeal to others, I would’ve enjoyed the novel more if the political focus had been balanced with other elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing premise and solid world-building, the passive storytelling, rushed character relationships, and heavy focus on politics made it less enjoyable for me. The lack of action and underdeveloped characters detracted from the potential of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

I did appreciate the creative concept of using magic as a means of transition.",

As a unique protagonist, Shan is determined to seize power and shape her own destiny. The plot centers on her dual roles as a blood worker and spy, as well as the struggle to control a young man with extraordinary abilities.

Her dynamic with her former best friend and lover, a fellow blood worker, adds depth to the narrative. The novel features commendable queer and trans representation, although these elements remain relatively minor plot points that may not resonate with all readers. A romantic subplot introduces a love triangle involving Shan, her ex-lover, and a young man with extraordinary powers. While the graphic sex scenes aim for representation, they feel unnecessary and don't significantly contribute to the fantasy plot.",

This immediately sets the tone for a dark, character-driven story. Shan is portrayed as a unique protagonist who seeks power and control over her own fate. The plot revolves around her role as a blood worker and spy, and the race to control a young man with extraordinary powers.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are deeply motivated and interesting, each with their own distinct drives. Shan, in particular, stands out as a complex and unconventional protagonist. The dynamic between Shan and her former best friend/lover, who is also a blood worker, adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The novel includes great queer and trans representation, which is a positive aspect. However, these elements are relatively minor plot points and may not appeal to everyone.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The blood magic and political intrigue are intriguing aspects of the story, but they are not explored as deeply as I would have liked. While there are some great moments toward the end, much of the focus is on interpersonal drama and romantic tension.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Content:**  \n  The romantic subplot involves a love triangle of sorts, with both Shan and her former lover falling for the young man with extraordinary powers. The sex scenes are graphic and, in my opinion, unnecessary. While they may serve as representation, they don’t significantly advance the fantasy plot.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is uneven, with a lot of time spent on angsty romantic tension before delving into the more compelling aspects of the story, such as blood magic and politics.

            "The story had potential but required further editing to enhance its structure. The plot leaned too much on telling instead of showing, leaving it feeling underdeveloped. The murder investigation was poorly executed, with characters contributing minimally to the resolution. Additionally, the political intrigue was vague and lacking in depth, ultimately failing to engage me.",
            "In this story, Anton emerged as the only character I genuinely liked, despite his minor role. The protagonist, Shan, was frequently depicted as intelligent, yet her actions often contradicted this portrayal, making her seem incompetent. Samuel came across as naive and frustrating, lacking the depth needed to make him compelling. Isaac's dual role as a trans character and a serial killer felt problematic and poorly executed, particularly with the inclusion of non-consensual acts. The relationships among characters felt superficial and lacked depth; the connection between Shan and Anton was mentioned repeatedly but never convincingly demonstrated. By the end, the polyamorous relationship felt forced and unappealing. Key moments, such as those between Isaac and Samuel, were often told rather than shown, diminishing their emotional impact.",

            "The premise of Shan attempting to unseat the Eternal King is intriguing but ultimately poorly executed. Her strategies, like installing a puppet ruler or seizing political power, lack logical coherence and feasibility. The twist involving the Unblooded being drained of blood to empower the Bloodworkers falls flat due to inconsistencies in the magical system and unclear explanations of the blood tax. Additionally, while the narrative could have delved into deeper themes about the challenges of reforming an oppressive system from within, these ideas are not effectively conveyed.",
            "In the first chapter, Shan is presented as a scheming, manipulative, and protective female protagonist, which is both impactful and refreshing. However, her characterization diminishes as the story progresses; her manipulations often fail, revealing her arrogance and naivety regarding the power dynamics at play. Samuel is introduced as a kind and powerful character, yet his kindness is never fully realized, and his role as a fantasy democrat lacks depth. His resentment toward being a Bloodworker feels underdeveloped, and his relationships with Shan and Isaac come across as superficial.\n\nIsaac stands out as the most compelling character, driven by radical beliefs and a clear motivation to dismantle the oppressive system. The tension and chemistry between him and Shan make their interactions the most engaging in the book. However, the love triangle involving Shan, Samuel, and Isaac feels unbalanced. Samuel's connections with both characters lack depth, rendering his attraction to them superficial. In contrast, the dynamic between Shan and Isaac is rich and well-developed, overshadowing the polyamorous potential of the relationships due to Samuel's lack of meaningful connection to the others.",
            "The frequent use of the word \"demure\" to describe Shan becomes distracting and repetitive. While the first chapter hooks the reader effectively, the remainder of the novel struggles to maintain that level of engagement.",
            "The magical system is vague and inconsistent. Although the Eternal King's vampiric nature is well-defined, the abilities and limitations of the Bloodworkers remain unclear, making their dependence on the blood tax confusing. The systemic oppression of the Unblooded is insufficiently explored, resulting in an underdeveloped role in the story. Samuel’s potential as a bridge between the Unblooded and Bloodworkers is ultimately squandered."

        "conclusion": "While the novel starts with a promising premise and a strong opening chapter, it struggles with inconsistent characterization, underdeveloped worldbuilding, and a lack of logical coherence in its plot.

While the final act feels rushed compared to the well-paced buildup of romance and mystery, it concludes with an intriguing setup for the next installment.",
            "The polyamorous romance is skillfully portrayed, showcasing strong chemistry among the trio and necessary discussions about poly dynamics. While the romance is intriguing and avoids instant attraction, it often overshadows the serial killer mystery. Shan LeClaire, the titular protagonist, is a ruthless and ambitious female lead with a soft spot for her loved ones. Her complexity, marked by self-serving tendencies and moments of frustration, makes her compelling. Samuel Hutchinson serves as an effective foil to Shan, with his idealistic and gentle nature contrasting her embrace of violence and manipulation. His dark Cinderella tale, though less engaging, adds depth to the narrative.",
            "The story is set against a backdrop of political tension between the oppressive Blood Worker class and the marginalized Unblooded. It introduces a vague magic system that revolves around blood as a resource. While the worldbuilding includes intriguing elements such as the Blood Tax and the immortal Eternal King, the magic system would benefit from further development.",
            "This novel presents a captivating polyamorous queer romance, featuring Filipino representation and a trans main character. It delves into themes of racism, classism, and systemic oppression, emphasizing the fight for justice for marginalized communities. The narrative is infused with a palpable anger towards an oppressive system, showcasing radical characters who advocate for significant change and recognize the role of violence in that struggle. While the portrayal of revolutionaries who resort to violence is nuanced, it hints at a broader narrative arc. Ultimately, the story challenges readers to grapple with the complexities of justice and the fight against oppression."

The pacing felt slower than I typically enjoy, and many plot points were only superficially addressed. The story relies heavily on its characters rather than the plot, which may disappoint readers hoping for a deeper exploration of the premise involving a trio pursuing a serial killer. Ultimately, the character-driven narrative may not satisfy those seeking a more action-packed or politically charged story.",

Isaac shows potential, and I look forward to seeing more of him in the next book. Samuel was my favorite, grappling with his inner conflict and striving to do what’s right in a corrupt system. The side characters, like Anton, were promising but underutilized, which I hope will be addressed in future installments. The romance was enjoyable, albeit leaning towards insta-love, but this didn't bother me much.

The representation in the book is commendable, featuring a prominent trans man and a polyamorous love story, all set in a world where these elements are normalized. This stands in stark contrast to the scrutiny and microaggressions faced by Shan and Isaac due to their non-white identities. Enright skillfully navigates these themes without falling into preachiness or inauthenticity. However, both Shan and Samuel occasionally act in ways that seem less intelligent than their backgrounds would suggest, making them feel more like plot devices than active participants in their own stories."

The inclusion of Filipino representation is a standout feature, as it’s rare to see in mainstream fantasy.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Shan, the protagonist, is one of my favorite characters in a long time. She’s a master of politics, willing to get her hands dirty both literally and figuratively, and her journey to power is compelling. The supporting characters, like Isaac (her former friend and lover) and Samuel (the unblooded heir), are equally complex and serve meaningful roles in the story. The relationship dynamics are purposeful and intricately tied to the political landscape of the nation.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Shan’s rise to power after assassinating her father and her mission to dismantle the immortal King’s rule to create a more equal society. The themes of power, equality, and moral ambiguity are explored in depth. The book is also “incredibly gay,” which adds a refreshing and inclusive layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n  The book is a fantastic and fast read, with a gripping plot that kept me engaged from start to finish. I’m eagerly anticipating the next installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a thrilling blend of political intrigue, morally complex characters, and inclusive representation. It’s a standout in the fantasy genre, offering a fresh and engaging story that feels both familiar and unique.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The first chapter captivated me with its bold premise, including themes like patricide. However, much of the action occurred off-page, leaving the story feeling disjointed and less immersive. The middle of the book dragged, and the pacing failed to sustain the initial excitement.",
            "Shan is clever, resourceful, and morally ambiguous, yet her decisions often come across as confusing and inconsistent with her character. Samuel's arc is intriguing, but his development feels rushed, particularly his training in blood working, which is only depicted in a single scene. Isaac's experiences as a foreigner in Dameral are compelling, but his character lacks depth and exploration. The polyamorous romance is an ambitious element, yet it feels underdeveloped and poorly integrated into the narrative. Overall, the relationships between Shan, Samuel, and Isaac lack the emotional depth and development needed to resonate fully.",

Key concepts, such as blood working, are poorly explained, leaving many questions unanswered regarding its nature, mechanics, and genetic or intuitive aspects. Additionally, while societal dynamics like racism, classism, and xenophobia are introduced, they are not explored in depth, contributing to a sense of superficiality in the world-building."

This unique perspective adds depth and intrigue, while the rebellion itself plays a simmering side plot, offering a refreshing departure from the typical emphasis on conflict found in fantasy novels.",
            "In this story, the author appears to prioritize the m/m aspect of the poly romance, often sidelining the female main character (FMC) in the process. This tendency to fetishize mlm relationships can be frustrating. I find Isaac and Shan’s relationship much more compelling than the dynamics between Isaac and Samuel or Shan and Samuel. Their complex history—shifting from friends to lovers to exes and then to enemies—deserves greater exploration and attention.",

            "The plot became overshadowed by the romance, relegating the murders—meant to be central—to mere footnotes. The identity of the killer was predictable, and the narrative shifted its focus to political themes, such as the divide between the rich and poor and magic users versus non-magic users, rather than maintaining the murder mystery. The love triangle involving Samuel felt superficial, with both relationships grounded solely in physical attraction.",
            "The characters lacked depth and consistency. For instance, Shan, intended to be a clever spy master, failed to exhibit any truly clever behavior.",
            "The execution fell short, relying too heavily on \"telling\" instead of \"showing.\" However, the writing quality was strong enough to keep me engaged and motivated to finish the book rather than abandon it.",

The romance felt superficial, and the story became predictable. Overall, it was just okay, and I won’t be continuing.",

            "The premise of the story—a hunt for a serial killer—held promise, but the execution fell short. Instead of concentrating on the investigation, characters often found themselves at social events like balls and luncheons, neglecting the case at hand. This made the mystery feel unsolvable until it was hurriedly resolved at the end. The pacing was uneven, with excessive focus on trivial details like outfits rather than driving the plot forward. Overall, the insufficient attention to the central mystery left me feeling disengaged and frustrated.",
            "The characters were a significant disappointment. Shan, typically enjoyable in similar roles, appeared shallow, fixating on clothes and relying on others to label her as clever. Samuel was so frustrating that I found myself wanting to shove him into a locker. The rest of the cast felt flat and undefined, resembling wooden placeholders rather than fully realized characters. Isaac, tasked with driving both the romance and political plot, came off more like a student reciting lines than a compelling individual.",

While I knew *Mistress of Lies* likely wouldn’t measure up, I still hoped it would be worth reading due to its similarities.\n\n- **Initial Impressions:**  \n  For the first 15 pages, I thought the book might hold some promise. Despite clunky writing and awkward dialogue, I was intrigued by the world-building and the hints of an interesting magic system.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were a major letdown. Shan, who I usually enjoy in similar roles, came across as shallow, only talking about clothes and being labeled \"clever\" by others. Samuel was frustrating to the point where I wanted to shove him into a locker. The rest of the cast felt flat and undefined, more like wooden placeholders than actual characters. Isaac, who was supposed to carry both the romance and political plot, felt more like a student reading lines than a compelling individual.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The story’s premise—tracking down a serial killer—had potential, but the execution was disappointing. Instead of focusing on the investigation, the characters spent most of their time attending social events like balls, fetes, and luncheons. Their lack of effort in solving the case made the mystery feel unsolvable until it was rushed at the end.\n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**  \n  The pacing was uneven, with too much time spent on trivial details like outfits rather than advancing the plot. The lack of focus on the central mystery left me feeling uninvested and frustrated.\n\n- **Overall Tone and Engagement:**  \n  The book lacked the intensity or heat I expected. Instead, it felt like a lukewarm dribble, failing to deliver on its potential.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Mistress of Lies* fell short of my expectations. While it started with some promise, the clunky writing, unlikable characters, and poorly executed plot left me disappointed. The lack of focus on the central mystery and the overemphasis on trivial details made the story feel flat and unengaging.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a low rating, likely aligning with the \"low ratings on the Goodreads page\" referenced by the reviewer."

The narrative is populated with diverse characters, including two biracial individuals who, despite their high societal status, experience microaggressions and racism. Their cultural heritage, reminiscent of the Philippines, is beautifully interwoven through food, stories, and traditions. A trans character also plays a significant role, and the inclusion of a polyamorous relationship refreshingly avoids the common cliché of a love triangle.\n\nHowever, I found Samuel’s character frustrating; despite his background in the slums, he appeared naïve and overly gullible in the context of high society. Shan, while intelligent and cunning, often stumbled in her schemes and missed obvious plot twists. Although she embodies the \"strong female\" trope, her lack of meaningful relationships outside of romance left her feeling isolated and stressed.",

However, the book fails to maintain the hype generated by its opening, which is disappointing.  \n\n- **Character Development (Shan)**  \n   - Shan is a strong-willed, tenacious, and resolute character with ambitious plans. She leads a double life as a noblewoman and the head of a spy network, which is compelling. However, as the story progresses, her brilliance and strength diminish, making her feel less impactful.  \n\n- **Magic System**  \n   - The blood magic system is enjoyable and well-executed, though it lacks originality. The author could have expanded on it further to make it more immersive.  \n\n- **Romance**  \n   - The romance is well-developed and enjoyable, featuring a unique take on a love triangle. While I wasn’t personally invested in it, this is more a reflection of my preferences than the author’s skill.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing**  \n   - The book is well-written, captivating, and smooth, with a generally good pace. However, the pacing feels slightly unbalanced at times.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Anton)**  \n   - Anton, Shan’s brother, is a significant motivation for her actions, but his character is unlikable and fails to live up to the sacrifices Shan makes for him. This dynamic is disheartening.  \n\n- **Communication Between Characters**  \n   - The lack of communication between characters, especially allies, is frustrating. Secrets and withheld information unnecessarily complicate the plot, making it feel contrived.  \n\n- **Mystery and Investigation**  \n   - The central mystery involving gruesome murders is intriguing but underdeveloped. The investigation is sidelined, and key information is withheld by the King, making the resolution unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Show vs. Tell**  \n   - The book often tells rather than shows. For example, Shan’s spy network and the investigation are mentioned frequently but not explored in depth, leaving much to the imagination.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has a lot of potential, with strong elements like its premise, magic system, and initial character development.

This imbalance results in a shallow and overstuffed narrative. The pacing suffers as the story tries to cover too much at once.

The idea of a society divided between Blood Workers and the Unblooded, with tensions simmering between the classes, is intriguing and checks all the boxes for a complex, engaging story.\n\n- **Execution and Balance:**\n   - The execution of the story falls short. The book attempts to juggle too many plotlines—Shan’s quest to restore her family’s reputation, Samuel’s mysterious power, a murder investigation, a brewing revolution, multiple romances, and the king’s experiments—without giving any of them enough depth or focus. This lack of balance makes the story feel shallow and overstuffed.\n\n- **Worldbuilding and Magic System:**\n   - The worldbuilding is underdeveloped. The magic system and the societal structure of Aeravin are not explored in enough detail, leaving the reader with a superficial understanding of the setting. This lack of depth is particularly disappointing given the rich potential of the premise.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Character development is largely abandoned due to the overcrowded plot. Shan, who is described as clever and manipulative, is never shown demonstrating these traits in a meaningful way. Similarly, Samuel’s journey and other characters’ arcs are underdeveloped, missing opportunities to explore their complexities and relationships.\n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**\n   - The pacing suffers because the story tries to tackle too much at once. The book would have benefited from focusing on a few key elements—such as the murder mystery, Shan’s family restoration, and Samuel’s development—and saving other plotlines for future installments. Instead, everything is crammed into this book, leaving little room for meaningful exploration.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The writing relies heavily on telling rather than showing.

            "The murder mystery storyline failed to capture my interest as much as it should have. While it made sense by the end, much of the book felt unengaging.",
            "This story features richly developed characters, each with complex personalities and motivations that make their interactions engaging. Shan stands out with her strength, intellect, and moments of vulnerability; she is willing to lie, kill, and manipulate to achieve her goals. Samuel begins the book filled with anger and resignation as an Unblooded, grappling with his powers and identity, embodying everything he despises. The dynamics among the trio—Shan, Samuel, and Issac—are particularly compelling. Issac and Shan share a deep bond forged through years of fighting and surviving as social outcasts, while their relationship with Samuel is shaped by his conviction, vulnerability, and naive worldview. The narrative also explores MMF dynamics, features a trans love interest, and delves into dark political fantasy elements.",
            "This book offers an intersectional perspective on power and class dynamics. Shan, born into nobility yet mixed-race, faces disadvantages compared to her peers, while Issac grapples with similar struggles. Samuel, despite being white, is born into the lowest class as an Unblooded but gains privilege through his lineage. However, I found the author’s messaging on revolution and oppression lacking. The motivations behind freeing the Unblooded and defeating the Eternal King felt underdeveloped. Shan's character also disappointed me; she seemed to prioritize the concept of a nation over the actual suffering of its people. Although she recognized the plight of the Unblooded, she was unwilling to risk her own safety to help them or challenge harmful power structures. Her advocacy for slow progress and a broader vision came across as hypocritical, especially given her privileged background.",

She is willing to lie, kill, and manipulate to achieve her goals.  \n   - Samuel starts the book angry yet resigned to his life as an Unblooded. He struggles with his powers and identity, representing everything he resents.  \n   - The dynamics within the trio (Shan, Samuel, and Issac) are compelling.

It made sense by the end but felt unengaging for most of the book.  \n\n- **Messaging and Character Growth:**  \n   - I struggled with the author’s messaging on revolution and oppression. The goal of freeing the Unblooded and defeating the Eternal King felt underdeveloped as a motivational factor.  \n   - Shan’s character began to wane for me as she didn’t seem to learn the lesson I expected. She cared more about the idea of a country than the suffering of its people. While she understood the Unblooded’s suffering, she wasn’t willing to risk her own life to help them or disrupt harmful power structures.

            "The murder mystery plot lacks tension, as the victims are Unblooded civilians with no ties to the protagonists, making it difficult to feel invested. The reveal of the killer and their motivations feels rushed, missing an opportunity for greater impact. The ending, intended to be a high-octane twist, also comes off as hurried, causing the reader's attention to wane. Despite these shortcomings, the novel is a dark fantasy rich in political intrigue, dangerous magic, and morally ambiguous characters. It weaves together multiple storylines, including a murder mystery, political machinations, a burgeoning revolution, and a high-stakes romance. The opening is particularly strong, featuring Shan's murder of her father and her subsequent rise to power, effectively setting the stage for courtly scheming and blood magic.",
            "Shan is a compelling protagonist—ambitious, ruthless, and fiercely loyal to her twin brother—while also navigating the complexities of her biracial identity and facing prejudice. In contrast, Samuel, an Unblooded with a hidden magical gift, comes across as less engaging and somewhat bland. Isaac, the enigmatic Blood Worker, stands out as a well-liked character. The story also excels in its inclusive representation of queer identities, featuring Isaac as a trans man, Samuel as bisexual, and Anton as gay.",
            "The world is richly atmospheric, featuring opulent court scenes, sinister magical experiments, and a pronounced divide between the Blood Workers and the Unblooded. However, the magic system, known as Bloodwork, lacks clarity, with vague rules and limitations that can leave readers feeling confused.",
            "The novel shines in its representation of queer and Filipino identities, seamlessly woven into the fantasy setting. It thoughtfully explores themes of prejudice, power dynamics, and loyalty, particularly through the character of Shan.",
            "While the novel has its shortcomings, it offers captivating elements for the right reader, including a dark fantasy atmosphere, a developing polyamorous romance, and a fiercely unapologetic female lead. Fans of *Silver Under Nightfall* by Rin Chupeco or *A Dowry of Blood* by S.T. Gibson may find it particularly appealing."

            "Shan possesses intriguing traits, but her character development stagnates after the initial setup. While her backstory—killing her father and building a spy network—holds promise, these elements remain largely unexplored. The narrative focuses more on telling us about Shan's manipulative nature rather than showing it in action. Sam, the only significant Unblooded character, is underutilized; he spends more time reflecting on his identity than engaging in actions that could deepen his role in the story. The relationships among the three main characters lack depth and believability. Given their circumstances—such as Isaac abandoning Shan, Sam's struggles as an Unblooded, and Shan's supposed manipulation—there should have been more conflict. Instead, any tension is quickly overshadowed by romantic moments. Most interactions between the leads center on their physical attraction, making it difficult to invest in their relationships.",

Instead, the book leaned heavily into YA romantasy, which was not what I was hoping for. This mismatch in expectations is on me for not researching the author’s typical genre beforehand.  \n\n- **World-Building**  \n   - The world-building suffered from a lack of *Show-Don’t-Tell*. The magic system, *Blood Working*, sounded promising but was mostly referenced by characters rather than shown in action.

The epilogue piqued my curiosity about the next installment, and I might still read it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book didn’t meet my expectations for a dark, mature horror romance, it was enjoyable enough to finish.

            "The conflict is a standout element, with characters like Shan, Samuel, and Isaac embodying diverse political perspectives rooted in their backgrounds. The interplay between the rich and poor, as well as the unblooded and blooded, adds depth and reflects real-world political dynamics. The evolution of their political views throughout the story is particularly impressive. However, the pacing accelerates significantly in the final 50 pages, leading to some events that feel sudden and disorienting. While the twists are unpredictable, they lack the groundwork needed to make them feel truly earned.",

            "The blood magic is both disturbing and alluring, effectively establishing the story's tone. While the plot isn't overly complex, it fulfills its role and enhances the dark, adult fantasy atmosphere. The world, though familiar, is engaging, with class tensions that propel the narrative. Hints of a broader universe suggest deeper exploration in future installments, adding depth and intrigue.",

While not overly complex, it serves its purpose well and adds to the dark, adult fantasy vibe.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world is \"pretty standard but a good kind of standard,\" with class tensions that drive the story. There are hints of a larger world that will likely be explored more in future books, adding depth and intrigue.  \n\n- **Conflict and Politics:**  \n  The conflict is a standout element, with characters like Shan, Samuel, and Isaac representing different political stances tied to their origins. The interplay between the poor-rich and unblooded-blooded dichotomies adds complexity and mirrors real-life political dynamics. The evolution of their politics throughout the book is particularly impressive.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are solid and well-liked for different reasons. The inclusion of a poly romance is appreciated, though it feels like it might be drawn out over the series due to the many other plotlines.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The pacing picks up significantly in the last ~50 pages, with some events feeling sudden and slightly disorienting. While the twists were unpredictable, they didn’t feel revelatory, as the book didn’t provide enough groundwork to make them feel earned.  \n\n- **Engagement and Overall Feel:**  \n  Despite the book’s complexity and depth, there’s a sense of disengagement, likely due to the \"first book\" feeling where much of the setup is for future installments. However, it’s still an enjoyable read with broad appeal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a strong start to a series and an impressive debut. It’s a dark, political fantasy with a touch of romance, perfect for readers who enjoy bloody, intricate stories. While it has some pacing issues and a few underdeveloped twists, it sets up a promising foundation for the rest of the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars!"

            "Shan is a truly ruthless character with a compelling villainous aura. Her intense anger towards the system is palpable, and her fierce desire to protect her loved ones resonates throughout the story. I absolutely loved her! Smart, competent, and efficient, Shan can meticulously craft a plan or quickly seize an opportunity when it arises. She embodies the mantra of acting despite the potential for hurt feelings or moral dilemmas, a testament to her complexity.\n\nIf Shan is the beating heart of the book, Samuel is its soul. As the moral compass, he instinctively identifies right from wrong and speaks his mind, regardless of the potential consequences. In a brutal world, Samuel's unwavering morality provides a much-needed beacon of hope. He is so endearing that I wanted to both hug and protect him, while wishing to share a drink with Shan.\n\nThe romantic dynamics among Shan, Samuel, and Isaac are beautifully crafted. The author skillfully balances the relationships without losing focus on their individual connections as a throuple. Shan and Isaac navigate their turbulent past with sincerity and understanding, with Isaac's evident regret adding depth to his character. Meanwhile, Samuel and Isaac share a playful, intense flirtation, and Shan and Samuel seamlessly complement each other despite their differences. Every romantic interaction is not only believable but also incredibly delightful!",
            "This book is not a light read; its world is undeniably brutal and bloody. Content warnings include, but are not limited to, on-page patricide, references to past rape of a now-deceased character, murder, bloodshed, and human experimentation.",
            "I couldn't put this book down! I loved it so much that I want to start a fan club and be its president! The author's storytelling is flawless; I wouldn't change a thing—not even a comma. This level of satisfaction is rare and incredibly gratifying. I adored everything about this book and can hardly wait for the second installment! What did you mean by that, Samuel? This book is a monthly pick for an August box, and I can't wait to see it! Renew, renew, renew!"
        ],

I loved it so much that I want to form a fanclub and be its president!  \n   - The author does not step a foot wrong in his storytelling, and the feeling of \"I wouldn't change a thing, not even a comma.\" is so, so rare but also so gratifying when it comes.  \n   - I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK!!!! I CANNOT HOLD MYSELF TO WAIT FOR BOOK 2!!!!!!  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Shan is truly ruthless and has a villainous aura. Her anger against the system is so loud, so tangible, and her desire to protect her loved ones is palpable in the air. I LOVED HER! She's smart, competent, and efficient, and she can take her time to form a plan but can also improvise and take an opportunity when it arises.  \n   - Shan is the queen of \"I know this might hurt your feelings / I know this is wrong but I need to do this, so I do it anyway.\"  \n   - If Shan is the beating heart of the book, then Samuel is the soul. Samuel is the moral compass, the one who decisively sees right from wrong and reacts without considering the political and social implications. He speaks his mind even in situations that could lead him to serious trouble.  \n   - In a bloody and bloodthirsty world, Samuel's morality shone through every step of the way. He was the beacon of hope we needed. I loved him so much. I want to hug and protect Samuel, and drink with Shan.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - The romance between Shan, Samuel, and Isaac is sooo good. I loved how the author paid attention to all pairs but also to them as a throuple.  \n   - Shan and Isaac had a turbulent past, but they slowly overcame it because Isaac was sincere, and Shan simply understood his motivations. Also, because Isaac definitely looked like he regretted most of his life choices. Poor guy.  \n   - Samuel and Isaac had this calm yet intense flirty vibe. Shan and Samuel clicked together like two pieces of a puzzle. Albeit being very different from each other, they fit together.  \n   - Every bit of romance is believable and oh so very delightful!!  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot was good, and I really liked the pacing. It had many twists and many plot threads, but we also had time for character and romance development.  \n\n- **World-Building and Tone:**  \n   - It's not a light read, though. The world in the book is truly brutal and bloody. CW include but aren't limited to: patricide on the page, mention of rape (happened in the past to a now-dead character), murder, blood, experimentation on humans.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Installments:**  \n   - What did you mean by THAT, Samuel my dear?!!!  \n   - This book is a monthly pick for an August box, and RENEW, RENEW, RENEW!!!!!! I can't wait to see it!!!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an absolute masterpiece, with flawless storytelling, compelling characters, and a gripping plot. The romance is beautifully crafted, and the world, though brutal, is vividly realized. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment and cannot recommend this book enough.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a perfect or near-perfect score."

By the end, I was left with more questions than answers, especially regarding key world-building elements essential for grasping the narrative.",

Samuel, the secondary POV character, is bland and lacks purpose, while Isaac, the most intriguing character, has potential that ultimately leads to a disappointing storyline.

Her motivations, supposedly linked to her brother Anton, feel unconvincing due to their shallow relationship and minimal interaction. While depicted as manipulative and untrustworthy, she doesn't come across as genuinely evil—rather, she appears more irritating than impactful. Anton stands out as a character, grounding Shan by constantly calling her out, which I appreciated. Sam is frustratingly annoying, failing to recognize his own limitations despite being a victim. In contrast, Isaac is intriguing; his nice-guy facade eventually gives way to madness. The polyamorous dynamic feels unbalanced, with Sam’s irritating behavior overshadowing Isaac's more compelling persona.

While the plot did regain momentum later, I had already lost interest in most of the characters. I would have preferred a greater emphasis on the political intrigue and murder mystery rather than the romance. Although I appreciate romance in stories, I prefer it to be woven in rather than dominating the plot. The romance subplot overshadowed more intriguing elements, such as the political machinations and the murder mystery.",

            "The story opens with Shan killing her father in the first chapter, but soon shifts focus to blushing encounters in library corners and romantic interactions. The plot centers on Shan's ambition to assume her father's role as head of the household and her desire to become the spymaster. In her quest to capture the Not-A-Vampire King’s attention, she seeks out the last heir to his lineage, leading to a tale rife with murder, blood, and political intrigue. However, these darker themes are often overshadowed by the overly kind and pleasant nature of the characters.",
            "I struggled to connect with the characters in this story. Shan, Sam, and Isaac, despite navigating a world rife with political intrigue and violence, come across as overly kind and apologetic. Their interactions, filled with blushing, dating, and frequent apologies, feel at odds with the darker tone suggested by the book's description.",

As a result, the fantasy aspects feel underdeveloped and secondary to the political intrigue. Marketed as a “dark romantic fantasy” with a “villainous and bloodthirsty” heroine, the book ultimately falls short of these promises. The tone is far from dark, and Shan's character lacks the villainous and bloodthirsty qualities suggested. Additionally, the twists are predictable, and the story lacks the intensity and complexity I anticipated."

The polyamorous dynamic didn't resonate with me, as I sensed a power imbalance between two characters and found the third less appealing. However, I did appreciate the portrayal of a queer-normative society in the novel.",
            "The novel delves into themes of racism through the experiences of Shan and Isaac, who navigate their Tagalan heritage—a fantasy interpretation of Filipino culture—in the kingdom of Aeravin, where they are marginalized. It also tackles class struggle, highlighting how the unblooded, representing the lower class, lack government representation, while the powerful Blood Workers dominate the political landscape.",
            "The story presents a unique premise featuring Blood Workers with vampire-like abilities, intertwined with political intrigue, romance, and a murder mystery. While the concept of blood magic is captivating, it feels underdeveloped. Although the narrative highlights significant applications such as lifespan extension, healing, and body modification, it fails to explore the everyday uses of this magic. Additionally, the distinction between Blood Workers and traditional vampires—who face issues like sunlight sensitivity and blood dependency—creates confusion regarding the book's description."

Suggestions for improvement include an earlier introduction to the Blood Tax, clarification on what the blood contributes to magic, scenes that test the magic's limits, and direct interactions between the blooded and unblooded to underscore the injustice. Despite this, the overall plot and characters are compelling, and the romance is particularly well-executed and enjoyable.",

The uneven pacing and disjointed writing style detracted from the experience, but the story’s strengths were enough to leave me interested in continuing the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Her goal is to overthrow the eternal king, who resembles her father, and replace him with someone more worthy, like Samuel, the male lead. I appreciated the shocking and unexpected plot twist. While the novel presents an original concept, it suffers from a lack of cohesion, as the author attempts to weave together too many elements—romance, dark fantasy, vampires, and a detective plot—resulting in a messy and underdeveloped narrative.",

His later choices appear inconsistent with the ideals and values established in the first half of the novel, resulting in a disjointed character arc. Additionally, some events and character decisions feel forced, seemingly included solely to advance the plot without regard for the characters' motivations or personalities. This inconsistency undermines the story's believability.

His later choices seem inconsistent with his established ideals and values from the first half of the novel, which makes his character arc feel disjointed.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Consistency:**  \n   - Certain events and character choices feel forced, as if they exist solely to move the plot forward without considering whether they align with the characters' established motivations or personalities.

This moral ambiguity created an \"icky\" feeling and made it difficult to fully engage with the story.  \n\n- **Character Age and Realism:**  \n   - The characters are portrayed as being in their early twenties, which feels unnecessarily young for the level of responsibility they hold.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building and Mythos:**  \n  I love the evolution and applications of the vampire myth in this book. The vampires feel more like Blood Mages from *Dragon Age*, but they must consume blood to use magic, which ties back to their vampiric nature. The concept of blood magic is intriguing and well-executed.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n  While some of the ending plots hint at more conventional tropes for the next book in the series, I feel very satisfied with how this installment concluded. I’m excited to pick up the next book. The story also includes a light murder mystery element, which adds an engaging layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Influences:**  \n  This book reminded me of Rin Chupeco's *Silver Under Nightfall*, but with less horror and *Castlevania* vibes, and more focus on court intrigue and blood magic.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The triad poly relationship is a standout element—it’s not always sunshine and rainbows, which makes it feel realistic and compelling. The FMC (female main character) is strong but fallible, adding depth to her character.  \n\n- **Writing and Tropes Avoided:**  \n  I appreciated the absence of miscommunication tropes, though the characters do lie, as the title suggests. This adds complexity to their interactions without relying on overused clichés.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The book explores believable political conspiracies and manipulation, which kept me engaged. It also touches on the feeling of otherness as a POC in a white-dominated country/government, adding a layer of relatability and depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a refreshing take on vampire lore, blending blood magic, political intrigue, and complex relationships. While it hints at familiar tropes for future installments, it stands strong on its own with its unique world-building, compelling characters, and thoughtful themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 (rounded up)"

            "The reveal and resolution felt rushed, yet they set the stage for a haunting ending that promises an exciting continuation. However, the title, *Mistress of Lies*, doesn't quite capture Shan's character, who embodies information, secrets, and manipulation rather than outright deception.",
            "Shan is a compelling protagonist—tough, clever, and determined, though her good intentions often lead to missteps. In contrast, Isaac and Samuel are more subdued; Isaac is haunted by his past actions, while Samuel tends to make impulsive choices. Anton and Bart feel underdeveloped, with much of their story unfolding off-screen. Their perspectives, particularly Anton’s, could have benefited from deeper exploration. The book is not a steamy or spicy romantasy; instead, it leans toward dark, political storytelling. Readers sensitive to blood—its appearance, use in magic, and consumption—should approach with caution.",
            "The politics in this story are captivating and expertly crafted, leaving me eager for future installments. The blood-working magic system is central to the world, yet it feels somewhat vague. While it is a born skill that isn't guaranteed to be inherited, its applications—such as healing, harming, warding, and lighting—are intriguing but not fully explored.",
            "This novel masterfully intertwines vampires, murder mysteries, LGBTQIA+ representation, political intrigue, love triangles, and a lost heir. As a dark debut, it centers on characters driven by their own ambitions, often oblivious to the consequences of their actions and the impact on others."

Their perspectives and relationships, especially Anton’s, could have been explored more deeply.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Magic System:**  \n   - The politics are intriguing and well-crafted, leaving me eager for more in future installments.  \n   - The blood-working magic system is central to the world but remains somewhat vague. It’s a born skill, not guaranteed to be inherited, and its applications (healing, harming, warding, lighting) are intriguing but not fully explained.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The reveal and resolution felt rushed, though they set up a haunting ending that promises an exciting sequel.  \n   - The title, *Mistress of Lies*, doesn’t fully align with Shan’s character, who is more about information, secrets, and manipulation than outright deception.  \n\n- **Minor Quibbles:**  \n   - The name “Jessica James” feels out of place in a world with names like Shan LeClaire, Alessi, and Tristan Aberfoth. It lacks the thematic resonance of the other names.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this dark, politically charged debut and am excited for the sequel. While the book has some pacing issues and underdeveloped side characters, its strong protagonist, intriguing worldbuilding, and complex politics make it a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

His more proactive role in the later parts is appreciated, though.  \n\n- **Moral Dilemmas and Cost:**  \n  The book raises an important question: How high is too high a cost? This adds depth to the narrative and leaves the reader reflecting on the stakes involved.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel has its strengths, particularly in its opening and closing sections, as well as its exploration of social inequality and moral dilemmas. However, the pacing in the middle falters, and the protagonist’s actions often feel insufficient. While some characters, like the Eternal King, show promise, they are not fully utilized. Overall, it’s a mixed experience with moments of excitement and thought-provoking themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Unfortunately, this strong start quickly loses momentum, resulting in a plot that feels generic and uninspired. The story lacks distinctive elements that could capture the reader's attention, making it challenging to remain engaged.",

Samuel, another key character, is unremarkable and lacks depth. Additionally, the dynamic between Shan (the Sparrow) and her second-in-command (the Hawk) is perplexing, as hawks naturally prey on sparrows.",
            "The prose is generally beautiful, but it suffers from awkward phrasing and jarring word choices that disrupt immersion. For instance, the sentence \"Unlike Shan, he didn’t have the benefit of a lifetime\" is confusing and detracts from the overall reading experience.",

The use of modern phrases like \"okay\" in a historical context feels jarring and inconsistent. While the concept of Blood Workers (blood mages) shows promise, it remains underdeveloped, and the societal structure lacks uniqueness, resembling typical non-magical nobility. Although the metal claws worn by Blood Workers add an intriguing detail, the world itself lacks the depth and originality needed to be truly compelling. The blood magic system has potential but is not explored in a meaningful way. Additionally, logical inconsistencies, such as Shan testing Samuel’s blood against that of the immortal king without explaining how she obtained the latter, undermine the story’s credibility.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I did not enjoy the book enough to continue reading past the 25% mark. While the first chapter had a strong setup, the overall experience fell short of my expectations.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was not as developed as I would have liked at this point in the story. While some basic details about the setting were provided, I didn’t feel fully immersed or rooted in the world.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There was a disconnect between how the characters were presented and their actual choices and actions. This inconsistency made it difficult for me to connect with or believe in the characters.\n\n- **Stakes and Tension:**  \n  The stakes felt unintentionally low, which diminished my investment in the story. I didn’t feel a strong sense of urgency or consequence driving the narrative.\n\n- **Potential for Future Installments:**  \n  Since this appears to be the start of a series, I might consider revisiting it if reviews for the next installment are more positive. However, I’m not motivated to continue with the series at this time.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a promising start, it ultimately failed to hold my interest due to underdeveloped world-building, inconsistent character portrayals, and low stakes. I may give the series another chance in the future if subsequent books receive better feedback.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (Did not finish the book)."

The portrayal of their polyamorous relationship was well-executed, with a strong emphasis on consent. Additionally, the representation of a transmasc character was commendable, particularly in the intimate scene between the transmasc individual and a cis woman. However, I found the label of Shan as a villainous heroine to be misleading. Although she engages in morally ambiguous actions early on, they aren't necessarily wrong, and her self-perception as politically savvy often clashes with reality. Whether this reflects a character flaw or an authorial oversight is open to interpretation.",

However, almost everything fell just a bit short, leaving room for improvement in the rest of the series.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n   - The world-building and magic system never felt fully fleshed out. Things happened without proper explanation because the characters already knew the details. The magic system lacked clear rules and felt underdeveloped, almost like it was included just for the \"spooky blood magic\" aesthetic. I hope this gets addressed in the next book.  \n\n- **Political Intrigue:**  \n   - The political intrigue felt more suited to a YA novel and came across as rushed, which was disappointing for an adult dark fantasy. It has potential but needs more depth and development.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - The characters were a highlight for me. Shan, Samuel, and Isaac are great main characters, and I loved their motivations and dynamics. The polyamorous relationship was handled well, with clear emphasis on consent, which I appreciated. The transmasc representation was also excellent, especially in how an intimate scene between a transmasc person and a cis woman was written.  \n   - However, labeling Shan as a \"villainous heroine\" felt inaccurate. While she did something morally ambiguous early on, it wasn’t necessarily wrong, and her self-perceived political savvy didn’t always align with reality. Whether this is a character flaw or an authorial shortcoming is up for debate.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n   - Despite its shortcomings, I have hope that the series will improve. The combination of polyamorous relationships, political intrigue, and blood magic is incredibly compelling, and I’m eager to see how it develops.  \n\n- **Physical Edition:**  \n   - The Illumicrate edition of the book is stunning, which adds to my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has some flaws, particularly in world-building, magic system development, and political intrigue, its strong concept, compelling characters, and unique representation make it worth reading.

However, as the story progressed, nothing significant happened. The main characters were handed everything, often too late to impact the storyline.  \n  - The plot felt convoluted, with the same ideas repeated excessively over 400+ pages, seemingly to set up a second book that might be better.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - There was very little world-building, making it difficult to visualize the setting. Despite being an imaginative person, I couldn’t conjure up a clear image of their world.  \n  - The setting shifted inconsistently, moving from Renaissance to modern times to medieval without any logical explanation.  \n\n- **Magic System (Blood Working):**  \n  - The Blood Working concept was poorly defined and made little sense. It allowed blood workers to do everything but nothing truly useful.  \n  - The magic system was vague and seemed to be used only by the main characters and the king, lacking depth or broader application.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing felt repetitive, with the same ideas reiterated unnecessarily throughout the book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The main characters lacked agency, as everything was handed to them rather than earned through their actions.  \n\n- **Aesthetic Appeal:**  \n  - The cover and edges of the book are beautiful, which is a shame given the disappointing content.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial hope for a compelling story, the book fell short in nearly every aspect. The plot was underdeveloped, the world-building was lacking, and the magic system was poorly executed. The repetitive writing and inconsistent setting further detracted from the experience.

His eventual seduction into the fold feels natural.  \n   - Issac is depicted as a sad and tortured character, forced to act under someone else's control, which adds depth to his role in the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Vampire Lore:**  \n   - The author presents a fresh take on vampires, maintaining their dark essence while introducing new elements.  \n   - The exploration of power and ambition through the characters' unfaltering pursuits is well-executed.  \n\n- **Plot and Suspense:**  \n   - The storyline is suspenseful, driven by betrayal and the hunt for a serial killer whose actions threaten to incite a revolt.  \n   - The complex bond between the three main characters adds intrigue, leaving the reader questioning who is manipulating whom.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n   - The romance between Shan and Samuel feels rushed and inconsistent with Shan's character, as her calculating nature would likely resist such emotional vulnerability.  \n   - The relationship between Samuel and Issac is more believable and adds an interesting dynamic to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book is a captivating read with strong character development, a fresh take on vampire lore, and a suspenseful plot filled with intrigue and betrayal. While the romance subplot could have been more nuanced, the story remains engaging and well-crafted.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The overarching plot addressing classism and the divide between Blood Workers and the Unblooded is both compelling and realistic. However, the murder mystery subplot falls short; it feels underdeveloped and unresolved, with a reveal that is ultimately unsatisfying and confusing.",
            "The romance is the standout element of the story, characterized by palpable chemistry and attraction among the characters. The dynamics between the three main characters are well-defined and consistently engaging. However, the emotional connection feels rushed, and the ending leaves the romance oddly unresolved, which is disappointing. The flawed nature of characters like Shan and Samuel is a highlight, as their messy, realistic portrayals rooted in their upbringings add depth. In contrast, the relationship between Shan and Anton feels underdeveloped; their connection appears superficial, and their cultural ties, particularly through their mother, are insufficiently explored. On a positive note, the transmasc and overall LGBT representation are handled exceptionally well, enriching the narrative.",

It also included queer representation (not my main reason for reading, but I think that was a big draw for many readers), a twisty political plot, and some spicy scenes. While these elements might work for some readers, they didn’t work for me.  \n\n- **Writing Style (Show vs. Tell):**  \n  Too many critical plot points happened off-page, which made the story feel disjointed and less immersive.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The romantic subplot felt forced, with weird and rushed attractions (insta-lust) that didn’t make sense between the characters. I didn’t even get to the real meat of the romance, but what I read didn’t feel believable or engaging.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The story seemed to be trying too hard to be more than just another Romantasy book. It aimed to be high fantasy with a romantic subplot, but it didn’t succeed as either.  \n\n- **Representation and Diversity:**  \n  I appreciate the attempt at diverse representation, particularly the queer rep, which I think will appeal to readers who prioritize this in fantasy books.  \n\n- **Reader Validation and Consensus:**  \n  I’m aware I’m in the minority with my opinion, but I feel validated that my complaints align with those of other readers.  \n\n- **Potential for Improvement:**  \n  Maybe if I had kept reading, the romance or character development would have improved towards the end. However, since this is the first book in a series and I was struggling from around page 50, I decided to pass.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Mistress of Lies* had an intriguing premise and elements that might appeal to some readers (like queer representation and a dark fantasy setting), it fell short for me due to its disjointed plot, forced relationships, and inability to balance high fantasy and romance.

The reviewer expresses frustration with the recurring trope of trans characters being depicted as antagonists.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story features political intrigue, but the reviewer finds its execution lacking. The intrigue is often dropped abruptly in favor of romantic moments, only to be reintroduced suddenly, creating a disjointed narrative flow.\n   - The pacing feels inconsistent, with characters appearing unproductive and oblivious to the ongoing magical murders, which undermines the tension and urgency of the plot.\n\n- **Character Decisions and Logic:**\n   - The reviewer questions the logic of the Eternal King's actions, noting that the characters' lack of productivity and awareness should have logically led to their demise at multiple points.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book earns praise for its LGBTQIA+ representation, it falls short in its portrayal of a trans character as a villain and struggles with inconsistent pacing and plot execution. The political intrigue is undermined by abrupt shifts to romantic moments, and the characters' lack of urgency detracts from the story's tension.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 2.5/5 stars (1 star added for LGBTQIA+ representation, 1 star deducted for the trans villain trope)."

            "The book opens with an intriguing premise of political scheming and revenge but quickly descends into a predictable murder mystery. The middle drags, but the final quarter becomes more engaging as twists unfold and characters take charge. While the pacing is uneven, the last act is more compelling—perhaps due to my eagerness to reach the conclusion.",
            "Shan LeClaire, the protagonist, is a skilled schemer but feels juvenile and lacks depth. Samuel is bland and underdeveloped, with an unclear character arc. In contrast, Isaac stands out, introducing much-needed tension and drama, though his potential remains underutilized. The Eternal King is a poorly developed villain, and Anton's character arc is left unresolved. The romance between Shan and Samuel lacks chemistry, feeling rushed and unconvincing, while Isaac adds some tension to the dynamics. Overall, the relationships lack depth and realism.",
            "The dialogue frequently feels stilted and awkward, which detracts from the overall reading experience. While the prose shows moments of promise, it often becomes repetitive, especially in Shan's internal monologues about her intelligence and frustration.",
            "The concept of Blood Working as a magic system is intriguing yet underdeveloped, lacking a thorough exploration of its potential applications. The worldbuilding is minimal, focusing primarily on the main kingdom without delving into significant political ramifications of Blood Working. While Shan and her brother's Tagalan heritage is acknowledged, it remains superficially explored, leaving cultural elements feeling underrepresented."

        "conclusion": "Mistress of Lies had the potential to be an engaging novel with its intriguing premise and unique magic system, but it fell short in execution. The plot was predictable, the characters lacked depth, and the worldbuilding was underdeveloped. While there were moments of enjoyment, particularly with Isaac and the final act, the overall experience was not satisfying. The book may appeal to some readers, but it did not resonate with this reader.",

The romance subplot also suffers from an insta-love dynamic that lacks depth and balance among the characters. Additionally, the narrative is burdened by excessive exposition, which slows the pacing and could have been streamlined for a smoother progression.

Although romance is central to the story, it suffers from a lack of chemistry and depth. The polyamorous relationship is particularly underdeveloped, with the characters rarely sharing the same space, and Isaac's absence of a point of view weakens the triad.

The integration of magic into Isaac's transition is skillfully done, showcasing how seamlessly queer and trans identities can be woven into fantasy narratives.

However, I struggled to connect with Shan. While the author intended her to be unlikable, she came off as more ridiculous than complex, and her forced cleverness, coupled with a lack of meaningful action until late in the story, was frustrating. \n\nThe MMF romance was natural and well-integrated, with Samuel and Isaac displaying more chemistry with each other than with Shan. Fortunately, the relationships avoided excessive drama, leaving room for further development in future installments. However, the ending felt hypocritical, particularly regarding Isaac's treatment.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Representation and Diversity:**\n   - The representation in the book was great, with multiple queer characters and characters of color.\n   - The way magic was integrated into Isaac's transition was well-executed and made sense within the world, demonstrating how easy it is to include queer/trans characters in fantasy stories.\n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**\n   - Samuel was my favorite character, and I felt a strong emotional connection to him. I understood his choices and empathized with him.\n   - Isaac was also a character I liked, and I felt bad for him due to the unfair treatment he received.\n   - Shan, however, was a character I struggled to connect with. While the author intended her to be unlikable, she came across as ridiculous rather than complex. Her supposed cleverness felt forced, and her lack of meaningful action until late in the book was frustrating.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The MMF romance felt natural and well-integrated into the story. Samuel and Isaac had more chemistry with each other than with Shan, but the relationships were not overly dramatized and have potential for further development in future installments.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The pacing of the book was a letdown, with some parts feeling slow or underdeveloped.\n   - The mystery aspect didn't make much sense, especially since Samuel's ability to compel information was underutilized, which could have streamlined the plot.\n\n- **Moral Complexity and Character Decisions:**\n   - The ending felt hypocritical, particularly with Isaac's treatment. Despite his actions aligning with the group's goals, he was captured and turned in, which didn't make logical sense.\n   - The characters' sudden moral high ground felt inconsistent in a story that was supposed to feature morally grey protagonists.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**\n   - The world-building was intriguing, and the plot had potential, but some elements, like Shan's motivations and the handling of the rebellion, felt underdeveloped or inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this was a solid fantasy debut with strong representation and an intriguing plot. While I enjoyed the queer romance and the emotional depth of some characters, the pacing, underdeveloped mystery, and inconsistent character decisions held the book back from being a firm 4-star read. Despite these issues, I believe the author has potential and look forward to seeing how the series develops.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3.5 stars."

            "The book was marketed as a murder mystery intertwined with a rebellion against the king, but three-quarters of the narrative focused on politics. Unfortunately, the political discussions lacked engagement, and the characters failed to take meaningful action to support their words, resulting in a stagnant plot. Additionally, the author relied heavily on telling rather than showing, which hindered my ability to visualize the events and fully immerse myself in the story.",
            "**Shan:** Initially, I found Shan compelling for killing her father to seize power. However, her character later became inconsistent. The revelation that she was the Sparrow felt random, and her actions often contradicted her stated goal of helping the Unblooded. Despite her promises of change, she failed to deliver, and her hypocrisy in despising democrats while relying on their methods was frustrating. \n\n**Samuel:** Samuel, introduced as a Unblooded with actual magic, had an intriguing twist, but he didn’t stand out as much as I had hoped. \n\n**Issac:** Issac was my favorite character. As a Royal Blood Worker, he was fascinating, and the twist revealing him as the murderer was a highlight. I would have loved to see more of his perspective and his plans to overthrow the king. \n\n**Anton:** Anton showed potential but was underdeveloped. He started as a character with anger issues and a gambling habit, and the reveal that he was printing anti-king pamphlets was interesting. I wish we had seen more of his actions and strategies.",

The political intrigue, morally ambiguous choices, and dynamic character interactions contribute to a gripping and unpredictable plot.

His gradual awakening to the horrors of his new life and his complicity in the King’s plans add significant depth to his character. **Isaac**, the King’s right hand and a figure from Shan’s past, plays a pivotal role in the plot through his relationships with both Shan and Samuel. His struggle for recognition and self-destructive quest for respect make him a compelling character, and his well-written trans identity enriches the story’s diversity.",

            "The story feels clichéd and underdeveloped, missing opportunities to explore its political intrigue, espionage, and the intricacies of bloodworking. The absence of investigative elements and the underutilization of the spy network diminish the narrative's potential. Set in a realm ruled by an immortal King and an elite class of blood workers, the unblooded lower class suffers exploitation. A series of murders ignites dissent and threatens revolution. The plot is intriguing, featuring two main characters: Samuel, an unblooded individual with mysterious powers linked to the eternal King, and Shan, a noblewoman from a disgraced house who secretly serves as a spymaster while facing discrimination for her half-Tegalan heritage.",

Shan, a notorious and ruthless spymaster, fails to live up to her reputation; she gathers minimal useful information and reacts rather than initiates her schemes. Her vague plan to overthrow the King often sees her entangled in others' plots, rather than showcasing her supposed skills in espionage and manipulation.",

            "Shan, a young and ambitious spymaster, makes mistakes that add depth to her character. Her growth throughout the book is evident, and her evolving goals, along with her focus on romance and court politics, make her both relatable and intriguing. While some reviews criticize the telling rather than showing approach to her spymaster skills, I find her learning curve and missteps realistic for a debut novel. The supporting characters, including the king as a villain, are well-developed and enhance the story's complexity. The differing opinions among characters on how to enact change create engaging chaos and tension. The polyamorous romance and inclusion of trans characters are handled thoughtfully, with their acceptance feeling refreshing and natural. The tension between the three main romantic characters is compelling, and the brief but promising spice leaves room for further development in future installments.",
            "The world-building is captivating but could benefit from further expansion, particularly in the areas of blood magic and the societal distinctions that define this country. Additional details on social manipulation, political dynamics, and the intricacies of blood magic would significantly enhance the reader's immersion."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Opening and Introduction:**\n   - The book starts with a strong opening chapter, featuring Shan committing patricide, which effectively introduces her ruthless nature and her rise to power.\n   - This introduction sets the stage for the political intrigue and establishes Shan as a compelling character.\n\n- **Character Development (Shan):**\n   - Shan is portrayed as a young, ambitious spymaster who makes mistakes, which adds depth to her character.\n   - Her growth throughout the book is evident, and her shifting goals and focus on romance and court politics make her relatable and intriguing.\n   - While some reviews criticize the \"telling instead of showing\" approach to her spymaster skills, her mistakes and learning curve feel realistic for a first book.\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**\n   - The supporting characters, including the king as a villain, are well-developed and contribute to the story's complexity.\n   - The differing opinions among characters on how to enact change create engaging chaos and tension.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**\n   - The book is not primarily fast-paced, with the middle section feeling slightly muddled in terms of maintaining tension and direction.\n   - However, the ending picks up momentum, making it satisfying for readers who enjoy political intrigue.\n\n- **Romance and Representation:**\n   - The poly romance and inclusion of trans characters are handled well, with their acceptance feeling refreshing and natural within the story.\n   - The tension between the three main romantic characters is compelling, and the brief but promising spice leaves room for further development in future books.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building is intriguing but could be expanded further, especially regarding blood magic and the societal differences that set this county apart.\n   - More details on social manipulation, political dynamics, and the mechanics of blood magic would enhance the reader's immersion.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential:**\n   - Despite some pacing and world-building issues, the book is enjoyable and shows promise for the author's future works.\n   - The characters are engaging, and the political unrest and romantic dynamics leave readers eager for the next installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis debut novel delivers a strong start with compelling characters, particularly Shan, and a refreshing take on poly romance and trans representation. While the pacing and world-building could be improved, the story's political intrigue and character growth make it a worthwhile read. The author shows great potential, and I look forward to seeing how the series evolves.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4 stars."

            "The story begins with an engaging, action-packed opening but loses momentum as it unfolds. The middle section lacks depth, resulting in a thin plot and underdeveloped characters.",
            "I appreciated the *concept* of the characters more than their execution. The story often told rather than showed their traits, leading to inconsistencies. Shan, the protagonist, is introduced as a mastermind, yet her poor decisions throughout the narrative undermine this portrayal. The polyamorous romance needed more finesse to be effective; the chemistry between characters was frequently described rather than demonstrated, resulting in insta-lust that lacked meaningful emotional connections. Although I typically don't enjoy polyamorous romances, I didn't let that influence my rating, but I still found the relationships unconvincing.",
            "The world-building in this story, especially the incorporation of vampires, was a standout feature. The creative society of Blood Workers, blood magic, and the unblooded was engaging. However, the potential of these concepts felt underutilized, particularly in the portrayal of the unblooded characters, whose lives lacked deeper exploration."

However, it was let down by inconsistent character development, underdeveloped relationships, and a plot that failed to maintain its initial momentum.

            "The pacing of the story could use improvement, as some sections, particularly the romantic and spicy scenes, felt rushed. The relationships lacked authenticity, and the spicy moments seemed more like embellishments than essential elements of the plot. I would have preferred these scenes to be either more developed or omitted altogether. Despite this, I enjoyed the book and found the plot intriguing. The concept was compelling, but at times, it was difficult to follow the events and their significance. With further development, this book has the potential to become a five-star read.",
            "The diverse cast of characters was a standout feature, though some lacked consistency. Shan, a central character, had unclear motives; her initial goal of assassinating the king to benefit non-magical people seemed to lose focus as the story unfolded. Moreover, her disguise—merely a change of outfit and makeup—felt unrealistic. Bart, another key character, was underutilized; despite his importance, he often felt overlooked, and I would have liked to see more of him.",
            "The magic system in the story felt underdeveloped. Although blood magic was introduced, its mechanics, educational aspects, and the role of government-provided blood were insufficiently explained. This lack of detail diminished the system's significance to the narrative. Additionally, while the world-building showed promise, it lacked depth. Shan's indifference toward non-magical people, aside from her brother, made her character seem disconnected from the broader world, which ultimately detracted from the overall immersion."

For example, Shan, one of the main characters, had unclear motives. She initially aimed to kill the king to improve the world for non-magical people, but her focus seemed to waver as the story progressed. Additionally, her disguise (just a different outfit and makeup) felt unrealistic.\n   - Bart, an important character, was underutilized. Despite his significant role in the story, he felt forgotten, and I wish we saw more of him.\n\n- **Magic System:**\n   - The magic system was not well-established. While blood magic was mentioned, details about its mechanics, schooling, and government-provided blood were lacking. This lack of explanation made the magic system feel underdeveloped despite its importance to the story.\n\n- **Pacing:**\n   - The pacing could have been improved.

However, the challenges faced by the unblooded are more narrated than depicted, diminishing the narrative's impact. The prominent polyamorous romance and sexual tension enhance the book's appeal for certain readers.",

However, her motivations often feel muddled, and her intelligence is overstated, leading to a sense of repetition. **Samuel:** A passive character drawn into Shan’s schemes, Samuel is the lost heir to the vampire king, harboring a hidden and terrible power. While his perspective is relatable, the plot heavily relies on Shan to propel the story forward. **Isaac:** The third member of the main throuple, Isaac is a trans character who uses blood working to transition. He comes across as more complex, and readers eagerly anticipate his POV in the next book. His past betrayal of Shan is hinted at but not fully explored. **Anton:** Shan’s twin brother, a non-bloodworker, is more intelligent than his sister.

Her motivations are often muddled, and she isn’t as smart as she believes, which can feel repetitive.\n   - **Samuel:** A passive character pulled into Shan’s schemes, he is the lost heir to the vampire king with a hidden terrible power. His POV is relatable, but the story relies heavily on Shan to drive the plot.\n   - **Isaac:** The third in the main throuple, he is trans and uses blood working to transition. He feels more complex, and his POV is anticipated in the next book. His past betrayal of Shan is alluded to but not fully explained.\n   - **Anton:** Shan’s twin brother, a non-bloodworker who is smarter than his sister.

His transition from a potential love interest to the main villain feels abrupt and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Plot Cohesion and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot feels disjointed, with key events seemingly happening off-page, leaving gaps in the narrative.  \n   - The central murder mystery is neglected for long stretches, making the urgency feel misplaced.  \n   - The story jumps around, creating a sense of emptiness and confusion.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n   - The love triangle between Shan, Samuel, and Isaac feels forced and underdeveloped.  \n   - The romantic tension is overshadowed by the obvious expectation to root for Shan and Samuel, making the love triangle feel like a cop-out.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Repetition:**  \n   - The overuse of specific phrases like “cravat” and “blood and steel” becomes distracting and repetitive.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n   - The world-building is fine but feels incomplete, leaving a sense that something is missing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has an intriguing premise and some strong elements, it ultimately falls short due to inconsistent character development, a disjointed plot, and underdeveloped romantic and villainous arcs. The repetitive writing style and lack of cohesion detract from the overall experience. Despite these flaws, there’s enough potential to warrant giving the second book a chance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is provided, but the tone suggests a lukewarm or mediocre rating (e.g., 2.5/5 or 3/5)."

            "The book shows promise but struggles with pacing, as some plot points feel rushed or underdeveloped. Key developments are fast-tracked, leaving me wishing for more time to explore these moments.",
            "The dual perspectives of Shan and Samuel are compelling, showcasing their driven and complex natures. I appreciated their interactions with non-POV characters, particularly Shan's relationship with her Unblooded twin brother, which beautifully illustrated both love and misunderstanding. Bart, her brother's lover and part of her information network, was a character I wished to see more of. Isaac, a childhood friend of Shan's, added emotional depth to the narrative, with his casual transness and the use of magic for his transition being standout elements. The story's inclusion of polyamory, a villainous heroine, and the unique perspective of a trans Filipino-American author further distinguished it. Isaac's trans identity and the seamless representation of his transition through magic were especially impactful.",

            "*Mistress of Lies* is a captivating queer fantasy novel told from dual third-person perspectives, focusing on themes of blood magic and revenge. The story follows twins Shan and Anton, who conspire to kill their father in a bid for freedom and to reconnect with their mother’s heritage. With the assistance of Bart, Anton’s lover, they succeed, and Shan assumes her father’s position at court and on the council. Meanwhile, Samuel, an Unblooded—someone unable to wield blood magic—accidentally uncovers a murder and becomes entwined in the twins’ complex lives.",
            "The novel thoughtfully examines a potential polyamorous relationship among Shan, Isaac, and Samuel. Shan and Samuel share an immediate attraction, as do Samuel and Isaac. Shan is open to rekindling her romance with Isaac while contemplating a relationship with both men. The polyamorous dynamic is handled with care, ensuring that all three characters receive equal attention and respect.",
            "In a world dominated by blood magic, a distinct social hierarchy favors those who wield its power, leaving the Unblooded, like Samuel, marginalized. The incorporation of Filipino cultural elements—such as adobo, pancit, and Tagalog—enhances the worldbuilding and deepens the characters' identities.",
            "Heritage is a central theme in the story, particularly through the characters of Anton and Shan, who are half-Filipino. Their father has suppressed their connection to their mother’s culture, leaving them feeling alienated. Samuel's heritage is also significant; he learns through blood magic that he is the descendant of a vampire king who oppresses the Unblooded, and he is the son of a woman who was sexually assaulted. Additionally, Isaac, a trans man and former love interest of Shan, navigates prejudice as the child of immigrants, despite his exceptional talent in blood magic, which secures him a high-ranking position in society."

            "This story stands out for its commendable LGBTQ+ representation, particularly with the inclusion of a trans character, which is a refreshing rarity. However, the romance feels underdeveloped; the characters meet, fall in love, and navigate societal pressures against polyamory in an implausibly brief timeframe, resulting in a shallow experience.

There wasn’t enough worldbuilding to make the setting feel fully fleshed out.  \n  - I love when a setting feels like a character, but this book didn’t achieve that.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Books:**  \n  - This is the first in a series (or duology/trilogy), and while it had a rocky start, it shows promise.  \n  - The characters are interesting, and there’s room for more exploration in future installments.  \n  - If you’re a fan of romantasy, you might enjoy this, especially if the author hits their stride in the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis romantasy novel had its strengths, including plausible relationships and an interesting plot, but it suffered from uneven pacing, underdeveloped worldbuilding, and missed opportunities for character expansion. While it wasn’t perfect, it shows potential for future books in the series, making it worth a try for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot is engaging, though it occasionally drags, which almost prompted me to rate it 3.5. However, I ultimately settled on a 4 because I thoroughly enjoyed the story and its characters.",
            "The dual perspectives of Shan and Samuel are skillfully crafted and enjoyable. Shan is a morally complex, intelligent, and cunning character who is also fiercely protective of her brother. Samuel, an unblooded with hidden powers, navigates the world of blood workers while remaining empathetic toward his fellow unblooded. Isaac, a trans man with a connection to Shan, is a compelling character whose story I hope to see further developed. Anton and Bart are intriguing figures, and I look forward to their expanded roles in the sequel. The romantic tension among Shan, Samuel, and Isaac adds an engaging layer to the narrative. Isaac's identity as a trans character is handled thoughtfully, acknowledged without being portrayed negatively or as the central focus. The themes of power dynamics, morality, and societal tensions are present, setting the stage for deeper exploration in future installments.",

Instead of traditional vampires, the main characters are \"blood workers,\" who consume blood to gain abilities like strength, speed, and healing. The concept of blood bending, inspired by *Avatar*, adds an interesting twist. The world-building sets up potential for deeper exploration in future books, particularly the politics and tensions between blood workers and the unblooded.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The dual POVs of Shan and Samuel are well-executed and enjoyable. Shan is morally grey, intelligent, cunning, and badass, yet also kind and deeply protective of her brother. Samuel, an unblooded with a hidden power, navigates the blood workers' world while maintaining his empathy for the unblooded. Isaac, a trans man with a past tied to Shan, is a compelling character whose story I hope to see expanded. Anton (Shan's brother) and Bart are intriguing, and I hope they play a larger role in the sequel. The dynamic between Shan, Samuel, and Isaac, who are all infatuated with each other, adds an engaging layer to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**  \n  While the plot is engaging overall, it can feel slow at times. This almost led me to rate it 3.5, but I ultimately gave it a 4 because I enjoyed the story and characters so much.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The inclusion of a trans character (Isaac) is handled well, with his identity acknowledged but not treated as a negative or central focus. The themes of power dynamics, morality, and societal tensions are present and set the stage for deeper exploration in future installments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a fun and unique story with a fresh take on vampire lore, compelling characters, and intriguing world-building.

            "The mystery plot surrounding the killer felt underdeveloped, lacking sufficient active investigation. More emphasis on parties and one-on-one conversations could have enriched the mystery element. While Isaac and Anton’s subplot was engaging, a better balance with the main mystery would have strengthened the overall narrative.",
            "Shan is a compelling protagonist—confident yet flawed—making her journey of self-discovery truly engaging. The Eternal King serves as a well-crafted antagonist, his gradual loss of humanity rendering him both detestable and intriguing. Isaac, portrayed as a trans man, offers a refreshing and respectful representation, free from unnecessary transphobia from other characters. Samuel’s perspective as an Unblooded provides a unique lens on societal inequality, and his empathy for others like him is heartwarming.",

            "The story follows Shan LeClaire, a Blood Worker on a quest for revenge, and Samuel Hutchinson, a cursed relative of the Eternal King. Together, they investigate a string of gruesome murders targeting the Unblooded. While the initial murder committed by Shan appears significant, it ultimately lacks impact later in the narrative, which is disappointing. Additionally, some sections feel repetitive, suggesting that the story had the potential for a more engaging and dynamic plot.",
            "Shan LeClaire is resolute in her quest to restore her family’s name, but her character becomes increasingly unlikable as the story unfolds. In contrast, Samuel Hutchinson is more relatable, though he frequently makes questionable choices, especially concerning his cursed blood. His powers and character development are far more compelling than Shan’s, leading me to wish for a narrative centered solely on him.",
            "The dual POV structure was effective, though the pacing occasionally felt uneven due to some repetitive elements.",
            "The Blood Working magic system centers on the control of others through their blood, creating a stark divide between the Blooded, who wield magic, and the Unblooded, who are often exploited. The introduction of a blood tax enriches the world-building and highlights this societal divide. While the book was marketed as a vampire story, it ultimately focuses more on blood-based magic, which may be misleading for some readers.",
            "The inclusion of trigger warnings was commendable, given the story's dark and potentially sensitive themes.",
            "The book leans more towards romantasy (romantic fantasy) than pure fantasy, which may not resonate with all readers. Additionally, the tone and themes diverge from traditional vampire genre expectations."

            "The book opens with a gripping premise: Shan's father is murdered, prompting her transformation into a killer to protect her twin brother and their heritage. The narrative weaves together elements of blood magic, a murder investigation, and a city ruled by an oppressive immortal, creating an engaging and complex story. However, the expansive scope leads to a superficial exploration of its various components. Splitting the story into two or more books could have allowed for deeper development. The pacing is brisk, with multiple plotlines—such as the murder investigation, a magic-less class revolt, and several romances—competing for attention. This frequent shifting of focus makes it difficult to fully engage with any single storyline or character. I hope the next installment will concentrate more on the Sparrow’s role and the king's overthrow, resulting in a more cohesive and satisfying narrative.",

However, the book ultimately left me disappointed.\n\n- **Pacing and Dialogue:**\n   - The pacing and dialogue were handled well, but so much happened off-page that I struggled to connect with the characters or their struggles.\n\n- **Political Intrigue:**\n   - The political intrigue was one of the few elements that kept me reading. I’m not typically drawn to politics in books, but I wanted to see what would happen to Aeravin and its citizens. However, the execution lacked depth, and the stakes, while present, didn’t fully deliver.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building fell short. I understood the structure of the world, but it wasn’t immersive—I couldn’t picture Aeravin or feel its atmosphere. The vampire lore tied to blood magic was an interesting twist, but it felt underdeveloped. Aside from one scene, I rarely thought, “This is vampiric.” Blood magic enhanced strength and alertness, which could’ve been fascinating if explored further.\n\n- **Plot Logic and Predictability:**\n   - The plot’s logic was frustrating. The central twist was predictable—I figured it out long before the characters did. Shan’s preoccupation with maintaining her “demure” facade and Samuel's need to \"not change\" took up so much of the story that it detracted from the larger stakes.

There were no significant redemption arcs or moments of growth that made me feel invested in their journey.\n\n- **Technical Issues:**\n   - There were technical issues, such as repetitive descriptions (the word “demure” was overused), misspellings, and scenes that felt heavily influenced by *The Hunger Games*. For example, Shan’s transformation into a figure the king wants her to be—paired with ominous warnings from her designer—immediately reminded me of Katniss Everdeen.\n\n- **Diversity and Representation:**\n   - I admired the diversity in the cast and their backgrounds, but this wasn’t enough to make me enjoy the book.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Decision to Continue the Series:**\n   - I struggled to finish the book and even considered not finishing—a rare occurrence for me.

Despite its flaws, the story has potential, and I might consider reading the sequel if I’m in the right mood.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

Shan and Isaac lack clarity in their motivations and personalities, making it difficult to grasp their true objectives.

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship among the central trio. Although the romance took more focus than I usually prefer, I appreciated their dynamics and found the sexual tension captivating. My main critique is that I struggled to understand the motivations of the two POV characters. Shan aimed to elevate her family's reputation and replace the King, but the specifics were vague. Meanwhile, Samuel was primarily focused on surviving in a new world. Both characters often felt passive, merely treading water instead of actively pursuing their goals. While passive characters can be intriguing, especially in a rigid society, I wanted clearer motivations—particularly from Shan, who was portrayed as ambitious and determined. It was unclear what she was truly striving for or how her actions connected to a larger plan.",

            "I was captivated by the magic system in this world; it was dark, seductive, and offered a fresh take on vampire lore. The worldbuilding in Aeravin, featuring the Unblooded and Blood Workers, was impressive. The dual perspectives of Samuel and Shan, hailing from opposite ends of the societal spectrum, effectively highlighted the stark inequalities within their society. As Samuel ascends, his horror at these contrasts deepens the narrative. The intersectionality of Shan and Isaac’s experiences adds richness and complexity, making the world feel authentic while addressing significant themes."

The worldbuilding of Aeravin, with its Unblooded and Blood Workers, was strong. Having two POV characters from opposite sides of the world effectively illustrated the societal inequality, especially as Samuel rises in the world and is horrified by the contrasts in their society. The intersectionality of Shan and Isaac’s specific experiences added depth and complexity to the world, making it feel more real and addressing important themes.\n\n- **Prose and Narrative Style:**  \n  The prose was good, though I felt there was a bit too much showing rather than telling. In a fantasy book with intricate worldbuilding, I prefer more explicit explanations to avoid confusion. That said, I think the author, Enright, could trust his readers a little more to grasp the nuances.\n\n- **Character Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n  I really enjoyed the central trio’s relationship. While there was more focus on the romance than I typically prefer in a book, I still appreciated their dynamics and found the sexual tension delicious.\n\n- **Character Goals and Agency:**  \n  My biggest critique is that I wasn’t entirely sure what either POV character wanted. Both Shan and Samuel had relatively vague goals—Shan aimed to raise her family’s reputation and replace the King (though it was unclear how), while Samuel focused on surviving the new world he was thrust into. However, they often seemed passive, treading water rather than actively pursuing their objectives. While passive characters can be interesting, especially in a strictly structured society, I wanted clearer motivations, particularly for Shan, who was set up as ambitious and determined. It was unclear what she was truly striving for or how her actions tied into a larger plan.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Despite the above critique, I still enjoyed the book, particularly the murder plotline. The ending felt well-judged and left me eager to pick up the next installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the novel engaging, with a compelling magic system, strong worldbuilding, and intriguing character dynamics.

The plot is a perfect blend of court intrigue, a murder mystery, and a richly developed world. The pacing is excellent, with rising tension and stakes that make it nearly impossible to put the book down.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world is ruled by Bloodworkers, who consume blood to gain power and control over others, while the Unblooded are oppressed and forced into hard labor. The dynamics of power, manipulation, and survival are intricately woven into the narrative, creating a fascinating and immersive setting.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The characters are deeply complex, with no clear distinction between good and bad. Shan is a compelling protagonist who knows how to navigate the political games of her world. Samuel, an Unblooded with a hidden dark power, adds another layer of intrigue. The shifting dynamics between characters, whether romantic or power-based, are captivating. The polyamorous romance involving Shan, Isaac, and Samuel is particularly well-written, adding depth and complexity to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book explores themes of power, manipulation, survival, and moral ambiguity. The tone is dark and intense, perfectly matching the high-stakes narrative and the morally gray characters.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is phenomenal, with vivid descriptions and sharp dialogue that bring the world and characters to life. The author’s ability to balance multiple plotlines and character arcs is impressive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an absolute masterpiece, combining a richly imagined world, complex characters, and a gripping plot. The blend of court intrigue, murder mystery, and polyamorous romance creates a story that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant.

The relationship dynamics are misrepresented as polyamorous, but they ultimately resemble a gay romance, leaving Shan marginalized.",

The story wrapped up too quickly, leaving several plotlines and character arcs underdeveloped. By the conclusion, the murder mystery aspect had nearly vanished, which was a letdown.

However, I felt that the characters lacked sufficient development; I wanted them to be more layered and complex, especially given the depth that a fantasy setting demands."

It’s beautifully gothic and perfectly captures the vibe of the story.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Relationships:**  \n  I loved the romance in this book. All three main characters had great chemistry, and their relationships felt natural and engaging. Even though I usually dislike love triangles, this one worked for me because of the strong vibes and connection between the characters.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The middle of the book was longer, but as a fan of slow burns, I didn’t mind it. However, the ending felt rushed, which was a major disappointment. The story wrapped up too quickly, leaving some plotlines and character arcs feeling underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Plot and Genre Execution:**  \n  The murder mystery aspect of the story became almost invisible by the end, which was a letdown. While I enjoyed the dark fantasy elements and the overall plot, I felt some components could have been stronger.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved the characters, but they didn’t get enough time or attention to fully develop. I wanted them to feel more layered and complex, especially in a fantasy setting where depth is crucial.  \n\n- **Debut Novel Considerations:**  \n  As a fantasy debut, I think the author did a commendable job. Fantasy is a challenging genre to write, and I’m willing to give grace for weaker areas like pacing and development. There’s clear potential for improvement in future installments.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend this book, especially to readers who enjoy dark fantasy with a touch of romance. While it’s not perfect, it’s a solid debut with room to grow, and I’m excited to see where the series goes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book for its vibes, romance, and dark fantasy elements.

The middle of the book drags, prioritizing arguments and plot mechanics over character-driven moments. The ending is particularly disappointing, as many plotlines remain unresolved, making the story feel more like a setup for future installments than a satisfying conclusion.",

Shan became more focused on plot-driven interactions with her brother and love interests, neglecting the exploration of her motives and inner world. Similarly, Samuel's ties to the Unblooded world felt unclear, which made it challenging to stay invested in his journey. Isaac emerged as a compelling character with his mysterious nature, but the impact of his role was lessened by Shan and Samuel's lack of depth, making it difficult to fully appreciate his significance.",

The magic system, revolving around Blood Workers and their use of blood for power, is both morbid and intriguing.

            "**Shan:** Smart and relatable, Shan makes understandable mistakes that feel true to her character. As a blood worker, she’s part of an intriguing magic system, though I hope for more details in the next book. **Samuel:** A compelling character with a secret power and hidden royal lineage, Samuel’s disdain for the nobility, stemming from his poor upbringing, is well portrayed. You can feel his frustration as he navigates his circumstances, and he rarely falls into the damsel trope. **Isaac:** The love interest for both Shan and Samuel, Isaac is the Royal Bloodworker. Although he doesn’t have POV chapters until the epilogue, his exhaustion and emotional depth are palpable. The romantic tension among the three is strong, and I’m hoping for a resolution that includes all of them (fingers crossed!).",

Her reading was phenomenal, and she had excellent source material to work with. If you’re going for the audiobook, this is the way to go—she slayed it.  \n\n- **Main Characters:**  \n  - **Shan:** She’s smart, relatable, and makes mistakes that feel understandable and in-character. As a blood worker, she’s part of a unique magic system that’s intriguing, though I wish there were more details about how it works (maybe in the next book?).  \n  - **Samuel:** He’s a compelling character with a secret power and a hidden royal lineage. His disdain for the nobility, rooted in his poor upbringing, is portrayed very well. You can feel his frustration as he navigates his circumstances, and he’s not a damsel (most of the time).  \n  - **Isaac:** The love interest for both Shan and Samuel, Isaac is the Royal Bloodworker. He doesn’t have POV chapters until the epilogue, but his exhaustion and emotional depth are palpable. The romantic tension between the three characters is strong, and I’m hoping for a threesome resolution (fingers crossed!).  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The blood magic system is fascinating—magic workers use blood to perform magic, and not everyone has this ability. While the mechanics aren’t deeply explored in this book, it’s clear that overuse of blood magic might have vampiric consequences, which adds an intriguing layer.  \n\n- **Villain:**  \n  The Eternal King is a formidable antagonist. He’s functionally immortal due to annual blood sacrifices and has no soul or moral compunctions. His treatment of the Unblooded (those without magic) as mere cattle is chilling and sets up a high-stakes conflict.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is well-crafted, with a good balance of character development and plot progression. The romantic subplot was almost resolved but was derailed for Plot Reasons, which left me eagerly anticipating the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a fantastic book with a unique magic system, compelling characters, and a gripping plot. The audiobook narration is exceptional, and I highly recommend it. I’m eagerly looking forward to the next installment, especially to see how the romantic dynamics and the conflict with the Eternal King unfold.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n10/10—would definitely recommend!"

The story centers on two main characters, Samuel and Shan, as they navigate a ruthless world of power struggles. Notably, the book subverts traditional gender roles: Shan exhibits traits typically associated with men, such as ruthlessness, while Samuel displays empathy and vulnerability, often seen as feminine traits. However, the slow pacing detracted from my overall enjoyment of the narrative.",

Her precarious position stems from her family's political scandal and her mixed heritage.

His empathetic and vulnerable nature stands in stark contrast to Shan's lethal ruthlessness. Both characters are well-developed and experience significant personal growth throughout the story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The book started off well and had an intriguing setup, but some parts felt flat throughout. It picked up again in the third act. The murder mystery aspect was particularly engaging, and I wish it had been the central focus of the plot. Instead, the story felt like two sub-plots combined, which diluted the overall impact. Personally, I would have preferred a more solid \"whodunit\" style plot over the political elements.  \n\n- **Themes and World-Building:**  \n  The story explores fascinating concepts, such as magic and vampire-like behaviors, and the societal structure is intriguing. The book also effectively highlights real-world issues through its narrative and world-building, adding depth and subtext to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n  The strong female main character (FMC), Shan LeClaire, is compelling, and her journey is central to the story. The book includes diverse representation, such as queer and trans characters, which adds richness to the narrative. The dynamics of the love triangle and the dual POVs were well-executed, though the romantic tension and slow-burn elements could have been more impactful.  \n\n- **Tropes and Genre Elements:**  \n  The book incorporates a variety of tropes, including politics, twins, kings/queens, magical powers, betrayal, and second-chance romance. While these elements added complexity, they sometimes felt overwhelming and detracted from the main plot.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  The conclusion of the murder mystery was satisfying, and the ending left me intrigued about what’s next for Shan. I’m curious to see where the series goes, especially given the cliffhanger-like ending.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book covers heavy topics, and I hope it includes a trigger warning section to prepare readers for sensitive content.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a mixed but ultimately engaging read. While the plot structure could have been more focused, the murder mystery and world-building were highlights. The diverse representation and thematic depth added layers to the story, and the ending left me eager for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75/4 ⭐️, 2 🌶️"

The story jumps days or weeks between chapters, which allows for some inference about relationship development, but I would have preferred more on-page exploration of these dynamics.

It would have been more effective if the triangle had been either fully explored or omitted altogether.",

            "The plot of this book was disappointingly slow, often requiring me to force myself to continue reading. Despite a promising start, where the first line hinted at potential, the story quickly lost momentum. Numerous side plots were introduced, but many remained underdeveloped, resulting in a disjointed narrative that was difficult to follow. I felt the book missed a valuable opportunity to delve deeper into the murders.",
            "The strongest aspect of the book is undoubtedly the characters. I was particularly drawn to Shan and her dual existence; her life in the shadows was captivating, and I found myself stressed for her throughout the story. I would love to see a prequel or novella exploring how she began this double life and discovered her birds.\n\nSamuel, on the other hand, was a more conflicted character. Living in the slums and struggling to survive, he ultimately chooses a noble path, but I was disappointed by how lost he seemed. Given his street smarts, I expected him to be a more astute player, which made his character confusing. I hope he finds his way in the sequel, as he is my favorite character and will serve as Shan’s moral compass.\n\nIsaac offers great representation, but I found it difficult to trust him, which made it harder to connect with him emotionally. Overall, many characters felt one-dimensional, making it challenging to fully invest in them. While I appreciated the relationships developing between Isaac, Samuel, and Shan, I felt they overshadowed other plot elements, leading to a somewhat disjointed narrative.",

It’s dark, full of lies, deceit, and mystery.  \n   - I enjoyed all the blood working and how the “magic” works.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The strongest part of the book was the characters.  \n   - I loved Shan and how she’s living two lives. I was stressed for her throughout the book! I think it is so intriguing when a character lives a double life. I was much more interested in her life living in the shadows. I would love a prequel or novella about how she started all that and found all her birds.  \n   - Samuel was a bit of a conflicting character. He’s living a life in the slums and trying to stay alive. Samuel ends up on the noble path, and I was disappointed that he was so lost. You would think, with all the street smarts, he would have been a smarter player. This is where I found his character confusing. I’m hoping he finds his way in the second book. He was my favorite character because he will be Shan’s moral compass.  \n   - Isaac is a character with great representation. I didn’t trust him throughout this book, and it was harder to love him. We will see what happens there.  \n   - In my opinion, most of these characters fell too flat for me. They were so one-dimensional that it made it hard to love them.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot of this book was so slow. There were times I had to force myself to jump back into this book. It had been a long time since anything had happened.  \n   - The beginning was so promising though because the first line felt like it would be so promising!  \n   - Throughout the book, we have many side plots, and several are not developed. It made the plot feel so disjointed and hard to keep up.  \n   - I missed the opportunity for them to really look into the murders.  \n\n- **Relationships:**  \n   - I liked the relationships stirring between Isaac, Samuel, and Shan.  \n   - I do think it took over a lot of the book. There were so many different things going on, and it felt flippant to their relationship status.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an okay read for me. I have read much better fantasies.

The Eternal King enlists two unlikely allies, Shan and Samuel, to hunt down the murderer. Shan, an ambitious Blood Worker, has ascended to power through the ruthless act of killing her family's patriarch. Meanwhile, Samuel, a bastard with a unique talent, becomes embroiled in the investigation after stumbling upon a drained body.",

This dynamic fuels a backdrop of civil unrest that grows throughout the narrative. While the blood-based magic system is captivating, I would have liked to see it employed in more innovative and practical ways. I look forward to future installments that delve deeper into this magic system and reveal its full potential."

            "I appreciated Shan as a character, but I felt she wasn't portrayed as the 'master manipulator' initially suggested. The backstory between Isaac and Shan was underexplored, which could have added depth. The romance fell flat for me; it felt like insta-love without any real development or depth. While the characters were visually appealing, that alone wasn't enough to engage me. The story had the potential for a compelling slow burn, but ultimately, the relationship dynamics lacked the necessary buildup, despite the plot's focus on the interactions among the three characters.",

Similarly, Samuel's magic is only touched upon superficially; we see the outcomes of his powers but not the journey of mastering them.

Their interactions and dynamics were well-developed and engaging, making this one of the story's strongest aspects.",

I hope the sequel addresses these issues with plotting and pacing.  \n\n- **Character Development and Action:**  \n  My biggest gripe was not getting to see the characters actively doing the things they were described as being capable of. For instance, Shan, who is portrayed as a political spy mastermind, doesn’t demonstrate much of her intelligence or cunning on-page—it’s mostly told rather than shown. Similarly, Samuel’s magic is rarely explored in depth; we only see the results of his powers, not the process of him learning to control them.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n  The relationships between the characters were a highlight of the book. Their interactions and dynamics were well-developed and engaging, making this one of the strongest aspects of the story.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  As a political fantasy, the book was disappointing, but as a romantasy, it worked much better. The dark, sexy vampire aesthetic—complete with silver claws and fancy dresses—was immaculate. The poly love triangle, though a bit insta-love-y, was enjoyable and added to the appeal.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  If you enjoyed *The Scarlet Alchemist*, you might like this book as well. Despite its flaws, I found it enjoyable enough to want to read the sequel once it’s released.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book struggled with pacing, plot depth, and on-page character action, it excelled in character relationships and delivered a compelling romantasy vibe. The dark, sexy aesthetic and engaging dynamics kept me invested, even if the political fantasy elements fell short. I’m hopeful the sequel will improve on the weaker aspects.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded up."

            "The characters are meticulously crafted, each driven by distinct motivations and often self-serving methods. Their inability to empathize with one another enriches the narrative, adding depth and complexity to their relationships and intensifying the story's tension. I look forward to seeing how they develop in future installments.",

Although the trope of a society divided between magic users and non-users is familiar, the author’s approach is chillingly realistic, deeply woven into the characters’ motives and actions.",

            "The book opens with an intriguing premise centered on blood magic and political intrigue, setting the stage for an action-packed narrative. However, the story quickly becomes bogged down in dialogue, with lengthy sections lacking significant developments. The pacing feels uneven, and the initial setup could have been more dynamic to sustain reader engagement. The protagonist's role as a secret spy investigating a series of brutal murders in the city feels clichéd and unoriginal. By the end, the story comes across as generic, despite its potential for uniqueness, likely due to the familiarity of revolution-themed fantasies. The twists are predictable, partly due to a small cast that limits opportunities for surprises or betrayals.",
            "The characters were well-developed and had great depth, which I truly appreciated. However, the romance felt underdeveloped, relying on an insta-love trope that lacked sufficient buildup. While the dynamic between Isaac and Shan was compelling, Samuel's introduction felt abrupt and out of place. Although the characters themselves were strong, their interactions could have been crafted more effectively to enhance the overall story.",
            "The exploration of blood magic and its influence on the trans character's identity was a highlight for me. However, the world-building tended to rely on exposition rather than immersive storytelling; for instance, we were informed about the power of blood workers and the king's brutality, but these elements were seldom demonstrated in action."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I enjoyed the book and loved the depth of the characters, particularly the inclusion of a trans character and the exploration of their identity through blood magic. However, the plot and pacing fell flat, and the story felt generic despite its potential. The romance and character interactions could have been better developed, and the world-building needed more showing rather than telling.",

It lived up to this promise with vivid descriptions and a deep dive into dark, gruesome details.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Shan, the main character, is a manipulative noblewoman with a clear mission to protect her brother and restore her family’s honor.  \n  - Samuel is a good-hearted but conflicted character, burdened by what he perceives as a liability.  \n  - Isaac is a greedy, ambitious man who has worked hard to achieve his status.  \n  - The characters’ differing goals and methods create compelling dynamics, and the hints of deep attraction between them suggest the potential for a polyamorous relationship, which seems to be set up for exploration in the sequel.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The lack of blood magic involvement was a letdown. Despite most characters being blood workers, there wasn’t enough detail or background about this forbidden practice. While its power and duality (capable of both good and evil) were mentioned, it felt underexplored. I hope this is addressed more in the next book.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  This was a great debut novel that delved into a dark and gruesome world. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to reading more in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the underdeveloped blood magic system, *Mistress of Lies* is a strong debut with a gripping opening, well-crafted characters, and a dark, immersive tone. The potential for future exploration of relationships and magic makes me eager for the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

She is a compelling character, driven by a misguided belief that her actions are for her brother, even as she neglects to communicate with him or recognize his own rebellious efforts. Her fixation on manipulating the system and her disdain for those who resort to more extreme measures reveal her flawed perspective.

            "I appreciated that the love triangle in the story was a true triangle rather than a tripod, but I still find love triangles unappealing overall. Unfortunately, this one was poorly executed; the third character often vanished whenever the other two were together, regardless of the context. While the relationship seemed to be leaning toward polyamory—a concept I support—the portrayal felt unrealistic. It’s hard to believe that people would simply forget about another person for the sake of convenience, especially since comparisons are so natural. The story oversimplified a complex situation, which felt like a narrative shortcut.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Magic System:**  \n  The blood-based magic was intriguing and initially drew me into the book. However, I felt it lacked sufficient development, which left me wanting more by the end.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Shan is a compelling protagonist with a strong personality. Her determination to do whatever it takes to achieve her goals made her a fascinating character to follow. The supporting characters, including Isaac (a childhood friend) and Samuel (a key figure in her schemes), added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The book starts strong with a promising setup, including a murder mystery subplot. However, the main plot involving the murders takes a backseat for a significant portion of the book, as the focus shifts to the relationships between Shan, Isaac, and Samuel. This shift left me wishing the murder mystery had been more consistently integrated into the narrative.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The book excels in its diverse representation, featuring a transmasc character, multiple mixed-race characters, and a polyamorous relationship. This inclusivity was a standout aspect of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some shortcomings, I enjoyed the book by the end and am curious to see where the story goes next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong start and featured a fascinating protagonist, the underdeveloped magic system and the sidelining of the murder mystery plot were notable drawbacks. However, the diverse representation and engaging characters made it an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

In contrast, Shan was perplexing; her contradictory views and behavior created a sense of confusion. While I initially enjoyed the dynamic between the characters, it eventually devolved into an instant love scenario with a love triangle, which isn't my preference. Still, I believe Samuel's eagerness and openness may be rooted in his history of loneliness.",

There is no gradual build-up into the world, and this lack of development persists throughout the novel.  \n  - The world itself is incredibly interesting, with political intrigue and unique elements like vampires that are not explicitly defined as such, leaving room for curiosity and interpretation.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The relationship between Shan and the main male characters felt rushed, transitioning from instant lust to love without feeling authentic.  \n  - More time spent on plotting and training could have allowed for a more natural development of relationships and character dynamics.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  - The novel seems to be setting up for a duology, but the reviewer would have preferred knowing if it were a trilogy to allow for deeper exploration of the characters and their arcs.  \n  - The pacing felt uneven, with certain elements (like training and plotting) being glossed over, which could have added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n  - The reviewer acknowledges the author's potential and expresses a desire to see them continue to improve their storytelling and writing abilities.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel presents an intriguing world with political intrigue and unique supernatural elements, the lack of gradual world-building and rushed character relationships detracted from the overall experience. The reviewer appreciates the author's potential and hopes for more depth and development in future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They were engaging and kept me invested in the story.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was lacking. While I didn’t expect to be spoon-fed information, certain elements felt glossed over, while others were repeated too often. For example, the Eternal King is introduced as immortal, but there’s no deeper exploration of his history, significance, or how he became immortal. Similarly, Blood Working, a type of magic, is mentioned, but its intricacies and rules are not well-explained.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance started off as \"insta-lust,\" which I found a bit off-putting. The characters meet and, within a few pages, are already considering kissing or removing clothes. However, the romance improved and became more enjoyable by the middle of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I had a mixed experience with this book.

However, the middle of the book was draggy, and the investigations often led to little to no progression, making the pacing uneven.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The chemistry between the trio was excellent, with palpable tension that added depth to their interactions.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending was lackluster, though the last few chapters were great. The cliffhanger in the epilogue felt forced, as if it was written solely as bait for a sequel.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Expectations:**  \n  This book wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t mind-blowingly good either. I expected more, especially since it was one of my most anticipated reads of the year. That said, it’s not bad for a debut book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong start with a unique concept, engaging suspense, and great character dynamics, it struggled with pacing in the middle and delivered a lackluster ending.

While the lack of intelligence can be somewhat excused, as it reflects a common trope in female characters, the absence of rage is particularly disappointing.

It explores messy, complicated relationships, has some political intrigue and unrest, and an interesting take on vampirism with blood magic as the root.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The story kicks off with an amazing opening chapter that hooks you. However, I found myself disengaging at times because much of the story seemed to progress off-page, and we were just being told about it happening rather than experiencing it firsthand.  \n\n- **Character Motivations and Development:**  \n  I found Samuel’s motivations to be very conflicting at times. It was jarring how easily he agreed to work with Shan, which led to a bit of insta-love and attraction that I did not vibe with. I preferred the slower progression of their relationship over time.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some issues, I enjoyed the story overall. It was a solid debut with a lot of potential.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a strong debut with an intriguing premise, blending messy relationships, political intrigue, and a unique take on vampirism. While the pacing and character motivations had some flaws, the story was engaging enough to keep me interested.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars"

A major plot point involving a series of murders, which two main characters (Shan and Samuel) were supposed to investigate, was frustrating because they spent little time actually investigating.  \n\n- **Prose Style:**  \n  The prose felt overdone, with sentences that were difficult to follow, requiring rereading for clarity.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The concept of \"blood working\" was intriguing but underdeveloped. I would have liked to see more exploration and explanation of this idea.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were underdeveloped, which made the love triangle feel unrewarding. While I appreciated the biracial, female protagonist and her struggles with racism, sexism, and microaggressions, as well as the trans representation in Isaac, I wished the author had done more with Isaac’s character evolution.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The book tackled important themes like racism, sexism, classism, and authoritarianism, which I appreciated. The representation of a biracial, female protagonist and a trans character (Isaac) was a highlight.  \n\n- **Editing:**  \n  There were multiple typos, which, while not the author’s fault, were distracting and annoying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong opening and tackled important themes with commendable representation, it ultimately didn’t work for me due to its thin plot, underdeveloped characters, and overdone prose. However, it might appeal to readers looking for a fantasy with an uncomplicated plot, attractive characters, and moderately spicy scenes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the pacing became boring and challenging at points.  \n  - The author tried to incorporate too many elements at once, which detracted from the overall success of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - The characters lacked chemistry, and the romance felt shallow and unconvincing.  \n  - The love triangle was refreshingly unique (all three characters liked each other instead of the typical two-boys-one-girl dynamic), but it wasn’t enough to save the lack of depth in the relationships.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing felt lackluster as the story progressed, which made it harder to stay engaged.  \n  - While the book wasn’t difficult to understand, the execution of the writing didn’t live up to the potential of the premise.  \n\n- **Focus and Execution:**  \n  - The story would have been stronger if the author had focused more on the fantasy elements and solving the murders, rather than trying to juggle too many themes and subplots.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its promising premise and unique elements, the book ultimately fell short of my expectations. The lack of character chemistry, shallow romance, and overambitious plot execution made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The concept of blood working felt somewhat vague and could have been developed further.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I liked the main characters enough, but I didn’t feel like I got too much depth from them. The book had a habit of telling me what I should feel about the characters, but I’m not sure I ever truly connected with them emotionally.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The spicier scenes felt a bit random to me and didn’t seem to contribute much to the overall plot. They seemed out of place and didn’t enhance the story as much as they could have.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  Overall, I think this series has good potential, but this particular book was somewhat underwhelming. It didn’t fully deliver on what it could have been.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some interesting elements, such as the magic system and the main characters, it fell short in terms of depth, emotional connection, and plot cohesion. The series shows promise, but this installment left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The relationship aspect took up too much space, overshadowing these critical parts.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Samuel gains his power too quickly, and I didn’t fully understand the power system, especially by the end. Shan is described as cunning and clever but ends up being manipulated by everyone and fails to see the obvious.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The timing was ill-paced, and some chapters felt unrelated and unfinished.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws in plot development, pacing, and character depth, the novel was still a nice read due to its beautiful writing style.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

            "The story masterfully maintains tension and intrigue, especially through its political maneuvering. It strikes a commendable balance between political intrigue, romance, and character development.",
            "The romance features a well-balanced and compelling polyamorous relationship between Shan, Samuel, and Issac. Each character is engaging, and their dynamics are thoughtfully developed. Although Issac doesn't have a POV chapter until the epilogue, he stands out as a favorite, leaving room for further exploration in future stories.",
            "The book presents Bloodworkers, a unique take on vampires, who possess the ability to control blood rather than exhibiting traditional traits like fangs or nocturnal habits. This concept leans more towards blood magic than vampirism, which is misleading given the book's marketing as a vampire story. Additionally, Bloodworking is underutilized throughout the narrative, resulting in limited and lackluster demonstrations of this intriguing ability.",
            "The story presents an intriguing premise centered on Shan LeClaire, the daughter of a disgraced family who murders her father to reclaim her family's power and becomes the spymaster for the Eternal King. Alongside her is Samuel Hutchinson, a deuteragonist grappling with a dark and dangerous ability. His life is upended when Shan discloses vital information. Meanwhile, Issac De la Cruz, the Eternal King’s right-hand man, collaborates with Shan to track down a serial killer and assist Samuel in managing his powers."

        "conclusion": "*Mistress of Lies* is a political fantasy that delivers heavily on intrigue and character dynamics, though it may disappoint readers expecting a traditional vampire story. The concept of Bloodworkers feels more like blood magic than vampirism, and the underutilization of this ability is a drawback. However, the well-crafted political schemes, compelling characters, and balanced romance make it an enjoyable read. I give it four stars and remain optimistic about the potential for more intense storytelling and character development in the sequel.",

Despite this, it set up the next book nicely, and I’m looking forward to reading the sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Mistress of Lies* is an engaging read with strong character dynamics and a romance-forward plot. While the worldbuilding and magic system could have been more developed, the story sets up an intriguing foundation for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story begins with Shan murdering her lord father to seize power through blood magic, establishing a backdrop of political intrigue and treachery in a vampiric court. The narrative alternates between the perspectives of Shan and Samuel, while Isaac plays a significant yet underexplored role. I found the dual viewpoints engaging but felt that Isaac's perspective could have added depth. The synopsis and first chapter were captivating, but the pacing faltered afterward, leading me to become more invested in the characters than the overarching storyline.",
            "Shan excels in political intrigue, while Samuel, despite lacking blood magic, wields his own sinister power. Their dynamic is captivating as they maneuver through the perilous court. The emotionally charged love triangle involving Shan, Isaac, and Samuel heightens the story's tension.",
            "The world-building was insufficient, relying heavily on established vampire lore instead of delving into unique aspects like blood magic. Although some details about blood magic were introduced later, they felt superficial, leaving me with more questions than answers about its true mechanics.",

            "While I appreciate the representation and the characterization of the main protagonists, I found the romance between the characters lacking depth; it felt more like lust than love, diminishing the impact of the climax. Some character decisions, particularly Shan's, seemed unconvincing, as I expected her to be more selfish. Additionally, I would have liked to see more development from secondary characters like Anton and the villain.",
