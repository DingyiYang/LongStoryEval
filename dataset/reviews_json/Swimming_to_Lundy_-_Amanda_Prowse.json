            "The novel skillfully alternates between Tawrie's story in 2024 and Harriet's in 2004, effectively engaging the reader in both narratives. However, the beginning felt slow, and the overly detailed ending made the conclusion drag on.",
            "Tawrie's character is initially hard to connect with due to her disdain for her mother and dismissive attitude toward her grandmother's support. However, her coming-of-age journey is ultimately satisfying. Harriet is a well-developed character, and her diary offers valuable insight into her struggles, which significantly influence Tawrie's life. Hugo is also a well-realized character, enriching the narratives of more sympathetic figures like Harriet, Bear, and Dilly. Bear and Dilly's thoughtful reactions to their parents' marital issues add emotional depth to the story.",
            "While the story had its strengths, some repetitive phrases were jarring, and the use of modern language by older characters—such as Jago saying “for” instead of “about”—felt awkward.",

            "I wasn't a fan of the introduction of Harriet's POV in 2002. For a long time, it felt disconnected and included one of my pet peeves: cheating. Harriet's diary entries and chapters were quite depressing, and while the eventual connection became clear, I could have done without them. The present POV also featured cheating, a love triangle, and an insta-love vibe, which further diminished my enjoyment. \n\nAdditionally, there were several math errors throughout the book, particularly regarding dates and ages. For instance, Tawrie was eight when her father died in 2002 and twenty-eight in 2024, yet the tragedy is repeatedly referred to as occurring twenty years ago. These inconsistencies were distracting, though I didn't let them affect my rating. \n\nThe blurb led me to expect *Swimming To Lundy* to be an uplifting story about a character pursuing her dreams, but it turned out to be heavily focused on family drama and conflict, which was a major disappointment for me, as I'm not a fan of that genre. The story felt overloaded with negativity and exaggerated conflicts, making it difficult for me to enjoy.",
            "In this story, the protagonist, Tawrie, grapples with significant personal challenges, including the death of her father at eight, an alcoholic mother who hinders her progress, and her own self-doubt about pursuing her dreams. While these themes have the potential to be compelling, the excessive drama and implausible resolutions ultimately create an unbalanced narrative. The abrupt, happy endings for all characters feel contrived and unrealistic.",

The advertised focus on Tawrie finding herself, her family dynamic with her mother, and coping with grief was not the main focus of the story. Instead, the inclusion of an insta-love story and an unexpected POV detracted from the intended narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book took too long to get going, with the story only picking up around 200 pages in. The overall length felt excessive, with too much filler content that dampened the impact of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The character of 'Ed' was unlikable, and it was hard to understand why Tawrie was drawn to him. The family drama on Ed's side felt unnecessary and overshadowed the more poignant elements of the story, such as Tawrie's grief over losing her father.  \n\n- **Themes and Content Warnings:**  \n  The central element of cheating was a significant part of the story but was not mentioned in the blurb, which was disappointing. This omission felt misleading and could have been addressed upfront.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book had some strong scenes that showed potential. However, these moments were overshadowed by the unnecessary subplots and filler content.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had potential but fell short due to its misalignment with the blurb, excessive length, and unnecessary subplots.
