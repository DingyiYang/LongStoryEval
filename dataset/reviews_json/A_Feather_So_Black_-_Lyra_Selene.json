            "The romance was enjoyable, though it could have been more effectively crafted. The love triangle and relationship dynamics enriched the narrative, while the protagonist’s journey of self-discovery and self-love was compelling and relatable.

The writing is engaging and immersive, although some Gaelic terms prove challenging to pronounce without referencing the appendix at the end.",
            "The world-building is rich and detailed, emphasizing fae and magical elements. The incorporation of changelings and Celtic-inspired terminology adds to the immersive experience, though some terms can be difficult to pronounce.",

With elements of fae, magic, changelings, and betrayal, it ultimately explores the journey of self-love. In a genre saturated with similar motifs, this fae-inspired fantasy stands out for its unique storytelling.",

However, the dynamic between Fia and Rogan was both realistic and heartfelt, beautifully portraying their journey from childhood friends to adult companions. The romance was steamy but not overdone, with just the right amount of spice in a few memorable scenes.

            "Throughout the book, I found myself questioning its direction and how it would conclude, and the ending truly took me by surprise. I’m thrilled about the sequel, as I still have many questions regarding the main character’s past and the aftermath of the story's conclusion. The sneak peek at the end only heightened my anticipation! \n\nWith an engaging mix of quests, Faerie curses, complex family dynamics, and forbidden romance, I was captivated from start to finish. While it took about 100 pages for me to fully immerse myself, once I did, I couldn’t put the book down. \n\nIn hindsight, I wish I'd paid closer attention to the table of contents; the glossary at the back would have been beneficial for understanding the Irish terms, especially early on as I was getting oriented.",
            "A strong, relatable, and flawed narrative.",
            "**Refined Review:**\n\n*A Feather So Black* is a captivating romantasy, rich in lush prose and immersive world-building, woven with elements of forbidden romance and Celtic mythology. With its dark fairytale atmosphere, the narrative is deeply character-driven, focusing on the intricacies of love and desire.",
            "This book evokes the enchanting vibes of \"Howl's Moving Castle\" while also establishing its unique identity. The two main characters, Fia and Irian, struck me as reminiscent of Jude and Cardan, which I absolutely adore. Irian, in particular, reminds me of a blend of Cardan and Jacks, and I’m completely smitten!",
            "My heart was breaking, and a part of me wanted to shatter the world with it. I loved every aspect of this story. The ending was especially surprising, featuring two major plot twists that left me truly shocked."

I feel I’ll be thinking about it and these characters for a long time.  \n  - The first half of the book had me hoping for a happy ending for Fia and Rogan, despite the circumstances.  \n  - The narrative explores difficult choices, such as being forced to choose between the people who shaped us and the places we call home, or doing things that cause suffering for those we care about.  \n\n- **Anticipation for the Sequel:**  \n  - The second book is highly anticipated, and I’m eager to see what Fia—and Selene—will do next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* is a masterfully written romantasy that combines lush prose, complex characters, and a heart-wrenching plot. It’s a story that stays with you, leaving you emotionally shattered yet eager for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The love triangle (or square) was engaging—I have a weakness for stories where a rekindled romance clashes with a new attraction.

            "This book offers a captivating retelling of the Swan Lake fairy tale, infused with elements of fae, magic, and an enchanting, eerie forest atmosphere. It follows Fia, a changeling trained as the queen’s assassin, on a quest to break a curse, steal a treasure, and restore magic to the human realm. As the story unfolds, Fia unravels the mysteries of the fae world and the stakes involved. However, the ending felt rushed; events occurred too quickly to fully grasp, and the final scene remained unclear until I read the sneak peek of the next book.",
            "Fia is a willful, sharp-edged character who balances her earnestness with a charming naivety that leads to questionable decisions, all of which feel justified. While Rogan, Irian, and Eala play significant roles, they are less developed in comparison to Fia. Corra, the fae household beastie, shines as a standout character. Irian brings a captivating \"who did this to you?\" intensity, and the love triangle, while present, remains refreshingly subtle rather than overbearing.",
            "The prose is enchanting, featuring beautifully crafted lines that deserve to be savored. While I don’t usually focus on writing quality, it truly stood out in this work.",
            "This book is dark, atmospheric, and haunting, featuring a stunning setting, enchanting botanical magic, and monstrous Celtic-inspired fae and creatures. Its vibes evoke comparisons to The Shepherd King Duology, which is high praise indeed."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *A Feather So Black* is a dark, atmospheric, and enchanting read with a compelling protagonist and a richly imagined fae world. While the character development of secondary characters could be stronger and the ending felt rushed, the book’s vibes, writing, and Fia’s journey of self-discovery made it a fantastic experience. I’m eagerly anticipating the rest of the trilogy.",

            "The story's slow pacing effectively facilitates a rich exploration of the magical lands and Fia's development. The Full Moon serves as a convenient plot device for time jumps, adding intrigue without feeling forced.",
            "Fia’s journey from a tool for others to embracing her fae heritage is truly rewarding. Although I’m not usually a fan of love triangles, it provided a period of growth for her. Rogan's unsettling character effectively challenged Fia's vulnerabilities, while Irian, the fae villain, adds intrigue with his slow-burn romance with Fia, perfectly balancing the story’s darker themes. The romance is tastefully spicy, enhancing the narrative without overshadowing Fia’s character development. Overall, the blend of romance and plot strikes a perfect chord for fans of romantasy.",
            "The world-building in this story is exceptional, seamlessly blending dark enchantment with Celtic folklore. The vivid descriptions of Tír na nÓg and Dun Duragh create a whimsical yet perilous atmosphere. Additionally, the attention to seasonal changes and their influence on Fia’s character adds significant depth to the narrative.",
            "The villains were expertly crafted and surprising, eliciting a wide range of emotions. Their actions, particularly those of individuals who professed to love Fia, added depth and tension to the narrative."

The setup, featuring Fia, a changeling with no memories, striving to earn the love of her foster mother, the Queen, was captivating. The power dynamics and Fia’s naive need for validation were compelling and set the stage for her journey.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The world-building was exceptional, blending dark enchantment with Celtic folklore. The contrasting environments of Tír na nÓg and Dun Duragh were vividly described, creating a whimsical yet deadly atmosphere. The attention to seasonal changes and their impact on Fia’s character added depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  The slow pacing of the story worked well, allowing for detailed exploration of the magical lands and Fia’s growth. The use of the Full Moon as a plot device for time jumps was convenient but didn’t feel forced, maintaining intrigue and allure throughout.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Fia’s evolution from a weapon for others to embracing her fae heritage was deeply rewarding. The love triangle, while not my favorite trope, served as a growth period for Fia. Rogan’s character, though unsettling, effectively tested Fia’s vulnerabilities. Irian, the fae villain, was fascinating, and the slow-burn romance between him and Fia was delightful and well-balanced with the story’s darker elements.\n\n- **Romance and Spice:**  \n  The romance was tastefully spicy, with scenes that enhanced the story without overshadowing Fia’s character growth. The balance between romance and plot was perfect for fans of romantasy.\n\n- **Villains and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The villains were well-written and shocking, evoking a range of emotions. Their actions, even from those who claimed to love Fia, added layers of complexity and tension to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a darkly enchanting tale with rich world-building, compelling character development, and a well-balanced blend of romance and intrigue. Fia’s journey from a manipulated weapon to a self-determined individual is both rewarding and addictive.

            "The plot is both original and compelling, evoking a nostalgic charm akin to childhood fairytales. Blending whimsy, romance, and heartbreak, it beautifully charts Fia’s journey of self-discovery as she seeks to escape being manipulated by others. The story effectively incorporates elements like ancient curses, trust challenges, and a love triangle.

The love triangle, which I usually dislike, was surprisingly well-executed. Though I was ready to move on from Rogan before Fia, I appreciated her internal struggle. Irian, in contrast, was a delightful character, and I wished their relationship had been developed earlier and explored more deeply.",

The audiobook narration was outstanding and enhanced the experience. I highly recommend this book to fans of magical realms, lore, and beautifully crafted storytelling.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot (4.75/5):**  \n  The plot was original and powerful, evoking a sense of nostalgia reminiscent of childhood fairytales. It was whimsical, romantic, and heartbreakingly beautiful, with a focus on Fia’s journey of self-discovery and breaking free from being a pawn in others’ schemes. The story included elements like ancient curses, trust challenges, and a love triangle, which were well-executed. However, the pacing between full moons sometimes felt slow, with not much progress happening other than Rogan and Fia’s intimate moments.  \n\n- **Characters (5/5):**  \n  Fia was a beautifully written character with complex traits and quirks that made her instantly endearing. Her growth throughout the book was a joy to follow. The love triangle was surprisingly well-done, even though I typically dislike this trope. While I was over Rogan before Fia was, I understood her struggle. Irian, on the other hand, was a delightful character, and I wished his relationship with Fia had been developed sooner and explored more deeply.  \n\n- **World Building (5/5):**  \n  The magical world was immersive and richly detailed, filled with lore, curses, and scheming. The whimsical and beautiful storytelling transported me to a realm that felt both enchanting and treacherous.  \n\n- **Romance (3/5):**  \n  The romance was a mixed bag. While the love triangle was well-written, the relationship between Fia and Irian felt underdeveloped and could have been explored more. The intimate scenes between Fia and Rogan, though present, sometimes overshadowed other potential developments in the story.  \n\n- **Spice (2/5):**  \n  The spice level was relatively low, with a few intimate scenes that didn’t add much to the overall plot. I would have preferred more meaningful interactions or developments during these moments.  \n\n- **Writing (5/5):**  \n  The writing was phenomenal, with beautiful and whimsical storytelling that drew out a wide range of emotions. The narrative was engaging and kept me hooked until the very end.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration (1000/5):**  \n  The audiobook narration was exceptional. The narrator brought the story to life, especially with the Celtic name pronunciations, which I would have struggled with otherwise. The last 20% of the book was so enjoyable that I dreaded finishing it, but I couldn’t stop because I needed to know how it ended.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a powerful, whimsical, and emotionally resonant read that I absolutely loved.

            "**Fia:** Raised to be a weapon, Fia's trusting nature aligns with her character arc. Having only experienced manipulative love, she confuses genuine care for true affection. **The Queen:** From the outset, I despised the queen. She embodies the traits of Mother Gothel and Frollo, manipulating Fia into believing she deserves nothing more and treating her as a mere tool. **Rogan:** He genuinely cares for Fia but struggles to navigate their relationship. His connection to Eala complicates matters; while he loves part of Fia, he fails to defend her fully against others. **Eala:** A morally ambiguous character, Eala is as manipulated as Fia but possesses the cunning to fight back. Her own agenda is clear, with red flags apparent from the beginning. **Irian:** He fits the \"shadow daddy\" archetype, but I felt his character lacked depth. The romance features a moderate level of spice, rated at .5.",
            "The world-building is rich, intricate, and captivating, making every corner of this realm resonate with a sense of history. Folklore and historical elements are seamlessly integrated, skillfully avoiding clunky info dumps.

I loved every mini-story Fia and Irian told each other, and the love story between Fia and Rogan in the fortress was beautiful. However, the pacing dragged slightly around the 3/4ths mark but picked up quickly afterward.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - **Fia:** Raised to be a weapon, Fia is too trusting, but this makes sense given her arc. She has only known manipulative love, so when someone shows genuine care, she mistakes it for real love.  \n  - **The Queen:** I hated the queen from the beginning. She gives off Mother Gothel/Frollo vibes, manipulating Fia into thinking she doesn’t deserve more and treating her as a tool or weapon.  \n  - **Rogan:** He genuinely cares for Fia but is clueless about how to handle their relationship. His fate is tied to Eala, which complicates things. While he loves a side of Fia, he can’t love all of her, as seen when he doesn’t fully defend her against others.  \n  - **Eala:** A morally gray character, Eala is just as manipulated as Fia but cunning enough to fight back. She has her own agenda, and her red flags are evident from the start.  \n  - **Irian:** He’s a “shadow daddy” type, but I felt his character could have been more fleshed out.  \n\n- **Spice:**  \n  The romance has a moderate level of spice, rated at 🌶️🌶️.5.  \n\n- **World Building:**  \n  The world-building is lush, detailed, and immersive.

            "Fia is an outstanding female main character whose development throughout the story is truly captivating. Her journey toward self-love and embracing her identity, especially after entering the fae world, is beautifully portrayed. Rogan, however, left me feeling conflicted. While there were moments I liked him, his insensitivity—such as when he remarked, “I wish you wouldn’t do that” regarding Fia's Greenmark—made me question the depth of his love for her. Eala, the antagonist, is complex and intriguing; I sensed her manipulative nature early on, and her shocking actions, like controlling Rogan and harboring resentment toward her mother, added depth to her character. The relationship between Fia and Rogan is engaging, but it's evident he isn't her endgame. His struggle to fully accept Fia for who she is is particularly poignant.

As one of my favorite ballets, of course I had to read this book.  \n\n- **Main Character:**  \n  Our main character, Fia, is a changeling. Swapped for a human princess as a child, Fia is raised by the human High Queen to be her spy and weapon. Fia was a wonderful main character. I felt for her and wanted so badly for her to have her happy ending.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Magic System:**  \n  The magic system was really fun. The way Fia uses her magic was really interesting. How she grows into it was one of my favorite parts of the story.  \n\n- **Romance and Tropes:**  \n  We have curses, a tragic fae ‘shadow daddy’, a prince, magic, and plenty of romance with spice. There is a love triangle, and I normally really dislike that trope, but it’s so good here. It makes sense to the story. It becomes obvious towards the middle who Fia is meant to be with.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  The ending was perfect. I was glad it left off where it did, though I am still very excited for the second book. I can’t wait to get back to this world and find out what happens next for Fia and everyone else after that ending.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I’ve read a lot of really good books this year, but so far this one is definitely one of my top reads.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a strong start to a new series, delivering a magical and romantic fantasy with a unique retelling of Swan Lake. The compelling main character, engaging magic system, and well-executed love triangle make it a standout read. The ending leaves readers eager for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

Her journey is strong, messy, and authentic as she navigates self-doubt, conflicting emotions, and a complicated relationship with her foster mother. The secondary characters are also well-crafted, each with unique motivations and flaws. The interactions between Fia and Irian, the dark fae lord, are particularly engaging, adding depth to the narrative through their shared stories. The romance is a central element, featuring a love square that introduces complexity and tension.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel creates an immersive, atmospheric fae world rooted in Celtic folklore. The setting, Tír na nÓg, is described as a dark, enchanted forest filled with mythical monsters, deceptive fae, and treacherous elements. It’s not a whimsical, candy-coated realm but rather a Grimm-esque environment that feels delightfully treacherous. The glossary at the back is helpful for those unfamiliar with Celtic pronunciations.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The character development is excellent, particularly for Fia, the protagonist. Her arc is strong, messy, and real, as she grapples with self-doubt, conflicting emotions, and her complex relationship with her foster mother. Secondary characters are also well-developed, with their own unique motivations and flaws. The interactions between Fia and Irian, the dark fae lord, are particularly compelling, as they share stories that add depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is engaging, though some reviewers noted it can feel slow in places, especially in the first part. However, the story picks up significantly in Parts 2 and 3, leading to an exciting and satisfying ending. The quest to break the curse, free the princess, and retrieve the enchanted sword is filled with tension, treachery, and moral dilemmas.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance is a key element, featuring a love square (rather than a traditional triangle) that adds complexity and tension. Fia’s feelings are realistically messy, torn between duty, history, and her attraction to both Rogan and Irian. While the broody, morally grey male love interest trope is common in Romantasy, it’s executed well here, with Irian being a standout character.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is beautiful and lyrical, evoking a sense of nostalgia for childhood fairytales. The inclusion of stories within stories adds depth and layers to the narrative, likely setting the stage for the next book. The audiobook narration by Heather O’Sullivan is particularly praised for capturing Fia’s voice and handling the Celtic pronunciations with ease.\n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The novel explores themes of self-discovery, betrayal, and the balance between light and dark. It incorporates familiar fantasy tropes—such as the quest, enemies to lovers, and morally grey characters—but gives them fresh, original spins. The dark fairytale feel is consistent throughout, with a good balance of spice and emotional depth.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* is a captivating dark fairytale that blends Celtic folklore, romantic tension, and a richly atmospheric fae world.

The storytelling is masterful, striking an ideal balance of intrigue, emotion, and action.",
            "**Fia:** Fia, the changeling girl, is a profoundly tragic and compelling protagonist. Raised in a world that despises non-humans, she becomes a weapon, yet her yearning for love and acceptance is heart-wrenching. The depth of her portrayal made me sympathize with her intensely, rooting for her happiness above all others. \n\n**Rogan:** Rogan, the princeling, fulfills his role as Fia's best friend and occasional lover but never felt like a suitable endgame for her. His tendency to refer to her as “changeling” came across as dismissive, and ultimately, he lacked the strength of character that Irian possesses.\n\n**Irian:** Irian, on the other hand, is a strong, brooding figure marked by a tragic past. His resilience and complexity captured my admiration, and his dynamic with Fia—filled with playful banter, secrets, and mutual respect—was beautifully crafted. I found myself constantly worried for him yet utterly captivated by his presence. The romance between Fia and Irian is tender, passionate, and deeply satisfying. Their witty banter and genuine connection are based on seeing one another for who they truly are, transcending their identities. The juxtaposition of the toxic found family theme with the pure found soulmate storyline adds layers of complexity to their relationships, making the narrative all the more compelling.",
            "This book is a masterpiece, with every sentence crafted to perfection. The prose is vivid, sharp, and tender, fully immersing me in its world. The author's descriptions are so rich that it feels as if she has truly lived in this setting. Although the novel felt a bit wordy at first, by the 20% mark, I was completely captivated by the writing, particularly the setting descriptions, which I typically don't enjoy but found myself savoring here.",
            "The worldbuilding draws inspiration from Celtic mythology, creating a fresh and unique backdrop. I was captivated by the rich setting, engaging characters, and the author's compelling narrative voice. The seamless integration of these elements results in a truly immersive experience."

        "conclusion": "*A Feather So Black* is a masterpiece of dark fairytales, fae romance, and self-love. With its stunning prose, unique worldbuilding, and deeply compelling characters, it’s a must-read for fans of *The Cruel Prince* and anyone who loves stories with wit, heart, and soul. A talented author has established themselves as a new queen of fae romance, and I can’t wait for the next release.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Writing Style and Prose:**  \n  The book is perfection, with not a single imperfect sentence. The prose is vivid, sharp, and tender, immersing the reader in the world. The author’s descriptions of the environment are so vivid it feels as though she lived in that world. Initially, the novel felt wordy, but by the 20% mark, I fell completely in love with the writing, especially the setting descriptions, which I usually don’t enjoy but found myself savoring here.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is inspired by Celtic mythology, which feels fresh and unique. I fell in love with this world, its characters, and the compelling voice of the story. The author masterfully weaves the setting, characters, and plot into a cohesive and immersive experience.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - **Fia:** Fia, the changeling girl, is a deeply tragic yet compelling protagonist. Her upbringing in a cruel world where non-humans are hated shaped her into a weapon, and her longing for love and acceptance is heart-wrenching. Her portrayal is so well-done that I felt deeply for her and rooted for her happiness more than any other character.  \n  - **Rogan:** Rogan, the princeling, plays his role well as the best friend and friend with benefits, but I never saw him as endgame for Fia. His habit of calling her “changeling” felt dismissive, and his character ultimately showed weakness compared to Irian.  \n  - **Irian:** Irian is a strong, broody character with a tragic past. His resilience and depth made me adore him, and his dynamic with Fia—filled with push-and-pull banter, secrets, and mutual respect—was beautifully written. I was constantly worried for him but utterly captivated by his character.\n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  The romance between Fia and Irian is tender, spicy, and deeply satisfying. Their banter is witty and vivid, and their connection is built on seeing each other for who they truly are, not what they are. The toxic found family theme contrasts with the pure found soulmate storyline, making the relationships complex and compelling.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The plot is full of twists and turns, keeping readers on their toes. Just when you think you’ve figured it out, a new twist emerges. The themes of women’s empowerment, the misuse of power, and the lengths people go to gain control are woven seamlessly into the story through the prose, characterization, and plot. The storytelling is masterful, with a perfect balance of intrigue, emotion, and action.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* is a masterpiece of dark fairytales, fae romance, and self-love. With its stunning prose, unique worldbuilding, and deeply compelling characters, it’s a must-read for fans of *The Cruel Prince* and anyone who loves stories with wit, heart, and soul. Lyra Selene has established herself as a new queen of fae romance, and I can’t wait for the next book in the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nPerfection! (No specific numerical score provided, but the review is overwhelmingly positive.)"

They provided a chance to process the intense events in Tír na nÓg and heightened my anticipation for the faerie realm scenes.

            "Fia is a captivating protagonist whose profound loneliness as a fae raised among humans is strikingly evident—she longs to belong but never quite fits in. Despite her origins, she embodies more humanity than many, brimming with love and compassion. Her greatest vulnerability lies in her yearning for love and acceptance, making her susceptible to manipulation. I appreciated Fia's journey of self-discovery as she recognizes her role as a pawn and learns to trust her own judgment. The romance in the story, particularly the love triangle, is beautifully crafted. Fia and Rogan share a rich history; he is her best friend, first love, and the heir to his kingdom. Their separation stems from Rogan's choice of duty over happiness, a decision that continues to frustrate Fia. In contrast, Fia and Irian's relationship feels more authentic. Irian embraces Fia for who she truly is, including her magic, and their connection radiates purity and enchantment.",

This timeline lends the relationship between Fia and Irian a somewhat rushed quality, given their limited interactions. Nevertheless, the novel is a captivating exploration of duty, desire, truth, and storytelling. It follows Fia, a changeling with earth magic, on a perilous mission to Tír na nÓg to rescue the cursed princess Eala and recover a treasure to restore magic to the human realm. Rich in political intrigue, romantic entanglements, curses, enchantments, and themes of duty and sacrifice, the tale enchants from start to finish.",

In contrast, her bond with Irian is fascinating, rooted in shared stories and a burgeoning trust that challenges her perceptions of the Folk and herself.",

However, once I got used to the lyrical style (mostly by ignoring the parts that didn’t make sense), the story became more engaging.  \n\n- **Originality and Freshness:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book is a breath of fresh air in the fantasy genre. It stands out from the popular fae/fantasy books I’ve read, offering something unique and different.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are complex and deviate from traditional heroines and side characters. The main character’s growth, especially in her relationships, is well-portrayed. I appreciated how she fully explored her feelings for Rogan before ultimately choosing Irian.  \n\n- **Love Triangle:**  \n  The love triangle is compelling and genuine. Even nearing the end, I wasn’t entirely sure who she would choose, which added to the tension and intrigue.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story progresses unpredictably, keeping me engaged. I loved how the book spanned a year, with each chapter marking the passing of months and seasons. This structure made me feel like I had spent the year with the characters, reflecting on their growth.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  While I’m happy with how the main character and her love interest overcame their conflict, I wish there hadn’t been declarations of love at the end. Given that they only met for 12 hours once a month, it felt rushed. I would have preferred an ending where she began exploring things with Irian instead.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The author effectively conveys a message about love, even though the plot surrounding it is tangled and confusing. The conflict between Rogan and Fia felt genuine and insurmountable, and I appreciated that Rogan’s character remained consistent throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws in world-building, plot devices, and writing style, this book captivated me with its originality, complex characters, and unpredictable story. The love triangle was compelling, and the year-long structure added depth to the characters’ growth. While the ending felt slightly rushed, the overall magic and whimsy of the story left me enthralled.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 Stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the ride and believe this book deserves more recognition. I can only see the author improving with time!"

This loose retelling of *Swan Lake* takes its own unique direction while seamlessly weaving in elements of the original tale.

Fia’s journey of self-discovery and empowerment, set against a lush and magical backdrop, makes this a standout fantasy novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5 stars"

Her emotes, vocalizations, timbre, pace, and character continuity were exceptional. Narrating a book is not easy, but when the story flows well and the technical construction is on point, a narrator and writer can produce an outstanding audiobook by merging their talents.\n\n- **Story and Retelling:**  \n  The story is a delight, and Lyra Selene has crafted a marmite coup de grace—you’ll either love it or hate it. It depends on whether you prefer Disney-style retellings or those authentic to the original fairytale. This retelling reflects *The Swan Maiden* from the Edda or Grimm’s Fairy Tales, though some may see themes from Disney’s 1994 version. Regardless, it stands on its own as a strong romantasy novel, not just a retelling.\n\n- **Characters and Themes:**  \n  The heroine, Fia, is a changeling adopted by the queen as a secret weapon and spy. The queen’s real daughter is cursed, fated to be a swan by day and return to her true self at nightfall. The story features a morally grey male main character (MMC), spicy elements, and twists and turns that captivate and enchant the listener.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley, Hachette Audio, Orbit, the author Lyra Selene, and the narrator Heather O’Sullivan for providing this stunning ALC. My review is voluntary, and all opinions are my own.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis audiobook is a brilliant retelling of *The Swan Maiden*, blending authentic fairytale elements with a strong romantasy narrative. The narration by Heather O’Sullivan elevates the experience, making it a captivating listen.

Keeping track of everything was sometimes difficult, but as with any world-building, things start to make more sense as the story unfolds.  \n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  What I liked most about this story was Fia, our FMC. Despite being presented with many opportunities to make foolish decisions, as most romantasy books depict, her story was refreshingly different. I loved how she stayed true to herself, with her growth and self-love increasing with each realization. It was incredibly satisfying to read her journey.  \n- **Romance:**  \n  Regarding the romance, I enjoyed it, although I didn't fall head over heels. It was beautifully written, but because the world was so unique and magical, the intensity of the love felt a bit diluted to me. However, that's just my personal preference - I prefer a bit more banter, a bit more steaminess, and a slower build-up. Regardless, this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment.  \n- **Handling of Love Triangles:**  \n  I'm usually not a fan of love triangles, but I think this one was handled very well, capturing the self-awareness and growth of all the characters.  \n- **Language and References:**  \n  I found the book quite enjoyable. It was a bit challenging to read due to the numerous Gaelic references, but I appreciated it for what it was.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIn conclusion, it's a good read, very unique, with a darker magical world.

The faerie world, Tír na nÓg, was beautifully crafted, and I loved being immersed in a setting where nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted.  \n\n- **Retelling and Folklore:**  \n  The novel is a Swan Lake retelling with a strong foundation in Irish/Celtic folklore.

Her growth and arc were compelling, especially her journey of self-acceptance and realizing that those she thought loved her only cared about what she could do for them. This aspect was handled with honesty and authenticity.  \n\n- **Romance and Love Triangle:**  \n  While I don’t typically enjoy love triangles, I was intrigued by this one initially.

However, I adore stories involving fae, so I decided to give it a chance. After reading *A Court of Thorns and Roses* (which I loved), I’ve noticed many fae stories trying to emulate that trilogy, but most fail to capture the magic, believable characters, or quality writing. I’m picky about what I read, so this was a gamble.\n\n- **Storytelling and Plot:**  \n  This book is perfect. It features great storytelling, well-crafted plots, and a host of twists, turns, and surprises. The writing is fabulously descriptive without venturing into “writing to fill word count” territory. I was thoroughly engaged from start to finish.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are realistic and compelling. I loved Fia and her special talents, and I felt deeply for her despite her awful upbringing. Her gratitude and love for the Queen added layers to her character. I also adored Corra and wished we could see more of her. Irian was intriguing, but I would have liked to encounter more Fae folk overall.\n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The settings were perfect, both in the human world and the Fae realm. They were vividly described and added depth to the story.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  Poor Fia—trained for one thing her whole life, only to discover that things may not be as she was led to believe. The tension between following the Queen’s orders and questioning their consequences was gripping. The story raises important questions: Who is telling the truth? Who should Fia believe? So much hinges on her decisions, making the narrative emotionally resonant.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I am so keen to read more of this series. It’s fabulous, with a fantastic journey and a great ending, but I need more ASAP!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* is a fantastic fae read that exceeded my expectations. It delivers great storytelling, compelling characters, and a richly described world. I highly recommend it to fans of the genre and can’t wait for the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nStars: Five  \n\n*ARC supplied by NetGalley and publishers.*"

The author’s ability to craft vivid and evocative descriptions, especially of the forest-based magic and woodland sprites, was a standout feature.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  This is a Celtic-inspired fantasy with a rich and immersive world. The inclusion of humans, fae, and dark, morally grey, broody immortals added depth and intrigue to the story. The forest-based magic system was particularly enchanting.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  FMC Fia’s journey was compelling, though she did come across as a bit immature at times. However, she truly shined in moments where she stood up for herself, especially when men didn’t treat her as she deserved. Watching her navigate complicated family dynamics, including evil stepmother vibes and sibling conflict, was both painful and engaging.  \n\n- **Romance and Tropes:**  \n  The romance delivered on several great tropes: friends to lovers, enemies to lovers, and love triangles. The slow-burn romance was executed beautifully and kept me invested throughout.  \n\n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n  I was initially worried that the ending might not live up to the rest of the story, but the author absolutely nailed it. The conclusion was satisfying and left me eager to read the sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a beautifully written and immersive Romantasy that I thoroughly enjoyed. From the stunning prose and rich world-building to the compelling characters and slow-burn romance, it delivered on every front. The audiobook narration by Heather O’Sullivan was the cherry on top, making this an unforgettable reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐️ (rounded up)"

It exceeded my expectations and reminded me of Juliet Marillier’s storytelling style.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The novel beautifully captures the enchanting yet unpredictable nature of the Fae and Fair realms. It masterfully blends elements of beauty, harshness, and fickleness, creating a vivid and immersive world.  \n\n- **Story Integration:**  \n  Some readers might not appreciate the melding of multiple fairy tales, such as *The Swan Princess* and *The Twelve Dancing Princesses*, but I loved how they seamlessly merged into one cohesive narrative. It felt like a perfect blend of everything I could want from a fairy tale retelling.  \n\n- **Series Potential vs. Standalone:**  \n  While I enjoyed this first book, I almost wish it had been a standalone rather than the start of a series. That said, the many open threads leave room for intriguing developments in future installments, and I’m curious to see where the story goes next.  \n\n- **Character Development (Main Character):**  \n  My major complaint is the main character’s extreme naivety and susceptibility to manipulation. It was frustrating to read at times, though I understand why she was written that way given her background. Thankfully, she showed some growth toward the end, which redeemed her character somewhat.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some frustrations with the main character’s naivety, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.

She embodies a compelling blend of both, and I found myself rooting for her throughout the story. The love triangle (or perhaps love square?) added depth, with each relationship being beautifully complex and fraught with tension. The writing was so skillful that my heart wavered between the two relationships in every chapter, and I would have happily supported either one. My only minor concern was that the “I love you” and “We can’t” dynamic felt a bit prolonged, but this did not detract significantly from my enjoyment.",

While I haven’t read ‘For the Wolf,’ ‘The Folk of the Air’ is one of my favorite fantasy series, so any comparison drew me in.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  - The story jumps straight into the main storyline and draws you in from the very beginning, which I loved because I can be impatient and find it frustrating when a book takes too long to interest me.  \n  - It’s very fast-paced and action-packed, keeping me invested and unable to put it down.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Fia is a wonderful protagonist—she’s not a simpering girl beguiled by a handsome face, nor is she a heartless weapon (despite her mother’s intentions). She’s a great combination of both, and I really rooted for her throughout the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationships:**  \n  - I loved the love triangle (or love square?), as all the relationships were complicated, beautiful, and horrible in the best possible way.  \n  - The writing was so well done that my heart was torn between two relationships in every chapter, and I would have happily rooted for either one.  \n  - The only slight issue was that the “I love you” “We can’t” dynamic went on slightly too long in quick succession, but this was a minor concern.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - I loved and adored this book and would highly, HIGHLY recommend it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a captivating and fast-paced fantasy/romantasy with a strong protagonist, complex relationships, and a storyline that hooks you from the start.

Corra is another character I love, particularly their interactions with Fia and their ability to bring murals to life.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The last quarter of the book felt a bit draggy and repetitive as Fia learned everything she needed to complete her mission. It took her a while to reach her final deduction, which slowed the momentum.  \n\n- **Themes and Storytelling:**  \n  The novel is a wonderful exploration of balance, magic, and love. Following Fia on her journey of self-discovery was deeply engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a beautifully written retelling of *Black Swan* mixed with Celtic mythologies, offering a rich exploration of balance, magic, and self-love. Despite some pacing issues in the final quarter, the story is compelling and leaves me eager for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Fia, a changeling on a quest to rescue her human sister and other maidens cursed to become swans by day. The plot cleverly restricts travel to the fae realm to full moons, creating a rhythmic ebb and flow between the human and fae worlds that heightens tension and keeps the narrative engaging. The retelling of *The Swan Princess* and references to *The 12 Dancing Princesses* are skillfully woven together, blending familiarity with originality. The pacing strikes a balance, juxtaposing serene moments in the human world with the urgency of full moon quests. Although some threads remain unresolved, the most pressing issues are addressed, and the promise of a sequel offers a satisfying continuation.",
            "Fia is a captivating protagonist grappling with her identity as a changeling, caught between the worlds of humans and fae. Her internal conflict and journey of self-discovery drive the narrative. The love triangle involving Fia, Rogan—her first love and her sister’s betrothed—and the dark fae lord is skillfully developed, enriching the story. The morally ambiguous characters, especially the fae lord, add layers of complexity that enhance the overall experience.",
            "The prose is generally beautiful, but the occasional use of modern language and excessive metaphors slightly detracts from the immersive experience.",
            "The fae realm is vividly portrayed, blending traditional elements and folklore seamlessly. The inhumane nature of the fae, both in appearance and morality, stands out as a key highlight. The fresh yet familiar integration of fairy tale lore keeps me engaged and guessing throughout."

The plot is structured around the constraint of traveling to the fae realm only during the full moon, creating a rhythm of ebb and flow between the human world and the fae realm. This structure adds tension and keeps the narrative engaging. The retelling of *The Swan Princess* and nods to *The 12 Dancing Princesses* are well-executed, blending familiarity with originality.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Fia is a compelling protagonist who struggles with her identity as a changeling, neither fully human nor fae. Her internal conflict and journey of self-discovery are central to the story. The love triangle between Fia, Rogan (her first love and her sister’s betrothed), and the dark fae lord is well-developed and adds depth to the narrative. The morally gray characters, particularly the fae lord, are intriguing and add complexity to the story.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Lore:**  \n  The fae realm is richly depicted, with traditional fae elements and folklore woven throughout. The inhumane nature of the fae, both in form and morality, is a highlight. The integration of fairy tale lore feels fresh yet familiar, keeping the reader engaged and guessing.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is generally lovely, though the occasional use of modern words and overwrought metaphors detracts slightly from the immersive experience.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  The pacing is well-balanced, with moments of calm in the human world contrasted with the urgency of the full moon quests. While the story ends with some unresolved threads, the most pressing needs are addressed, and the promise of a sequel ensures a satisfying continuation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful blend of traditional fae lore, epic quests, and heartfelt character development.

However, once the story picked up, it became incredibly engaging, and I couldn’t put it down.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is highly descriptive and flowery, which I personally enjoyed as it helped me vividly imagine the scenes.

While the initial world-building and names were challenging, the story’s depth and immersive style made it a memorable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars."

            "The character development and relationship dynamics in this book are exceptional and truly stand out. Fia's journey revolves around her struggle to choose between the people she has always known and the Fae prince who truly understands her. While the romance is a central focus, it seamlessly enhances the fantasy world-building and propels the plot forward. The love triangle trope is refreshingly executed, illustrating Fia's growth as she transitions from one relationship to another that better fosters her personal development.",
            "The prose is beautifully lyrical, creating a visually captivating reading experience. The storytelling is enriched with riddles, intricate family dynamics, and morally ambiguous characters, which add significant depth to the narrative.",
            "The world-building in this novel is intricate and immersive, seamlessly blending Celtic mythology with high fantasy elements. However, a more comprehensive glossary or pronunciation guide would enhance the reader's experience by aiding navigation through the Celtic terms and names. Set in a richly imagined high fantasy realm influenced by Celtic lore, the story unfolds in a world beset by disease, failed harvests, and social strife. Fia, a changeling, embarks on an impossible quest to break a curse in the Fae realm. The narrative balances cozy fantasy—focusing on character development, relationships, seasonality, and domestic tasks—with darker, more gory elements that explore the depths of human nature.",
            "This novel skillfully weaves classic tropes—such as love triangles, Fae, star-crossed lovers, and friends-to-lovers—into a refreshing and meaningful narrative. Central themes of trust, growth, and self-discovery drive the story forward. While it features dark, gory, and bleak moments that delve into the darker aspects of humanity, it is not a heartwarming cozy fantasy. Instead, it offers a compelling blend of action, emotional depth, and intensity. Readers should consult trigger and content warnings before diving in."
        ],
        "conclusion": "I absolutely loved *A Feather So Black*. It is a beautifully written, character-driven fantasy novel with a strong Celtic influence and rich mythology. While it has elements of cozy fantasy, its darker, action-packed scenes and exploration of complex themes set it apart. The romance is well-integrated into the plot, and the tropes are executed in a refreshing manner. My only suggestion would be to expand the glossary/pronunciation guide to enhance the reader’s experience.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The novel is set in a high fantasy world with a strong Celtic influence, filled with mythology and folklore. It explores a world plagued by disease, failed harvests, and social strife, where Fia, a changeling, embarks on an impossible quest to break a curse in the Fae realm. The story straddles cozy fantasy with its focus on character development, relationships, seasonality, and domestic tasks, but it also includes dark, gory, and bleak elements that delve into the darkest parts of humanity.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The character development and relationship building (or destruction) are incredible and a standout feature of the book. Fia’s journey involves deciding who to trust—the people she’s known her whole life or the Fae prince who understands her deeply. The romance plot is a major focus, but it complements the fantasy world-building and helps move the plot forward. The love triangle trope is handled refreshingly, showing growth out of one relationship and into another that better supports personal development.\n\n- **Writing Style and Prose:**  \n  The prose is beautiful and lyrical, making the reading experience a feast for the eyes. The storytelling is rich with riddles, complex family dynamics, and morally grey characters, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  The world-building is intricate and immersive, blending Celtic mythology with high fantasy elements. However, the book would benefit from a more comprehensive glossary or pronunciation guide to help readers navigate the Celtic terms and names.\n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The novel incorporates classic tropes such as love triangle, Fae, star-crossed lovers, friends to lovers, and “touch her and die,” but they are executed in a refreshing and meaningful way. Themes of trust, growth, and self-discovery are central to the story.\n\n- **Content and Tone:**  \n  The book contains dark, gory, and bleak moments, exploring the darker aspects of humanity. It is not a heartwarming cozy fantasy but rather a mix of action, dark scenes, and emotional depth. Readers are advised to check trigger/content warnings before reading.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI absolutely loved *A Feather So Black*. It is a beautifully written, character-driven fantasy novel with a strong Celtic influence and rich mythology. While it has elements of cozy fantasy, its darker, action-packed scenes and exploration of complex themes set it apart. The romance is well-integrated into the plot, and the tropes are executed in a refreshing manner.

Raised by the queen, Fia endures a harsh upbringing, where abuse is masked as training.

However, Lyra Selene succeeded in creating a fairytale-inspired story that feels unique while still appealing to mainstream readers.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Fia, the protagonist, was raised as a weapon by the queen, receiving affection only when she performed well. This upbringing led to a lot of inner dialogue, making her relatable yet frustrating at times. Despite her flaws, readers find themselves rooting for her. The relationship between Fia and Rogan is central, with much of the book focusing on their growth.  \n\n- **Magic and World-Building:**  \n  Fia's botanical magic and her efforts to revive the greenhouse were highlights of the story. The mythology and world-building were well-crafted and engaging.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  Fia's relationship with the sprite Corra added a playful and mischievous element to the narrative.  \n\n- **Tone and Ending:**  \n  The story took a surprisingly dark turn toward the end, which may divide readers. Some will appreciate the boldness, while others may find it unsettling.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance, featuring an enemy-to-lovers trope and elements of insta-love, wasn't the strongest aspect of the book for me. However, fans of these tropes might enjoy it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* is a unique and engaging addition to the fae-based romantasy genre. While the romance may not appeal to everyone, the strong character development, intricate world-building, and surprising twists make it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The satisfying conclusion wrapped up the essential elements, allowing it to stand alone, though I’m eager to read the next installment.",

The love triangle was skillfully crafted, with both love interests being likable. I appreciated how clues were subtly woven into the narrative to illustrate why one wasn’t right for Fia. Irian delivered some of the best lines in the book, but I wished for more development in his relationship with Fia to make their love feel more authentic. The love triangle (or square, including Eala) was approached uniquely, avoiding typical jealousy. The love interests had minimal interaction, and their moments with Fia felt genuine, focusing on their individual connections. However, I found Fia’s love for Irian somewhat unconvincing, given the limited time they spent together.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book was enchanting and instantly captivating. I devoured most of it in one day and found it incredibly addicting. Even the slower, \"filler-y\" chapters were interesting, keeping me engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Corra was my favorite character—adorable, funny, and a standout. I hope to see more of them in the sequel. The love triangle was well-handled, with both love interests being likable. Clues were subtly woven into the story to show why one wasn’t right for Fia, which I appreciated. Irian had some of the best lines in the book, but I wished for more development of his relationship with Fia to make their love feel more believable.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The love triangle (or square, including Eala) was handled uniquely, without typical jealousy. The love interests didn’t interact much, and their moments with Fia felt genuine and focused on their individual connections. However, I felt Fia’s love for Irian wasn’t fully convincing, given the limited time they spent together.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The plot wasn’t particularly unpredictable, except for the ending, but it was still a fun and enjoyable read. The story felt fresh and unique within the romantasy genre, with well-researched worldbuilding. Terms were explained well in the text, making the glossary unnecessary for me.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was satisfying and wrapped up the most important elements. It could serve as a standalone, but I’m excited to read the sequel.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Uniqueness:**  \n  While I can see some similarities to *For the Wolf* and *These Hollow Vows*, the book stands out with its own uniqueness. It doesn’t feel like a typical romantasy, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Minor Quirks:**  \n  Irian’s nickname for Fia, \"colleen,\" was cute but unintentionally reminded me of Colleen Hoover, which slightly disrupted the romantic moments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enchanting and addictive read with well-developed characters, a unique take on romantic dynamics, and a satisfying ending. While some aspects of the romance and plot could have been more fleshed out, the book’s freshness and engaging storytelling make it a standout in the romantasy genre. I’m eagerly looking forward to the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, Iaran feels somewhat underdeveloped, and their relationship could benefit from deeper exploration.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  The story revolves around Fia, a changeling raised as a spy and weapon by the High Queen, who is tasked with retrieving the Queen’s cursed daughter, Eala, from the Folk realm. The mission becomes complicated due to Fia’s growing bond with Iaran, the dark-fae captor, and the unresolved feelings between Fia and Prince Rogan. The plot is enriched with twists and emotional depth, making it engaging and enjoyable. The blend of Celtic mythology and romantasy tropes adds a unique flavor to the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Fia is a standout character, shaped by her circumstances and driven by her mission. Her strength, snarkiness, and determination make her relatable and compelling. The emotional weight of her journey, especially her cursed love for Iaran, is well-portrayed. However, Iaran’s character feels slightly underdeveloped, and his relationship with Fia could have been explored more deeply.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The magical realm of Tir na nÓg is vividly described through Lyra Selene’s onirical and detailed prose. The integration of Celtic mythology into the world-building enhances its richness and memorability. Many sentences stand out for their beauty and depth, contributing to the immersive experience.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance is a slow burn, woven seamlessly into the plot. It adds emotional weight to Fia’s journey, though the abruptness of her falling for Iaran could have been better developed. The tension between Fia, Rogan, and Iaran adds complexity to the romantic subplot.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Lyra Selene’s descriptive and poetic writing style captures the magical essence of the story. The attention to detail and the blending of mythology into the narrative are commendable. The prose is both evocative and memorable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* is a strong debut that successfully blends Celtic mythology with romantasy elements. Fia’s journey is emotionally charged and compelling, supported by rich world-building and a slow-burn romance. While some aspects of character development could be deeper, the novel leaves readers eagerly anticipating the next installment in the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this captivating narrative, the interplay between love and destruction is poignantly explored. The protagonist is likened to a weapon, crafted to inflict pain, and the stark reality is that men often wield such weapons without understanding how to love them. The intensity of desire is encapsulated in the declaration, “When you give me your heart, colleen, I want all of it.” This sentiment embraces the rawness of love, accepting its potential for harm and chaos. \n\nThe protagonist grapples with the question of whether love that demands change can truly be called love. The initial encounter is described as a surreal experience, where the protagonist perceives the other as a hallucination—a being of balance sent to confront their past transgressions. The moment is beautifully captured when the character reflects, “I thought I might not mind oblivion, if you were the one to deliver it.” This line encapsulates the profound connection between love and self-destruction, leaving readers to ponder the complexities of affection and sacrifice."

The story truly begins when Fia accompanies Rogan to rescue her sister Eala from Tir Na Nog and restore magic to their plagued lands. The plot is engaging, with a mix of difficulty and history complicating their journey.  \n\n- **Use of Lore:**  \n  The novel excels in its use of Celtic lore, which is deeply integrated into the story.

Fia’s internal conflict and growth are compelling, and Rogan’s dynamic with Fia adds depth to the story.

The fantastical elements and intricate details make the setting come alive, and I found myself deeply invested in the expanding world.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are likeable and well-developed. Fia, the protagonist, is a badass heroine with a determined and strong personality. Her journey is compelling as her story unravels with secrets and lies at every turn. Irian and Rogan are also great characters, with Irian being a personal favorite due to his layered and shadowy exterior.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  The story is not simple; it’s layered with magic, intrigue, and underlying danger. The Fae are portrayed as dark and dangerous rather than romantic and playful, which adds a sense of tension and unpredictability throughout the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  While the book is a little slow in places, this didn’t detract from my enjoyment. Instead, it allowed me to appreciate the worldbuilding and character development even more.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The novel is very well-written, with a perfect blend of intrigue, romance, and fantastical elements. It’s an excellent choice for fans of fantasy and the Fae.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The story is brimming with intrigue and danger, with a constant sense that Fia is never truly safe. The Fae are enigmatic and not always as they seem, adding depth and mystery to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* is a fantastic addition to the Fae fantasy sub-genre, offering rich worldbuilding, compelling characters, and a layered, intriguing plot.

While I generally dislike love triangles, I feel the story is more about Fia learning to love herself rather than choosing between her first love and her new passion.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Throughout her life, Fia believed she was nothing more than a weapon to be used, leading her to hate her magical side. It is only when she meets Irian and experiences his forest that she learns what it truly means to be loved and to accept herself for who she is.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel transcends the typical love triangle trope by focusing on Fia's journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance. It beautifully intertwines adventure, romance, and personal growth, making it a compelling read despite my usual reservations about love triangles.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I highly recommend supplementing the read with the audiobook instead of flipping back and forth to the glossary or pronunciation guide. Heather O’Sullivan, the narrator, does an excellent job immersing you in this world of cunning fae and mortals, magic, curses, and love.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  The story follows Fia, the fae daughter of the queen, who was left in exchange for the mortal Princess Eala, trapped in the faerie realm.

            "The story centers on a well-developed romance that captivates the reader without resorting to the typical love triangle trope. Instead, it presents a love timeline that illustrates how individuals can grow out of certain relationships. While the second romance lacks the depth of the first due to the characters' limited familiarity, it is characterized by openness and respect. I look forward to seeing how this relationship evolves in future installments, hoping to become more invested as the characters spend more time together. Additionally, the complex family dynamics add a compelling layer to the narrative, and I found the portrayal of these relationships to be particularly empowering.",

The twists, particularly Fia's shocking revelation about sacrificing her heart to the Tree of Life and her role as the heir of the Sept of Antlers, were truly gripping. While the pacing in the latter half was captivating, the earlier sections made it easy to set the book aside. I anticipated Eala's tendency to sacrifice others, but the specifics of her actions—like transforming Rogan into a brainless lackey instead of killing him—were unexpected. Suspenseful moments, where I feared for the characters' safety, kept me invested, even though I knew the story would continue.",

Irian emerges as the standout character, captivating readers with his depth and presence. Meanwhile, Eala's character is shrouded in mystery, her true intentions adding layers of tension and unpredictability to the narrative.",
            "The book utilizes my favorite method of world-building, revealing details gradually instead of relying on info dumps. This technique keeps me engaged and allows the story to unfold organically. The flashbacks of Fia and the strategic unveiling of information during pivotal moments, such as the party at the end of Part 1, enhance both immersion and intrigue.",

While the ending felt slightly rushed and some plot twists were predictable, I still enjoyed the overall journey.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - **Fia:** The protagonist, a changeling with botanical magic, is complex and tormented. Her journey challenges her self-perception and leads to unexpected growth. Her sarcasm masks years of suffering and loneliness, making her a deeply relatable character.  \n  - **Rogan:** Fia’s childhood best friend and prince, Rogan is kind, loyal, and flawed. Their friends-to-lovers dynamic, though not my usual preference, was beautifully executed, with flashbacks adding depth to their relationship.  \n  - **Irian:** A dark and dangerous fae lord, Irian is both fascinating and enigmatic. His enemies-to-lovers dynamic with Fia is sizzling and filled with angst, making him a standout character.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The novel features a well-handled love triangle, with both friends-to-lovers and enemies-to-lovers tropes. The spicy scenes are intense and well-written, adding to the emotional depth of the relationships. Despite my usual aversion to love triangles, I found this one compelling and enjoyable.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is lyrical, evocative, and rich in sentiment, creating a melancholic yet enchanting atmosphere. The author’s ability to paint vivid, almost cinematic scenes left me breathless at times.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather so Black* is a bewitching and enthralling start to the *Fair Folk* trilogy. While it draws on familiar fantasy romance tropes, it executes them brilliantly, with rich world-building, complex characters, and a captivating narrative. Despite its slow pace and predictable twists, the novel’s evocative writing and emotional depth won me over completely. I eagerly await the sequel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In contrast to some reviews labeling it as mere smut, I found the plot and suspense to be skillfully crafted. The mysteries surrounding Irian's character and motives were particularly engaging.",
            "Fia emerged as a standout character, complete with a rich backstory and compelling motives that made me genuinely root for her. In contrast, Rogan, the love interest, felt underdeveloped and lacked personality, leaving me puzzled by Fia's attraction to him. I was relieved when the love triangle resolved in favor of Irian, whose intriguing plotline and motives were far more captivating.",
            "I appreciated the portrayal of magic in the story, especially Fia’s abilities, which enriched both the world and her character. The worldbuilding was exceptional and kept me engaged throughout. The idea of a changeling rescuing the human they replaced was captivating, and the execution was impressive. Additionally, the incorporation of retellings from tales like The Swan Maiden and The Twelve Dancing Princesses added a familiar yet refreshing dimension to the narrative.",
            "Initially hesitant, I found myself genuinely enjoying this book and am inclined to explore more works by the author. While it hasn't fully converted me into a romantasy enthusiast, it has opened me up to the possibility of reading more in this genre if the premise intrigues me.",
            "I usually steer clear of romance novels, particularly hetero romance and romantasy, as I often find them overly spicy and lacking in substance. However, this book pleasantly surprised me. While it does contain some spicy scenes, they were not overwhelming for someone like me who typically dislikes such content. I appreciated that the romance did not overshadow the plot."

This book had a lot to overcome given my usual preferences, but it succeeded in surprising me.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Premise:**  \n  Selene’s worldbuilding was excellent and kept me hooked. The concept of a changeling rescuing the human they replaced was intriguing, and the execution was well done. The inclusion of retellings from stories like \"The Swan Maiden\" and \"The Twelve Dancing Princesses\" added a familiar yet fresh layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Fia was a standout character with a fleshed-out backstory and compelling motives, which made me root for her. However, Rogan, the love interest, fell flat for me. His lack of personality and motive made him uninteresting, and I couldn’t understand Fia’s attraction to him. I was relieved when the love triangle resolved in favor of Irian, whose mysterious plotline and motives were far more engaging.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  I enjoyed how magic functioned in the story, particularly Fia’s magic, which added depth to the world and her character.  \n\n- **Plot and Suspense:**  \n  Contrary to some reviews calling it \"smut without plot,\" I found the plot and suspense well-executed. The mysteries surrounding Irian’s character and motives were especially captivating.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  While there are some spicy scenes, they were not overwhelming for someone like me who isn’t a fan of such content.

            "The story follows Fia, a changeling on a quest to rescue her human sister and other maidens cursed to transform into swans by day. The plot cleverly utilizes the constraint of traveling to the fae realm only during the full moon, creating a rhythmic ebb and flow between the human and fae worlds. The narrative is a thrilling ride, alternating between serene moments in the human realm and intense action during the full moon. This retelling of *The Swan Princess* incorporates elements from *The 12 Dancing Princesses*, blending familiar lore with fresh twists. While the book concludes with some unresolved questions, it satisfactorily addresses the most pressing issues, setting the stage for a sequel.",
            "Fia is a captivating protagonist grappling with her identity as a changeling, caught between the human and fae worlds. Her journey of self-discovery is further complicated by her childhood friend and first love, Rogan, who is now betrothed to her sister. The morally ambiguous dark fae lord adds another layer of complexity, drawing Fia in and challenging her beliefs. The love triangle is skillfully crafted, enhancing the narrative and deeply exploring the emotional conflicts at play.",

The fusion of folklore and fairy tales creates a familiar yet unpredictable atmosphere. The stark contrast between the human and fae worlds is vividly illustrated, with each setting presenting its own unique experiences and challenges.",

He embodies a cunning, enigmatic figure with sharp wit and a mysterious presence.

            "I wanted to like Fia, but she often frustrated me despite my understanding of her character. Rogan felt oddly portrayed; it seemed the author was attempting to salvage his relationship with Fia, only for her to change her mind later. I grasped his reasons for leaving, and for the first half of the book, I anticipated a second-chance romance, but the story took an unexpected turn. My feelings about Irian are mixed—perhaps I've encountered too many similar characters, making me more critical. Still, I appreciated his support for Fia and felt he was a better match for her overall. I found Fia's family utterly detestable and wished for their downfall. Despite my issues with Fia, I was pleased to see her prioritize herself when it mattered. I'm curious to see what happens next.",

However, once the characters embarked on their quest, I felt like a lot of the events were filler. I’m not sure if that was intentional, but it didn’t work for me.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I tried hard to like Fia, and while I understood her character, she still annoyed me most of the time. Rogan felt like a very weird character; it seemed like the author was trying to salvage his relationship with Fia, and at some point, she changed her mind. I understood his reasons for leaving, and for the first 50% of the book, I thought it was building up to a second-chance relationship, but it took a different path. I’m unsure how I feel about Irian—perhaps I’ve read too many similar characters and am just picky now. However, I appreciated how supportive he was of Fia and how he seemed better for her overall. I completely disliked Fia’s family; they were all horrible, and I just wanted them to burn.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  I loved the world-building, the Celtic lore influences, and the dark take on the Swan Princess story. The twist with the black swan and the ending were particularly enjoyable.\n\n- **Ending and Character Growth:**  \n  Although I didn’t like Fia, I was happy to see her choose herself when it mattered. I’m curious to see what will happen next.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had mixed feelings about the characters and pacing, the world-building, lore, and ending were strong points that kept me engaged.

            "The pacing was the story's weakest aspect. It begins with a strong start, but the characters spend an entire month waiting to re-enter the fae realm, which disrupts the momentum. The ending left me feeling a bit lost, as it felt overly fanciful and abstract, reminiscent of an ayahuasca trip journal. I hope the sequel offers more clarity on the events that unfold.",

I was pleasantly surprised by the level of spice, which enhanced rather than overshadowed the plot.

The narrative centers on Fia, raised by a human queen to serve as a weapon. Her mission is to rescue the queen’s daughter, Eala, from the enigmatic Folk. Along the way, Fia becomes involved with Eala’s betrothed, a human prince, and the shadow-wielding Folk Heir, hitting all the key elements of romantasy, including some spicy moments.",

Fia is tasked with rescuing the queen’s daughter, Eala, from the magical and mysterious Folk.

However, some details, like the lesser Folk, were mentioned once without further description. While this isn’t a deal breaker, I’m a stickler for details and would have liked more thorough world-building. I think the addition of a map and a glossary would have enhanced the experience.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing felt off to me.

He’s a rare specimen, especially in the way he treated Fia.

For instance, her blind trust in Eala was exasperating, yet it reflects the abusive and manipulative environment her \"mother\" created, leaving her desperate for connection with her sister.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  The world-building and Celtic background of the mythology and characters are amazing and very extensive. However, at times, it feels too heavy and adds little to the overall story.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The storyline is intriguing, but I wish the plot developed more quickly. At certain points, it feels lost or dragged out, which detracts from the pacing.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  I’m not a fan of love triangles, especially when the characters are toxic and manipulative toward each other. However, this aspect was well-resolved by the end of the book. My main complaint is Fia’s indecisiveness, which leads to her dragging out her relationship with Rogan unnecessarily, especially when it’s clear that Irian is her true love interest.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Books:**  \n  Despite some flaws, I’m willing to read the next book as the story has a lot of potential.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel excels in world-building and mythology, it struggles with pacing and character indecisiveness. The resolution of the love triangle is satisfying, and the story’s potential leaves me eager for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I’m excited for the rest of the series to come out!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully written, engaging story with strong character development, creative world-building, and a compelling narrative. The author’s ability to maintain tone and deliver a thought-provoking exploration of familiar themes makes this a standout read. I’m eagerly anticipating the next installment in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Tasked with bringing the true princess home, Fia's journey delves into themes of identity, manipulation, and the longing for love and acceptance.",
            "Fia’s journey is profoundly emotional as she navigates her identity as an outsider—too strange for humans and too human for the Folk. Her growth centers on embracing her darker aspects and learning to love herself rather than seeking validation from others. The portrayal of her trauma and struggles is both authentic and relatable. The novel features two love interests: Rogan, her first love who ultimately betrays her, and Irian, a brooding, morally grey character who accepts all facets of her. Their romance unfolds as a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers arc, while her relationship with Rogan is marked by angst and emotional manipulation. The romantic tension is skillfully balanced with moments of spice and emotional depth.",

This feels like a setup for future installments, and I anticipate the story will gain momentum in the sequels.",

I look forward to seeing how these characters evolve in future installments.",

I’m curious to see how these characters develop in future books.  \n\n- **Romantic Tropes:**  \n  The book features several romantic tropes, including enemies-to-lovers, a *Swan Lake* retelling, a “touch her and ☠️” dynamic, Celtic mythology, a morally grey “shadow daddy,” and a well-handled love triangle.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The spice level is ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥.5, spicier than the early *ACOTAR* books and equal to or slightly spicier than the later ones. This comparison helps readers gauge the level of romantic tension and intimacy.  \n\n- **Critique of Reviews:**  \n  I’ve seen dismissive comments labeling this as a “Booktok book,” implying it’s poorly crafted but popular. Such critiques overlook the book’s broad appeal and reduce it to a matter of taste rather than merit. Valid critiques should not demean others’ preferences.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a slow-paced, Gaelic-infused *Swan Lake* retelling with intriguing characters, enigmatic world-building, and a promising set-up for sequels. While the pacing may not suit everyone, fans of romantasy will likely enjoy its unique elements and romantic tropes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: ❤️❤️❤️❤️.25  \n- Spice Meter: ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥.5"

The pacing was frustrating at times, especially during the month-long wait for the Gate to open; it seemed like better planning could have avoided this delay. The mission dragged on, leading me to question why they didn’t simply stay in Faerie for a month to complete it instead of extending it over several years. While the ending was satisfying, it left me curious about their future plans. Some elements of the story were eye-roll-inducing, but overall, I enjoyed it. The conclusion was strong, yet I still had lingering questions about the resolution.",
            "I generally liked Fia, though she made some questionable choices, such as clinging to her friendship with Rogan, trusting Eala, and delaying her mission by waiting months instead of staying in Faerie to sort things out. I found Rogan insufferable—an inept, entitled prince with unrealistic dreams of grandeur and romance. His inability to even shave his own face, along with his assumptions and poor communication, were frustrating. In contrast, Irian stood out to me as gentle, powerful, dark, and resigned; he seemed more honest and capable than Rogan, and I hope he doesn’t betray Fia. Eala strikes me as sinister, and I’m skeptical of her intentions. I also wonder if Corra will prove to be more significant than she appears. Ultimately, I hope Fia chooses Irian over Rogan and rises above the drama, as Irian seems more deserving and genuine. The constant refrain from the male characters about not being good enough for Fia was irritating; if they feel that way, they should strive to improve. As a hopeless romantic, I found it hard to fully trust the romantic dynamics between Fia and the other characters.",

I wasn’t invested in his relationship with Fia and kept hoping it would end.  \n  - **Eala:** Eala came across as mean, which made it hard to connect with her character.  \n  - **Irian:** Irian was the standout character for me. He was intriguing, and I wanted to learn more about him. His dynamic with Fia was fun and full of chemistry, though their feelings developed rather quickly given their limited interactions.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  Fia and Irian had a compelling connection, with great chemistry and a fun dynamic as they exchanged stories and got to know each other. However, their romance felt rushed since they could only meet on the night of the full moon. On the other hand, Fia’s relationship with Rogan was less engaging, and I felt she deserved better.\n\n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n  The ending was predictable, and I saw the twists coming. While it tied up some loose ends, it also introduced more riddles and left me with unanswered questions, which was unsatisfying. However, I loved the epilogue, which provided a satisfying conclusion to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed reading *A Feather So Black*. Despite some confusing elements and a predictable ending, the world-building, Fia and Irian’s dynamic, and the unique retelling of *The Swan Lake* made it an engaging read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ / 4 stars"

While the plot is engaging, Fia's choices can be frustrating at times. The ending presents a soft cliffhanger, leaving the fate of the Folk uncertain.

Fia's relationship with Prince Rogan, her childhood best friend, was complex; although he showed her kindness, his inability to fully accept her fae side left their bond feeling incomplete.

I appreciated the active incorporation of folklore throughout the narrative, though I wished the author had focused more on vividly describing these beings instead of relying heavily on Celtic language. The magic system is refreshingly unique, but I felt the inclusion of shadows was unnecessary.

The druids, sprites, and all manner of impish beasties created a world filled with whimsical treachery. I enjoyed how much of the folklore was actively used throughout the book, though I wish the author had leaned more into describing these creatures rather than relying heavily on the Celtic language.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic system felt unique and fresh in its delivery. However, I think the shadows could have been done away with, and the author could have leaned more into the sky powers to make Irian stand apart from other “booktok shadow daddies.”  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The plot was a great take on the Swan Princess and 12 Dancing Princesses. While the story taking place over a full year required glossing over months in a chapter to focus on the full moon, it didn’t hurt the story. Suspending disbelief was necessary in this aspect.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters were solid. I adored the FMC’s growth as she had to choose between who she was and who she was becoming. The love interests were well-played, with no overlap, though I wished one had come into his own more and not fit the mold of other fantasy leading men. The side characters felt a bit flat, except for Corra, the little sprite, who was the best.  \n\n- **Language and Glossary:**  \n  The glossary at the end made the reading experience harder. It would have been much easier if it had been at the beginning. The language sometimes made it hard to connect with the story due to my unfamiliarity.  \n\n- **Audiobook Potential:**  \n  I think this would have been amazing as an audiobook!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile not a 5-star read, this high fantasy novel with its unique magic system, rich Celtic folklore, and solid character development was still really good.

Her mission is to break a curse on Eala, the human girl she replaced, and bring her home. Accompanied by her childhood love, who is engaged to Eala, Fia journeys to Tír na nÓg, the magical realm, where she grapples with her ingrained hatred for the Fae. As the plot unfolds, Fia begins to question her mission and her sense of belonging, particularly after meeting a monstrous Folk lord who offers her a sense of understanding for the first time.",
            "Fia's journey is captivating as she navigates her identity, mission, and complex feelings for both her childhood love and the Folk lord. Her internal conflict and growth are depicted with nuance, making her a relatable and multidimensional protagonist. The supporting characters, including Eala's betrothed and the Folk lord, enrich the narrative and challenge Fia's perceptions.",
            "The author's vivid and beautiful writing immerses readers in the story. The incorporation of Irish folklore and mythology adds depth, with unfamiliar words and phrases that enhance the narrative's rhythm and pacing once understood. The emotional resonance is powerful, evoking strong feelings and even bringing me to tears.",
            "The novel intricately examines the dual nature of love—both healing and harmful—alongside the journey of self-acceptance. It poignantly portrays the challenge of learning to love oneself in a world that often diminishes personal worth. I found the story particularly resonant, especially its powerful message about reclaiming one’s narrative and embracing the role of the main character in one’s own life.",

            "In this story, I felt that Fia treated Rogan unfairly. Throughout the narrative, Rogan consistently chose her, sacrificing his future, loyalty to his kingdom, and family. Yet, Fia dismissed his love, claiming, “You don’t love me the right way.” While I understand that Rogan made her feel ashamed of herself, this portrayal seemed forced to elevate Irian's character. Rogan was Fia's best friend when others shunned her, even sharing his food when her own “mother” made her fight for scraps. It would have been more honest for Fia to acknowledge Rogan's past love and friendship while explaining that she found the love she truly deserves with someone else. Instead, she strung him along with vague statements like, “We’re not meant for each other,” which felt less direct than saying, “I don’t want to be with you.” Fia's treatment of Rogan made her seem like a poor friend; she abandoned him for a month without communication and left him to handle the swan princess alone, despite his pleas for help. This inconsistency felt at odds with her character and their supposed friendship. \n\nOn a positive note, I loved Fia’s journey of self-discovery and the role Irian played in it. Irian was fantastic, and I adored his character. While I initially wished Fia had been the black swan in the swan princess tale, Irian's role as the black swan was a refreshing twist.",

I hope to understand more when the next book comes out.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Fia and Rogan):**  \n  I felt like Fia did Rogan dirty.

The main narrative follows Fija, the protagonist, and her best friend, Prince Rogan, as they embark on a quest to rescue kidnapped human girls, including the queen’s daughter. Their journey leads them to fairy feasts, where Fija develops a bond with the fairy lord Irian, who is linked to the abducted girls. Despite these intriguing elements, the plot ultimately lost its initial momentum and became less engaging.",

Both Rogan and Eila seem disinterested in the arranged marriage, yet the queen insists on it. Fija's naivety is frustrating; she trusts strangers over Rogan, who has been a loyal friend her entire life. While the queen's manipulation of Fija is expected, her willingness to serve the queen's agenda is infuriating. Fija's character often feels overly naive, and her trust in manipulative figures like the queen and Eila makes me want to shake her. Eila, much like her mother, is a skilled manipulator who creates chaos while pretending to be innocent. Fija’s misguided attempts to help her sister only heighten my frustration.

            "This book offers a fresh take on familiar tales, skillfully blending elements from *Swan Princess*, *Black Swan*, and *12 Dancing Princesses*. While the romantic aspects are present, they weren't the main focus for me. I found myself torn between the friends-to-lovers dynamic of Fia and Rogue and the enemies-to-lovers relationship between Fia and Irian. Ultimately, I found myself rooting for the character who encouraged Fia to grow and embrace her true self. The ending left me with many unanswered questions, and I still feel uncertain about what transpired. I plan to reread the book before the next installment in the trilogy to gain a clearer understanding.",

The restriction of visiting Tír na nÓg only once a month caused certain parts of the story to feel slow and drawn out.

The narrative unfolds primarily during full moons, making the anticipation between them worthwhile for the unfolding events."

The story progresses primarily during full moons, with the wait between them being worth it for the events that unfold.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The characters are either lovable or written to be hated (e.g., Eala).  \n  - The protagonist, Fia, has moments of frustration, particularly in her interactions with the villains, where her inability to discern trustworthiness is evident.  \n  - The love story is compelling, with Irian being a standout character who captures the reader’s heart.  \n\n- **Romance and Tension:**  \n  - The romance is spicy, with two to three intimate scenes and plenty of good tension.  \n  - There is a misconception about a love triangle; it’s more of a “first I want you, then I want you” dynamic.  \n  - A teased kiss scene is dropped and never revisited, which feels inconsistent and unnecessary.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  - Heather O’Sullivan’s narration is excellent and highly recommended for the audiobook version.  \n\n- **Villains and Conflict:**  \n  - The villains are somewhat predictable, and Fia’s interactions with them can be frustrating, as her lack of discernment is obvious to the reader.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  - The book ends on an open note, setting up for the next in the series, but it doesn’t leave the reader on a cliffhanger. The ending is satisfying and doesn’t make the wait for the next installment painful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a beautifully written and whimsical story with a unique take on Fae lore. While the characters and romance are captivating, some aspects, like Fia’s interactions with the villains and a dropped plot point, detract slightly from the experience. Overall, it’s a highly enjoyable read with a satisfying ending that leaves readers eager for the next book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The pacing felt uneven due to frequent time jumps, which made it seem like significant events were happening off-page. The story spans a little over a year, and the time jumps required piecing together what occurred in between.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book has a dark fairytale vibe, which I really enjoyed. The inclusion of monstrous creatures, whether good or evil, added to the magical and immersive atmosphere.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main character, Fia, was compelling, and her unique magic stood out compared to other fantasy books. The Fair Folk were intriguing, with their wicked and feral nature, making it hard to trust any character.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The central plot revolves around breaking a dark curse, which I found engaging. The escalation of events in the second half was particularly gripping and left me eager to continue the series.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  The book features a love triangle with multiple love interests. Fia’s relationship with Rogan felt repetitive due to their forbidden love and constant push-and-pull dynamic. In contrast, her relationship with Irian was more interesting, though I wished it had been explored further.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a slow start and uneven pacing, the book’s dark fairytale atmosphere, compelling characters, and engaging plot made it a worthwhile read.

            "The first half of the book is engaging, blending romance, tension, and humor. While it evokes ACOTAR vibes, it ultimately falls short in execution. Unresolved dynamics, like the mysterious guy to whom Fia owes a kiss, create intrigue for future installments.",

Corra, while reminiscent of Peeves from Harry Potter, proves to be a helpful presence. However, Eala's character feels inconsistent for someone who was kidnapped at nine. Additionally, Ronan's frequent absences and the lack of concern from others come across as unrealistic.",

The politics of the Fae realm, particularly during the wedding scene, are poorly explained, leading to further confusion. Additionally, there are numerous unresolved details, such as the random feathers in the mortal realm and Ronan and Fia's prolonged stay at the fortress despite a nearby castle.

The little touches of magic, sly wording, and bargaining added to the charm. The juxtaposition and reversal of personality and morals of the \"sisters\" after coming up in different realms was intriguing and kept me guessing about who was genuine and who was not throughout most of the book.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book felt a little too long and slow at times. It spanned over a whole year, so some parts had to be breezed over. I think less time and more detail could have benefitted certain sections. Additionally, reducing the number of spicy scenes, which felt repetitive, might have allowed for more depth in other areas.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I found Fía's character a bit confusing. She talks extensively about how she was brought up to be a weapon, but her resolve seems to crumble too quickly. While this might be due to the revelations by Rogan planting doubts in her mind, I’m not entirely convinced by her transformation.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  There were a couple of instances where I was confused by time jumps. I’m not sure if this was due to listening to the audiobook or if the written version also had this issue.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The narrator was excellent. Having a narrator with an accent that fits the story’s location enhanced my immersion. The pronunciation, speed, cadence, and sound quality were all perfect, making it easy to follow along.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I’m torn on this book. While I loved the fairytale retelling, Celtic inspiration, and the intriguing moral reversals of the characters, the pacing felt slow, and some aspects of character development and narrative structure were confusing. The audiobook narration, however, was outstanding and added significantly to the experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded up to 4."

Accompanied by her best friend and secret love, Rogan, she journeys to the gate every full moon to break the spell on her sister. When Fia discovers her sister and other stolen girls transformed into swans, she must find a way to reverse the enchantment and confront their warden, Irian. The plot is engaging and well-executed.",

            "The inclusion of Gaelic (or a similar language) enriched the world-building, but some terms were left undefined, making it challenging to follow. I overlooked the pronunciation guide at the back of the book until I finished reading, so I hope it will be placed at the front in the final publication. Furthermore, the introduction of magical creatures with unfamiliar names without explanation added to the confusion.",

I kept hoping Fia would choose him, but she ultimately ends up with someone else, leaving Rogan in an unfortunate position. While I liked Irian, the resolution of the love triangle left me conflicted—perhaps I was hoping for a reverse harem! Despite these minor issues, the book was an enjoyable read, and I look forward to purchasing it in the future. I can't wait for the second book to see how the story unfolds!"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed this reimagining of the swan princesses with a Fae twist. The story follows Fia, a changeling trained as a weapon, on her quest to rescue her swapped sister from the Fairy realm. Accompanied by her best friend and secret love, Rogan, she journeys to the gate they access every full moon to break the spell on her sister. Along the way, Fia discovers her sister and other stolen girls transformed into swans and must find a way to reverse the enchantment and confront their warden, Irian. The plot is engaging and well-executed, offering a unique twist on a classic tale.",
            "I loved the characters, particularly Fia, whose fighting skills are balanced by her vulnerability, making her relatable. Rogan stood out, and I hope to see more of him in the next book. Irian was also well-developed, and I look forward to exploring his perspective further.",
            "The use of interchangeable language, likely Gaelic, was intriguing yet occasionally confusing. Some words lacked clear definitions, making it difficult to infer their meanings. Additionally, the pronunciation guide was located at the back of the book, which I overlooked until I finished reading. I hope it will be moved to the front in the final publication.",
            "The introduction of magical creatures with unique names was intriguing, but additional context and descriptions would have enhanced the experience.",
            "I wasn't a fan of the love triangle in this story. Rogan endures constant hardship and never seems to find happiness, which was frustrating. Ultimately, the main character chooses someone else, leaving Rogan in an undesirable position. I found myself torn between rooting for Rogan and liking Irian, to the point where I almost wished for a reverse harem dynamic. Despite this, the book was an enjoyable read, and I look forward to purchasing it in the future. I can't wait for the second book to see how the story unfolds."

As a result, I’m unsure if I want to continue with the next installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully written, traditional faerie story with a poetic and ethereal tone. However, the vague writing style and Fia’s frustrating choices made it difficult for me to fully connect with the story. While it may appeal to fans of long-form fairytales, I wasn’t deeply invested and remain undecided about reading the next book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I had to reread a few parts to fully grasp the intricacies of the setting.\n\n- **Character Development (Fia):**  \n  Fia's story was well-written, and her emotional journey—from feelings of belonging and not belonging to her relationships with others—was deeply felt. The mystery surrounding her origins was intriguing, and I appreciated how the author dropped subtle clues throughout the story.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot (Love Triangle):**  \n  The love triangle involving Rogan and Irian was handled in a way that didn’t feel frustrating. As Fia navigated her feelings for both characters, the progression felt natural and engaging.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  The majority of the book spans 12 months, with Fia and Rogan making brief visits to the fae world, each lasting only a day due to the consequences of staying longer. While the fae world visits were action-packed and enjoyable, the chapters set in the human world often felt slow and less engaging. I found myself skimming through some parts to get back to the more exciting segments.\n\n- **Ending and Setup for Sequel:**  \n  The ending left an opening for the second book, but I had to reread it several times to fully understand it. I’m hopeful that the sequel will provide more clarity and explanation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book had strong elements, such as detailed world-building, well-developed characters, and an intriguing romantic subplot.

The story follows Fia, a changeling raised by the queen and her druid lover to serve as a weapon against the fae. Alongside her childhood best friend, a prince, Fia embarks on a mission to rescue the cursed princess and steal magic from the fae.",

            "This story features a love triangle, but the writing clearly indicates who the ultimate couple will be. The romantic tension enhances the narrative without overshadowing the main plot. As a fast-paced romantasy, it's difficult to put down until the final 10%, where it transitions into pure fantasy. As the first installment of a trilogy, the ending hints that future books may focus more on fantasy than romance."

            "The novel centers on Fia, a changeling in a magic-deprived kingdom, who embarks on a quest to rescue Princess Eala from the Fair Folk. Drawing inspiration from *Swan Lake* and *The Swan Princess*, it offers a fresh perspective. The plot features a hidden gate, a perilous journey through enchanted forests, and Fia's conflicting emotions for Prince Rogan and the Dark Fae Lord who holds Eala captive. While the story captivated me throughout, I felt that certain elements, particularly Eala's character, could have been more fully developed.",
            "I enjoyed the romance between Fia and Rogan, but I was disappointed that it quickly faded in favor of the Dark Fae Lord. While I'm uncertain about this shift, I'm open to seeing how it unfolds in the second book. Fia is a compelling protagonist, and her internal conflict and growth are well portrayed. However, Eala's character feels underdeveloped, leaving me with unanswered questions that I hope will be addressed in future installments.",

This uncertainty added to the overall suspense of the story.",

The many twists and reveals maintained my interest throughout the story. I was constantly unsure about who Fía should trust, who she should end up with, or if she was making the “right” decision, which added to the suspense.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  None of the characters are perfect; they make mistakes and have many flaws. While no one in the story felt “good,” they all felt real and relatable. Fía, in particular, is a changeling girl who struggles with self-esteem and desires love and acceptance from the mother of the princess she replaced. This aspect of her character was one of the better-executed parts of the story.  \n\n- **Interpersonal Dynamics:**  \n  My biggest gripe was the lack of communication between two of the characters. They spend a lot of time together but have only a handful of interactions until a reveal explains why they won’t talk. However, I found this explanation hard to believe and not very realistic.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  The lore of the setting was well-developed and added depth to the story. The difficult family dynamics and Fía’s struggles were effectively woven into this world.  \n\n- **Originality and Adaptation:**  \n  While I’m not super familiar with the original Swan Princess fairytale, this novel felt like a much darker tale than the animated movie from my childhood. It didn’t come across as a straightforward retelling but rather as an expansion of the original story, with Fía’s narrative building off it in a unique way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an engaging and thought-provoking novel with well-developed characters and an intriguing plot.

The story follows a prince and a changeling on a quest to rescue the real princess from the fae world. The changeling, guided by her stand-in mother, the queen, is also tasked with retrieving a powerful weapon from the fae realm. The narrative delves deeply into the politics of the fae world, drawing comparisons to *The Cruel Prince*, but with a richer and more intricate fantasy element.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Audience:**  \n  - I feel like labeling this book as a \"Romantasy\" might market it to the wrong audience. It’s primarily a fantasy novel with some romance elements. While there is some spice when the romance develops, the first 200 pages lack significant romantic content.  \n  - This book would appeal to readers who enjoy intricate world-building and fairytales, as it includes many short tales and delves into the history of the fae war and the current state of the fae and humans.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The story revolves around a prince and a changeling tasked with rescuing the real princess from the fae world. The changeling is also instructed by the queen (her stand-in mother) to retrieve a powerful weapon from the fae realm.  \n  - The book heavily focuses on politics within the fae world, making it comparable to *The Cruel Prince* but with a stronger and more complex fantasy element. However, it doesn’t follow an enemies-to-lovers trope.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  - The romance is secondary to the fantasy elements, but it does include a well-executed love triangle and some spicy moments later in the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The pacing is a significant flaw in this book. The story takes a while to build momentum, especially in the beginning, which might deter some readers.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  - The ending wasn’t a cliffhanger, but it left me intrigued enough to consider picking up the next book. However, I’m unsure what to expect moving forward.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book for its rich world-building, political intrigue, and fairytale elements. While the pacing was a drawback, the story’s complexity and the well-done love triangle kept me engaged. I’m curious about the next installment, though the ending didn’t leave me with a strong sense of anticipation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The novel features lyrical and poetic writing that is both captivating and beautiful. I found myself rewinding the audiobook multiple times to re-listen to particularly striking quotes.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The story is set in a richly imagined world filled with perilous magic and moonlit forests. The fae realm and its intricacies are vividly portrayed, adding depth and enchantment to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The adventure/quest storyline is engaging, with Fia’s mission to retrieve the cursed princess Eala serving as the central focus. The book explores themes of love, identity, and sacrifice, which are woven seamlessly into the plot.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are complex and well-developed. Fia, the changeling spy, is a compelling protagonist, and her relationships with Prince Rogan and the dark fae lord Irian add emotional depth. However, I felt the love triangle and romance aspects could have been explored more deeply.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  Listening to the audiobook enhanced my experience, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the story and understand the pronunciation of names and terms, which I might have struggled with in the written format.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* is a mystical and beautifully dark fairytale reimagining that will enchant fans of romantasy. While I wished for more development in the romance subplot, the lyrical writing, richly imagined world, and complex characters make this a unique and captivating read. I highly recommend it to those who enjoy stories of magic, adventure, and emotional depth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While it was clear from the start that Fia would ultimately sacrifice herself to save everyone, this resolution felt somewhat predictable. The limitation of only being able to visit the nOg land 12 times and only at night quickly became repetitive. I found myself wishing for more action, as the story felt slow overall. My rating dropped due to the last few chapters, which leaned heavily into YA angst and left me frustrated. Although I’m glad Fia chose to stay in the end, I wish this decision had come earlier in the narrative.",
            "I sympathized with Rogan; he truly got a raw deal. Despite a difficult childhood, he remained devoted to Fia, often suppressing his feelings for the sake of his kingdom and his responsibilities as a leader. Unfortunately, he never received the recognition he deserved for his sacrifices. I found the romance between Fia and Rogan much more believable than that between Fia and Irian, as their connection felt weak and less engaging.",
            "I commend the author for subverting my expectations. Instead of having Rogan become a jerk or betray Fia for Eala, he remained loyal. Additionally, Fia's unexpected betrayal added an intriguing layer to the story."

He had a shitty childhood and never wavered in his love for Fia. He tried ignoring his feelings for the benefit of his kingdom and to be a responsible leader, but he never got credit no matter what he did.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  I bought the romance between Fia and Rogan more than Fia and Irian. I didn’t feel much connection between Fia and Irian, which made their relationship less compelling.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Expectations:**  \n  I give the author credit because she didn’t do what I expected. It would have been easy for Rogan to turn into a jerk or betray Fia for Eala, but he didn’t. I also didn’t see Fia’s betrayal coming, which added an unexpected layer to the story.  \n\n- **Predictability and Resolution:**  \n  That said, I think it was always obvious that Fia was going to sacrifice herself, and that would be the solution to save everybody. While this resolution made sense, it felt somewhat predictable.  \n\n- **Pacing and Repetitiveness:**  \n  The fact that they were only able to go to the nOg land 12 times, and only at night, got repetitive very quickly. I wish there had been more action overall, as not much happened in the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Tone:**  \n  I dropped my ranking at the end because the last few chapters felt very YA and angsty, which annoyed me. While I’m glad Fia finally stayed, I wish it had happened earlier in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had many elements that worked for me, particularly Rogan’s character and the unexpected twists. However, the repetitive pacing, predictable resolution, and overly angsty ending detracted from my enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75/5"

It’s a story of self-discovery and finding strength in love, with a strong focus on internal character growth.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was perfect, with time moving quickly and focusing on the important moments.

While I appreciated the depth, the story sometimes felt like it was trying to tackle too much, which affected the overall pacing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Fia’s journey of reckoning with her upbringing and understanding love is compelling. Her dynamic with Rogan adds emotional depth to the story, though I wished for a bit more focus on their relationship at times.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Anticipation:**  \n  Despite some pacing issues, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and am excited to read the second installment. The bonus sneak peek chapter included was a delightful addition.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* is a solid 4/5 star read for me. While it has some pacing struggles and a slow start, the second half of the book is immersive and engaging. The exploration of complex themes and Fia’s character development make it a worthwhile read, and I’m looking forward to the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5 stars.  \n\nThanks to Orbit and NetGalley for providing an eARC in exchange for an honest review!"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n  - This is a Celtic-inspired romantasy novel with an enemies-to-lovers trope.  \n  - It features a love triangle and a slow-burn romance, which are key elements of the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Language:**  \n  - The book has beautiful language and prose, which I appreciated.  \n  - The glossary at the back was extremely helpful for understanding the many Gaelic words that are difficult to pronounce in English.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The main character, Fia, is a half-human, half-fae changeling who has been groomed from a young age.  \n  - Her naïveté and tendency to believe lies are consistent with her background, though I found this aspect a bit frustrating at times.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story involves frequent communication breakdowns due to the characters' tendency to lie.  \n  - The romance is slow-burning, which adds to the tension and keeps the reader engaged.  \n  - The book ends on a cliffhanger, but the sequel, *A Crown So Silver*, is set to release in January 2025, so the wait isn’t too long.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I went into this book with no expectations and found it to be a cut above the last few romantasy novels I’ve read.  \n  - I couldn’t resist the allure of a hot immortal fae lord, and all the elements of a great romantasy are present.  \n  - I would recommend this to anyone looking for their next romantasy read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Celtic-inspired romantasy delivers a slow-burn romance, a love triangle, and a compelling, albeit frustratingly naive, protagonist. With beautiful prose and a helpful glossary, it’s a standout in the genre. While the cliffhanger ending leaves you eager for more, the sequel’s upcoming release ensures the wait won’t be too long.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75⭐️ (rounded up to 4⭐️)"

Her decision to leave behind people who didn’t treat her well was a powerful and relatable arc.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The plot felt overly long, spanning almost a year, and I could feel the length as I read.

While I understood Fia’s trust in her “mother,” I wanted to snap at her and tell her to think critically, as her mother was clearly using her, which made me furious.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I understood Eala’s bitterness, but I still wanted to throttle her for hurting Rogan and Fia, especially for manipulating Fia into not trusting Irian.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Throughout the book, I was begging that it wouldn’t end on a cliffhanger, and I’m so happy that it didn’t. I’m relieved that Fia and Irian are both still alive and together, and I feel like I can breathe for now.  \n\n- **Anticipation for the Sequel:**  \n  I’m nervous about what the second book will bring, but as long as Fia and Irian are together at the end of the series, I will be happy. Like Fia, I hate unhappy endings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book was emotionally intense, with a plot that kept me engaged and characters that evoked strong reactions. While I was frustrated with some of the characters’ actions, the satisfying ending left me relieved and hopeful for the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her voice, coupled with the story, was everything.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a refreshing retelling with well-developed characters, lyrical writing, and intricate world-building. The slower pacing is executed beautifully, and the romantic elements add an unexpected but enjoyable layer. The audiobook narration enhances the experience, making it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While some parts felt a bit slow, I believe this was necessary for the story to develop and for the narrative to become clearer.  \n\n- **Tropes and Relationships:**  \n  The book features a love triangle (or perhaps a love square), but it becomes clear early on which direction the relationships are headed, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Anticipation for the Sequel:**  \n  I’m eager to pick up the next book to see what happens with the characters and how their stories unfold.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating retelling inspired by classic tales, with a strong focus on Odile. While it has moments of slower pacing, the engaging narrative and clear direction of the relationships kept me invested. I’m excited to continue the journey with the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Many new debut romantasy books are hit and miss for me, and I was expecting this one to be a miss.  \n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  I felt like there were a lot of parallels to *ACOTAR*, especially concerning the main leads. However, I was able to overlook this because I really enjoyed the fae society that was crafted.  \n- **Characterization of the Fae:**  \n  I love books with fae who are deeply unpleasant, wild, feral, and do not possess a standard human moral compass.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite initial reservations and similarities to *ACOTAR*, the book exceeded my expectations with its unique and compelling portrayal of fae society.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Knowing about this reference earlier would have made the reading experience smoother.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Themes:**  \n  - I noticed some elements that felt reminiscent of *Howl’s Moving Castle*, which added a fun and nostalgic touch to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a highly enjoyable and immersive read, despite the initial challenge of navigating the Gaelic words. The blend of Celtic mythology and subtle nods to familiar stories like *Howl’s Moving Castle* made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Fia, the Black Swan, is a relatable protagonist who has suffered emotional abuse and manipulation from her foster mother. While her struggles with self-worth and desire for love can be frustrating, I found her journey to break the cycle of abuse and discover her true self deeply resonant. Irian, the evil Sorcerer, embodies a familiar trope, yet he complements Fia perfectly, and I enjoyed their dynamic. I also appreciated that the story emphasized Fia's process of moving on from her ex rather than relying on a love triangle.",

The prose created a moody and enticing atmosphere, akin to immersing myself in music.\n\n- **Story Concept and Originality:**  \n  The Swan Lake angle was refreshing, as it’s not a fairy tale often reimagined.

The integration of Celtic mythology is a notable strength. While the plot is engaging, the pacing feels uneven. The romance unfolds as a slow burn, yet Fia and Irian's limited monthly meetings make their love seem rushed despite the time that passes. I would have preferred more interactions between them and a deeper exploration of the Fae Folk's world.",
            "**Fia:** I found the main character captivating; she was a badass who kept me engaged throughout. Her relationship with her mother stood out, particularly the line, \"Only I know how to love someone like you,\" which resonated deeply with me. Fia's feeling of being a side character in someone else's story added significant depth to her character, making her sorrows and triumphs the highlights of the book.\n\n**Irian:** He embodies the typical dark-haired, morally grey fae love interest, but it works. Although labeled a monster, I didn’t find his actions particularly horrific. However, his personality felt more told than shown.\n\n**Rogan:** I usually dislike love triangles, but this one focused on falling out of love with one character and into love with another, which I appreciated. Rogan was a solid character, but I naturally found myself rooting for the morally grey fae lord.\n\n**Eala:** From her first appearance, Eala was clearly antagonistic, yet her character felt one-dimensional, defined solely by her harsh persona.\n\n**Chandi:** It was odd that she was the only swan maiden with a name, personality, and role, but I liked her and wished she had more page time.\n\n**The Queen:** She was evil yet undeniably interesting and badass. I loved her character, even if she wasn’t morally good.\n\n**Corra:** My absolute favorite! They brought brightness and intrigue to the story, and I’m excited to learn more about them in the future.",
            "The writing was beautiful, featuring many quotable lines, such as \"The thorny vines climbing my spine grew tiny buds of perilous desire.\" However, certain phrases, like \"to catch the sound in his mouth\" and \"And I-I,\" were overused and became somewhat irritating."

The incorporation of Celtic mythology was a strong point. While the plot was interesting, I found the pacing a bit off. The romance was a slow burn, but since Fia and Irian only met one day each month, their love felt rushed despite the passage of time. I wished they had more interactions throughout the book and that the world of the Fae Folk was explored more deeply.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n  - The writing was beautiful, with many quotable lines like, \"The thorny vines climbing my spine grew tiny buds of perilous desire.\" However, some phrases were overused, such as \"[...] to catch the sound in his mouth\" and \"And I-I,\" which became annoying.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this was a highly enjoyable read, especially for fans of romantasy and Fae stories. While I prefer fantasy that is more plot- and character-driven rather than romance-focused, I still liked this book very much.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story's pacing is slow, primarily due to the monthly missions to Tír na nÓg, leading to prolonged stretches of inactivity. The lack of urgency and the characters' inefficiency further extend the narrative over nearly 12 months. As the first installment in a trilogy, it combines elements of *Cruel Prince* and *For the Wolf* with Celtic mythology, centering on Fia, a changeling on a quest to rescue Princess Eala from the Folk realm. While the world-building is immersive, offering a magical and poetic portrayal of Tír na nÓg, the pacing detracts from the overall sense of urgency and action.",
            "The romance between Fia and Irian, the shadow daddy, is a standout element of the story. Their compelling enemies-to-lovers dynamic showcases Irian as dark, morally ambiguous, and irresistibly alluring. Their bond deepens through shared stories and emotional vulnerability.\n\nThe love triangle with Rogan is skillfully executed, featuring minimal overlap and a resolution that benefits all characters. However, Rogan's entitled demeanor and underdeveloped characterization make him less likable, exacerbating Fia's struggles with self-worth. Fia's journey from seeking external validation to embracing self-love is empowering, though her naivety and abandonment issues leave her susceptible to manipulation. While Irian's complexity and charm make him a memorable character, Rogan's lack of depth and entitlement diminish his appeal.",

It falls into the category of a decent fantasy novel with potential for growth in the sequel.  \n\n- **Story and Premise:**  \n  The story is a retelling of *Swan Lake* and *The Twelve Dancing Princesses*, which I approached with an open mind. It follows Fia, a Changeling raised in the human realm as a weapon against the Fair Folk, on a mission to retrieve her stolen sister, Princess Eala. The journey to Tír na nÓg introduces political intrigue, faelore, and unexpected romantic entanglements.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Fia’s determination to break the geas on her sister and challenge Irian, the tànaiste of the Sept of Feathers, adds depth to her character and makes her journey engaging.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The world-building and magic system, while not groundbreaking, provide a satisfactory foundation for the story.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance is unexpectedly prevalent and will appeal to romantasy readers. However, it sometimes overshadows other elements of the story. A love triangle adds an extra layer of misunderstandings, which I anticipate will unfold further in the sequel.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The political intrigue and faelore contribute positively to the plot, adding complexity and interest.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  As the first book in a trilogy, it sets a decent foundation. However, the fate of the series hinges on how well the second book can redeem and elevate the narrative to keep me invested in the finale.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a decent start to a trilogy with undeniable potential for improvement. While it didn’t fully meet my expectations, I’m hopeful that the sequel will deliver a more compelling and elevated narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The love triangle grew increasingly frustrating as the story unfolded. The repetitive exchanges between the protagonist and Rogan became tiresome, with each encounter feeling like a chore. I braced myself for yet another unnecessary heart-to-heart, featuring the same dialogue: “I love you, but I’m not meant for you; you need to move on.” Initially, Irian was a compelling and mysterious love interest, and I was eager to see where their romance would lead. Unfortunately, as the story progressed, their relationship became dull, which was a significant disappointment."

However, the writing often felt overly poetic, relying heavily on abstract descriptions (e.g., dreams, forgotten memories, stardust) rather than grounding the narrative in tangible details.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romance between Fia and the fae character felt underdeveloped. Due to the constraint of Fia only being able to visit the fae lands once a month, there wasn’t enough time for the relationship to grow organically or feel authentic.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Fia, the female main character, is portrayed as very young and naive. Her inability to recognize the manipulations and twists that are obvious to the reader made her character frustrating at times.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  While the book has the potential for an engaging story with its unique ideas, the execution falls short. The overly poetic writing style and underdeveloped elements prevent the story from fully realizing its promise.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel has the kernels of an interesting story with its magical elements and fae lore, but the execution is lacking. The overly poetic writing, underdeveloped romance, and naive protagonist detract from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The love triangle—if it can be called that—felt somewhat lackluster, as Rogan and Fia's conversations became monotonous, and Eala came across as cold and unlikable. Fortunately, Irian brought life to the romance, and I appreciated how he connected with Fia through his storytelling.",

            "The introduction of Rogan felt abrupt, making it difficult to invest in their relationship initially. Fia and Irian's connection progressed too quickly, particularly after the 60% mark, leaving me wanting more scenes to develop their bond naturally. At times, the story felt disjointed, with a heavy focus on the full moon nights in the fae lands, which created a sense of isolated incidents rather than a cohesive narrative. The ending was intriguing yet confusing; being in Fia's perspective made it frustrating not to fully grasp what transpired, though this may be an intentional setup for the sequel.",
            "The relationship between Fia and Rogan is complex and nuanced, with Fia’s feelings evolving throughout the story. Rogan’s distrust of Fia’s magic adds depth to their dynamic, and I appreciated that their conflict didn’t culminate in a major blow-up. Instead, Fia learns that love should not require change. The love triangle is skillfully handled, focusing on Fia’s loyalties and the distinction between platonic and romantic love rather than mere indecision. Irian’s introduction is captivating, and his bargain with Fia to exchange stories offers a unique and vulnerable way to deepen their connection. Fia’s journey of self-acceptance and self-love is the book's highlight, beautifully portrayed through her evolving feelings toward the fae and her magic. Rogan’s reactions to Fia’s magic contrast with Irian’s, further enhancing Fia’s growth. Additionally, Corra, the sprite in the fort, adds whimsy and charm, quickly becoming one of my favorite characters.",

I wanted more scenes to make their connection feel more natural.  \n  - The story felt disjointed at times, focusing heavily on the full moon nights in the fae lands, which made it seem like isolated incidents rather than a cohesive arc.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  - The ending was intriguing but confusing. Being in Fia’s head, it was frustrating not to fully understand what happened, though this might be intentional as a setup for the second book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed this book, particularly Fia’s journey of self-acceptance, the unique romantic dynamics, and the whimsical gothic atmosphere. However, the pacing, world-building, and some aspects of the relationships could have been stronger. Despite these issues, I’m excited to read the second book and see where the story goes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  - I initially struggled with the audiobook, reaching the 40% mark before realizing I didn’t fully grasp the story.  \n  - The narrator had a soft, soothing Irish accent that fit the book’s vibe but was so calming that it sometimes made me nod off.  \n  - The narrator’s slight variations in character voices made dialogue scenes confusing without the written text to reference.  \n  - Having a physical copy helped immensely, especially with understanding the Irish Gaelic words used throughout the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n  - The writing is overly descriptive, with flowery language and multiple metaphors per paragraph or even sentence.  \n  - This excessive description made it hard to distinguish when something truly magical or significant was happening in the plot.  \n  - For example, I often questioned whether certain descriptions were literal or metaphorical, like green tendrils of plants snaking around a character’s spine.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The plot felt slow, with only two or three short action scenes throughout the entire book.  \n  - Much of the story felt like waiting around for the next full moon, with little happening in between.  \n  - There are a couple of spicy scenes toward the end, which might appeal to some readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the narrator’s soothing voice and the physical copy helped me better understand the story, I struggled with the overly descriptive writing style and slow pacing. The plot lacked significant action, and the excessive metaphors made it hard to discern key moments. However, the book’s atmosphere and the narrator’s performance were highlights.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Rogan’s storyline was particularly sad, and I pitied him more than anything. However, the relationships in the story felt underdeveloped and boring. I couldn’t buy into the dynamic of meeting someone three times and already being as invested as the person we spent much of the book hearing about.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The poetic writing style, while potentially appealing to some, didn’t work for me.

            "Fia is a resourceful, brave, and clever protagonist, yet she remains unaware of the mistreatment she has endured. Her time away from the kingdom and her deepening relationship with Irian catalyze her personal growth, which the author skillfully portrays. Irian stands out as a compelling character who encourages Fia to embrace her fae heritage and true self. In contrast, Rogan comes across as weak and irritating, resembling a spoiled man-boy, and I felt we spent too much time on him despite his lack of appeal. The love triangle/quadrangle is a central theme, but I believe Rogan shouldn't even be a contender; Irian is far more captivating. I particularly enjoyed the scenes between him and Fia, as their relationship feels genuine and meaningful.",

I am… kind of one of those readers. I love romance. However, this book never really felt like a genuine, heartstopping romance to me, but rather a melodrama with two male love interests whose only real personality traits are to be mysterious and attractive. For me, romance should complement all the other things happening in the story, rather than consume it.\n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  *A Feather So Black* started off promisingly. Selene leans much more into the detail of Irish mythology than many writers, and the land of the fae feels properly otherworldly and unknowable.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The MC, Fia, has a complicated relationship with her mother and compelling personal motivations for her quest. However, when she meets the second love interest, who basically feels like Darkling!lite, everything goes downhill. Fia’s internal monologue feels like watching a tennis match, as she quickly spins back and forth between two potential suitors. Any wits or self-determination she demonstrated early on go out the window as she continues to pursue both men despite plenty of evidence that this is a bad idea and neither being a great conversationalist.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The broader plot is promptly forgotten unless it can be used as a reason for Fia to change her mind about who she loves, again. I really wanted to love this book and hoped it would be a good entry point given I am daunted by the sheer scale of the romantasy genre. But I unfortunately couldn’t take the sheer levels of melodrama seriously and was hoping for something slightly different from this one.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *A Feather So Black* has strong elements in its world-building and initial character motivations, it ultimately falls short in delivering a compelling romance and maintaining a coherent plot. The melodrama and lack of depth in the love interests overshadowed the potential of the story, leaving me disappointed despite my initial excitement.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story was sluggish, spanning a year of minimal progress. Fia's narrative lacked depth, and her naivety and impulsive choices rendered her a disappointing protagonist. Despite her training as a killer, she readily trusted Eala and decided to commit murder without much consideration.",

Her naivety and impulsiveness made her a challenging protagonist to engage with. \n\n**Rogan:** He reminded me of Mal Oretsev, appearing selfish, self-centered, and spoiled. His thoughtlessness and failure to recognize Fia’s abuse were infuriating. Additionally, his flirtation with Fia, despite her clear disinterest, felt inappropriate. While I understood his desire to express his love, his assertion that only he knew how to love her was deeply misguided. \n\n**Irian:** Described as vicious and cruel, I found these portrayals exaggerated. He seemed more like a lonely individual than a seductive bad boy. The Fairyloot artwork of him was misleading, as it omitted his tattooed arms, which I found disappointing. \n\n**The Queen:** Her abusive and manipulative nature was evident in her harsh treatment of Fia, forcing her to live like a servant despite being a fosterling. \n\n**Eala:** Her role in the story was predictable, and her character lacked depth. Although she appeared to genuinely want Fia as an ally, her limited presence left her feeling underdeveloped. \n\n**Chandi and Corra:** These were the characters I genuinely liked. Corra, in particular, was generous in accommodating Fia’s demands, which I attributed to her own loneliness.",

I regretted not buying their version of Hurricane Wars, so I decided to get this one. However, I ended up feeling disappointed. Even the allure of the Fairyloot dust jacket faded as I found myself bored while reading.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Style:**  \n  The pacing felt slow and dull, stretching out a year of slow progress.

Her naivety and rashness made her a frustrating protagonist.  \n  - **Rogan:** He reminded me of Mal Oretsev, coming across as a selfish, self-centered, and spoilt character.

Fia, despite being the Queen's supposedly beloved foster daughter, is unloved and treated as a mere tool, even living in the servants' quarters. Rogan's inability to shave his own face felt unrealistic, especially in a kingdom constantly at war. Additionally, Eala and her mother came across as manipulative, while Fia's naivety only highlighted her foolishness.",

            "This novel offers a fresh retelling of Swan Lake, intertwining the realms of folk and humanity. It centers on Fia, a changeling skilled in combat and deception, who is sent by the queen to retrieve her biological daughter and a magical sword from the fae realm. The narrative delves into Fia’s internal struggle between her feelings for Rogan and her loyalty to the queen. While the plot is coherent, I found it challenging to remain engaged, often wishing Fia and Rogan would escape together due to the manipulative dynamics and untrustworthy characters surrounding them. The pacing felt slow, which hindered my investment in the story. Additionally, the transitions between Tir’nanog and the human realm were abrupt, with inconsistent time passage—what felt like mere minutes in Tir’nanog contrasted sharply with a fleeting month in the human realm. This inconsistency disrupted the flow and made immersion difficult.",
            "Fia's relationship with Rogan was compelling, but her interactions with her sister and the queen were frustrating due to their obvious manipulation. While the untrustworthy nature of the other love interest added tension, it ultimately failed to deepen my investment in the story.",

It follows Fia, a changeling trained in combat and deception, who is tasked by the queen to retrieve her biological daughter and a magical sword from the fae realm. The story explores Fia’s internal conflict with her feelings for Rogan and her loyalty to the queen. While the plot makes sense, I struggled to stay invested, often wishing Fia and Rogan would run away together due to the manipulative dynamics and untrustworthy characters.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The narrator’s Irish accent was excellent, and she seamlessly transitioned between character voices. I particularly enjoyed her portrayal of Kora/Cora. However, the slow pacing, though helpful for understanding the accent, became tedious over time. Additionally, the inclusion of Celtic words without clear explanations made it difficult to follow, and the unfamiliar character names were hard to keep track of in audio format.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is beautiful and rich with imagery, but the excessive use of similes and metaphors felt repetitive. Cutting back on these could have streamlined the book’s length without losing its impact.

            "I wanted to appreciate Fia's strength—she's introduced as a badass—but throughout the story, she often lacks agency, getting dragged around by other characters and making questionable decisions. The most compelling aspect of her journey is her struggle with the painful realization that the mother she adores has manipulated her all her life. I enjoy seeing characters with low self-esteem recognize their worth and grow, but Fia's development is hindered by her interactions with the two male love interests. \n\nRogan, the golden prince and Fia's childhood friend, reunites with her after four years for a mission that forces them to confront their complex past. However, their relationship feels overly focused on physical attraction, with Rogan's love expressed more through lust than genuine connection. On the other hand, Irian, the dark prince, initially appears menacing but turns out to be a softy. Yet, he also seems overly eager to get Fia undressed. The narration frequently emphasizes Fia's small stature compared to Irian's, and the repetitive use of the word *velvet* in the intimate scenes feels clichéd. It's hard to believe Irian could be genuinely smitten with Fia after just a few hours of interaction each month.",
            "This book feels like a refined version of Sarah J. Maas's work, showcasing a more skilled writer. Selene demonstrates a strong grasp of Celtic fairytales, delivering a narrative that retains the essence of Maas's style but with less melodrama. If you enjoy SJM's books but seek improved writing and world-building without the problematic elements, this is a great choice. You'll likely find it enjoyable.",

However, their relationship is incredibly horny, and Rogan's love for her is told and not shown, usually manifesting as lust.  \n  - The real love interest, Irian, is pretty bland. He's a dark prince who seems evil at first but is actually just a softy at heart, but he also can't wait to get the main character naked.  \n  - The narration constantly reminds the reader of how small Fia is and how big Irian is, and all the sex scenes contain the word \"velvet\" in exactly the context you're thinking.  \n  - It's hard to believe Irian would be smitten with Fia after interacting for a couple of hours one night out of every month.  \n\n- **Antagonist and Conflict:**  \n  - Eala's malice is pretty obvious from the literal first moment she comes on page, so it felt like I was sitting twiddling my thumbs while Fia agonized over bros vs hoes.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Comparison to Sarah J. Maas:**  \n  - This book is just Sarah J. Maas if she was a decent writer.  \n  - It's exactly like Sarah J. Maas, just with less growling, thank god.  \n  - Selene is a competent writer and clearly knows her stuff when it comes to Celtic fairytales.  \n  - If you like SJM books but are looking for better writing and world-building and don't want to read something as problematic, read this book. You'll probably like it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excels in world-building and draws beautifully from Celtic folklore, the main characters, particularly Fia, lack agency and depth. The romance feels shallow and overly focused on physical attraction, and the antagonist's motives are too obvious, making the conflict less engaging. Although the writing is competent and the audiobook narration is excellent, the story ultimately falls short of being truly compelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

Details were often narrated instead of woven into dialogue or action. Additionally, there were too many flashbacks that didn’t contribute to the plot or character development, and these were also told rather than shown.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was entertaining enough to keep me reading, though I often debated DNFing. I saw glimmers of excellence, but they were overshadowed by the book’s shortcomings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story had a compelling premise and moments of brilliance, it ultimately fell short due to underdeveloped execution, excessive telling, and a YA-like tone despite its potential adult classification. With more time and editing, this could have been a standout novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 ⭐️"

However, the initial love interest came across as bland, leaving me disengaged from their relationship for much of the book. I had an immediate distrust of the mother, while Irian earned my trust right away. The sister's character was perplexing, leading to moments of emotional whiplash.",

It follows Fia, a changeling raised as a weapon, on her quest to break the Swan curse on Princess Eala and restore magic to the human realm. While the plot unfolds at a slow, whimsical pace, it experiences a lull in the middle before delivering a satisfying conclusion. However, certain aspects, such as the unnamed and underdeveloped swans, feel incomplete, suggesting potential for further exploration in future installments.",

However, the urgency of their mission is undermined by their limited time in the folk realm, resulting in slow progress. Fia and Rogan seldom discuss their actions, which prevents them from uncovering schemes more quickly. Fia lacks agency; events unfold around her rather than through her initiative, making the narrative feel driven by necessity rather than her choices. The subplot involving the twelve maidens could have been further developed to enrich Fia's character arc and foster non-romantic relationships. Additionally, Fia's secret mission to find treasure for the Queen adds depth but remains underexplored.",
            "Fia, the protagonist, is a changeling grappling with the complexities of love and acceptance. While she has her moments, she often complains about not being embraced for her true self and falls into the allure of Irian, a dangerously charming character. Rogan, her childhood sweetheart, appears immature and spoiled, while Irian comes off as a shallow, attractive figure. Neither male lead possesses a compelling personality. Corra, a side character, stands out as a favorite but is unfortunately underutilized.",

However, the pacing felt strange due to the constraints of the plot, such as Fia and Rogan only being able to spend one night per month in the folk realm.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Fia, the protagonist, is a changeling struggling with what it means to love and be loved. While she wasn’t too bad, she often whined about not being accepted for her full self and fell into the \"damn he's hot\" trap with Irian, a dangerous character. Rogan, her childhood sweetheart, came across as immature and spoiled, while Irian felt like a \"very pretty cardboard cutout.\" Neither male lead had a winning personality. Corra, a side character, was a favorite but underutilized.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story revolves around Fia and Rogan’s mission to rescue Eala and 11 other women from Irian’s bind. However, the urgency of their mission clashes with their limited time in the folk realm, leading to a lack of progress. Fia and Rogan rarely discuss their actions in the folk realm, which hinders their ability to uncover schemes sooner. Fia doesn’t actively propel the story forward; instead, things happen to her, making the story feel like it continues out of necessity rather than her agency.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  There’s a love triangle between Fia, Rogan, and Irian. Rogan has the childhood sweetheart appeal, but Irian sees and accepts Fia’s hidden parts, unlike Rogan. However, neither romantic interest stood out as compelling.  \n\n- **World-Building and Terminology:**  \n  The story is set in a folk realm called Tir na nOg, but the world-building can be hard to follow due to jarring terminology casually thrown in.  \n\n- **Themes and Subplots:**  \n  The 12 maidens plotline could have been developed further to enhance Fia’s character arc and build non-romantic relationships. Additionally, Fia’s secret mission to find a treasure for the Queen adds complexity but isn’t fully explored.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a decent romantasy with captivating writing and an intriguing premise, but it suffers from uneven pacing, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of agency from the protagonist.

Themes of self-discovery, breaking free from societal expectations, and embracing one’s true nature were present, though they didn’t feel groundbreaking.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Lyra Selene’s writing is engaging and well-crafted. Despite the predictable elements, her prose kept me invested in the story. The pacing was steady, and the world-building, while not entirely unique, was immersive.\n\n- **Content and Tone:**  \n  The novel includes some mature language and tastefully written intimate scenes. While these elements didn’t detract from the story, they might not appeal to all readers, so I felt it was worth mentioning.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* is a solid addition to the faerie fantasy genre, though it doesn’t entirely escape the clichés that often define it. While I found the plot and characters predictable, Lyra Selene’s writing style and the protagonist’s journey of self-discovery kept me engaged. It’s not my favorite in the genre, but it’s far from the worst.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "I was immediately captivated by Irian, who met my expectations. However, Fia's incessant longing for Rogan and their repetitive discussions about their doomed relationship became tiresome, causing me to lose interest. Rogan's character lacked depth; I would have appreciated his perspective to make him more relatable. Additionally, Eala and Irian's viewpoints could have offered greater insight into the magical realm, which felt underexplored.",
            "The world-building was rich yet occasionally confusing, primarily due to the extensive terminology and the dual focus on the human world's political turmoil and the chaotic magical realm of the fair folk.

The narrative primarily serves as a setup for the next installment, with little occurring beyond what is described in the blurb. This results in a low-stakes story that lacks surprises or shocks.",

Fia and Rogan can only advance their quest to free Princess Eala one night each month, which diminishes the sense of urgency until the climax. The interludes in the human realm, where Fia tends a garden and befriends a sprite named Corra, further contribute to the narrative's sluggish pace.

The ambiguous ending suggests the author plans to continue the tale in future installments, leaving this one feeling incomplete.",
            "Fia experiences notable character growth, yet her empowerment arc is compromised by her ongoing acceptance of Rogan's mistreatment. Rogan embodies the archetype of a mediocre white man wielding excessive power, which undermines the story's theme of female empowerment. While the dark and brooding Fae, Irian, adds an intriguing layer, the revelation of one key character—either Irian or Rogan—as duplicitous nearly leads to catastrophic consequences.",

Rogan felt one-dimensional and lacked depth, while Irian, though cooler due to his powers, didn’t convince me of his connection to the main character, Fia.  \n  - **Main Character (Fia):**  \n    Fia had potential but often annoyed me. It felt like she couldn’t form independent thoughts, which made her less compelling.  \n\n- **Romance and Spice:**  \n  As a romantasy, the romance fell flat for me. I wasn’t invested in the love triangle or the relationships, and the sex scenes felt cringeworthy, leading me to skim through them.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The novel felt overly long at nearly 500 pages. The structure, with Fia’s interactions in the Fae world limited to once a month, resulted in uneven pacing—brief moments of action followed by lengthy stretches of mundane activities.  \n\n- **Potential for the Series:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I see potential in this series. The bones of the story are interesting, and some secondary characters show complexity. I’m hopeful that future installments will focus more on the fantasy elements and less on the romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t meet my expectations, I appreciate its potential and plan to continue with the series, hoping for stronger fantasy elements and character development in the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75 stars rounded up to 3.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and Orbit for providing an ARC in exchange for an honest review!"

            "The characters in the story are well-crafted, with Fia standing out to me in particular. While some reviews suggest she lacks depth, I believe this is intentional; she perceives herself as a shadow, a bystander, or an NPC. By the end, she realizes she is more than how others define her, showcasing significant character development despite occasional regressions to her old self. \n\nRogan, on the other hand, was the most frustrating character, reminiscent of Chaol from *Throne of Glass*. However, by the conclusion, I felt sympathy for him as I began to understand his motivations. While his actions are somewhat justified, he struggles to grasp love and how to treat the person he claims to care for, which is evident in a particular line after he and Fia sleep together. \n\nIrian is quite likable, but I wish we had seen more of his darker, morally ambiguous side. He has ample reason to unleash chaos, and I hope this aspect is explored further. As for Eala, I won’t give away any spoilers, but I sensed something about her from the start. Corra, however, remains my favorite character.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  - I’ve seen this book compared to *The Cruel Prince*, but I don’t see the similarity. I hated *The Cruel Prince* because I found it boring, lackluster, and the characters’ personalities and development were shallow. In contrast, I enjoyed this book.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - I haven’t read a book with this type of writing style before. While I appreciated its uniqueness, I sometimes felt a bit lost due to the extensive descriptions, which made it difficult for me to visualize the world.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters were nicely written. Fia, in particular, stood out to me. While some reviews describe her as lacking depth, I believe she was purposely written this way because she doesn’t see herself as a main character. She sees herself as a shadow, a bystander, or an NPC. However, by the end, she realizes she is more than what others make her out to be. This gave her great character development, as you see her grow throughout the story, even if she sometimes reverts back to her old self.  \n  - Rogan was the most annoying character, reminiscent of Choal from *Throne of Glass*. However, I felt sorry for him by the end, as I understood why he is the way he is. His actions are justified to some extent, but he doesn’t seem to understand love or how to treat the person he claims to love, which is evident in one line after he and Fia sleep together.  \n  - Irian is quite likable, but I wish we saw more of his darkness and morally grey side. He has every reason to scorch Earth, and I hope we see that explored further.  \n  - Eala: I don’t want to give spoilers, but I knew something about her straightaway.  \n  - Corra is my favorite character.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements (Spice):**  \n  - There is spice in this book, and it’s written well. However, I questioned the choice of location (the stairs).  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  - The twist at the end was a nice surprise. I didn’t expect Fia to do what she did, which added an enjoyable layer of unpredictability.  \n  - While the book didn’t completely hook me, it left me wanting more due to the many unanswered questions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book despite some moments of confusion with the writing style and a few character-related frustrations. The character development, particularly Fia’s journey, stood out to me, and the twist at the end was a pleasant surprise. While it didn’t fully captivate me, it left me intrigued and eager for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 out of 5."

            "The book had several shortcomings, with too few engaging elements. The love triangle (or square) was particularly disappointing, as it began with promise but lost its appeal after the first 30%. The swan girls, a key aspect of the story, were underdeveloped and mentioned only occasionally. Additionally, the intriguing fae creature summoned by Fia was relegated to a mere plot device for riddles, which added confusion rather than clarity. Overall, Fia’s powers felt underutilized, especially considering her role in the fae lands.",
            "The characters in the book lack meaningful development. Fia remains trapped in her belief that she is unlovable and merely a weapon, while Irian broods without providing insight into his actions or motivations. Rogan feels like a placeholder, contributing little to the story or experiencing any growth. The romance is poorly executed; the characters make no effort to deepen their relationships beyond poorly written sex scenes. Fia's attraction to her love interests—a human prince and a shadow magic fae—feels unclear and unconvincing. In contrast, Eala emerges as a strong character who drives the plot forward, highlighting Fia's lack of agency.",

            "The love triangle in the story didn't resonate with me, primarily due to Rogan's underdevelopment as a character. His reluctance to take action made him an unconvincing love interest. Although his reasons for remaining in the marriage were understandable, his failure to choose Fia indicated he wasn't the primary romantic lead.

Their journey of getting to know each other added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Love Triangle and Character Development:**  \n  The love triangle aspect fell flat for me, mainly because of Rogan. He felt underdeveloped as a character, and his lack of effort to set things right made him unconvincing as a love interest. While his reasons for staying in the marriage were valid, his inability to choose Fia made it clear he wasn’t the main love interest.  \n\n- **Fia’s Naivety and Decision-Making:**  \n  Considering Fia was raised to be a weapon, her naivety was frustrating. Despite being warned about the trickery of the fae courts, she took everyone at their word. For example, she agreed to a bargain with Eala without asking for anything in return and immediately believed everything Eala told her, despite Eala’s obvious experience in manipulating the fae courts.  \n\n- **Villain Transparency and Plausibility:**  \n  Eala was far too transparent as a villain to be believable. From her first interaction with Fia, she seemed to both know too much and claim to know too little, which made her motivations feel inconsistent and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Fia’s Relationship with Her Mother:**  \n  Fia’s relationship with her mother was intriguing, as she was her mother’s first attempt at creating a weapon and was evidently traumatized by that. However, I found it hard to believe that Fia, at just 8 years old, could have fully understood her mother’s intentions or her relationship with the Druid.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had strong storytelling and an interesting dynamic between Fia and Irian, it was let down by an underdeveloped love triangle, Fia’s frustrating naivety, and a transparent villain. The exploration of Fia’s relationship with her mother added depth but felt somewhat implausible given her age at the time.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️"

While many of the twists were predictable, there was a moment towards the end that surprised me, and I appreciated the author’s choice in that scene.  \n\n- **Character Development (Fia):**  \n  Fia, a half-fae, half-human protagonist with amnesia, is deeply shaped by her longing for unconditional love from her mentally abusive mother, the Queen. Her behavior is tied to the scraps of affection she received, which made her character compelling. However, I was frustrated that she didn’t fully unleash her forest magic to confront Eala, as it felt like a missed opportunity for her to embrace her power.  \n\n- **Love Interests:**  \n  The two love interests were fine, but I never felt particularly attached to either of them. One was constantly described in terms of moonlight, which became tiresome. Additionally, I disliked the \"jelly belly\" moment, as it used negative language to describe body types, which felt unnecessary.  \n\n- **Themes and Growth:**  \n  I appreciated the theme of a woman maturing, accepting herself, and growing alongside a love interest who supports her rather than holding her back. This aspect resonated with me and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Engagement and Investment:**  \n  While I enjoyed certain elements of the book, I never felt deeply invested in the characters. It took me time to get through the story, and it didn’t linger with me after I finished. However, there are enough intriguing elements to make me want to pick up the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws, including nonsensical descriptions, predictable twists, and a lack of deep character investment, the book offers an atmospheric ride with themes of self-acceptance and growth. While it didn’t fully captivate me, the unique elements, such as forest magic and the retelling of *The Swan Princess*, kept me engaged enough to continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

            "This story is riddled with plot holes that I found hard to overlook, even though I usually can if the narrative is engaging. The timeline is particularly unbelievable; the characters can only access the land of the fae one night a month, yet we witness almost none of the year’s worth of events that occur in between. It strained my suspension of disbelief to see everything conveniently align to keep the plot moving—like a magic castle providing all their survival needs or a queen allowing a key character to vanish for a year with minimal oversight. Even in fantasy, the world must adhere to some internal logic. While I appreciate familiar tropes, the sheer number here made the story painfully predictable. I anticipated every twist and reveal, as they felt overly familiar and clichéd.",

Whenever I put it down, I wasn’t excited to pick it back up, and it often felt like a chore. However, every time I jumped back in, I teetered between enjoyment and absolute love.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose and writing were beautiful. I highlighted several passages that I really loved.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was a little weird, with big time jumps. While the plot construction required it—since the full moon nights were crucial to the story—I wasn’t a huge fan of this approach.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was super unique. As a ballet fan, I loved the nod to *Swan Lake*, with white swans cursed to change into swans by day and maidens by night, dancing in the fae world at lavish parties.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I liked how flawed each of the characters were. Fia’s character arc, in particular, was satisfying to follow as she learned to love herself. However, I was not a fan of Rogen’s character. While I saw admirable qualities in him, his relationship with Fia was mostly in the past, which made it hard for me to develop the same soft spot for him that she carried. There were also some definite red flags from the beginning.  \n  Fia’s stepmom and stepsister were… well, I don’t want to spoil anything, but they were not my favorite characters.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I don’t think I’ll be continuing this series. I thought it was a standalone, and I wish it had been. I’ve decided to implement a new rule: any time I decide I don’t want to continue with a book, I dock it half a star.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book had moments of brilliance, particularly in its writing style, world-building, and Fia’s character arc. However, the pacing, certain characters, and the realization that it’s part of a series left me with mixed feelings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️ (Initially considered 4 stars but docked half a star due to not wanting to continue the series.)"

However, the comparison to *For the Wolf* is pretty accurate.\n\n- **Enjoyable Elements:**  \n  I enjoyed the quest, the fae world, and the main character’s magic. These aspects kept me engaged and added depth to the story.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Unfortunately, the ending felt confused and didn’t quite fit the rest of the story. It didn’t leave me eager to read the sequel; instead, I was just glad it was over.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character’s internal conflict was interesting, but it wasn’t fully fleshed out. The focus on the quest and the love triangle overshadowed this aspect, which was a missed opportunity.\n\n- **World-Building and Logistics:**  \n  The main character spends one night a month in the fae realm, but we see less and less of her time there as the story progresses. While this makes sense from an interest perspective, it doesn’t logistically. I’m not sure why the time frame wasn’t shortened to have the portal open more often, especially since it felt like a contrived way to build the main romance.\n\n- **Mini Stories Within the Story:**  \n  I generally don’t enjoy mini stories within a larger narrative, and this book included a lot of them, particularly during the flirting scenes between the endgame love interests. These mini stories were in third person without much context, making it hard to connect with them. This was unfortunate, as they took up a significant portion of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, it was an interesting read. If you enjoy portal romantic fantasy, this might be for you. However, the confused ending, underdeveloped character conflict, and logistical issues with the world-building detracted from my enjoyment. Thank you to NetGalley and the publishers for the ARC.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I would recommend it to romance readers venturing into fantasy or those new to romantasy, but it didn’t fully meet my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5-3 stars.  \n\nThank you NetGalley, Orbit Books, and Hachette Audio for an e-book and audio ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review."

The Gaelic terminology was challenging for me, as I typically avoid books that are difficult to follow. I take full responsibility for not preparing myself better. While I know this is the start of a series, I was hoping for more answers by the end. As it stands, I’m not particularly compelled to read the next installment, though I may reconsider. It took me a while to engage with the story, and finishing it felt like a lengthy process. Although the descriptions were rich, they sometimes became excessive, causing me to lose track of the narrative.",

The explanations provided were insufficient, leaving me confused about their separation and significance. While I understand there was a war, questions lingered: Why were the girls taken? Were they chosen for a specific purpose? Were the other girls also princesses? Unfortunately, these points remained unexplained, unless I overlooked them."

However, I wish I had done more research into what the story was actually going to entail. It was very hard for me to keep up with all of the Gaelic terminology, as books like this are not usually ones I go for because I find them difficult to follow. This part of my review is fully my responsibility for not looking into it beforehand.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I felt like the world-building was basically non-existent. Especially with there being two different realms, I don’t think it was explained well enough. I was left feeling confused about a lot of the meaning behind the different realms and why they were so separate. I understand there was a war, but why did those girls get stolen? Were they chosen for a purpose? Were the other girls also princesses? No explanation, unless I missed it.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  It took me a long time to get interested in the book, and it also took me a long time to finish. While it was descriptive, at times it felt overly descriptive, and I forgot what was being explained in the first place.  \n\n- **Closure and Series Potential:**  \n  I know this will be a series, but I do wish we could have gotten some answers at the end.

Their natural style and accent effectively set the scene and immersed me in the depths of Irish folklore. I cannot fault a single thing about their performance and fully appreciate their work.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Selene's words were poetic and raw, which I loved. The natural imagery and depth of folklore were beautifully executed, adding a rich layer to the story.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  I found the book incredibly long and occasionally struggled to follow it. At times, I considered not finishing it because I didn’t feel invested in the story. However, this wasn’t necessarily a fault of the author but rather a reflection of my personal preference.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt a bit flat to me. I didn’t feel invested in their fates or the love they shared, which made it harder for me to connect with the story.\n\n- **Genre Balance:**  \n  The book felt more focused on romance than fantasy, which isn’t my preference. I enjoy fantasy as the main plot with romance as a subplot, but this leaned heavily into romance with fantasy as a secondary element. The spicy scenes, while fine, seemed to dominate the climax of the story rather than the adventure.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this isn’t a bad book, but it’s a long read with a strong emphasis on romance. If you enjoy romance-driven stories with poetic writing and rich folklore, this might be for you.

I felt like I was thrown into the story without enough context, which made it difficult to follow. The abundance of Gaelic terminology added to the confusion, especially since I missed the glossary at the end of the book. It wasn’t until about 30% into the story that I finally understood what was happening and became interested.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The use of nature metaphors was overwhelming at first, to the point where it felt excessive. However, they eventually eased to a more bearable level as the story progressed.\n\n- **Character Connection:**  \n  It took me a while to connect with the characters, but once I did, I found them engaging. I’ve noticed that other reviewers have shared similar experiences with the slow start and delayed character connection.\n\n- **Plot and Originality:**  \n  Despite the slow beginning, the story itself was unique and intriguing. While it draws from the swan princess retelling, it offers a fresh and darkly intriguing path. The complicated, manipulative family dynamics and the strange, dark elements added depth and beauty to the world.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a slow and confusing start, it eventually became an engaging and unique read. The intricate family dynamics and dark intrigue made the story stand out, though the initial pacing and overwhelming metaphors were challenging.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars"

However, the book picked up again starting from the second half.  \n\n- **Tropes and Plot Elements:**  \n  I wasn’t totally convinced when I discovered the book included the love triangle trope, but I ended up being glad it was there. I really couldn’t stand Rogan, so when Irian was introduced, I was totally into it!  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  One issue I had was that some relationships developed way too quickly. For example, Irian and Fia’s relationship had so much potential, and if they had stayed enemies for longer, it would have had a greater impact.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  All things considered, this was an entertaining fantasy book with gripping dynamics and plot twists.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues and rushed relationships, the novel was an engaging read with a captivating world, intriguing characters, and unexpected plot developments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75⭐️  \n\nThank you to the publisher for this ARC in exchange for an honest review."

The story felt average, and I wasn’t fully engaged.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters lacked depth, which made the love triangle feel uninteresting and underdeveloped.  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The ideas for the characters and the world-building were intriguing, but they felt like they were only beginning to take shape in this story. They weren’t fully realized or well-executed in my opinion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *A Feather So Black* had potential with its interesting concepts for characters and world-building, the execution fell short. The lack of depth in the main characters and the underdeveloped love triangle made the story feel average overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The pacing felt too slow and repetitive, which made it difficult to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n  I enjoyed the arguments between Rogan and Fia. Their shared history and forbidden love made them an intriguing pair. While Rogan was often selfish, I found him to be a much better character than Irian, who felt overly perfect and designed to be the \"better choice\" for Fia.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  I was not a fan of the love triangle. It felt forced and detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *A Feather So Black* had a strong start and some compelling character dynamics, the slow pacing, repetitive plot, and unappealing love triangle ultimately diminished my enjoyment of the novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The narrative follows her journey of rediscovery as she questions the authenticity of the love she has experienced and reevaluates her understanding of her world and family.

While Fia's development is compelling, the supporting characters lack depth, often appearing one-dimensional: the malevolent mother, the childhood crush prince who values only Fia's human side, the wicked sister, and the brooding fae lord.

The book devotes excessive time to Fia’s internal musings and her relationship with Rogan, which detracts from the plot and the development of other key relationships, particularly with Irian, the fae. The narrative struggles to progress due to Fia's limited time in the fae realm—only 24 hours a month—making the in-between periods feel like filler with minimal meaningful advancement. As a result, the love triangle overshadows other plot elements, leaving them underdeveloped.",

Her internal struggles and nostalgia for Rogan are central to the narrative, yet her growth is hindered by the overwhelming focus on their relationship. **Rogan:** I found Rogan intensely unlikable. He comes across as spoiled, patronizing, and dismissive of Fia, lacking both self-awareness and responsibility. **Irian:** Irian, the enigmatic fae, is underdeveloped. His morally ambiguous nature and connection with Fia are intriguing, but their relationship feels rushed and overshadowed by the emphasis on Rogan.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  The cover is absolutely stunning, with colors that immediately drew me in. I picked the book solely because of its beautiful cover.\n\n- **Premise:**  \n  The premise is interesting, focusing on a changeling girl named Fia who was left by the fae in place of the Queen’s stolen daughter. The concept of a changeling who grows and ages, raised by a Queen who emotionally abuses her, is intriguing.\n\n- **Execution:**  \n  Unfortunately, the execution falls short. The book spends too much time on Fia’s internal musings and her relationship with Rogan, which detracts from the plot and the development of other relationships, particularly with Irian, the fae.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - **Fia:** Fia is a complex character, raised in an abusive environment that makes her feel worthless. Her internal struggles and nostalgia for Rogan are central to the story, but her growth feels stunted by the focus on her relationship with him.  \n  - **Rogan:** I disliked Rogan intensely. He is spoiled, patronizing, and dismissive of Fia. His lack of self-awareness and responsibility makes him an unappealing character.  \n  - **Irian:** Irian, the mysterious fae, is underdeveloped. His morally grey nature and the bond with Fia are intriguing, but their relationship feels rushed and overshadowed by the focus on Rogan.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The plot struggles to move forward due to the limited time Fia can spend in the fae realm (only 24 hours a month). The in-between periods feel like filler, with little meaningful progression. The love triangle dominates the narrative, leaving other aspects of the plot underdeveloped.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is pretty, but it lacks substance. While the prose is aesthetically pleasing, it doesn’t compensate for the lack of plot and relationship development.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  The book sets up potential for an interesting sequel, but I found this installment too lackluster to continue with the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a beautiful cover and an intriguing premise, its execution falls flat. The overemphasis on the love triangle and the underdeveloped relationship with Irian, combined with a slow-moving plot, made the reading experience disappointing. Despite the potential for a sequel, I don’t plan to continue with the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe book felt very \"so-so\" to me, lacking in both plot and relationship development."

It was engaging and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I found the author’s writing a little repetitive.

However, I won’t be picking up the rest of the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing magic and fae world, the repetitive writing style detracted from the experience.

Within just 50 pages, she starts dating a dark, brooding, morally ambiguous man and quickly falls for him.

The book felt like a combination of *Swan Lake* and *12 Dancing Princesses*, with a darker mood and Celtic inspiration. I particularly loved the changeling story, and the twist on whether the queen actually loved Fia or was just using her was really well-done.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing felt very confusing. Days, weeks, and months seemed to pass without any significant plot changes. There were moments where Fia did something \"for days\" or \"weeks passed and nothing had changed,\" which took me out of the flow of the story. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it felt like nothing did. Perhaps listening to the audiobook contributed to this disconnect, but I’m not entirely sure.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance, or rather, the multiple romances, were disappointing. The first half focused on Fia yearning for her childhood best friend, and they even got together. However, without any new information, she suddenly realized they couldn’t be together and ended it. Within 50 pages, she was going on daily dates with a dark, brooding, morally-grey man and quickly fell head over heels for him. This man was a walking cliche, with lines like \"I am not a good man,\" and the romance felt flat, rushed, and unnecessarily intense, especially since the two characters barely interacted before the halfway point.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters lacked depth and detail, which made the story fall short for me. However, the last 10% of the book was intriguing, particularly the introduction of Fia’s sister, who seems like she’ll be a very interesting character in the sequel.

I empathized with the FMC (female main character) due to her manipulative mother, as I could relate to that dynamic.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building in the beginning drew me in and gave me *Labyrinth* vibes (the David Bowie type). It almost felt like a fever dream while reading, which I actually loved.  \n\n- **Character Appreciation:**  \n  Special shoutout to my favorite character in the book, Corra!  \n\n- **Mythology and Retellings:**  \n  I’m a fan of mythology and retellings when done well, and this book did a good job at hitting most of my requirements.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Some metaphors were quite beautiful, but the further I got into the book, the more it leaned into purple prose, which isn’t my preferred style of writing.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Repetition:**  \n  There is a love square, which I usually don’t mind, but the dialogue between the prince and Fia was SO repetitive that I almost wanted to fast forward through their scenes. Additionally, the FMC is wildly trusting despite being repeatedly told how untrustworthy the fair folk are.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The middle of the book fell somewhat flat, as it seemed the author struggled to push the plot along at some points.  \n\n- **Repetitive Descriptors:**  \n  My biggest gripe was the repetitive use of words and arguments. I read about \"broad shoulders\" and \"kaleidoscope\" as descriptors more than I would have preferred.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI wanted to love this book, but it fell mostly into a \"good\" spot rather than a \"great\" one for me.

Fia must also steal a magical sword from the princess’s captor, Irian. While the premise intrigued me, the pacing was uneven; the first half dragged, and I nearly gave up several times. However, the second half significantly improved, particularly as it explored Fia’s evolving relationship with Irian. Overall, the story felt predictable, with the love triangle trope and its resolution being easy to foresee, which diminished some of the tension. Despite this, the latter half managed to hold my interest, and I plan to continue with the series.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I picked up *A Feather so Black* because it was compared to *The Cruel Prince* and *For the Wolf*, two series I really enjoyed. However, I initially disagreed with those comparisons and found the beginning of the book underwhelming. It took me until about 40% into the story to finally get invested.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story follows Fia, the changeling daughter of the high queen, as she teams up with her former lover and childhood best friend, Rogan, to rescue the princess she replaced. Fia is also tasked with stealing a magical sword from the princess’s captor, Irian. While the premise intrigued me, the pacing was uneven. The first half of the book dragged, and I almost gave up on it multiple times. However, the story improved significantly in the second half, especially when it focused on Fia’s evolving relationship with Irian.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  Fia’s interactions with Irian were the highlight of the book for me. As she got to know him, she began questioning her relationships with her adoptive mother and Rogan. This added depth to her character and made the story more engaging. However, I found the love triangle unnecessary and predictable. It was clear early on that the morally grey love interest, Irian, would come out on top.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  Overall, the story felt fairly predictable. The love triangle trope and its resolution were easy to foresee, which diminished some of the tension. Despite this, the latter half of the book managed to hold my interest, and I plan to continue with the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *A Feather so Black* had a slow and unremarkable start, it eventually picked up momentum and became an engaging read, particularly in the second half. The relationship between Fia and Irian was the standout element, though the predictability of the plot and the unnecessary love triangle were drawbacks. Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the latter part of the book enough to want to continue the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story can be challenging to grasp, as it centers on a single day of interaction each month, leaving the intervening time largely unexplored. This structure can create a sense of artificial rush, leading to elements like \"insta-love.\"",
            "In this story, Fia, the female main character, is a changeling trained as a spy and assassin by the high queen Eithne. While she undergoes a self-acceptance arc, I occasionally struggled to empathize with her, as the writing didn't fully capture her emotional depth. The love interest offers engaging banter and serves as an effective foil to Fia, highlighting the contrasts in their characters.",
            "The world-building is both intriguing and rich, featuring concepts such as the division between realms, gates guarded by protectors, Treasures that bind magic, and the significance of bargains. However, I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of this captivating world, as it feels somewhat underdeveloped despite its compelling elements.",
            "This fantasy romance novel artfully weaves together elements of Swan Lake and Irish mythology. It is deeply character-driven, exploring relationship conflicts through a rich tapestry of love tropes, including love triangles, forbidden love, unrequited love, filial bonds, friendship, and dysfunctional parental relationships.",

While the world-building is intriguing, it could have been more developed, and the pacing occasionally feels rushed.

She has a self-acceptance arc, but at times, I found it hard to empathize with her due to the writing not fully conveying her emotional depth.  \n  - The love interest provides engaging banter and serves as a good foil to Fia, adding contrast to her character.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The pacing can be difficult to conceptualize, as the story focuses on one day of interaction per month, with everything in between glossed over.  \n  - This structure can make the story feel artificially rushed at times, contributing to elements like “insta-love.”  \n\n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  - Despite its flaws, the novel is engaging and a quick read.  \n  - It is a commendable adult debut, and I look forward to seeing what the author writes next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis fantasy romance offers a unique blend of Swan Lake and Irish mythology, with a strong focus on character relationships and love tropes.

When it came to the point that they loved each other, I was confused AF—it happened very quickly.\n- **Pacing and Engagement:** It took me longer than normal to power through the book. I never felt a sense of urgency or desperation to continue reading.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite the confusion and pacing issues, I did enjoy reading this book. The beautiful writing and intricate world-building were highlights, even if some aspects felt underdeveloped or rushed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Furthermore, the characters lack depth, making it challenging to form a genuine connection or fully understand them.",

While the story attempts to portray her journey toward self-empowerment and recognizing past mistreatment, this growth feels superficial and unconvincing. Additionally, the characters lack depth, making it difficult to feel attached to or truly understand them.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book claims to explore themes of female empowerment and self-confidence, but these themes are not effectively conveyed. The narrative often devolves into romantic and sexual angst, overshadowing the intended message. Despite being marketed as an adult novel, the tone and content feel more aligned with young adult fiction, with the exception of the protagonist’s overt sexuality.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book attempts to blend Celtic folklore, female empowerment, and adult themes, it ultimately falls short in execution.

            "The plot felt repetitive, particularly during the lengthy periods when Fia and the prince waited each month for the full moon in an abandoned location. This setup grew monotonous, and it was unclear why they couldn't simply return home and travel to Tir na nóg only when necessary. The ending was frustrating, offering few answers and leaving the fates of the side characters unresolved. While I enjoyed the romance, largely due to Irian's character and his interactions with Fia, the love triangle involving the prince was poorly executed and added to my overall frustration. The book was excessively long, taking me over two months to finish, with much of the content feeling unnecessary. A significant portion could have been trimmed, especially the repetitive sections where Fia constantly reiterated her role as a weapon, which became tedious and unnecessarily prolonged the novel.",

In contrast, Irian was likable, and I appreciated the dynamic between him and Fia, even if their romance lacked depth.

Overall, the story resembled other fantasy romances too closely, lacking a distinctive element to set it apart.",

Additionally, the phrase “ice-chased ___” appeared multiple times without clear meaning, leading to confusion. The frequent use of the word “whore” felt excessive and uncomfortable.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **World-Building and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The fairytale-like world filled with monsters (both human and fae) and maidens was captivating.  \n  - Selene's lyrical writing style stood out, with numerous passages highlighted for their beauty.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  - Heather O'Sullivan's narration was phenomenal, bringing the dialect, pronunciation, and character of Corra to life in a way that brought joy.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Fia’s growth as a protagonist, particularly her journey toward self-love, was a strong point.  \n  - Rogan’s character, described as having \"toxic golden retriever vibes,\" was well-crafted but often unpleasant to read.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The book introduced many plot threads, but few were fully expanded upon, leaving some elements feeling unresolved or underdeveloped.  \n  - A scene where Fia is attacked in the forest by a member of the Gentry was intriguing but lacked follow-up, leaving questions unanswered.  \n  - The pacing felt uneven, with new information consistently introduced but not always fleshed out, and too much time spent \"between\" scenes.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Resonance:**  \n  - The story’s exploration of manipulation and self-discovery, particularly Fia’s struggle against those who sought to control her, was compelling.  \n  - The book’s darker tone and themes of betrayal and tragedy resonated, though they left the reader uncertain about the story’s ultimate direction.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Books:**  \n  - While the story has significant potential, the unresolved plot threads and pacing issues left the reader torn about whether to continue with the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A FEATHER SO BLACK* is a beautifully written and creatively imagined novel with a strong protagonist and a captivating fairytale atmosphere. However, its underdeveloped plot threads, uneven pacing, and unresolved elements left the reader feeling conflicted. While the audiobook narration and Fia’s character growth were highlights, the book’s potential was not fully realized, leaving the reader uncertain about continuing the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 2 out of 3 Goodreads friends who read the book gave it 5 stars."

            "The book suffers from disorganization and poor pacing, primarily due to an overemphasis on backstories and side plots. This scattered approach undermines the narrative's cohesion. While the central premise is intriguing, the story often loses focus, with the main plot overshadowed by excessive world-building and numerous tangential narratives. The ending is particularly unsatisfying, leaving many characters and subplots unresolved.",
            "Fia's magic is intriguingly depicted, showcasing both its positive and negative facets. Eala, Fia's sister, emerges as a compelling character, with her personality gradually unfolding throughout the story. However, Fia's repetitive internal monologue about feeling unlovable and made of \"dark things\" comes across as overly YA and becomes grating. The constant miscommunication between Fia and Rogan makes their relationship feel immature. While the romance is a central focus, the intimate scenes lack depth and feature awkward phrasing that feels out of place. Although the book is classified as adult, it reads more like New Adult, with characters displaying traits typical of both YA and NA genres.",
            "The imagery is stunning and vividly establishes the setting, especially around the ruins where Fia and Rogan reside. However, the world-building becomes overly detailed about a third of the way through, which detracts from the plot.",
            "This story is a must-read for fans of fairytale retellings and romance-driven fantasy with a touch of spice. It appeals to those who appreciate slower-paced narratives filled with intriguing, unresolved questions."

        "conclusion": "While the book has potential with its interesting premise, beautiful imagery, and compelling characters like Eala, it ultimately falls short due to excessive world-building, poor pacing, and an unsatisfying ending. The repetitive internal dialogue and immature character dynamics further detract from the experience. It may appeal to readers who enjoy slower, romance-driven fantasy, but it left me feeling disappointed overall.",

While there are similarities, they felt more like a copy-and-paste rather than inspired or innovative. The story seemed to follow a checklist of fantasy tropes without adding depth or chemistry.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements (Love Triangle):**  \n  The love triangle was a central focus, but it lacked emotional depth and connection. The main character’s past with one love interest was mentioned, but her immediate shift to the other made the triangle feel unbalanced and unconvincing. The love interests themselves felt one-dimensional, existing solely as romantic props rather than fully developed characters.  \n\n- **Use of Tropes:**  \n  The story relied heavily on clichéd fantasy tropes, such as the dark, brooding character versus the light, comedic one, and repetitive prophecies/conflicts. While these might appeal to readers new to the genre, they felt overused and uninspired for seasoned fantasy readers.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The narrative spanned a long period but only provided snippets of moments, making it hard to connect with the characters or feel invested in their journey. The story lacked meaningful action and weight, with much of the conflict feeling superficial.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose was beautiful and poetic, with occasional standout lines that enhanced the reading experience. However, the excessive focus on inessential details, like elaborate descriptions of outfits or seating arrangements, detracted from the overall flow and impact of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt underdeveloped, with little connectivity or growth beyond their roles in the plot. The lack of meaningful interactions or actions made it difficult to root for them or feel engaged in their struggles.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Feather So Black* had a strong beginning but ultimately fell flat due to its reliance on overused tropes, lack of meaningful character development, and uneven pacing. While the writing was poetic and occasionally captivating, the story failed to deliver depth or emotional resonance, leaving me wishing for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe novel lies on the middle-lower end of the scale for me, as I struggled to connect with the story or its characters."

            "The plot attempts to weave in multiple elements, including several villains and a romance, which ultimately dilutes the story. It would have been more effective if the book had concentrated on a single central theme instead of spreading itself too thin.",
            "The romance between Fia and Irian felt forced and lacked depth, making their supposed \"destiny\" together unconvincing and their relationship ultimately meaningless. The dynamic between Irian and Fia’s mother was awkward, reminiscent of a \"weird uncle.\" Many characters were underdeveloped, with Eala standing out as particularly two-dimensional; her villain arc was predictable and uninspired. Both Fia and Irian also lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with them. Surprisingly, Rogan emerged as the most fleshed-out character, though he still fell short in terms of quality—he simply stood out in comparison to the others.",
            "The writing had its strong moments, but some descriptions felt repetitive and excessive, like the “vengeful beast” that was drenched in “vengeance,” which almost made me stop reading.",
            "The world-building in this book was minimal and challenging to follow. The narrative attempted to juggle too many elements simultaneously, which obscured the characters' motivations. A more focused approach on a central conflict, such as the wars between fae and humans or among the fae themselves, would have added clarity and depth to the story."

It would have been better if the author focused on one central conflict, such as the wars between fae and humans or fae and other fae, to provide clarity and depth.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance between Fia and Irian felt forced and lacked depth. The idea that they were “destined to be together” was unconvincing, and their relationship didn’t feel meaningful.

I found the swan sister intriguing and wished we had seen more of her. The same applies to the Brunette Love Interest; their potential was underutilized. Given the book's length, it felt unnecessary for so few characters to evolve, with the exception of the Blonde Love Interest.",

I wanted more of the swan sister—she was so interesting, yet we saw so little of her. The same goes for the Brunette Love Interest. There was no reason for a book this long to have so few characters develop or move forward, except maybe the Blonde Love Interest.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book needed multiple POVs in my opinion. The pacing suffered due to the \"crossing realms once a month\" trope, which made the story feel disjointed and lazy. It threw all sense of pace out the window and made relationships, partnerships, and friendships feel too easy and unbelievable.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  While there was a lot of influence taken from pre-existing Celtic folklore and mythology, which I found enjoyable, the Faerie world itself was barely featured in this 496-page book. The lack of world-building was disappointing, especially given the strong premise and first few chapters.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I was disappointed with the book.

Although Fia was described as a \"weapon,\" this aspect of her character was never effectively demonstrated. She was manipulated and deceived throughout the story, yet remained oblivious, which was frustrating.

While I was excited about the changeling theme, the narrative was filled with surface-level ideas that were poorly integrated with other recent romantasy tropes. The plot didn’t provide meaningful explanations, especially regarding the world-building, which felt like a distant backdrop rather than an integral part of the story.  \n\n- **Characters and Agency:**  \n  The characters were frustrating and lacked real motives or agency. They felt like thin paper dolls, moving through the story without meaningful development or purpose. Their actions often didn’t align with the narrative, making them feel disconnected and annoying.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The love square was predictable and overly simplistic. It was obvious how it would resolve, which made it feel silly and unnecessary. This aspect of the story didn’t add much value or intrigue.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The novel was much too long for the amount of substance it offered. The pacing dragged, and the story didn’t justify its length, leaving me feeling unsatisfied by the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this changeling story, it ultimately fell flat due to its lack of depth, poorly developed characters, predictable romantic subplot, and excessive length. The world-building felt underdeveloped, and the narrative failed to engage me on a meaningful level.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated the unique portrayal of Fia, a changeling, which diverged from traditional tales. The relationship between Fia and Rogan was complex and intriguing, existing in a gray area that made it difficult to outright dislike Rogan despite his flaws. Surprisingly, I found myself drawn to Eala, Fia’s sister, who added an element of mystique and chaos to the narrative. The author skillfully crafts morally ambiguous characters that readers can't help but root for, even when they probably shouldn’t. \n\nHowever, the romance between Fia and Irian felt underdeveloped and unconvincing, leaning towards insta-love. I struggled to connect with Irian and found myself more invested in Rogan and Eala. Fia’s decisions regarding Irian often lacked logical reasoning, making it challenging to engage with their relationship, which is central to the story. Additionally, the book relied on some tired tropes, such as Fia being petite, beautiful, and skilled in combat while grappling with insecurities, which felt overdone and detracted from her character. Overall, Fia’s choices, particularly concerning Irian, often seemed contrived, leading to moments that were frustrating to read.",

I wanted to see more of his personality and motivations, but he was largely overshadowed by the romance between Fia and Tron.\n\n- **Comparison to *The Cruel Prince*:**  \n  The book does not live up to *The Cruel Prince*. While Jude in *The Cruel Prince* sought power and recognition, Fia's motivations were more about fame and support. Tron's character also falls short of Locke's manipulative complexity, and the main love interest lacks Cardan's depth and charisma.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had potential with its premise and initial setup, but the excessive focus on romance made the story predictable and overshadowed character development and the main plot. While some characters showed promise, they were underdeveloped, and the comparisons to *The Cruel Prince* only highlighted the book's shortcomings. A better balance between romance and the central mission could have improved the overall experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The narrative would have been more engaging if it had focused entirely on Tir na nOg, as the sections set in the human world contribute little to the story and significantly hinder the pacing. These parts could almost be omitted without losing anything essential. The plot feels disjointed and lacks significant events, especially considering the book's length. The effort to set up a continuation after 500 pages of minimal progress feels unconvincing and ultimately unsatisfying.",
            "Fia, the protagonist, is portrayed as intelligent and cunning, yet she often appears naive and easily manipulated. Her frustrating decisions, particularly her quick shift from distrust to blind faith in Eala, create inconsistencies that make her character difficult to engage with. \n\nThe male leads, Rogan and Irian, also lack depth and purpose. While Rogan is depicted as a charming prince, his motivations remain unclear throughout much of the story. Irian, though attractive, is underdeveloped, and his relationship with Fia feels unconvincing due to their minimal meaningful interactions and lack of mutual understanding.",

These parts could almost be skipped without losing anything important.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Fia, the protagonist, is portrayed as smart and cunning but comes across as dense, brainwashed, and easily deceived. Her decisions are frustrating, especially when she contradicts her own inner monologue about not trusting Eala, only to believe her immediately afterward. This inconsistency makes her character exhausting to follow.  \n  Rogan and Irian, the male leads, lack depth and purpose. Rogan is described as a hot prince, but his actions and motivations are unclear for most of the book. Irian, while also attractive, remains underdeveloped, and his relationship with Fia feels unconvincing due to their lack of meaningful interaction or understanding of each other.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The world-building is confusing and underdeveloped.

The book attempts to incorporate numerous fae romance tropes but fails to execute them effectively.  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative Choices:**  \n  The plot feels disjointed and lacks significant events, especially given the book’s length.

It went from zero to sixty without proper buildup, and the love triangle/square felt stilted and unsatisfying. There was a lack of yearning and longing, which I expected in a 17-hour audiobook. Additionally, the tone of the romantic scenes was inconsistent, with vague hints at intimacy early on and explicit smut scenes later.  \n\n- **Action and Politics:**  \n  Both the action and the political elements were poorly done, lacking depth and engagement.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my high hopes for *A Feather So Black*, I found it to be a disappointing and tedious read. The excessive length, underdeveloped characters, confusing magic system, poorly executed romance, and lackluster action and politics made it feel like a colossal waste of time.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5⭐️ rounded up to 2"

The dynamic between Fia, Rogan, Irian, and Eala did not resonate with me at all. \n\nRogan, in particular, was insufferable. His constant self-centeredness made me want to smack him. He gave me a serious case of the ick, especially in the beginning when he made suggestive comments toward Fia, despite her clear disinterest. \n\nIrian was slightly better, showing a bit more respect for Fia. However, there were still moments when he dismissed her contributions, claiming he couldn’t focus in battle because she was present, despite her having saved him before. Overall, the relationships in this story left much to be desired.",

I was cheering her on as her character grew, especially as she realized and overcame the toxic relationship with her mother.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  I am not a fan of love triangles, or in this case, a love square. So, I absolutely hated the dynamic between Fia, Rogan, Irian, and Eala.  \n  I also disliked Rogan. So. Much. The amount of times I found him insufferable was a lot. Every time he was like, \"But what about what I want?\" I wanted to smack him. He just gave me a huge case of the ick, especially in the beginning when he was making suggestive comments at Fia, and she let him know she was not interested. Yet, he kept doing it.  \n  Irian was slightly better in that he seemed a little more respectful of Fia. However, there were still times where he was like, \"You must not be here, or else I will get distracted in this fight,\" when she had literally saved him before.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was good. From the excerpt I read online, it seemed like it would be up my alley.  \n\n- **Sensory Descriptions:**  \n  I hated the amount of times I had to read about what Rogan and Irian smelled like. And the amount of times Fia talked about Rogan's musk... I hated it. (Maybe it's just me, but I don't find the smell of musk at all sexy.)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had strong elements like well-researched mythology and solid character development for Fia, the romantic subplot and certain sensory descriptions detracted from my enjoyment.

Very little action or development occurs throughout the majority of the book.\n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The abandoned castle setting felt unnecessary and confusing, as it wasn’t far from the MC’s real home. The faerie place she visits once a month was also poorly explained, leaving me unclear about its purpose or significance.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters lacked depth and chemistry. The mysterious dark-haired man had no personality, and his relationship with the MC felt forced and unconvincing. The love triangle was predictable and unengaging, with both love interests being less interesting versions of Rhys and Tamlin from other popular works.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was virtually nonexistent for most of the book. Nothing significant happened until the very end, by which point I had lost interest in the characters and the story. The lack of meaningful events made the book feel tedious and unfulfilling.\n\n- **Engagement:**  \n  The book failed to hold my attention. I found myself skim-reading frequently just to stay awake, and I ultimately regretted not DNFing (Did Not Finish) it sooner.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book suffered from poor pacing, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of engaging plot. The setting was confusing, and the relationships felt forced and uninteresting. By the end, I was completely disengaged and wished I had stopped reading earlier.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The transitions between locations and the absence of meaningful action contribute to a sense of stagnation in the story.",

The protagonist is 20 years old, but her problems and situation resemble those of a 17- or 18-year-old. This disconnect between the target audience and the actual content was disappointing. I believe New Adult and Adult fiction should be clearly separated, as they are not the same.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is a reimagining of *Swan Lake*, but it failed to deliver on its promising synopsis. The pacing is slow, and it feels like nothing happens for 90% of the book. There are also a couple of plot holes that detract from the overall experience.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Fia, is repeatedly described as a \"weapon,\" but she never demonstrates this trait. Additionally, some characters, including one of the love interests, are underdeveloped. The other love interest was unlikable, which made the love triangle unengaging.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance dominates the plot, but it didn’t resonate with me. The love triangle felt clichéd and uninspired, which is a common issue I have with this subgenre.\n\n- **Originality and Appeal:**  \n  In my opinion, the novel doesn’t offer anything new or interesting. It feels like a compilation of tropes and clichés that I’ve grown tired of. However, if you’re a fan of this type of story, you might find it entertaining.\n\n- **Aesthetic and Presentation:**  \n  The edition is one of the most beautiful I’ve seen from Fairyloot, which is a positive aspect.

This book was incredibly boring and might even serve as a cure for insomnia.  \n  - While 16-year-old me might have enjoyed it to some extent, I no longer trust that version of myself.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The first romance was with a bland \"porridge prince,\" and the second was with a slightly less bland \"porridge fae lord.\" The fae lord had a hint of personality (like cinnamon sprinkled in), but he was still basic at best.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The concept of the gate opening only during a full moon made the entire plot ridiculous. While I understand the need for magical conditions, this one didn’t fit the story.  \n  - Fia and the prince’s quest took a year, during which they provided no updates to the queen and made no progress.  \n  - They spent 30 days in a decrepit castle near the fae border, then 12 hours in the fae realm, and repeated this cycle. Nothing significant happened in the human realm, while too much was crammed into the short time in the fae realm.\n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Scenes:**  \n  - The sex scenes were poorly written and lacked tension. The author should study fanfiction to improve their ability to write engaging and well-crafted intimate moments.  \n  - The descriptions (e.g., \"licking stripes,\" \"touching velvet steel\") were cringe-worthy and failed to evoke any excitement.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a disappointment, with bland characters, a poorly paced plot, and awkwardly written romantic scenes.

I usually push through insufferable books to critique them fairly, but in this case, I decided to spare myself the frustration.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel fell short in multiple areas, including prose, character development, romantic chemistry, and worldbuilding. Despite my initial excitement for the fae lore, the execution was disappointing, leading me to abandon the book early on.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While the idea of plant powers and a “lust to kill” held promise, it ultimately failed to deliver in a compelling manner.",

Almost dreamlike.  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is good. The mystery and intrigue of Tir na Nog, the folk's magic, it all was well done and interesting.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  It was painful watching the main character get manipulated at every point by the other characters. She kept flip-flopping between \"I like him\" and \"I don't like him.\" I felt like a yo-yo being snatched back and forth, on a merry-go-round going around and around again and again.  \n- **Believability:**  \n  It is believable for a character who's neither folk nor human, who's been lied to and abused at just about every turn, but the constant \"I love him, no he's dangerous or bad\" was not enjoyable to read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book wasn’t for me, it has several appealing elements, such as its unique concept, lush writing style, and strong world-building.
