However, it is actually a multi-POV adult fantasy with a sapphic subplot, which creates a mismatch between expectations and reality.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around a magical location that is slowly dying, along with its inhabitants. Desperate witches attempt to save the town by kidnapping and indoctrinating people with latent magical abilities. This makes the narrative darker and more complex than the lighthearted story the marketing implies.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world is interesting and well-developed, with a unique magical setting that adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Motivations:**  \n  The characters' motivations are compelling and add layers to the narrative, making them engaging despite the darker themes.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  The romantic storylines, particularly the sapphic subplot, were not to my liking. However, they did not detract significantly from my overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I am tentatively interested in continuing with the series, as the world and characters have potential for further exploration.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book suffers from misleading marketing and contains darker themes than expected, it offers an intriguing world, compelling character motivations, and a unique plot.

Other romantic pairings are similarly unconvincing, driven more by superficial attraction than genuine chemistry. The romances often come across as awkward and even creepy, with some meet-cutes that are unsettling. Additionally, marketing the story as a cozy sapphic romance is misleading; the relationship Ellie ultimately finds herself in lacks consent, rendering the ending uncomfortable rather than empowering.",

To fulfill this prophecy, she seeks to awaken the powers of three new witches who arrive in Crenshaw, guiding them as they navigate the rules of their new reality.

With multiple perspectives and intricate relationships, the plot adds depth and complexity to the overall story.",

The relationships—whether female-female, male-female, or male-male—often feel manipulative, which is unsettling. Additionally, the witches are activated by severing ties with their current lives, notably leaving a young son with an abusive and neglectful father, which is particularly disturbing.",

Sanche, the headmaster, is the most complex character, yet his development feels superficial. The six different points of view dilute character depth, making it difficult to connect with any one character.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Story Structure:**\n   - The story starts with an intriguing premise where magic awakens in individuals during life-threatening situations, and they are transported to Crenshaw, a magical town.\n   - The plot initially shows promise with the conflict between factions in Crenshaw, but it loses momentum and fails to develop fully.\n   - The ending feels rushed and lacks coherence, leaving several plot threads unresolved.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Maggie’s arc is the most compelling, as she struggles with being separated from her son and navigating her new magical life.\n   - Dan’s character is also engaging, particularly his desperation to stay in Crenshaw to avoid dying of cancer in the real world.\n   - Sanche, the headmaster, is the most complex character, but even his development feels superficial.\n   - The multiple points of view (6 in total) dilute character depth, making it hard to connect with any single character.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The book features three romances: F/F, M/F, and M/M, but all feel shallow and lack emotional depth.\n   - The romances are based on instant attraction rather than meaningful development, which detracts from their impact.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The concept of Crenshaw and its magical community is intriguing but underdeveloped.\n   - Elements like the Hobbs (magical creatures) and the magical classes are introduced but not explored in detail.\n   - The environmental issues in Crenshaw (tainted water, foul smell) add an interesting layer but are not fully utilized.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**\n   - The book incorporates heavy social justice themes, including racism, LGBTQ+ issues, white privilege, and ableism.\n   - While some themes are relevant, their frequent and overt inclusion disrupts the story’s flow and detracts from its intended “cozy” tone.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**\n   - Jeremy Carlisle Parker and Max Meyers deliver strong performances, capturing the characters’ voices effectively.\n   - Dan’s and Sanche’s voices are particularly well-done and add depth to their characters.\n   - The pacing felt slow at 1.5x speed, requiring an increase to 1.75x for better flow.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Remedial Magic* has potential with its unique premise and intriguing characters like Maggie and Dan. However, the story suffers from a lack of focus, underdeveloped world-building, and shallow romances. The heavy-handed inclusion of social justice themes detracts from the intended cozy tone, making it a less enjoyable read. While the audiobook narration is well-executed, the overall experience was disappointing, and I’m unsure if I’ll continue with the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Key characters, such as the chief witch, lacked proper introductions, making it difficult to grasp their roles and motivations.",

The story presents a dichotomy where characters see themselves as heroes or villains, but this dynamic remains unexplored and unclear. The romance deviates from the cute, cozy sapphic vibe I anticipated, instead feeling bizarre and driven by unreliable, unlikable perspectives. Relationships are rooted in mutual exploitation, and the reliance on insta-lust is a trope I find unappealing.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre Misclassification:**  \n  The book is wildly mis-categorized as Cozy Fantasy or RomFantasy. It is not a feel-good, comforting read but rather a dark fantasy with high stakes, grey morals, and untrustworthy narration. The publisher’s marketing misrepresents the book’s tone and themes.\n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  Fans of *The Once and Future Witches* will likely enjoy this book, not just because of shared themes like witches and politics, but because of its multi-POV structure, expansive plot, and intricate character dynamics. It features at least 10 characters with in-depth, moving parts.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The book is a high-powered, emotionally charged story with a big-picture situation and multiple character arcs. It explores economics, politics across worlds, secrets, and grey morality. It’s a wild ride filled with villains, strong-willed women, and high stakes.\n\n- **Romance Subplots:**  \n  The romance elements are not the focus, despite the marketing push. There are three major romances, but the lesbian relationship (marketed as a soulmate dynamic) is not the most compelling. The gay romance is the healthiest and most engaging, while Maggie’s story leaves room for future investment. The romances are entangled in tragedy and partnership against adversity.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes themes of abusive spouses/parents, suicide, death-ish scenes, mind meddling, and forced marriages. Additionally, the use of Harry Potter references in an LGBTQIA+ political book is criticized as performative and inappropriate.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the genre misclassification, the book is highly enjoyable and worth reading. It’s a dark, complex fantasy with rich storytelling, and I look forward to the next installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a dark, intricate fantasy with high stakes, complex characters, and morally grey themes. While the marketing misrepresents it as a cozy or romantic fantasy, the book delivers a powerful, emotionally charged narrative. Despite some criticisms of its romance subplots and content choices, it’s a compelling read that leaves me eager for more.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The pacing felt off, as it was marketed as a cozy romance but turned out to be a fast-paced story with multiple points of view.\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The book attempts to address queer themes and references Harry Potter, but it also dismisses the concept of disabled people existing in a magical world, which felt problematic and poorly handled.\n\n- **Marketing and Expectations:**  \n  The summary and marketing misrepresented the book. It was sold as a cozy romance between two women, but the actual content diverged significantly from this expectation, focusing instead on a fast-paced narrative with three points of view.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book failed to meet my expectations due to its lack of engagement, problematic handling of themes, and misleading marketing.

            "The book begins with three perspectives—Maggie, Ellie, and Dan—which initially feel clunky and disjointed. The addition of three more viewpoints (Prospero, Sondre, and the Chief Witch) further complicates the narrative, making it challenging to keep track of the characters and their respective chapters. This rotating point of view hampers emotional connection, leaving many characters feeling underdeveloped.",
            "The portrayal of Prospero as excessively white and flawless feels forced and cringe-worthy, suggesting an overemphasis on her appearance. Additionally, the absence of disability, illness, and injury in this magical world comes across as ableist. The notion of healing and achieving perfection is particularly troubling in a queer narrative that should celebrate imperfections.",
            "Maggie's traumatic car crash in the opening chapter was jarring and clashed with the cozy tone the book promised. A content warning would have been appropriate.",
            "The world-building and magic explanations come across as overly didactic, relying too heavily on exposition instead of integrating seamlessly into the narrative. Each of the first three characters is taken to the magical realm in separate chapters, receiving the same repetitive explanations, which feels redundant and hinders character development."

        "conclusion": "While the book had potential, its clunky pacing, excessive exposition, and lack of meaningful character development made it difficult to engage with. The introduction of too many POVs and the problematic handling of representation (both in character descriptions and the erasure of disability) further detracted from the story. Additionally, the traumatic car crash scene felt out of place in a book marketed as cozy. Ultimately, these issues led to the decision to stop reading at 44%.",

Initially, the story is steeped in trauma and near-death experiences that awaken the witches' magic. They are brought to Crenshaw, where they must attend the School of Remedial Magic and decide whether to stay or return home. Crenshaw is in turmoil, relying on the new witches to help resolve its issues. Themes of healing, choice, and the consequences of power are woven throughout the narrative.

While it has potential as a dark academia or dystopian fantasy, the execution falls short, leaving the reader exhausted and disengaged. The problematic romantic relationships and disjointed plot further detract from the experience. Unless the sequel addresses these issues, I will not be continuing with the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Genre Accuracy: 2/10  \n- Worldbuilding: 3/10  \n- Character Development: 4/10  \n- Romantic Relationships: 2/10  \n- Plot Cohesion: 3/10  \n- Writing Style: 5/10  \n- Overall Enjoyment: 3/10"

Her ability to craft a compelling narrative shines through in this book.  \n\n- **Complexity of Storylines and POVs:**  \n  Initially, I was nervous about keeping track of the multiple storylines and points of view.

I’m excited to read the next book and explore more works by this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book defies genre expectations by delivering a romance that enhances the story rather than dominating it. Despite its fast pace and multiple POVs, it’s an engaging and enjoyable read with well-developed, morally complex characters. It’s the perfect \"brain candy\" for when you need something fun and entertaining.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The story follows a large cast of characters, including a librarian and a lawyer, who discover latent magic through near-death experiences and are then whisked—or kidnapped—off to a school that teaches remedial magic.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I struggled with this book due to misaligned expectations. Based on the cover and description, I anticipated a cute, magical realism-style story. However, the book leaned more heavily into fantasy, and I found the rules of the fantasy world difficult to discern.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I struggled with the lack of relationship and character development. Everyone seemed to meet and immediately lust after each other, which felt shallow and unrealistic, especially compared to the depth of relationships in *One Last Stop*.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book made strong points about homophobia, transphobia, racism, and explored themes of free will. These aspects were thought-provoking and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Experience):**  \n  I reviewed this book on audio and found the narration engaging and entertaining. However, I occasionally struggled to distinguish between spoken dialogue and internal monologues, which contributed to some confusion while listening.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Remedial Magic* had an intriguing premise and tackled important social issues, it fell short of my expectations due to its confusing world-building, underdeveloped relationships, and misalignment with the tone I anticipated. The audiobook narration was enjoyable but occasionally unclear.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This lack of resolution left me feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with the overall narrative.\n\n- **Personal Impact:**  \n  I found the book so disappointing that I wish I could erase it from my memory entirely. It was not an enjoyable or fulfilling reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell far short of my expectations. It was darker and more unsettling than the synopsis suggested, with problematic themes, misplaced cultural references, and unresolved plotlines. Overall, it was a deeply disappointing read that I would not recommend.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "Maggie emerged as my favorite character, driven by her clear motives and unwavering commitment to her son. Her choice to betray Ellie for her son's future marked a compelling climax in her character arc. While Dan's descent into immorality was intriguing, he often faded into the background amid the large cast, and his relationship with Axell felt underdeveloped, serving more as a plot device than a genuine connection. \n\nThe relationship between Ellie and Prospero was particularly problematic. Prospero's abusive behaviors—stalking, lying, endangering Ellie, and mind-wiping—were disturbingly framed in a positive light for much of the book. It wasn't until the end that the narrative acknowledged his abusive nature, creating a sense of inconsistency. The romance between Ellie and Prospero was twisted and abusive, clashing with the book's marketing as a conventional romance. Although the story began to recognize the abuse toward the end, the initial framing of their relationship was jarring. I hope the next installment will explore Ellie’s escape from Prospero’s toxic love and approach dark romance with greater self-awareness.",
            "The writing and world-building were solid, though the pacing felt uneven at times. While the story captured my attention, the frequent Harry Potter references undermined the unique world the author was trying to create. The witches' society, depicted as a dystopia that has stagnated for centuries and mirrors injustices from the non-magical world, presented intriguing ideas that were not fully developed.",
            "The book features overt preaching about real-world issues that often feels forced. While the witches' blindness to their own society's flaws, particularly their discrimination based on magical ability, offers an intriguing critique, it remains underexplored. Additionally, the trivialization of Ellie and Prospero's abusive dynamic—exemplified by comments on their sex life—detracts from the gravity of their situation."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite its incongruences and misaligned genre expectations, *Remedial Magic* is worth reading as a horror and dark romance. The world-building and character dynamics, particularly Maggie’s arc, are compelling, though the problematic framing of Ellie and Prospero’s relationship and the heavy-handed social commentary detract from the overall experience. I would recommend it with the caveat that readers approach it as a dark, unsettling story rather than a cozy fantasy romance.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Genre Expectations vs. Reality**  \n   - I expected a cozy fantasy with a developing romance between two witches, but the book turned out to be a multi-POV story with elements of horror and dark romance.  \n   - If judged solely on fulfilling the initial expectation, I would rate it 1 star. However, as a horror and dark romance, it performs well.  \n   - The marketing and internal logic of the book did not clearly signal its true genre, which affected my initial perception.\n\n- **Writing and World-Building**  \n   - The writing and world-building were decent, though the pacing was inconsistent.  \n   - The story held my attention overall, but the frequent Harry Potter references detracted from the distinct world Marr was building.  \n   - The witches’ society is portrayed as a dystopia, stagnating for centuries and replicating injustices from the non-magical world, which was thought-provoking but not fully explored.\n\n- **Character Development**  \n   - Maggie was my favorite character due to her clear motives and admirable prioritization of her son. Her decision to betray Ellie for her son’s future was a fascinating culmination of her arc.  \n   - Dan’s descent into immoral choices was intriguing, but he often faded into the background due to the large cast. His relationship with Axell felt underdeveloped and more like a plot device.  \n   - Ellie and Prospero’s relationship was problematic. Prospero’s abusive behavior (stalking, lying, endangering Ellie, and mind-wiping) was jarringly framed positively for most of the book. The book only clarified Prospero’s abusive nature toward the end, which felt inconsistent.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary**  \n   - The book includes heavy-handed preaching about issues in the non-magical world, which felt forced.  \n   - The witches’ blindness to their own society’s flaws, particularly their discrimination based on magical ability, was an interesting critique but not fully addressed.  \n   - The trivialization of Ellie and Prospero’s abusive dynamic, such as comments about the quality of their sex life, undermined the seriousness of the situation.\n\n- **Romantic Relationships**  \n   - The romance between Ellie and Prospero was twisted and abusive, which clashed with the book’s marketing as a proper romance.  \n   - The book’s framing of their relationship as positive for most of the story was jarring, though it began to acknowledge the abuse toward the end.  \n   - I am hopeful that the next book will address Ellie’s escape from Prospero’s abusive love and lean more self-awarely into dark romance.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its incongruences and misaligned genre expectations, *Remedial Magic* is worth reading as a horror and dark romance. The world-building and character dynamics, particularly Maggie’s arc, are compelling, though the problematic framing of Ellie and Prospero’s relationship and the heavy-handed social commentary detract from the overall experience. I would recommend it with the caveat that readers approach it as a dark, unsettling story rather than a cozy fantasy romance.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- If judged on initial expectations: 1 star.  \n- As a horror and dark romance: 3.5 stars."

            "The plot was overly complicated, featuring too many points of view that made it difficult to follow. Focusing on two main characters, Ellie and Prospero, in the first book, with secondary characters like Maggie and Dan introduced later, would have enhanced character development and world-building. The pacing felt rushed, and some plot points were illogical. For instance, Maggie’s ex-husband cutting the brake lines while their son was in the car was implausible. Additionally, Dan’s sudden cancer cure upon entering Crenshaw, only for it to return if he leaves, seemed like a forced plot device.",
            "The characters in the story felt underdeveloped, and their relationships often seemed forced. For instance, Ellie quickly shifts from viewing herself as boring and routine-driven to kissing a stranger, Prospero, just moments after meeting him, leading to an implausible instant romance. Maggie's storyline also felt rushed and illogical, especially concerning her ex-husband's actions regarding their son. Additionally, Dan's character lacked depth, and his sudden magical cure in Crenshaw came across as contrived.",
            "The world-building in the story was insufficiently detailed. The prologue introduces a Hob without any description of what it is or how it looks, which left me confused.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Narration Performance:**\n   - The audiobook features two narrators: Jeremy Carlisle Parker and Max Meyers. Jeremy is a trained opera singer whose previous work I’ve enjoyed, while Max is new to me. Both did their best to portray multiple POVs, but the book would have benefited from a larger cast of narrators to better differentiate the characters. The frequent POV switches were confusing, and it often took time to figure out whose perspective was being presented.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters felt underdeveloped and their relationships were forced. For example, Ellie goes from describing herself as boring and routine-driven to kissing a stranger (Prospero) within minutes of meeting her, then immediately falling in love. Maggie’s storyline also felt rushed and illogical, particularly with her ex-husband’s actions regarding their son. Dan’s character was flat, and his sudden magical cure in Crenshaw felt contrived.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building was lacking in detail. For instance, the prologue introduces a \"Hob,\" but there’s no description of what a Hob is or looks like, leaving me confused. The setting of Crenshaw and its rules were not well-explained, making it hard to immerse myself in the story.\n\n- **Plot Structure:**\n   - The plot was overly complicated with too many POVs, making it hard to follow. The story would have worked better if it focused on two main characters (Ellie and Prospero) in the first book, with secondary characters like Maggie and Dan introduced later in the series. This would have allowed for better character development and world-building.\n\n- **Pacing and Logic:**\n   - The pacing felt rushed, and some plot points were illogical.

            "The ending is deeply problematic, as Prospero uses a magical power boost to brainwash Ellie into believing they are happily married. This manipulation undermines the possibility of a healthy, consensual relationship. Additionally, Ellie's aunt's advice to tolerate unhealthy relationships for the sake of good sex is troubling and conveys a negative message.",
            "Ellie and Prospero's relationship feels shallow and underdeveloped, marked only by a brief kiss and vague hints of dating. In contrast, Maggie and Sondre's connection advances too rapidly, with physical intimacy occurring before they genuinely understand one another. Sondre's manipulative, deceitful, and sexist behavior undermines the author's portrayal of him as a good man. Additionally, Ellie's fluctuating trust in Prospero creates an unstable and unconvincing dynamic between them.",
            "The review contains awkward phrasing that could be improved for clarity. The misuse of the verb \"badger,\" which is mistakenly interpreted as turning someone into a badger, is particularly jarring. Additionally, using \"witch\" to refer to men instead of \"wizard\" is problematic, as \"witch\" is not a gender-neutral term.",
            "The pacing is rushed and awkward, with inadequate world-building. The story features only one magic lesson, and the magic system remains poorly defined. Descriptions of magical creatures, like hobs, are insufficient. Additionally, several subplots are introduced but lack the necessary context and development.",
            "The book is marketed as a cozy fantasy romance centered on lesbian witches, but it ultimately disappoints. It features more heterosexual content and explicit scenes than lesbian romance, which is frustrating for readers seeking authentic representation. Despite the author's intention to create a fantasy novel inspired by her wife's concerns about the scarcity of such stories, the imbalance in representation detracts from the overall experience."

However, these ideas were not executed well, leaving them underdeveloped and confusing.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main characters, such as Ellie, Maggie, Axell, Dan, Walt, Prospero, and Sondre, were introduced intriguingly but lacked depth and definition. Ellie, in particular, felt overpowered and unearned as the savior, while others like Maggie, Axell, and Dan were underutilized. Crenshaw, despite being central to the story, was not developed enough to make the reader care about its plight.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The magical world was not explored effectively. Promised elements like magical classes were barely touched upon, with only two classes shown, both ending in disaster and failing to enhance understanding or affection for the magic system. The limited settings (the magic school, the tavern, and Prospero's house) felt restrictive and underdeveloped. Additionally, the class system in Prospero seemed flawed and poorly explained, raising questions about its logic and fairness.  \n\n- **Plot and Execution:**  \n  The story failed to deliver a solid narrative or a compelling reading experience. The multiple points of view (Walt, Prospero, Ellie, Maggie, Dan, and Sondre) did not provide clarity or depth, and the magical world remained confusing and unexplored. The plot felt rushed and underdeveloped, with many ideas left unresolved or poorly executed.  \n\n- **Writing and Tone:**  \n  The book felt like it was written with love and passion, but it lacked the necessary time and refinement to fully develop its ideas and characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and some interesting concepts, it fell short in execution. The characters lacked depth, the world-building was underdeveloped, and the plot felt rushed and confusing.

            "This book offers a delightful fantasy experience, featuring multiple characters and perspectives—about six in total—which I found particularly enjoyable. The narrative centers on Prospero, a powerful witch, and Ellie, who is prophesied to save Prospero's dying land, Crenshaw. Prospero's initial plan to awaken Ellie's inner witch through a near-death experience takes an unexpected turn due to their immediate attraction. Once Ellie arrives in Crenshaw, she begins to uncover her powers, believed to be crucial for the land's salvation. Other perspectives include Maggie, a mother and lawyer, and Dan, a newly discovered witch, both grappling with their own challenges and desires related to Crenshaw. \n\nHowever, the story concludes without resolving the issues plaguing Crenshaw, which was disappointing. I would have loved to see Ellie, Maggie, and Dan come together to save the land. While the pacing is engaging and the multiple viewpoints keep the narrative dynamic, the unresolved ending leaves several loose ends.",
            "In this story, Prospero is portrayed as a formidable and dangerous witch, yet her character evolves as she develops feelings for Ellie. Meanwhile, Ellie embraces her powers and emerges as a key player in the battle to save Crenshaw. Maggie's unwavering determination to reunite with her son highlights her resilience and maternal instincts. Additionally, Dan, a cancer survivor, seeks love in Crenshaw, adding depth to his character.",
            "Crenshaw is a magical realm in crisis, where dying witches and polluted waters evoke a palpable sense of urgency. The stark contrast between Crenshaw and the Barbarian lands enhances the richness of the world-building.",
            "The romance between Prospero and Ellie is a central theme, as their instant attraction complicates Prospero's initial plans. Meanwhile, Dan's pursuit of love with another witch, Axel, introduces an additional layer of romance to the narrative."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a fun and enjoyable fantasy novel with a rich world, engaging characters, and multiple POVs. The romance and character development are strong points, but the unresolved ending leaves something to be desired. I would have loved to see the characters unite to save Crenshaw and achieve their heart's desires.",

The concept of witches mastering magic in a charming yet flawed town—characterized by poisonous water and strict regulations—is captivating. The magic system, which allows for the transportation and transmutation of objects and people, is particularly intriguing. However, I found the use of memory alteration as a form of punishment troubling, despite recognizing its potential as a beneficial tool in other contexts.",

Maggie, who started as levelheaded and driven, lost depth and direction by the end, despite her understandable concern for her son. The Chief Witch's character shifted abruptly from just and fair to demanding the removal of Ellie and Maggie’s autonomy. Dan's transformation from a dying man battling addiction to someone willing to abandon his moral code at Sondre’s command was jarring. By the end of the book, I no longer liked Prospero.

            "The story's outline showed promise, but the execution was lacking, especially regarding the handling of consent issues in Crenshaw's world. The pacing felt rushed, with too many storylines competing for attention and insufficient depth given to each.",
            "The novel presents multiple perspectives, including Ellie, Maggie—a lawyer fleeing her abusive ex to protect her son—and Dan, a man with cancer searching for a second chance. However, the abundance of viewpoints, coupled with the limited space for each, leaves the characters feeling underdeveloped. While the blurb hinted at a story centered on two characters and their evolving relationship, the novel ultimately falls short of this promise.",
            "The author skillfully crafts the enchanting world of Crenshaw, rich in imagination and detail. However, the captivating setting cannot fully compensate for the weaknesses in character development and plot execution. The story follows Ellie, a librarian who is transported to the dying magical land of Crenshaw by a witch named Prospero to explore her magical potential. While the premise echoes familiar themes from Harry Potter—such as discovering one's magical abilities and attending a magical institution (in this case, a community college)—it ultimately falls short in delivering a compelling narrative.",
            "The novel failed to fully engage me, and the ending left me uninterested in any potential sequels. While it may appeal to some readers, it simply did not resonate with me."

While the author shows promise, the execution of the story did not fully work for me, and I am unlikely to revisit this novel. However, I encourage other readers to give it a try, as reading experiences are subjective.",

            "Maggie’s character arc was particularly jarring. She transitioned from a desperate mother focused on her son’s safety to someone indifferent, even engaging in a romantic encounter with the headmaster. This abrupt shift undermined her earlier motivations and made it difficult to connect with her. The introduction of characters like Ellie, Maggie, and Daniel was intriguing but lacked depth. Ellie’s obsession with researching missing people and her desire to remain aggressively average were unique traits, yet her sudden encounter with Prospero felt forced. Maggie’s backstory involving her son and ex had potential, but her later actions contradicted her initial motivations. Daniel’s magical cure for cancer was an interesting concept, but it overlooked his gambling problem, missing an opportunity for deeper character exploration.",

The magical system, especially the conditional cure for cancer, felt contrived and undermined the overall immersion in the story.",

For instance, a potentially fatal drug overdose was mentioned and resolved too casually, and the idea of magically cured cancer—conditional on compliance—felt unsettling. These aspects contributed to my discomfort and diverged from what I had hoped for."

The dual POV format shifts between these dynamics, which felt overwhelming to me, as I typically prefer books that focus on a single relationship and develop it deeply. This rapid switching made it challenging to connect with the characters and fully invest in their relationships. However, this is a matter of personal preference, shaped by my usual reading choices.

The magic system isn’t too complex, and we’re from the point of view of witches learning how the magic works.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  The story is very fast-paced, an easy book to pick up and not set down until you’re done.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationships:**  \n  I was expecting this to be a sapphic romance based on the cover art and the description. While that is a part of the story, there are a few other relationships going on at the same time. The book is dual-POV and hops between the sapphic relationship, an MLM relationship, and a straight relationship. Typically, I read books that focus on one relationship and spend a lot of time developing that, so I felt the amount of relationships in this book was a bit extreme. It was hard to really get to know each of the characters and then root for the relationships because we were hopping around so much. However, this is definitely personal preference and my opinion based on the type of romance stories I typically gravitate towards.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  As the book is very fast-paced, the speed of the relationship development fits in with the speed of the book overall. If I had read this book when I was in high school, before I started reading the adult romance books I do now, I really think I would have loved all the different relationships.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The plot of the book is excellent. It is a simple concept of a world falling apart and the people that love it doing everything in their power to stop it, mixed with corrupted morals and questions of love and sacrifice.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  The ending leaves you wanting so much more, and I’m excited to read the next book!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a fast-paced, engaging young adult fantasy novel with a mix of romantic relationships and a compelling plot centered around love, sacrifice, and saving a crumbling world.

            "**Ellie & Prospero (Lesbian, Major Couple):** Their romance is toxic, primarily due to Prospero’s mind-manipulating abilities. Although Ellie feels a mutual attraction, she initially resists pursuing Prospero but is ultimately brainwashed into returning to the magical realm. **Maggie & Sondre (Heterosexual, Major Couple):** Their relationship is less toxic but more tragic, as both fall victim to Prospero’s manipulation.

However, it felt like window dressing for the romance/adventure stories rather than being integral to the plot.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Tone:**  \n   - The plot starts off light and fun but becomes increasingly complex and dark. This tonal inconsistency didn’t work well, especially with multiple romances as the focus.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationships:**  \n   - **Ellie & Prospero (Lesbian, Major Couple):** Their romance is toxic due to Prospero’s ability to manipulate minds. Despite mutual attraction, Ellie chooses not to pursue Prospero but is ultimately brainwashed into returning to the magical world.  \n   - **Maggie & Sondre (Heterosexual, Major Couple):** Their relationship is less toxic but more tragic, as both are victims of Prospero’s mind manipulation. They are only together because Maggie would be killed if they weren’t, stripping them of agency.  \n   - **Dan & Axyll (Gay/Pan, Minor Couple):** This is the only romance I truly liked, as it is based on mutual attraction and gradual learning about each other, making it the most genuine and healthy relationship in the book.  \n\n- **Character Agency:**  \n   - Despite the characters’ struggles to gain agency, they ultimately lack it by the end of the book, as their relationships and fates are dictated by external forces and manipulation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has strong world-building and some compelling elements, it suffers from tonal inconsistency, misaligned genre expectations, and a lack of character agency.

            "The characters in this story are poorly developed and largely unlikable. Ellie is annoying and lacks common sense, while Maggie is one-dimensional, defined solely by her constant references to her son. Dan comes across as spineless, Axell is bland, and Próspero is both abusive and unappealing. Sondre stands out as the most redeemable character, but even his actions are inconsistent and disappointing. The romantic relationships feel unrealistic and rushed; the main character falls in love instantly, which strains credibility. The overused instant love trope makes the relationships feel forced, especially given that the characters cannot have children, rendering the urgency to pair up nonsensical.",

For instance, if Próspero had the ability to erase memories, it was puzzling why she didn’t use it to silence Maggie’s incessant talk about her son. Furthermore, the pressure to pair up characters felt forced, especially without a clear motivation, such as the need to reproduce to sustain magic.",

This approach makes the story feel busy, but in the grand scheme of the narrative, not much actually happens. It seems like this first book is setting up for an epic series, but the spread of perspectives made it difficult to become deeply invested in all the characters or the survival of Crenshaw.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  With so many character perspectives, the story struggles to develop each character deeply. While the central couples are highlighted, the sheer number of viewpoints dilutes the emotional connection to any single character or their journey.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The magical land of Crenshaw is intriguing, and the concept of a hidden magical world is compelling. However, the world-building feels secondary to the multiple character arcs, leaving the setting somewhat underdeveloped. The inclusion of badgers adds an interesting and unique touch to the world.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook narration by Jeremy Carlisle Parker and Max Meyers is a standout aspect. Their use of distinct accents and dialects for different characters helped maintain my attention, even as the story became increasingly bizarre.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  Based on the book description, I expected a sapphic love story centered around saving a magical land. While these elements are present, the multiple perspectives and lack of a singular focus made the story feel different from what I anticipated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis first book in Melissa Marr’s *A Course in Magic* series introduces an intriguing magical world and a diverse cast of characters, but the multiple perspectives and slow plot progression made it difficult to fully engage with the story. The audiobook narration was excellent, but the narrative structure left me unsure if I will continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The seemingly instant and easy romances are either going to crumble or become real and strong ones.

Prospero is difficult to empathize with, as she openly acknowledges her flaws.

The concept of Houses representing different magical groups is confusing, as their names do not clearly reflect their specialties and seem to change. Additionally, the space of Crenshaw does not convincingly support its population or the variety of jobs described. The political landscape is inconsistent, leaving simple questions unanswered that could clarify the world's logic. While the magic system shows promise, it remains underdeveloped and poorly explained. The practice of assigning weak witches to menial tasks raises concerns about fairness and logic within the system. Furthermore, the harshness of memory erasure for those returned to the human world undermines the allure of Crenshaw."

The tone and content were much darker than anticipated.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Morality:**  \n  I feel sorry for Dan, who is forced to either comply with the magic users or face a grim fate due to his cancer. However, the magic users are portrayed as morally questionable, engaging in disturbing behaviors like mental manipulation, which I found deeply unsettling.  \n\n- **Cultural Depiction:**  \n  The witch village’s culture is portrayed as highly disturbing, particularly the normalization of mental violations and manipulation. This made the setting feel oppressive and uncomfortable.  \n\n- **Reader Suitability and Recommendation:**  \n  While I have a fairly thick skin for darker themes, I wouldn’t recommend this book universally due to its heavy focus on mental violations and manipulation. It’s not a story that everyone would find enjoyable or acceptable.  \n\n- **Curiosity About the Series:**  \n  Despite my reservations, I have a morbid curiosity about how the author will resolve the story and potentially craft a happy ending. I’ll likely read the second book from the library to see how the narrative unfolds.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel subverted my expectations with its dark and unsettling themes, particularly the morally questionable actions of the magic users and the oppressive culture of the witch village. While I wouldn’t recommend it universally due to its disturbing content, I remain curious about the series’ direction and will likely continue reading to see how the story resolves.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It felt boring and lacked depth.  \n  - While some moments were sweet and I appreciated the inclusion of queer love, I wished there was more effort in building relationships through conversations and plot development rather than jumping straight to love (or lust).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the story overall, the similarities to *The Magicians* and the reliance on insta-love for every character detracted from my enjoyment. The lack of meaningful development in relationships left me wanting more depth and effort in the storytelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 3 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Representation:**  \n  The book is marketed as a queer romance, and while it delivers on that, it also introduces two additional couples that were not mentioned in the description. This was confusing and misleading, as I expected the story to focus solely on Ellie and Prospero.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The plot feels unevenly paced. It moves very slowly for a significant portion of the book, though the multiple perspectives (split between 7 characters) help make it feel less stagnant. However, the story accelerates abruptly toward the end, which feels jarring and poorly executed.\n\n- **Ending and Character Agency:**  \n  The ending was particularly disappointing. The plot twist stripped the most dynamic and fiery characters of their agency, leaving me frustrated. It felt incomplete, as though the book was only the first act of a larger story rather than a standalone novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its moments, particularly in its queer romance elements, it suffers from misleading marketing, uneven pacing, and an unsatisfying ending that undermines the characters' agency. It feels more like the beginning of a series than a complete story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The reader anticipated a cozy, lighthearted story but found it to be filled with tragedy, illness, car accidents, death, and missing people.  \n\n- **Content Sensitivity:**  \n  The reader is sensitive to heavy and tragic content in media, and the book's themes were overwhelming, especially within the first five chapters. This made it difficult for the reader to continue.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The book was marketed as a \"rom comy\" or cozy read, but it did not align with these expectations. The reader was disappointed by the lack of lightheartedness and the abundance of dark themes.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Due to the mismatch between expectations and the actual content, the reader could not finish the book and decided to return it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book failed to meet the reader's expectations of a cozy, lighthearted story, instead presenting a dark and intense narrative filled with tragic events. This disconnect, combined with the reader's sensitivity to such content, led to dissatisfaction and the decision not to finish the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Despite the elements that usually appeal to me, the story failed to captivate me.  \n\n- **Writing Style (Show vs. Tell):**  \n  The book suffers from a bad case of \"telling not showing.\" The narrative often felt flat and lacked the depth that comes from immersive storytelling.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The constant jumping between POVs felt haphazard and disrupted the flow of the story. This made it difficult to connect with the characters or the plot.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romances felt immediate and lacked the gradual build-up that makes relationships believable and engaging.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was lackluster and didn’t provide the rich, detailed setting I expect from a fantasy novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had elements I typically enjoy, such as magic, romance, and fantasy, it fell short in execution.

The premise of the story was interesting, and I particularly liked the added mystery of the vanishing people at the beginning, which played a neat role throughout the story.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I really liked the majority of the characters and thought they played their parts well in moving the storyline along. However, there were a few characters I wasn’t a huge fan of, but I think that’s natural—in any novel, you’re bound to find a character or two you wouldn’t be friends with in real life.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I’m conflicted about the ending. It didn’t tie up in a neat little bow, which would normally bother me, but in this case, I’m actually pleased with it. I think it kept the tone of the story intact and felt appropriate.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

This was unexpected, as the back of the book only mentions two main characters. The pacing felt rushed, particularly in the writing, which detracted from the overall experience.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ellie's character felt inconsistent. She initially emphasizes her desire to be \"normal\" and her disinterest in romantic relationships, but then abruptly kisses a stranger without clear motivation or development. This sudden shift felt jarring and unconvincing.\n\n- **Use of References:**  \n  The inclusion of a Harry Potter reference early in the book felt unnecessary and overdone, especially since I’ve encountered similar references in other recent reads. It didn’t add value and instead felt like a tired trope.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a promising start, the introduction of multiple P.O.V.s, rushed writing, inconsistent character development, and overused references made it difficult to continue reading. These issues overshadowed the initial potential of the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The ending was particularly frustrating, leaving me disinterested in pursuing the sequel. I simply don't feel compelled to endure another installment after such a disappointing conclusion.",

However, the narrative quickly shifted to a six-person point of view, focusing on the general events of a poisoned fantasy land. This change made the story feel disjointed and less engaging than I had anticipated."
