            "This novel uniquely combines adventure, mystery, comedy, and romance, setting it apart from typical historical romances. While the darker themes are occasionally lightened by humor, this balance may not resonate with all readers. The plot is straightforward, despite its mysterious facade, and primarily explores coffee-room culture and the interactions between social classes. The epilogue effectively sets the stage for the next installment, which I am eager to read. Additionally, the author’s note is insightful and worth a read.",
            "The villain lacks depth, coming across as a mere cardboard cutout, while the parents are one-dimensional, embodying the typical archetype of those obsessed with appearances and status. However, the friendship among Charlotte, Mathew, Alexander, Hannah, and Sophia serves as the book's saving grace. Mathew is a charming character grappling with his own struggles, and Alexander, Charlotte’s twin, shows great promise. The romance unfolds in the final quarter of the book and is low on steam, which aligns well with the storyline and characters. While there’s no miscommunication, the characters do keep secrets from one another for an extended period, which feels justified within the context.",
            "The prose can be overly descriptive at times, bordering on purple prose, which may deter some readers. The modern vibes, while trendy, didn't bother me. The pacing is decent, making it easy to finish the book in just a couple of days.",
            "This book skillfully addresses themes of colonization, slavery, and gender and racial discrimination without overshadowing the plot. The heartwarming found family trope enriches the narrative, adding depth to the characters and their relationships."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Lady Charlotte Always Gets Her Man is an entertaining book that offers a mash of genres and a light read that doesn’t tax the brain too much. Despite some overly descriptive prose and one-dimensional characters, the heartwarming relationships and social commentary make it a worthwhile read. The low-steam romance and straightforward plot add to its charm, making it a decent choice for those looking for a blend of adventure, mystery, and romance.",

            "The story features a diverse cast, including Charlotte, the female protagonist, her mixed-race cousins—children of a pirate—and Matthew, her brother's closest friend and the youngest son of a duke. Charlotte's cousins operate a coffeehouse that serves as both a sanctuary for her and a central hub for the narrative. Matthew, a physician and naturalist, is instrumental in Charlotte's life and her quest to escape her parents' plans.",
            "Set in the 1750s, as noted by the author, the story initially evokes the earlier 1700s through its depiction of Georgian fashion, wigs, and makeup. However, notable historical details, such as references to the Tower of London's menagerie (which closed in the 1830s) and the mention of tennis, feel somewhat anachronistic.",
            "This story explores significant themes, including the slave trade, indentured servitude, the treatment of Indigenous people, the role of women in Georgian society, and the ethics of artifact collection. These elements add depth to what might initially appear to be a farcical narrative.",
            "This historical romance delves into serious themes, a contrast to its cartoonish cover which might imply a lighter story. While there are humorous moments, notably involving a parrot and a capuchin monkey, the central plot is gripping, revolving around the efforts to prevent the female protagonist's betrothal to a psychopath."

My confusion was exacerbated by receiving an audiobook edition with several sections missing, which I only discovered when I was 27% in—actually 36% with the cuts. The pacing felt off, and the lack of tension was apparent since the villain was revealed right from the beginning.",
            "The villain comes across as overly theatrical, reminiscent of a Scooby-Doo character, and lacks depth. The hero leans towards vigilante behavior, while Charlotte, the heroine, truly stands out—don't be fooled by her pretty dresses and ladylike demeanor! I also appreciated the supporting character, Hannah, who added a delightful touch to the story.",

It feels like four genres combined into one.  \n\n- **Tone and Setting:**  \n   - The book has a mix of modern and outdated elements. At times, it clearly reflects the 1800s setting through the language used, but other parts feel so contemporary that I could believe it was set in 2024.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and POV:**  \n   - The book is written in third-person POV, which isn’t my preferred style, but I still gave it a chance.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Complexity:**  \n   - There’s a lot happening in the story, which made it hard for me to stay engaged. The dense prose and lack of breaks left me feeling confused and overwhelmed.  \n\n- **Romantic and Spice Elements:**  \n   - While there are romantic aspects, the spice level is practically nonexistent. This is something to keep in mind if you’re expecting a steamy romance.  \n\n- **Tropes:**  \n   - The book includes tropes like found family, he falls first, opposites attract, and different worlds colliding.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and DNF Decision:**  \n   - Despite enjoying parts of the book, I had to DNF (did not finish) it at around 39%. The confusion and lack of engagement made it difficult for me to continue.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book blends romance, adventure, mystery, and suspense, but its mix of modern and outdated tones, dense prose, and lack of spice made it hard for me to fully connect with the story. While it has some enjoyable elements, I ultimately couldn’t finish it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The main characters first meet around 12% into the book (in chapter 3). The narrative concludes with a satisfying happily ever after, accompanied by an epilogue set not long after the main events, and importantly, there is no cliffhanger.",

While the stakes are established early on with the protagonist's impending marriage to a dangerous man, the next 39% of the book is bogged down by unnecessary filler. The latter half descends into chaos, featuring a haphazard mix of assassins, thievery, and an overwhelming number of random animals, all of which feel absurd and out of place.",

The protagonist's actions often feel inconsistent and unrealistic—such as escaping her overbearing mother during a dress fitting, crossing London half-dressed, and impulsively buying a coffee shop. Initially, the romantic interest, Matthew, is portrayed as a unique, bookish character, but he ultimately transforms into an implausibly over-the-top hero—super tall, strong, a skilled fighter, surgeon, naturalist, and secret savior. The romance is flat and uninspired, failing to add any emotional depth to the story.",

The side characters, especially the star-crossed lovers—a bird and a monkey—infuse charm into the story, enriching the narrative and enhancing overall enjoyment.",

            "The male main character (MMC) is intelligent and studious with a thrilling adventurous streak, demonstrated by his daring rooftop leaps to rescue children. His long-standing affection for the female main character (FMC) adds depth, but his feelings of inadequacy—stemming from past trauma—can feel clichéd and slightly undermine the romance. Additionally, the dialogue at the story's resolution leans toward overly sentimental, reminiscent of a Hallmark film."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Main Character (Charlotte):**  \n  Charlotte is an excellent main character. She knows herself well and is portrayed as smart and strong-willed, which makes her compelling and relatable.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The main plot revolves around exposing and stopping a betrothed who is rumored to have killed his two previous wives and is depicted as a guilty sociopath. This central conflict is engaging and drives the story forward.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The male main character (MMC) is smart and studious but also has an adventurous side, such as jumping across rooftops to save children. He has been pining for the female main character (FMC) long-term, which adds depth to his character. However, the \"she’s too good for me\" discourse, though rooted in his trauma, feels overdone and detracts slightly from the romance. The dialogue at the end, once the conflict is resolved, comes across as overly sentimental and Hallmark-like.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  The side characters, including a bird and a monkey who are star-crossed lovers, are fun and add charm to the story. They help flesh out the narrative and contribute to the overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  The setting is well-crafted, and the historical context, particularly the acknowledgment of how cumbersome women’s outfits were, adds authenticity and depth to the story. This detail is appreciated and enhances the immersion.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  The author shows promise, and I am likely to read more of their work in the future. The characters and setting are well-developed, and there is a strong foundation for future stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a solid and enjoyable read with a compelling main character, an engaging plot, and charming side characters. While the romantic elements occasionally feel overdone, the story’s strengths, including its historical authenticity and the author’s potential, make it worth reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars (rounded up to 4)."

            "The mystery surrounding Charlotte's betrothed, suspected of murdering his former wives, held promise but ultimately fell flat. The plot was vague and confusing, cluttered with extraneous details that obscured rather than enhanced the story. Additionally, the antagonist lacked depth and development, failing to evoke a genuine sense of danger or tension.",
            "The relationship between Charlotte and Matthew lacked genuine development. Their connection was conveyed primarily through third-person limited narration instead of meaningful interactions or tension. Although the story suggested there was palpable tension, I never felt it, leaving their romance unconvincing.",
            "Initially, I found the writing style unappealing, though it improved somewhat as the book progressed. Despite this, it ultimately didn't resonate with me. The author's inexperience in the historical romance genre was apparent, and while I usually enjoy cheesy, over-the-top narratives, this one crossed the line—especially with the inclusion of a parrot and a monkey. The humor felt excessive and detracted from the story rather than enhancing it.",
            "The book's quick pacing and absurdity kept me engaged, compelling me to turn the pages. Although I found some enjoyment in it, issues with writing, tone, and character development prevented it from being a truly satisfying read."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book had potential but fell short in several areas, including writing style, tone, mystery execution, and romantic development. While it was an entertaining read due to its fast pace and absurdity, the excessive cheesiness and lack of depth in key elements left me wanting more. With further editing and practice, the author could refine their storytelling and strike a better balance between humor and substance.",

            "The book embraces the escapist fantasy aspect of historical fiction, which I appreciated, even though the author does not prioritize authentic historical accuracy in dialogue, thoughts, or actions.",
            "Charlotte, the protagonist, is a twenty-five-year-old woman in the mid-1700s, engaged to a man who has murdered two wives. His younger brother, Matthew, a naturalist-surgeon and Charlotte's twin brother's best friend, gave up his wealth and title to explore the New World. While Charlotte and Matthew share a charming connection, it leans heavily on physical chemistry rather than a deep emotional bond. Charlotte worries that Matthew doesn’t truly know her, a valid concern given their interactions have largely taken place in large groups since childhood. Though Matthew once quietly harbored feelings for Charlotte, she was mainly preoccupied with her twin brother.",
            "The book features a mature tone, addressing topics like sex and includes provocative scenes, which starkly contrasts with its youthful cover art. This discrepancy between the cover and the content is quite surprising.",
            "The story primarily unfolds in a coffee shop, where individuals from various social classes interact. This setting is a refreshing departure from the high-society scenes suggested by the cover's imagery of dancing and balls.",
            "I appreciated the book's candid examination of the slave trade and its ties to wealth and consumerism. However, I wish it had delved deeper into this theme as the story unfolded, as it was the most compelling aspect for me.",
            "I anticipated a tale centered on balls and high society, but instead, I encountered a swashbuckling adventure with a heist twist. While I appreciate a good heist, the cover art led me to expect a greater emphasis on dancing and social intrigue."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book was an enjoyable escapist historical fiction with a swashbuckling adventure and a heist element. While the cover and initial expectations were misleading, the story offered a mix of romance, mature themes, and an exploration of the slave trade’s impact. However, I wished for deeper engagement with the historical context and a more accurate representation of the era.",

            "The book's premise offers an intriguing setup, featuring Lady Charlotte Lovett's quest to uncover the truth about her betrothed, suspected of double murder. The coffee shop setting is a standout element, and I appreciated the historical details included in the author's note. However, while marketed as a mystery, the narrative leans more towards romance, with the mystery playing a secondary role.",
            "Charlotte's parents are overbearing, yet their indifference to her reckless behavior—such as ruining an expensive dress, gallivanting around London, and returning home with a serious arm injury—seems inconsistent and unrealistic. Additionally, Charlotte's seemingly effortless access to her inheritance, enabling her to invest in her cousin's coffee shop overnight, feels implausible for a young, unmarried woman of her era. While Matthew Talbot is portrayed as a commendable character, his unrealistic superhero antics, like rooftop leaping, feel excessive. However, I enjoyed the Scooby Gang dynamic and the diverse cast, particularly Charlotte’s cousin, who delivered a memorable retort when Charlotte lamented her societal constraints. The romance between Charlotte and Matthew was sweet, though the clean romance aspect isn't to my taste.",

            "The story centers on Charlotte, who is betrothed to Hawley, Matthew's older brother, suspected of having killed his two previous wives under mysterious circumstances. While Hawley is portrayed as a cartoonish villain, the plot fails to fully resolve the mystery surrounding his wives' deaths. Although it was satisfying to see him face some consequences, I wished the truth about his past actions had been explored in more depth. The ending leaves us hanging, hinting at future developments. I found Charlotte's twin brother, Alexander, intriguing enough that I would consider reading his story, if published. Despite Hawley's over-the-top villainy and stereotypical henchmen, his motivations felt underdeveloped; the narrative didn't delve into his past crimes or deliver true justice for his ex-wives.",
            "I found myself more engaged in the romance between Banshee, the capuchin, and Pan, the parrot, than in the relationship between Matthew and Charlotte. The chemistry between the human couple felt lacking, and both characters struck me as somewhat peculiar. While Charlotte’s forward-thinking nature made her intriguing, it also rendered her reckless. I appreciated her defiance of societal norms. In contrast, Matthew came across as too perfect—quiet, scholarly, and perhaps a doctor or surgeon—though his profession was unclear. His double life allowed him to achieve heroic deeds with ease, making him seem more like a Gary Sue character and less relatable.",
            "The engaging writing captured my interest, but inconsistencies in character behavior and plot logic diminished the overall experience.",
            "The time period and societal norms felt inconsistent with Charlotte's character, who seemed too modern for her setting. There were also logical gaps, such as her running away from the modiste in her wedding dress without facing repercussions from her overbearing mother or generating any gossip.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Development and Chemistry:**\n   - I was more invested in the romance between Banshee (a capuchin) and Pan (a parrot) than in the romance between Matthew and Charlotte. There was something missing between the human couple that I can't quite pinpoint—perhaps a lack of chemistry or the fact that both characters felt odd to me.\n   - Charlotte was ahead of her time, which made her interesting, but also reckless. I enjoyed her defiance of societal norms.\n   - Matthew, on the other hand, felt too perfect. He was quiet, scholarly, a doctor (or surgeon—it was unclear), and had a double life that allowed him to perform heroic feats effortlessly. He seemed like a \"Gary Sue\" character, which made him less relatable.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The main plot involved Charlotte being betrothed to Matthew's older brother, Hawley, who was suspected of killing his two previous wives under mysterious circumstances. While Hawley was a cartoonish villain, the story took a turn that didn't fully resolve the original mystery of his wives' deaths. It was satisfying to see him face consequences, but I wished the truth about his past actions had been revealed.\n   - The story ended on a cliffhanger, which could set up a potential series. I enjoyed Alexander (Charlotte's twin brother) enough to consider reading his story if it becomes a series.\n\n- **World-Building and Consistency:**\n   - The time period and societal norms were somewhat inconsistent with Charlotte's character, who felt too modern for the setting.\n   - There were logical gaps, such as Charlotte running away from the modiste in her wedding dress without facing repercussions from her tyrannical mother or causing any gossip. This undermined the mother's supposed dominance and the stakes of Charlotte's actions.\n\n- **Villain and Conflict:**\n   - Hawley was an over-the-top villain with stereotypical henchmen, but his motivations and actions felt underdeveloped. While he was clearly up to no good, the story didn't fully explore his past crimes or deliver justice for his ex-wives.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**\n   - The writing was engaging enough to keep me interested, but the inconsistencies in character behavior and plot logic detracted from the overall experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel had its moments, particularly with the quirky animal romance and Charlotte's defiance of societal norms, it fell short in developing believable chemistry between the main human characters and resolving key plot points. The villain felt underdeveloped, and some aspects of the story lacked consistency. However, the cliffhanger ending and Alexander's character left me curious enough to consider reading a potential sequel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "I almost DNFed this book, but I'm glad I pushed through. After taking a break, returning to it felt like diving into something entirely new. I'm not sure if I was simply in a bad mood at the start or if the story truly picked up after the 40% mark, but it ultimately worked for me. Initially, I expected a historical romance with a hint of mystery based on the title, cover, and blurb. However, I found myself confused about the book's direction. Even after 30% in, there was no romance, and the mystery hadn’t progressed. Most of the early chapters focused on a coffee shop, leaving me with little connection to any character and questioning where the story was headed.",
            "The characters captivated me from the start. Sweet, shy, and kindhearted Matthew was utterly irresistible; the more I got to know him, the deeper my affection grew. His caring nature extended not just to people but even to animals, and learning about his difficult past truly tugged at my heartstrings—he's such a wonderful character. \n\nI also loved Charlotte, who fiercely advocated for herself and others, determined to carve out a life beyond her high-society background. She prioritized happiness over privilege, which I found inspiring. The supporting characters, especially her brother, added depth; he recognized her perfect match in Matthew and encouraged their relationship. Though her parents were quite unkind, the warmth of sibling love and the found family dynamic among her friends, particularly those from the coffee shop, enriched the story.\n\nAs the love story unfolded in the second part, I eagerly anticipated the interactions between the main characters. Their relationship blossomed beautifully—it was sweet and heartfelt, with a genuine care for one another. As their connection deepened, I found myself rooting for them even more. The romance was charming yet passionate, making for a delightful read.",
            "The charming animals provide a delightful contrast to the darker elements of the story, creating an entertaining and enjoyable experience.",
            "The mystery in the book became clearer as the story progressed, allowing me to focus on what I was searching for. Initially, I had some doubts about Matthew, which added an intriguing layer to the narrative. The plot wasn't a traditional whodunit; instead, it centered on proving a point and extricating characters from a complex situation. Despite this shift in focus, the story remained engaging, filled with action, attacks, and pursuits, making it a compelling page-turner."
        ],
        "conclusion": "All in all, I ended up enjoying my reading. I think that what got me frustrated at the start might have been that it wasn't what I expected and my mood was off maybe? So I will want to try that author again, I think there is some great potential here and these historical romance mysteries are really growing on me. I also feel like now that the characters have won my heart, it will probably go more smoothly for me in the next one. Looking forward to it.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Initial Struggles and Pacing:**\n   - I got so close to DNFing this one but I am glad I did not. Instead, I took a break and when I got back to it, it was like reading something totally different. Not sure if I was in a bad mood for it when I started or if things just picked up after 40% but it worked for me.\n   - My first thoughts on this book were: this is nothing like I expected... The title, the cover, the blurb. I thought I signed up for a historical romance with a bit of mystery. But right now I am just confused about what this is about. After 30% in, there is still no romance in sight. The mystery part didn't advance at all. I pretty much just learned about a coffee shop, for a lot of pages. Also, I didn't get enough information to fall for any character so far, and I am just wondering where this is all going.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters grew on me so quickly. Sweet, shy and kindhearted Matthew was so damn cute I just couldn't resist him. The more we got to see him, the harder I fell. He was always so caring about everyone (even animals) and when we got to talk about his hard past, my heart just bled for him. Such a wonderful character.\n   - I absolutely loved Charlotte and how she fought for herself and for others as well. She really tried to push that whole high society background out to get the life she wanted. Not caring about privileges and really going for happiness instead.\n   - I absolutely loved the friends and particularly her brother who was pushing his friend with her because he saw the perfect match they were. Her parents might be awful but sibling love is so damn satisfying, and the whole found family with friendship and all the people from the coffee shop made it all better!\n\n- **Mystery and Plot Development:**\n   - The mystery part of the book also got clearer and I knew what I was looking for. With some doubts about Matthew at first, it really made it interesting, and I was looking forward to seeing how they would manage to solve all that was going on.\n   - There wasn't really a big mystery as in a whodunit type of thing, it was more about how to prove something and get out of this situation but it was still pretty interesting and we got the action going on throughout this story with some attacks and pursuits and all so it kept being pretty page-turner worthy.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The love story started taking more space in that second part and I was really looking forward to our MCs' interactions and ended up really loving their story. It was sweet and they truly cared about each other. It got more and more engaging and I was so rooting for them to get together. It was charming but still passionate and it was so nice.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - Add to this the sweet animals that were always there to add a bit of fun to this darker story and it really made for a nice entertaining setup!\n\n- **Series Potential:**\n   - I loved that we got a little bit of an intriguing setup for book two at the end of this one. This is for sure the way to make me look forward to the next one. And I really loved the character it will be about so I'm curious about it all.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll in all, I ended up enjoying my reading. I think that what got me frustrated at the start might have been that it wasn't what I expected and my mood was off maybe? So I will want to try that author again, I think there is some great potential here and these historical romance mysteries are really growing on me. I also feel like now that the characters have won my heart, it will probably go more smoothly for me in the next one. Looking forward to it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5 (rounded up)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot had potential but was too wordy and convoluted, with twists and turns that dragged the story down rather than enhancing it.  \n   - The pacing suffered due to excessive modern verbiage and contemporary \"talking points\" that felt out of place in the historical setting.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The \"good\" characters, such as Charlotte and Dr. Lord Matthew Talbot, were likable and well-drawn.  \n   - The villains were easy to hate, which added to the story's tension.  \n   - However, the lack of chemistry or steam between the main characters made their romantic connection feel underwhelming.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Authenticity:**  \n   - The author seemed to lack a working knowledge of formal address and honorifics, which detracted from the historical authenticity.  \n   - The inclusion of modern ideals and language felt jarring and inconsistent with the early-Georgian England setting.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing wasn’t bad, but it was overly verbose and could have benefited from tighter editing.  \n   - The humorous moments were a highlight, adding levity to the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n   - The book concludes with a happy ending and an epilogue, which provided a satisfying resolution.  \n   - The informative author’s notes were a positive addition, offering context and insight into the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential with its intriguing premise and likable characters, it was ultimately weighed down by excessive wordiness, a lack of historical authenticity, and underwhelming romantic chemistry. The humorous moments and satisfying ending were highlights, but the overall execution fell short of expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "Lady Charlotte is a clever and intelligent woman, but her modern ideas often feel out of place in the historical setting. Her tendency to suspect nearly every male character of villainy becomes tiresome. In contrast, Matthew emerges as a heroic figure, having risen above his abusive upbringing to become a dedicated physician and healer. The secondary characters, particularly those at The Black Sheep coffee shop, add depth and charm to the narrative. The inclusion of a parrot and a monkey as prominent characters is a delightful touch, and I appreciated the subtle humor woven throughout the story.",

            "Charlotte and Matthew are captivating, modern Regency characters. Charlotte defies societal norms as a strong-willed woman who secretly invests in a coffee house and investigates her betrothed, Lord Hawley. Meanwhile, Matthew, the third-born son of a noble family, is training as a surgeon and dedicating himself to studying flora and fauna while rescuing victims of human trafficking. The found family dynamic at the Black Sheep coffee house adds depth and charm to the narrative. Their slow-burning romance is filled with tension and chemistry, facing challenges such as family trauma and societal expectations. Although the romance is low-steam, featuring mostly clothed intimate moments, it remains profoundly engaging.",

            "The story follows Lady Charlotte as she seeks to escape her betrothal to the enigmatic Viscount Hawley. While the title hints at a wider romantic narrative, the plot primarily centers on Charlotte's investigation into Hawley and her quest for independence. Her relationship with Matthew, Hawley’s younger brother, serves as a slow-burn romance that takes a backseat to the main storyline.

The dynamic between Charlotte and Matthew is both sweet and deeply rooted in their enduring friendship, which gradually evolves into romance.

            "This novel blends a sibling's best friend romance with an opposites-attract dynamic set against a historical backdrop. The premise is intriguing, as Lady Charlotte uncovers her parents' plan to marry her off to a man rumored to have murdered his previous wives. However, the plot struggles to cohesively integrate its various elements—romance, mystery, and humor—resulting in a disjointed narrative. The cloak-and-dagger mystery feels contrived, and the tone fluctuates, leaving readers uncertain whether the story aims for lightheartedness or seriousness.",
            "The \"sibling’s best friend\" trope is a delightful aspect of the story, particularly in Alexander's efforts to play matchmaker for his sister Charlotte and his best friend Matthew. Matthew's longstanding crush on Charlotte adds a charming depth to their dynamic, although their mutual obliviousness can be frustrating. As they collaborate to implicate Matthew's brother, their bond develops; however, at times, it feels somewhat contrived.",
            "The story's tone is inconsistent, shifting between lighthearted romance and a serious woman-in-peril narrative. Humorous elements, such as an exceptionally well-trained parrot, clash with the darker themes of murder and danger. This lack of cohesion disrupts the pacing, causing the story to drag."

Perfect for fans of the “brother’s best friend” trope and closed-door historical romances.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Joined by her brother and his best friend—who happens to be her fiancé's brother—Charlotte seeks to thwart the engagement. As the plot unfolds, a potential romance blossoms between Charlotte and her brother’s best friend.",

Matthew, her brother’s best friend, is also well-developed, and their budding romance is worth rooting for. The supporting cast, including charming animals and lively coffeehouse patrons, adds a delightful touch to the story. However, while I enjoyed the romance between Charlotte and Matthew, their chemistry felt somewhat shallow due to a lack of exploration into their shared history. It came across more as a new romance than one grounded in a long-standing connection, which could have enriched the narrative.",

            "This novel is a charming blend of romance, intrigue, danger, and humor. It follows Lady Charlotte as she seizes control of her destiny to escape a forced marriage to a menacing suitor. The story features lively banter, strong camaraderie among the main characters, and a shared mission to expose the villainous Viscount Hawley. However, the subplot involving a parrot and a capuchin monkey feels excessive, and one unresolved mystery—how Charlotte explained her arm in a sling to her mother—left me feeling slightly unsatisfied.",
            "The characters in this story are mostly likable, with notable exceptions being the villain, Viscount Hawley, his henchman, and the hero's family, as well as the heroine's parents. Lady Charlotte stands out as a strong and determined protagonist, supported by her beloved twin brother, Alexander, and his best friend, Mathew Talbot. Mathew, the third son of a duke, offers a refreshing contrast to his bullying older brothers. The dynamics among Charlotte, Alexander, and Mathew are engaging, particularly as they collaborate to save Charlotte from an unwanted marriage. The romance between Charlotte and Mathew is central to the narrative; Mathew has loved Charlotte since childhood, and his distress over her betrothal to his brother adds emotional depth. Their relationship develops naturally as they work together toward their shared goal.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story revolves around Lady Charlotte’s efforts to thwart her engagement to Viscount Hawley, who is suspected of foul play in the deaths of his previous wives. Dr. Matthew Talbot, Hawley’s brother and Charlotte’s brother’s best friend, aids her in uncovering the truth while hiding his own secrets. While the premise was intriguing, I struggled to stay engaged due to pacing issues. Even as events picked up, I didn’t feel fully engrossed in the storyline.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The romance between Charlotte and Matthew, her brother’s best friend, was a highlight, as were the found family moments. The tension between supporting characters Mr. Powys, an established actor and playwright, and Calliope, an aspiring playwright and Charlotte’s friend, added depth. Additionally, the quirky love affair between Pan, a parrot, and Banshee, a capuchin, brought a unique charm to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Appeal:**  \n  The novel combines multiple appealing elements, including mysteries, romance, and a strong-willed heroine striving to take control of her future. These aspects initially drew me to the story, but they weren’t enough to sustain my full engagement throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had promising elements—mysteries, romance, and a determined heroine—the pacing and lack of immersion in the storyline made it difficult for me to stay fully engaged. The found family moments, quirky animal subplot, and tension between supporting characters were my favorite parts.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "This novel masterfully intertwines a gripping murder mystery with a gentle romance. Initially, the mystery takes center stage, while the romantic subplot remains subdued, only beginning to blossom in the latter third of the book, around the 70% mark.",
            "The heroine, Lady Charlotte, is forthright and outspoken, providing a stark contrast to the shy and stuttering hero, Matthew Talbot. Matthew's internal conflict deepens his character as he grapples with his feelings for Charlotte while also coming to terms with his brother's engagement to the woman he once loved. Meanwhile, the secondary characters play a crucial role in advancing the plot, frequently overshadowing the main protagonists.",
            "This was my first experience with the author, and their incorporation of animals alongside engaging storytelling has left me eager to explore more of their work in the future.",
            "The parrot and the monkey bring humor and charm to the story, enhancing its enjoyment and memorability."

        "conclusion": "*Lady Charlotte Always Gets Her Man* is a charming blend of mystery and slow-burn romance, with standout secondary characters and delightful animal antics. While the romance takes time to develop, the humor and unique elements make it a worthwhile read. The author’s writing has left a positive impression, and I look forward to reading more from her.",

The romantic elements don’t fully develop until the latter part of the book, around 70% in.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The heroine, Lady Charlotte, is forthright and outspoken, which contrasts with the hero, Matthew Talbot, who is shy, stumbles, and stutters around her.  \n   - Matthew’s internal conflict adds depth to his character, as he struggles with his feelings for Charlotte while dealing with his brother’s engagement to the woman he once loved.  \n   - The secondary characters play a significant role in driving the story forward, often overshadowing the main protagonists.  \n\n- **Romance Dynamics:**  \n   - The romance is slow-burn rather than intense or spicy, which may appeal to readers who prefer a gradual build-up.  \n   - Personally, I prefer heroes who are bossy and domineering, so Matthew’s shyness didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n- **Humor and Unique Elements:**  \n   - The animals in the story, particularly the parrot and the monkey, add humor and charm, making the book enjoyable and memorable.  \n\n- **Author and Writing Style:**  \n   - Violet Marsh is a new author to me, but her inclusion of animals and the overall storytelling have made me eager to explore more of her work in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Lady Charlotte Always Gets Her Man* is a charming blend of mystery and slow-burn romance, with standout secondary characters and delightful animal antics.

All thoughts are my own.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this is a solid historical romance novel with a good mix of intrigue and adventure.

            "The book incorporates several engaging tropes: Brother’s Best Friend, Opposites Attract, Forced Engagement, a touch of murder mystery, and Slow Burn. While these elements added depth, the murder mystery ultimately felt more like a side plot than a central focus. The writing was captivating, and I particularly enjoyed the relationship development between Matthew, the male main character, and Charlotte. Matthew's character was endearing, and their slow-burn romance stood out as a highlight of the story."

The relationship between Matthew and Charlotte was heartwarming, and the historical details about coffeehouses added depth.

Fans of \"Friends\" might catch references and enjoy the story more, but I didn’t notice any connections.  \n\n- **Tropes:**  \n  The book includes several tropes: Brother’s Best Friend, Opposites Attract, Forced Engagement, a side of murder mystery, and Slow Burn. These elements added layers to the story, though the murder mystery felt unnecessary by the end and more like a side plot than a main focus.  \n\n- **Historical Context (Coffeehouses in the 1700s-1800s):**  \n  I found the historical details about coffeehouses in the 1700s-1800s fascinating and educational. It added depth to the setting and made the story more engaging.  \n\n- **Writing and Relationships:**  \n  The writing was intriguing, and I enjoyed the development of the relationships, particularly between the MMC, Matthew, and Charlotte. Matthew’s character warmed my heart, and their slow-burn romance was a highlight.  \n\n- **Murder Mystery Subplot:**  \n  While the murder mystery was fun initially, it felt disconnected by the end and didn’t seem essential to the main plot. It could have been integrated more seamlessly or left out entirely.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This book was a fun read and satisfied my Bridgerton craving. It’s a solid 3-star read and a great choice for a light Spring read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was an enjoyable mix of romance, historical context, and tropes, though the murder mystery subplot felt unnecessary. The relationship between Matthew and Charlotte was heartwarming, and the historical details about coffeehouses added depth. While it didn’t fully resonate with me, it’s a solid and entertaining read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 Stars"

            "The novel begins slowly but gains momentum in the second half, ultimately becoming quite engaging. The twists and turns in this mid-18th-century historical romance kept me thoroughly intrigued.",
            "Both main characters are endearing, particularly the male protagonist, Matthew, who experiences significant personal growth. His backstory, marked by bullying from his older brothers and feelings of isolation, adds depth to his character. The female protagonist is strong and unwavering in her feelings once she comes to trust Matthew. Their childhood connection, coupled with her initial hesitation due to his ties to the villain, adds complexity to their relationship. The introduction of numerous side characters hints at possible standalone stories. Overall, the novel feels like the beginning of a series, enriched by its vibrant cast and immersive world-building.",
            "I enjoyed the historical details, particularly the contrasts in dress and weaponry compared to the Regency era. The 1700s setting offered a refreshing change, as I haven't come across many books from this period.",
            "The romance is clean, featuring only kisses, a few fantasized thoughts, and the lyrics to a bawdy ditty. The secret life of the male main character adds an intriguing layer to the narrative."

Matthew, the male lead, is refreshingly multidimensional, with interests beyond just women and wealth. His character arc involves growth and maturity, which adds depth to the story.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The romance is sweet and cute, with a focus on mutual growth rather than one-sided dependency.

I would highly recommend it to others and look forward to potential sequels.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
