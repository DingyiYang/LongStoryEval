            "The story follows a group of friends as they seek revenge for the murder of one of their mothers, Maria, while also bracing for an impending hurricane. This dual narrative of personal vengeance and an approaching natural disaster creates a gripping, emotionally charged experience. The exploration of the theme that every story is, at its core, a ghost story adds depth and reflection to the narrative.",
            "The author skillfully constructs complex, realistic characters who defy simplistic notions of good and evil. Their relatable motivations and decisions make even their most extreme actions believable. The emotional depth and struggles of these characters, especially amid harsh living conditions, are compelling and elicit genuine empathy.",
            "The novel's use of Spanglish enhances its authenticity but may pose a challenge for non-Spanish speakers. The writing is beautifully crafted and resonates with a raw, lived-in quality. The engaging narrative strikes a balance between bleakness and hope, steering clear of tedium or overwriting.",
            "Set against the backdrop of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, the novel vividly captures the tension and resilience of the island's inhabitants. It powerfully illustrates the recurring theme of hurricanes and their devastating impact on the community, emphasizing the stagnation and lack of progress despite the frequent disasters.",
            "The story evokes deep emotions, leaving me heartbroken yet hopeful. The author's skill in weaving hope into a bleak narrative is a standout feature. I felt a strong connection to the characters and their struggles, making the story both impactful and memorable."

        "conclusion": "House of Bone and Rain is a powerful and emotionally charged novel that masterfully intertwines personal vengeance with the backdrop of a natural disaster. The exceptional character development, authentic writing style, and ability to evoke deep emotions make this book a standout. Despite the bleakness, the narrative is infused with hope, leaving a lasting impression on the reader. This is arguably the author's best work yet, and I highly recommend it.",

Sure, it’s exactly like it, except for the bloodlust, the multiple homicides, the age of the characters, the devastating weather events, and the fish people. Other than that, it’s basically the same story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character work is by far the best part of this book. Each person is carefully crafted, with a depth of interiority and complexity. None of them are without significant flaws, nor do they remain static in their arc. The palpability of their friendship is immense, and the weight of their mutual love is felt, which helps make sense of the many terrible decisions made throughout.  \n\n- **Pacing and Repetitiveness:**  \n  It got a bit repetitive at times. The cycle of hunting down a bad person, torturing and killing them, showing surprise about how far a “good” person will go in the name of retribution, confiding in a beautiful, wise female person but never taking her advice, and then starting the cycle over became a noticeable pattern.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  Gabino Iglesias can write his ass off. The prose is compelling and showcases his skill as a storyteller.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some repetitiveness in the plot, this novel shines through its exceptional character development and the palpable depth of the relationships between the characters.

            "The story illustrates how violence perpetuates itself, yet Bimbo's friends fail to hold him accountable. While Gabe occasionally points out this harmful cycle, the narrative often portrays it as more rewarding than detrimental. The deaths of key characters come across as oddly perfunctory, and the resolution feels overly convenient, frequently stretching believability.",
            "I felt frustrated by Bimbo's consistently poor decisions and Gabe's tendency to go along with them despite knowing better. As a first-person narrator, Gabe often seems wise in a way that doesn't align with his character, creating a disconnect that I found challenging. This perspective doesn’t reflect an older, wiser Gabe looking back on past mistakes, which added to my struggle with the narrative.",
            "The prose features sharp observations and poignant sentences that beautifully convey mood, which I appreciated most about the book. Unfortunately, the audiobook narrator did not do justice to the author's style, often rushing through these moments and neglecting to emphasize them appropriately.",
            "I wanted to enjoy this story, but it ultimately fell flat for me. Revenge narratives aren't to my taste, and that should have been a warning sign. Despite being marketed as horror, it never truly delivered on that front. While it included supernatural elements, it felt more like a blend of magical realism and revenge, or perhaps a touch of folk horror at best."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the book had moments of brilliant prose, the genre confusion, frustrating character decisions, and unsatisfying narrative resolution made it a disappointing read for me. The audiobook narration further detracted from the experience by failing to highlight the strengths of the author's writing.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - I wanted to like this, but it did nothing for me. Revenge stories aren't my thing, and that should have been enough to get me to leave it alone from the beginning.  \n  - Since it was marketed as horror, I thought there would be some interesting elements, but it never felt much like horror to me. It had supernatural elements, but it felt more like a magical realism revenge story, or perhaps folk horror at a stretch.  \n\n- **Character Development and Decisions:**  \n  - I was frustrated by the constantly terrible decisions Bimbo made, and Gabe's willingness to follow along even when he knows better.  \n  - Gabe, as a first-person narrator, often comes across as wise in a way that doesn't align with his character. This mismatch was consistently a struggle for me, especially since it isn't presented as an older, wiser Gabe reflecting on the past.  \n\n- **Narrative and Moral Ambiguity:**  \n  - The violence only begets more violence, and Bimbo's friends never hold him accountable. Even when Gabe occasionally tries to show that this is a vicious cycle, the text often makes it seem more rewarding than terrible.  \n  - The deaths of major characters are treated as weirdly perfunctory, and the resolution feels too convenient and often defied believability for me.  \n\n- **Prose and Narration (Audio Version):**  \n  - Iglesias' prose includes sharp observations and single sentences that convey mood exceptionally well. This was by far the thing I liked most about the book.  \n  - However, the audiobook narrator didn't seem to appreciate Iglesias' style. They often rushed past these moments or failed to give them the emphasis they deserved.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had moments of brilliant prose, the genre confusion, frustrating character decisions, and unsatisfying narrative resolution made it a disappointing read for me. The audiobook narration further detracted from the experience by failing to highlight the strengths of Iglesias' writing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As a result, the central revenge theme gets overshadowed, diminishing the story's overall cohesion.",

            "*House of Bone and Rain* unfolds in Puerto Rico as a hurricane approaches, delving into themes of vengeance, poverty, and life's fragility. The narrative centers on five lifelong friends whose lives spiral into violence following the murder of one of their mothers. The novel masterfully blurs the lines between the mundane and the supernatural, using ghosts and monsters as poignant metaphors for profound societal and moral issues.",
            "The bond among the five young men lies at the heart of the story, depicting a steadfast friendship tested by extreme circumstances. Their journey challenges readers to consider who the true monsters are—those who perpetrate violence or the systems that sustain poverty and despair.",

This fiercely original novel represents a significant evolution in storytelling, introducing a unique sub-genre, barrio noir, that seamlessly blends horror, thriller, crime, old-world Catholicism, mysticism, and supernatural elements. The writing is bold and uncompromising, delivering an intensely visceral experience where violence and tension reach extreme heights.",
            "While references to Cormac McCarthy and Clive Barker suggest the novel's tone and style, they do not fully encapsulate the author's distinctive voice and accomplishments. The book defies simple categorization, demonstrating the author's talent for pushing boundaries and crafting something truly original."

The author delivers their most impactful and mature work yet, combining visceral violence, supernatural elements, and profound themes of friendship, vengeance, and societal decay. This novel cements the author as a fiercely original voice in contemporary literature, and it’s clear they’re only just beginning to showcase their immense talent.",

            "This book captivated me despite initial impressions of typical coming-of-age narratives. Far from mainstream, it recounts the tale of a group of lawless thugs pursuing their own brutal version of justice, putting their loved ones at grave risk.",
            "The boys prioritize their friendship above all else, supporting one another even as one embarks on a brutal murder spree. Each feels a duty to back their friend due to past loyalties in smaller conflicts, resulting in morally questionable choices.",
            "The author's exceptional writing talent keeps the story engaging, even amidst its graphic content. The vivid depictions of violence serve as both a strength and a potential drawback, depending on the reader's tolerance for gore.",
            "This book requires a trigger warning due to its graphic violence, depicted in vivid and brutal detail that immerses readers in each harrowing moment. While it centers on the theme of friendship among a group of boys, it diverges sharply from typical coming-of-age narratives.",
            "I would consider reading another book by this author but will check reviews first to prepare for the content. I was surprised that other reviews did not highlight the graphic violence, as it is a key aspect of the story.",
            "Readers anticipating a tale reminiscent of *Stand By Me* or other boyhood bonding stories will be in for a jarring surprise. Although I have a penchant for mysteries, police procedurals, and crime novels, this book stands out as the most graphically violent and gratuitous I’ve encountered in years."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a gripping yet intensely graphic departure from typical coming-of-age stories. While the author’s writing is exceptional, the vivid depictions of violence and morally complex character dynamics make it a challenging read. It defies genre expectations and leaves a lasting impression, though it may not be suitable for all readers.",

            "This novel offers a captivating exploration of revenge, friendship, and the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. It follows Gabe and his four friends as they embark on a quest for vengeance after one of their mothers is shot by a drug lord. The intertwining themes of loyalty, loss, and the supernatural create an intense and thought-provoking narrative.",
            "The five main characters are richly developed and complex, embodying deep humanity with both sympathetic and flawed traits. Their sometimes repellent actions only add to their authenticity. The palpable bond among the brothers enhances the narrative, while their individual struggles and motivations remain compelling throughout.",

The devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria is portrayed with striking realism and emotional depth, adding a haunting dimension to the story. Evocative prose captures the island's atmosphere, as seen in the line: “The island became a playground for death, a place of death and angry ghosts, a shuddering house of bone and rain.”",

However, these elements are integral to the story and its authenticity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite potential criticisms, *House of Bone and Rain* is a compelling read with unforgettable characters and a gripping blend of crime and supernatural elements. Gabino Iglesias' ability to craft flawed yet engaging characters and deliver emotionally resonant storytelling makes this a standout novel for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the pacing and cohesion of the plot could have been stronger, the exploration of themes like morality and revenge, along with the well-crafted friend group, makes it a tentatively recommendable read. My high expectations may have influenced my critique, but the book still leaves a lasting impression.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "In this twisted coming-of-age tale, the real challenges are not graduation or romance, but grief and vengeance.\n\nThis supernatural thriller follows five teenage boys in Puerto Rico as they embark on a murderous quest for retribution following the murder of one of their mothers. As the story unfolds, the boys confront unsettling truths about themselves, their home, and the nature of revenge.\n\nWhile the premise might suggest a conventional revenge plot, the novel captivates with its shifting narratives, keeping readers on edge. What begins as a quest for vengeance evolves into a supernatural chase, and I can easily envision this book being analyzed in an English class, rich with provocative themes, symbols, and complex characters. Personally, I enjoyed unraveling the novel's many layers.\n\nAlthough the ending is somewhat disappointing, primarily due to the high bar set by the rest of the story, it remains passable. The book stays true to its themes and ultimately delivers an exceptional read. By the end, the haunting narrative lingers long after the last page is turned.",
            "The novel opens with five teenage boys, each playing a distinct role in the plot, though their importance varies. Central to the story is Gabe, the only male narrator, who is burdened by emotional trauma after losing his father at ten. He clings to his friends for support, as the male figures in their lives embody stereotypical negative traits: violent, confrontational, and rash. However, the author skillfully balances these characteristics by revealing their positive sides; they are not devoid of emotions and showcase loyalty and affection towards one another. This complexity adds depth to the characters as their strengths and flaws shift throughout the narrative. The real tension arises not from a high-stakes mission, but from the fear that their unwavering loyalty could lead to dire consequences. Their motto, \"If someone messes with one of us, they mess with all of us,\" takes on a cult-like intensity, highlighting the weight of their bond.",
            "In this novel, death is a constant presence, yet the violence depicted is anything but mindless. Each element is treated with respect, setting it apart from many Hollywood films. Puerto Rico comes alive through vivid descriptions, immersing readers in the experience as if they were trapped in the eye of the hurricane alongside the characters. The novel also embraces its bilingual nature, with characters seamlessly switching to Spanish—sometimes offering translations, but often leaving them untranslated. Unlike other works that struggle with the integration of non-English languages, *House of Bone and Rain* makes the use of Spanish feel entirely natural."
        ],
        "conclusion": "House of Bone and Rain is a hauntingly beautiful and magically gripping novel that delves into themes of grief, vengeance, and brotherhood. The author crafts a story that is both a supernatural thriller and a poignant coming-of-age tale, set against the vivid backdrop of Puerto Rico. The novel's complex characters, evocative writing, and layered plot make it a standout read, despite a slightly underwhelming ending. The author treats the material with respect, focusing on heart rather than shock-value, resulting in a narrative that lingers long after the final page.",

While the book touches on Puerto Rico’s colonial relationship with the United States, this commentary remains sporadic and underdeveloped. \n\nThe portrayal of Afro-Caribbean religious elements, including amulets, prayers, and rituals, starts with cultural authenticity.

The detailed and gruesome killings, along with elements of dark magic and supernatural ghosts, make it a chilling read that is certainly not for the faint of heart. Be sure to check the trigger warnings!"

I could still follow the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - It was an atmospheric read—I was transported to Puerto Rico.  \n   - I felt like I was there experiencing the horrors of the hurricane with the characters.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The book interwove real-life political issues, and it felt authentically bleak.  \n   - It opened my eyes to the devastation of the hurricane and its aftermath, as well as the lack of aid based on where you live in the world.  \n   - It was an emotional journey—I felt the injustice, betrayal, anger, hopelessness, and sadness.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n   - It’s listed as Mystery & Thrillers, but I’d say it could also go under Horror.  \n   - The killings, dark magic, and supernatural ghost story elements were detailed and gory—definitely not for the faint of heart (check trigger warnings!).  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - I really liked the 180-degree flip in a character’s morality (“We don’t hurt women—what are we doing?”). It was the cherry on top.  \n   - I thought the ending felt a bit rushed, especially with the ocean reef and Bimbo/his girlfriend subplots.  \n   - Some of the dialogue felt repetitive.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Overall, I really enjoyed the story. There was a lot going on, yet the author did a great job giving each part its time and tying it all together.  \n   - I appreciated the journey I went on as a reader—it’s so unique, and I haven’t read a book remotely like it.  \n   - I’ll definitely recommend this book! It would also make a great audiobook, especially to hear the Spanish dialogue spoken aloud.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a unique and emotionally impactful read, blending atmospheric storytelling, bilingual dialogue, and themes of political and social injustice. While the ending felt slightly rushed and some dialogue was repetitive, the overall experience was immersive and unforgettable. I highly recommend it, especially for fans of atmospheric, genre-blending stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story unfolds during a devastating hurricane, and the intense but plausible violence is a significant part of the narrative.  \n\n- **Magic and Monsters:**  \n  The story includes magic and monsters, though their role is ambiguous. The magic might be allegorical, representing themes like the fallout of colonialism and human delusion. The monsters add a Lovecraftian horror element, but the story could almost work without them.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The plot is complex and not entirely straightforward. There are weird little side stories that wander off unexpectedly, and the ending left me bewildered. The denouement, particularly the plot twist, was hard to explain and contributed to my overall confusion.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is excellent, with moments of dark humor that cracked me up. However, there are instances of infodumping and lengthy monologues that occasionally bogged down the pacing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are deeply flawed but feel extremely human. Their rationalizations and interpretations of events through a particular filter make them compelling. The protagonist's gradual slide from shock over violence to dispassionate acceptance is a key part of their arc.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Genre:**  \n  The book is unique and not quite like anything I've read before. It has elements reminiscent of Paul Tremblay's \"Cabin at the End of the World\" and the horror parody \"Meddling Kids,\" blending psychological thriller with horror.  \n\n- **Themes and Allegory:**  \n  The story explores heavy themes, including the fallout of colonialism and human delusion.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Prose and Writing Style:**  \n   - I really liked Gabino Iglesias's prose in *House of Bone and Rain*.  \n   - There are some incredibly quotable lines throughout the book, which save it from being a complete loss.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters are insufferably annoying and show shockingly little growth by the end.  \n   - Their lack of development makes the revenge story and horror elements fall flat.  \n   - I genuinely wanted the protagonists to fail due to their unlikable nature.  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n   - The plot is sloppy and meandering, filled with repetitive complaints about the state of Puerto Rico.  \n   - The narrative is painfully tedious, with a thinly veiled coming-of-age tale that fails to deliver.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n   - The book attempts to blend a violent revenge story with supernatural horror, but the execution falls short.  \n   - The supernatural mythology feels lame and underdeveloped, detracting from the potential for creative terror.  \n   - The coming-of-age themes are overshadowed by the characters' lack of growth and the repetitive preaching.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n   - *House of Bone and Rain* is nowhere near as good as Iglesias's previous novel, *The Devil Takes You Home*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Gabino Iglesias's prose shines with quotable lines, *House of Bone and Rain* ultimately disappoints due to its insufferable characters, sloppy plot, and underdeveloped supernatural elements. The book fails to deliver on its potential as a haunting revenge-horror story, making it a significant step down from the author's previous work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/10 (2.5 Stars, Rounded Down)"

            "The pacing is superb, gradually building tension throughout the novel. Intense scenes, such as the shocking moment on page 55, make it impossible to put the book down. The story maintains its grip, even during the most overwhelming moments.",
            "The setting of Puerto Rico is vividly brought to life, drawing me into the story from the start. The author skillfully crafts an eerie, supernatural atmosphere that deepens as the narrative unfolds. The line “Todas las historias son historias de fantasmas” (All stories are ghost stories) effectively sets the tone for the novel. By page 134, the palpable chaos and fear—marked by destruction, death, and vengeful spirits—make the island resemble a “playground for death.” The book provides a rich exploration of Puerto Rican culture, seamlessly integrating folklore and myths into the plot. Notably, the connection between the sea and the supernatural, especially through the enigmatic “fish” at the reef, adds depth and intrigue. Though the “fish” may not link directly to a specific myth, it feels authentic and enhances the story’s mysterious allure.",

Even for someone who doesn’t typically enjoy horror, this book is a wild and unforgettable ride through the shadows of Puerto Rico.",

            "The narrative centers on five Puerto Rican friends—Gabe, Xavier, Tavo, Paul, and Bimbo—who embark on a quest for revenge following Bimbo's mother's murder. Complicating their mission is a hurricane, which intertwines themes of vengeance, natural disaster, and supernatural occurrences. Told mainly from Gabe's perspective, the story provides a nuanced exploration of the characters and their intertwined lives.",

The narrative strikes a balance between a crime thriller and horror, placing particular emphasis on the unsettling aspects of the genre.",

            "The initial chapters were enjoyable, but by the halfway mark, the story felt like a laborious slog. The excessive violence stretched on, making me wish for a quicker conclusion. The ending, particularly the resolution involving the fish and brotherhood, didn't resonate with me.",

The setting and the tension/mystery of potential supernatural evil mixed in with the violence in the bloody, rainy backdrop were so good at first. The hurricanes and Gabe’s thoughts on colonialism felt so real and full of potential.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - I just didn’t vibe with the writing style. Examples like \"Her hair smelled great; one of those fragrances with a name I can never remember\" or \"Natalia was a castle as much as she was a woman\" felt overly lyrical and didn’t resonate with me. The scene with Bimbo and Kimbo punching each other felt like a hot messy pie of mumbo jumbo. Maybe I’m missing the poetry in such prose, but it didn’t work for me.  \n\n- **Character Development and Themes:**  \n   - Gabe’s angst, terror, bone-deep losses, love, and blind loyalty weren’t lost on me. The concept of brotherhood was interesting but got kinda cheesy and didn’t quite hit for me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Execution:**  \n   - The first couple of chapters were enjoyable, but halfway through, it started to feel like a lot of work to get to the end. The pages and pages of violence dragged on, and I found myself wanting it to end. The ending didn’t work for me, especially with the fish and the brotherhood resolution.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Despite the promising premise and strong start, the writing style, pacing, and ending left me unsatisfied. I went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars but ultimately rounded down because of the ending. I can’t say I’d recommend this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a compelling setting, premise, and initial tension, the writing style, pacing issues, and unsatisfying ending detracted from my overall enjoyment.

The story includes a dreamer kid trying to escape the hood with the girl he loves and his best friend, who is resigned to the thug life and accepts his fate.  \n\n- **Socio-Political Commentary:**  \n  Beneath the surface-level elements of the plot, the book delivers a scathing critique of U.S. policy toward Puerto Rico. It highlights the unjust and hypocritical nature of colonial occupation, a topic often ignored by mainstream American media and public discourse. The narrator’s musings on the paradoxes of being a colony—such as the freedom to access abortions and drink at 18—add depth to this commentary.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The writing is raw, unflinching, and in-your-face, which aligns with the book’s themes and subject matter.

The victims are depicted as \"bad guys\" complicit in the crime, justifying their deaths within the story's logic.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  Gabe's girlfriend, Natalia, is upset about the boys' actions and Gabe's lies but seems less troubled by the murders themselves. The group's bond and loyalty are central, with the power of teen friendship portrayed as the ultimate value.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot involves the boys taking on a drug kingpin, his gang, and supernatural allies. Despite having no clear plan, they miraculously succeed every time, which strained my ability to suspend disbelief.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are interesting and unique, but they lack significant growth or change throughout the story.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and World-Building:**  \n  The novel creates a morally repugnant and unbelievable fantasy world where revenge and friendship dominate. The tone is gritty and unapologetic, with a focus on the boys' relentless pursuit of vengeance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel's moral ambiguity and lack of believability were off-putting, its gripping plot, pacing, and unique characters kept me engaged. Despite its flaws, I found it hard to put down.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars (for plot, pacing, and character interest, despite moral and believability issues)."

It follows Gabe and his group of longtime friends as they navigate the horrors of everyday life in Puerto Rico. When Bimbo's mother is killed, the group is driven to avenge her death, leading them into a dark and violent journey. The plot is layered with elements of gore, ghosts, cartel power, broken government promises, myths, and dark magic, creating a rich and unpredictable narrative.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story is set against the backdrop of Puerto Rico, with the impending threat of the biggest hurricane to hit the island. Local folklore adds a layer of tension and fear, as dark entities and spirits are believed to reside in the storm's wind and rain. This atmospheric setting heightens the sense of dread and unpredictability throughout the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, particularly Gabe and his friends, undergo significant transformation as they become consumed by revenge and the darkness brought by the hurricane. Their descent into violence and unpredictability causes rifts in their friendships and relationships, adding depth to their development.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story is emotionally charged, evoking a range of emotions from the reader. The themes of revenge, loss, and the supernatural create a powerful and haunting experience that lingers long after the book is finished.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  As a fan of *The Devil Takes You Home*, I didn’t expect to love this book as much, but I was pleasantly surprised. Gabino Iglesias has crafted a story that is equally compelling and impactful, solidifying his place as a master storyteller.\n\n- **Recommendation and Personal Impact:**  \n  I highly recommend this book and will be doing so for years to come. It’s a story that stays with you, and I was so moved by it that I immediately purchased a physical copy after reading the ARC.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a masterful blend of revenge, horror, and supernatural elements, set against the vivid and atmospheric backdrop of Puerto Rico. Gabino Iglesias delivers a story that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars!"

The story also delves into the horrific impacts of loss on a young and malleable mind, capturing the brutality of such experiences.  \n\n- **Literary Influences and Style:**  \n  The book is a fascinating literary hodge-podge, drawing inspiration from *Macbeth* (e.g., the ‘ghost of Banquo’ trope and its impact on sanity) and *Moby Dick* (e.g., seeking justice at the cost of everything and everyone around oneself).

I remained uncertain whether these elements were meant to be interpreted literally, metaphorically, or through the lens of an unreliable narrator. This ambiguity made for an interesting but occasionally confusing read.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  While I ultimately enjoyed the book, it took some time to get into the groove of the story.

The story unfolds as a chaotic mix of revenge, violence, folklore, and death, set against the vivid backdrop of Puerto Rico. It explores themes of brotherhood, ghosts, ancient mysteries, and the haunting nature of stories. The narrative is deeply tied to the island's culture, the devastation of violent storms, and the struggle to move forward.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The author paints a rich and immersive vision of Puerto Rico, capturing its culture, the horrors of violent storms, and the pervasive crime. The setting serves as a powerful backdrop that enhances the emotional weight of the story.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters, particularly Gabe, are well-developed and compelling.

The recurring idea that \"all stories are ghost stories\" or that \"all stories are ghosts\" adds a haunting layer to their personal journeys.  \n\n- **Narration (Audio Version):**  \n  The audiobook narrators, Jean-Marc Berne and Daya Mendez, delivered solid performances. Berne's narration of Gabe and the overall narrative was smooth and enjoyable, though his ability to voice a variety of characters felt inconsistent at times, with accents occasionally dropping off and returning. Daya Mendez excelled in voicing chapters requiring a woman's perspective, adding depth and authenticity to those sections.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping and atmospheric tale of friendship, loss, and revenge, deeply rooted in Puerto Rican culture and folklore. The story's haunting themes and vivid setting make it a memorable read. The audiobook, while not flawless, is well-narrated and enhances the experience. Highly recommended.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The premise of a group of barely adult men defeating a major supernatural drug cartel stretches credibility and demands significant suspension of disbelief.

While the narrative is gripping, it can be frustrating, particularly when innocent people are harmed due to a misguided investigation. The ironic revelation that the culprit is Bimbo's girlfriend's brother adds complexity to the plot. The pacing is generally effective, maintaining momentum throughout the story. However, Bimbo's reckless decisions and delayed actions become increasingly tiresome, and his tendency to involve his friends in his schemes, though rooted in their strong bond, begins to feel repetitive.",

His descent into madness is largely witnessed through Gabe's perspective, who narrates the unfolding events.

At times, I found myself wishing Gabe would have intervened more decisively to curb Bimbo's destructive trajectory.",

            "The story follows five friends—Bimbo, Gabe, Xavier, Tavo, and Paul—who embark on a quest to avenge the murder of Bimbo’s mother, Maria, during a fierce hurricane in Puerto Rico. My main critique is the absence of a clear plan from Bimbo and the group. They appear to be improvising as they confront formidable adversaries like Brujos and drug lords. While their youth may account for some disorganization, I believe a more structured approach would have enhanced the believability of their mission.",

            "At first glance, the story centers on a group of friends ensnared in revenge, gang violence, and murder in San Juan. However, it unfolds into a multi-faceted narrative rich with supernatural elements, folklore, cryptids, and an abundance of gore. The true horror of the tale lies in its portrayal of everyday life in Puerto Rico, particularly during hurricane season. Set against the backdrop of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017, the narrative reflects the tragedy that claimed around 3,000 lives, leaving many without power for months or even years.",

These themes are intricately woven into the narrative, resulting in a story that is both thought-provoking and emotionally impactful.",

Since mafia/gang stories aren’t typically my thing, I was apprehensive at first. However, this turned out to be one of my favorite reads this year.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  On the surface, the story follows a group of friends who get caught up in revenge, gang violence, and murder in and around San Juan. But it evolves into a deeply layered narrative that explores supernatural elements, folklore, cryptids, and plenty of gore. The real horror lies in the depiction of \"normal\" life in Puerto Rico, particularly during hurricane season. The story is set during Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017, killing around 3,000 people and leaving many without power for months—or even years.  \n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel provides powerful commentary on poverty, violence, family, friendship in the face of adversity, government corruption/apathy, and colonialism. These themes are woven seamlessly into the narrative, making the story both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book made me laugh, cry, and feel horrified at different points. It’s a heartbreaking yet compelling exploration of human resilience and societal struggles.  \n\n- **Author’s Work:**  \n  I enjoyed this book so much that I’m eager to explore more of Gabino Iglesias’ works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping blend of supernatural horror, social commentary, and emotional depth.

Bimbo is portrayed as uber-violent and unintelligent, and his crew is equally hapless and unappealing.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n  The writing feels disjointed and implausible, as if it were written in a drug-induced stupor. The mystical elements related to the hurricane are unrealistic and detract from the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I did not enjoy this book at all. The plot, characters, and execution were all unappealing. The intriguing title was misleading, and the book felt like a waste of time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel failed to deliver on multiple fronts, from its unlikable characters and implausible plot to its poorly executed mystical elements. It was a disappointing read, and I cannot understand why others found it appealing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nWorst book I've read in a while."

While I understand the characters were meant to be flawed or make poor decisions, their actions lacked consistency, which made it hard for me to stay invested in their storylines.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing felt clunky at times, which disrupted the flow of the narrative and made it harder for me to stay immersed in the story.  \n\n- **Expectations and Presentation:**  \n  I had high hopes for this book, especially given its gorgeous cover, but the content didn’t live up to my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I was disappointed with this novel. While it had potential, the inconsistent character development, slow pacing, and clunky writing made it difficult for me to connect with the story or care about its outcome.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

This connection is central to the book's themes: How far would you go to support a friend? What is the cost of revenge? As Gabe, the main character, poignantly states, “Vengeance is like any other drug; it destroys your life while offering only a fleeting sense of satisfaction.”",

That tied into the book's central themes: How far would you go to stand by a friend? And what is the price of seeking vengeance? Like Gabe, the main POV character says, \"Vengeance is like any other drug; it destroys your life while making you feel good for a useless moment.\"  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story makes the setting of Puerto Rico come alive, and I liked the idea of setting the story during a hurricane and its aftermath.  \n\n- **Horror Elements and Plot Execution:**  \n  The book's horror elements and final twist didn't land as strongly for me as they did in previous Iglesias books, but overall I really enjoyed the book's mix of horror and crime noir.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  I am once again looking forward to the next Gabino Iglesias novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*House of Bone and Rain* is a compelling blend of horror and crime noir, with strong themes of friendship and vengeance.

            "The novel follows a Puerto Rican teen on a quest for revenge for his mother’s murder, framed by the catastrophic backdrop of Hurricane Maria. This setting introduces supernatural elements, including ghosts, demons, and haunting visions. However, the revenge narrative often feels repetitive and frustrating, particularly due to Bimbo’s relentless pursuit of vengeance and Gabe’s blind loyalty despite his better judgment. The story highlights significant themes such as the lack of accountability for Bimbo’s actions and the toxic masculinity evident in their group dynamics. At its core, the novel explores \"ride or die\" male friendships, love, and loss, reflecting the complexities of Puerto Rican culture.",
            "The characters, especially Bimbo and Gabe, were frustratingly static and lacking in accountability. Bimbo's actions went largely unchallenged, with only Paul daring to voice logic, yet he was unfairly branded a coward. While the portrayal of machismo and toxic masculinity was authentic, it often overshadowed the opportunity for more profound character development.",
            "The book opens with gripping action, violence, and suspense, immediately capturing my attention. However, the author's inconsistent translation of Spanish words and phrases undermined the experience, as some were translated while others were not. This imbalance disrupted the flow and authenticity of the language, ultimately detracting from my overall enjoyment.",
            "The paranormal horror elements were skillfully executed and truly engaging, featuring a surprising twist that caught me off guard. Puerto Rico emerged as a character in its own right, which I found particularly compelling. The incorporation of Santeria and the backdrop of Hurricane Maria added both depth and cultural significance, though the latter may be triggering for some readers due to its traumatic implications for the island."

        "conclusion": "While *House of Bone and Rain* has its strengths, such as its engaging paranormal horror elements, cultural depth, and the portrayal of Puerto Rico as a central character, it falls short in character development and consistency in language use. The revenge plot and toxic masculinity themes felt repetitive and frustrating, detracting from the overall experience. Despite these flaws, the book offers a unique exploration of Puerto Rican culture and supernatural horror.",

The lack of accountability for Bimbo’s actions and the toxic masculinity within the group dynamics were notable themes.\n   - The exploration of \"ride or die\" male friendships, love, and loss is central to the story, reflecting a reality of Puerto Rican culture.\n\n- **Writing Style and Language:**\n   - The book starts strong with action, violence, and suspense, which initially drew me in.\n   - The author’s approach to translating Spanish words and phrases into English felt inconsistent. Some parts were translated, while others were left untranslated, which disrupted the flow and authenticity of the Spanish language. This inconsistency was frustrating and detracted from the reading experience.\n\n- **Cultural and Paranormal Elements:**\n   - The paranormal horror elements were well-executed and engaging, with a twist that I didn’t see coming.\n   - Puerto Rico is portrayed as a character in itself, which I appreciated. The inclusion of Santeria and the setting during Hurricane Maria added depth and cultural significance, though the latter might be triggering for some readers due to its traumatic impact on the island.\n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**\n   - The characters, particularly Bimbo and Gabe, were frustrating due to their lack of growth and accountability. Bimbo’s actions were never challenged by the group, except by Paul, who was unfairly labeled a coward for speaking logic.\n   - The machismo and toxic masculinity depicted in the book were realistic but often overshadowed the potential for deeper character exploration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *House of Bone and Rain* has its strengths, such as its engaging paranormal horror elements, cultural depth, and the portrayal of Puerto Rico as a central character, it falls short in character development and consistency in language use. The revenge plot and toxic masculinity themes felt repetitive and frustrating, detracting from the overall experience. Despite these flaws, the book offers a unique exploration of Puerto Rican culture and supernatural horror.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5 stars)"

Some chapters even contain more headings than pages. The plot centers on the protagonist's efforts to take down Puerto Rico's most notorious crime boss, but the characters' strategies are overly simplistic and repetitive, often reduced to “We’re gonna punch him in the face.” Additionally, the narrative takes an unexpected and disorienting turn into a surreal, Innsmouth-like setting in Puerto Rico, which further derails the story and complicates its coherence.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Focus:**  \n   - The concept of \"A Group of Friends\" is intriguing, but the story primarily focuses on only two characters, which feels unbalanced and disappointing.  \n\n- **Structure and Format:**  \n   - The chapter format is confusing and inconsistent. While the chapter titles suggest multiple perspectives, 90% of the chapters are from the protagonist's point of view.  \n   - The use of synoptic headings at the start of each chapter initially seems stylish but becomes excessive and silly, especially since the chapters are very short (3-5 pages). Some chapters even have more headings than pages.  \n\n- **Plot and Execution:**  \n   - The plot revolves around taking down the biggest crime boss in Puerto Rico, but the characters' plans are overly simplistic and repetitive, often boiling down to \"We're gonna punch him in the face.\"  \n   - The story takes an unexpected and confusing turn into a surreal, Innsmouth-like setting in Puerto Rico, which derails the narrative and makes it hard to follow.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n   - The writing itself is good at times, but the book feels unnecessarily long and could have been 100 pages shorter.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n   - The reviewer compares this book unfavorably to *The Devil Takes You Home*, which they found far superior.  \n   - They also mention that this book does not resemble *Stand By Me*, despite potential similarities in premise.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - While there were parts of the book that were enjoyable, the overall experience was disappointing, leading the reviewer to stop reading before finishing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had moments of strong writing and an interesting concept, but its inconsistent structure, repetitive plot, and confusing narrative detours made it a chore to read. The reviewer ultimately chose not to finish the book but remains open to exploring the author's previous works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is provided, but the review conveys a generally negative impression of the book."

However, given the high praise for that book and the absolutely gorgeous cover, I knew I had to pick this one up.  \n   - While it wasn’t a favorite of the year, I ended up appreciating so much about this story and the author’s writing.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n   - This book is definitely not for everyone. It is very dark and violent, though not necessarily scary.  \n   - The story largely reads like a revenge crime thriller, with the revenge being bloody and gnarly. However, the book’s focus isn’t solely on the revenge plot.  \n   - At its core, the book is about a group of male friends growing up in a violent part of Puerto Rico where options are limited, and loyalty is paramount. Their pact—that an attack on one is an attack on all—drives the story, but the bonds and relationships between the boys, who come to see themselves as brothers, are the heart of the narrative.  \n   - The book doesn’t glamorize violence or portray the boys as noble characters for their actions, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Paranormal Elements:**  \n   - The paranormal elements in the story were a highlight for me. The ghostly visions, dark magic, and sea creatures added a layer of intrigue and depth.  \n   - The refrain, “All stories are ghost stories,” resonated with me, and I loved how it tied into the narrative.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The setting during and immediately after Hurricane Maria added immense atmosphere, fear, and confusion to the story, enhancing its emotional impact.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending took me by surprise and added a lot to my overall feelings about the story. While I wished it had been fleshed out a bit more, I loved what it conveyed about the rest of the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a dark, violent, and deeply atmospheric story that explores themes of loyalty, brotherhood, and revenge. While not for everyone, it offers a compelling narrative with rich paranormal elements and a surprising, thought-provoking ending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Cosby and Stephen Graham Jones.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - The sense of place is incredibly strong, with Puerto Rico vividly evoked through all five senses.\n   - Iglesias’ love for his homeland shines through, even as he critiques its flaws, especially in the context of life post-Hurricane Maria.\n\n- **Plot and Twists:**\n   - The tension is high from the start, with the impending hurricane and a character’s vow for revenge setting an unsettling tone.\n   - A major twist elevates the story, making it both original and a meaningful conversation with the genre’s history.\n   - The final third of the book is particularly satisfying, with every detail tying together in a way that feels both clear and impactful.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a masterful blend of lyrical prose, brutal violence, and emotional depth. It excels in character development, pacing, and setting, while delivering a story that is both original and deeply rooted in its genre. The free verse poems, strong sense of place, and powerful themes make it a standout read. Fans of S.A. Cosby and Stephen Graham Jones will find much to love here.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

The way the narrative developed kept me hooked and eager to see what would happen next.  \n\n- **Author's Skill and Future Expectations:**  \n  I can't wait to read more from Gabino Iglesias! His storytelling left a strong impression on me, and I’m excited to explore more of his work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a captivating and emotionally resonant read, blending fun and heartbreak in a way that kept me thoroughly engaged. It reminded me of Stephen King's coming-of-age stories but with a more inclusive and thoughtful approach. I highly recommend it and look forward to more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
