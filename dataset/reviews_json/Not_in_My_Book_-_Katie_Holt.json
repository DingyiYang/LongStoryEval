            "I absolutely loved the premise of two academic rivals in graduate school who are compelled to co-author a book due to their fiery clashes in class. The way they channel their true feelings for each other through the characters in their story is both engaging and enjoyable to read.",
            "The interplay between the female lead, a romance writer, and the male lead, a literary fiction author skeptical of happy endings, was captivating. Their collaboration on a romantic book meant to defy conventional endings introduced an engaging tension. The slow-burn romance unfolded at just the right pace, with the added angst providing significant emotional depth. A standout moment was their spicy scene, crafted before any romance blossomed, which was particularly memorable and skillfully executed.",
            "One of my favorite aspects of the story was the chapters featuring the characters writing scenes together. The seamless transition from playful banter and arguments to unspoken romantic tension was beautifully executed. Despite the narrative being told from a single point of view, the excerpts from their writing offered valuable insights into the male lead's emotions, enriching the overall depth of the story.",
            "The novel skillfully blends several of my favorite tropes, such as academic rivals to lovers, a book-about-books theme, and the classic \"only one bed\" scenario. These elements are seamlessly integrated into the narrative."

The idea of them using the characters in their book to indirectly express their true feelings for each other was incredibly engaging and fun to read.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The dynamic between the female lead, a romance writer, and the male lead, a literary fiction writer who doesn’t believe in happily ever afters, was fascinating. Their collaboration on a romantic book that wasn’t supposed to end happily created a lot of tension and intrigue.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  The chapters where they were writing scenes together were some of my favorite moments. The transition from banter and arguments to romantic undertones they were too scared to admit aloud was executed beautifully. Even though the story is told from a single POV, the excerpts from the book they’re writing provided glimpses into the male lead’s feelings, which added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  The slow-burn romance was perfectly paced, and the angst added emotional weight to the story. The spicy scene they wrote together before anything happened between them was particularly memorable and well-done.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The novel incorporated several tropes I adore, including academic rivals to lovers, a book-about-books theme, and the classic “only one bed” scenario. These elements were woven seamlessly into the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an incredibly enjoyable read with a unique premise, well-developed characters, and a satisfying slow-burn romance.

They are flawed, raw, vulnerable, and real, making them easy to love and memorable.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is a slow burn with creative twists, such as having the main characters write a smut scene together. This adds a new level of tension and pining, making it a standout moment in the book. The pacing balances humor and emotional depth, keeping the reader engaged.  \n\n- **Standout Moments:**  \n  1) The scene where Rosie and Aiden write a smut scene together is highlighted as a creative and tension-filled moment that elevates the story.  \n  2) The line, “Use your words, baby, you’re a writer, aren’t you?” is mentioned as a memorable and impactful moment, encouraging readers to pick up the book.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal:**  \n  The novel is likened to *Scream* in the horror genre—it critiques and reflects on romance while embracing its beloved clichés. It’s a story that burrows under your skin and leaves a lasting impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Not in My Book* is a delightful romcom that combines humor, self-awareness, and emotional depth. With its witty banter, flawed yet lovable characters, and creative storytelling, it’s a must-read for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n☆☆☆☆.5"

After the third time the male main character clenched his jaw, I found myself flipping to the next chapter, pondering how much richer the narrative would have been with a dual POV. Eventually, you do gain some insight into the characters. However, the conflict in the end felt somewhat contrived; the characters are in their mid-twenties yet they break up over issues reminiscent of high school drama. Still, the story delivers a satisfying HEA (happily ever after).",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The novel features an academic rivals-to-lovers story with a genuine rivalry and a slow-burn romance. Set in New York City, it follows two NYU students who must overcome their literary differences to collaborate on a work of fiction. The premise is engaging and well-executed, offering a layered love story that feels both fresh and heartfelt.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Rosie and Aiden are standout characters with incredible chemistry. Their dialogue and banter are some of the best I’ve encountered in romance novels. I adored them so much that I wanted to be best friends with them! Their romance is electric, with moments that made my heart race, particularly the writing scene at Aiden’s house.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is transportive, vividly capturing the essence of New York City across all seasons. Reading this after my own trip to the city during the holidays made the experience even more special. The prose is immersive and evocative, making the setting feel alive.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The book includes beloved romance tropes such as grumpy/sunshine, forced proximity, one bed, and slow burn. It also features Latinx representation, which adds depth and authenticity to the story. The yearning and angst are perfectly balanced, making the emotional payoff incredibly satisfying.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  Fans of Emily Henry’s *Beach Read* will find this novel reminiscent of January and Gus’s college days. Comparable authors include Clare Gilmore and Caitlin Moss (*Goodbye Again*). This book is perfect for readers who enjoy banter, academic rivals, and a love story set against the backdrop of New York City.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an absolute gem, delivering a perfect blend of romance, humor, and emotional depth. The characters, setting, and writing style come together to create a story that feels both intimate and expansive. I can’t wait to own a physical copy to annotate and revisit. Katie’s next release is already on my must-read list!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe review does not include specific numerical ratings, but the enthusiastic tone and glowing praise suggest a perfect or near-perfect score."

It’s been months since I was so sucked into a contemporary romance the way I was with *Not in My Book*.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows graduate students Rosie and Aiden, two academic rivals who can’t stand each other and are forced to work together to write a novel for class.

The insults these two hurled at each other at the beginning were incredible, but as they became friends, they had so many tender moments.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  This was also surprisingly spicy, which added an extra layer of enjoyment to the story.  \n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  As a Peruvian-American, it was so cool to see bits of Peruvian culture (mostly food) interspersed throughout the book! The FMC being Peruvian was a big draw for me initially.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Not in My Book* is a captivating contemporary romance that masterfully blends humor, tension, and heartfelt moments. The dynamic between Rosie and Aiden, combined with the unique premise of co-writing a novel, made for an unforgettable read.

The first-person perspective immerses us in Rosie's thoughts, while Aidan's writing offers a candid look into his emotions, deepening their connection and enhancing the romance.",

In contrast, Aiden grapples with his father's disappointment over his decision to pursue writing instead of joining the family’s financial tech company. The premise of their forced collaboration on a novel is both intriguing and well-executed.",

I loved it so much that I had to stop myself several times to avoid finishing it in one go. I was completely invested in Rosie and Aiden's story. The story was sweet, and while a lot of it was quite cliché, that’s probably what made me love it so much.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The plot was a bit predictable for me, but I didn’t mind because it really fit into the story. I can see why others might not have enjoyed it as much as I did, but I’m a huge fan of comforting rom-coms, so it worked perfectly for me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved Rosie as the main character. She wanted to live a romance while acknowledging that romance books aren’t reality. She was both a dreamer and a realist, and she had her flaws, which she didn’t try to hide. Aiden is the typical love interest—a bit grumpy but with a soft spot, which I found endearing.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  It was a pleasure to listen to the story. Frankie Corzo did an amazing job narrating it. Sometimes, I don’t like it when women try to sound deeper when voicing male characters, but Frankie did it in a way that didn’t make me cringe. I’ll definitely look out for more audiobooks narrated by her.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and RBmedia for this Audio-ARC! I can’t wait for Katie Holt’s future projects!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful, comforting rom-com that perfectly matched my tastes. While the plot was predictable, the clichés and charming characters made it an enjoyable read. The audiobook narration was excellent, and I’m excited to see what Katie Holt writes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "One aspect I found disappointing was the ending conflict; it felt predictable and was resolved in an immature manner. While the characters are in their 20s, the fallout from such a conflict seemed unrealistic.",
            "The gradual unveiling of Aiden's character throughout the chapters and seasons was truly heartwarming. His journey through grief and loss is relatable, capturing the struggle of finding a way to live in the aftermath. The supporting characters also shone brightly; Logan brought humor, while the sweet dynamic between Jess and Tyler was delightful. Alexa added her own unique charm and wit to the story, enhancing the overall experience.",
            "I can hardly believe this is the author's debut novel. She writes about books with the passion of a lifelong lover. While I don't want to assume that Rosie’s experiences and thoughts mirror the author's own, the shared Peruvian-American background adds a personal touch that enriches the narrative.",
            "I absolutely love books set in NYC, especially those that unfold over the seasons. Spanning a whole year allows for a deeper connection with the characters, even if the book is the same length as one set over a week. This approach adds depth and a sense of real-life progression.",
            "I have a soft spot for stories centered around book lovers, reminiscent of *You’ve Got Mail*. Aiden embodies the essence of Gus, but I’d say he elevates the rivals-to-lovers trope to an even greater intensity."

Pacing the story over a whole year makes it feel like we get more time with the characters, even if the book isn’t longer than one set over a week. It just adds depth and a sense of real-life progression.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  I adore books about book lovers or anyone in the book world—very *You’ve Got Mail* vibes. Aiden gave major Gus vibes in the best way possible, but I’d argue he took the rivals-to-lovers trope even more intensely than Gus did.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  It was sweet to see Aiden’s layers peeled back throughout each chapter and season. He is a character many people can resonate with, dealing with grief and loss and figuring out how to live in the aftermath. The side characters were also fantastic. Logan was hilarious, and the sweet relationship between Jess and Tyler was top-notch. Alexa added her own charm and humor to the mix.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n  I truly cannot believe this is Katie Holt’s debut novel. She writes about books like someone who has been a lifelong lover of them. While I don’t want to assume everything Rosie said and experienced reflects Katie’s own thoughts, it gives the book a personal touch knowing that both Katie and Rosie are Peruvian-American.  \n\n- **Conflict Resolution:**  \n  One aspect I didn’t love was the conflict at the end of the book—it felt predictable and was handled in a very immature way. I know they are still in their 20s, but I can’t imagine such a fallout from a conflict like that.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll in all, this is a wonderful romance novel written by a romance lover for romance lovers!

The angst and yearning were skillfully portrayed, and I appreciated the missed opportunities leading up to their eventual union, which felt perfectly timed. Much of the narrative had a holiday vibe, with a significant portion set around Christmas, and New York City served as a vibrant backdrop, almost like a character in its own right. However, the ending and final conflict felt rushed; the story would have benefited from an additional 20 pages to allow for a more natural conclusion.",

This challenge sparks a journey of collaboration, self-discovery, and romance. The novel is told from Rosie’s perspective, but Aiden’s viewpoint is skillfully integrated through excerpts from their joint writing project. This dual-layered narrative enhances the storytelling, making both the main plot and the \"book within the book\" equally engaging.",

Their contentious relationship is marked by sharp verbal exchanges and ongoing conflict, particularly in their writing class. However, as they are compelled to collaborate, their dynamic shifts, revealing a deeper connection and personal growth. The romance between Rosie and Aiden is skillfully developed, illustrating how two seemingly incompatible individuals can discover common ground and fall in love. The narrative delves into themes of vulnerability, authenticity, and the transformative power of collaboration. This grumpy-sunshine trope is executed with remarkable depth and emotional resonance."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  I LOVED the premise of the book. The idea of Rosie and Aiden being paired together to write a book after a blow-up in class was engaging. I especially enjoyed how snippets of their collaborative book were included at the end of each chapter, paralleling their evolving relationship.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Rosie was adorable and relatable—a fellow Swiftie and Peruvian Princess who gave off total \"Lover\" vibes. I appreciated how the author highlighted Rosie’s Latinx culture and her close-knit friend group and family. Aiden, the misunderstood male main character (MMC), had great character development. I loved how he uplifted Rosie and helped her find her confidence while maintaining incredible banter with her.  \n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers trope was executed perfectly. Rosie and Aiden’s relationship was sweet, swoony, and filled with banter, making it a delight for my hopeless romantic heart. The romance was both sweet and spicy, striking the right balance.  \n\n- **Narration:**  \n  The audiobook narration by Frankie Corzo was fantastic. She captured Rosie’s character perfectly, and I couldn’t stop listening.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  This book had everything I love: enemies-to-lovers, banter, Taylor Swift references, adorable side characters, a misunderstood MMC, and a hopeless romantic female main character (FMC).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was seriously so cute and enjoyable. The premise, characters, and romance were all well-crafted, and the narration added an extra layer of charm. If you’re a fan of sweet but spicy romances with great banter and relatable characters, this one is a must-read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n  The novel is set in an MFA program in NYC, where Rosie and Aiden, two aspiring writers with contrasting styles, clash in their creative writing workshop. Rosie writes romances, while Aiden writes literary fiction and despises romances. Their professor forces them to co-write a romantic story without a happily-ever-after (HEA) as their class project, which becomes the central premise of the story.\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story they co-write is based on their own lives, which adds a meta-layer to the narrative and propels the plot in fun and interesting ways. The dual POV structure enhances the storytelling, allowing readers to see both characters' perspectives.\n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  The novel explores several beloved romance tropes, including rivals-to-lovers, grumpy x sunshine, slow burn, and one bed. It also incorporates a book-within-a-book concept, adding depth to the narrative. The setting of New York City at Christmas adds a festive and cozy atmosphere.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Rosie and Aiden are well-developed characters with distinct personalities and writing styles. Their growth, both individually and as a pair, is compelling and satisfying to follow.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The love of romance novels shines through in the writing, making it clear that the author has a deep appreciation for the genre. The tone is engaging, and the open-door/spicy scenes add an extra layer of appeal for romance readers.\n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n  The novel is a quick and enjoyable read, as I was able to finish it in one day while on vacation. The pacing keeps the story moving, and the blend of humor, tension, and romance makes it hard to put down.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful and engaging read, especially for fans of romance and meta-narratives. The clever use of tropes, the well-crafted characters, and the festive NYC setting make it a standout story. The book-within-a-book concept adds an extra layer of intrigue, and the open-door scenes cater to readers who enjoy a bit of spice. Overall, it’s a highly enjoyable and well-executed romance.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5  \nOpen door / spicy!  \n\nThank you NetGalley and Alcove Press for allowing me to review this ARC!"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Originality and Familiarity:**  \n  At first, I thought the story sounded really familiar—a cynical man and a romance-loving girl writing together and falling in love. I expected it to be similar to *Funny Story* by Emily Henry but set in a college setting. However, while there were similarities, I found that both books are different in their own ways, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book was a whirlwind of \"will they, won’t they,\" and I really enjoyed it. The enemies-to-lovers trope was well-executed, and I liked how they loved each other while still maintaining a bit of an adversarial dynamic, though not as extreme as typical enemies-to-lovers stories.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I found myself rooting for Aiden to go to Tennessee and win Rosie back, and when he did, it was incredibly cute. I understood why Rosie was upset about being lied to, but I was glad that Aiden wrote the extra chapters, leading to their happily ever after.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a delightful read with a familiar yet unique take on the enemies-to-lovers trope. The characters' journey was engaging, and the resolution was satisfying, making it a story I truly enjoyed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Any book about books is always a fun read.  \n  - Read this if you love books about books, secret crushes, and Latina representation.  \n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n  - I especially liked the Latina main character. It is so special to read a book where you can actually see yourself being portrayed.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The storyline kept me wanting to keep reading.  \n  - I especially loved the chapters ending with a little blurb from the book they were reading.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  - I loved how this was an enemies-to-lovers, but not really, maybe more rivals-to-enemies with a secret crush.  \n\n- **Author’s Debut and Future Potential:**  \n  - What an excellent debut for Katie Holt; I look forward to reading more from her.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Audience Appeal:**  \n  - I've already recommended this book to a few friends.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful read, combining a love for books, engaging romantic dynamics, and meaningful representation. The unique storytelling elements, such as the chapter-ending blurbs, added to the charm. Katie Holt’s debut is impressive, and I eagerly anticipate her future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5 stars, rounded up to 5.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to Alcove Press for this eARC via NetGalley.

It was fantastic and kept me engaged throughout.  \n  - The miscommunication trope was executed in a deeper and more meaningful way than I expected, which I loved.  \n\n- **Character Development and Perspective:**  \n  - The characters were so blind to their own feelings and the situation that it physically pained me, but in a way that I found compelling and enjoyable.  \n  - I appreciated the unique narrative choice of not having a dual perspective, but the book within the book was written in dual perspective, which felt like a brilliant touch—truly chef's kiss.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a deeply enjoyable read with a well-executed slow burn and meaningful miscommunication. The characters' obliviousness added to the charm, and the narrative structure, including the book within the book, was a standout feature.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was so easy to read that I was completely immersed in the book. The way she writes about New York made me feel like I've been there without actually having been there. I could feel the winter snow through the pages, even though it's literally summer and hot right now.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  I could not stop reading. I stayed up till 5am and finished it in one sitting. The tension between Rosie and Aiden had me hyperventilating to the point I needed to take a breather.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  My favorite parts of this book were the scenes where they were co-writing their novel. The little excerpts at the end of the chapters that gave us insight into Aiden's thoughts on Rosie through the eyes of his character from their novel were the cutest thing ever. The third-act breakup, though predictable, created such good angst that I didn’t mind. The way he had to grovel and beg for her to forgive him had me on my knees. That man was desperate, and I loved every second of it.  \n\n- **Spice and Explicit Content:**  \n  I don’t mind spice, but I draw the line at dirty talk. I’m going to overlook it because spice is very subjective, and I know I’m in the minority that prefers less explicit scenes. But if you’re into that, you’ll love this book.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential and Future Work:**  \n  I honestly can’t believe this was her debut novel. I’m already looking forward to Katie Holt’s next book, even though this book hasn’t even been published yet. I am eagerly waiting for December 10th so I can grab a physical copy!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute delight to read, with its immersive writing, engaging plot, and well-developed characters. Despite some personal preferences regarding explicit content, the story’s charm and emotional depth left a lasting impression. Katie Holt’s debut novel is a standout, and I’m excited to see what she writes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The protagonist's reflection, “The entire time we were together, I could only think you were better than any dream or piece of fiction I could ever write,” highlights the depth of their feelings.

I want to be the person you picture when you're reading and dreaming because you're who I picture every single time. I love you. In light and dark, in romance and litfic.

I particularly adored the micro-trope of the FMC defending the MMC against his family. These elements were woven together seamlessly, evoking the same feelings I had when I first got back into reading romance in 2021.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters, Aiden and Rosie, were endearing but had moments of immaturity, especially in the beginning. Their constant bickering in front of the class felt embarrassing at times. However, Rosie wore her heart on her sleeve, and Aiden’s shy, grumpy demeanor made him a lovable \"little potato.\" Despite the single POV, Aiden’s love and yearning for Rosie were evident through the chapters he wrote in their shared book.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  While the story was super cute overall, some moments felt awkward, like when they included their kiss and other personal moments in the book they wrote together and read aloud to the class. The third act also had its flaws, but these didn’t overshadow the charm of the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s debut effort was commendable. The writing captured the emotional depth of the characters, and the romantic lines were swoon-worthy. For example:  \n  - *“I’m not yours anymore.” “Fine. If you’re not mine, then know that I’m yours.”*  \n  - *“The entire time we were together all I could think was you were better than any dream, any piece of fiction I could ever write.”*  \n  - *“I know you prefer what's in your books, and I pretend I don't want to be like them, but I do. I want to be the person you picture when you're reading and dreaming because you're who I picture every single time. I love you. In light and dark, in romance and litfic.

The anticipation of their classmates waiting for Aiden and Rosie to stop arguing so they could read their book added a fun dynamic.  \n\n- **Author Connection:**  \n  I was thrilled to discover that the author is the owner of my favorite Bookstagram account. This connection made me even more excited about her future works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some minor flaws, this debut novel was a delightful read that captured the essence of romance. I highly recommend it to fellow romance lovers and am eagerly looking forward to more books from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific numerical rating was mentioned, but the overall tone of the review suggests a highly positive impression, likely in the 4 to 4.5-star range."

The combination of relatable academic struggles, the rivals-to-lovers trope, and the likable characters made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a highly enjoyable read with a relatable academic premise, engaging characters, and a charming romance. The academic rivals trope was executed well, and the likability of Rosie and Aiden added to the overall appeal.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley, the Publisher, and the Author for providing an ARC in exchange for an honest review."

Their chemistry is undeniable, and their growth from rivals to lovers is satisfying. The Peruvian representation in Rosie’s character is a nice touch.  \n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**  \n  The romance is cute and steamy, with great moments like bookshop dates and scenes where they write back and forth to each other. The smut scenes are subtle yet hot, and Aiden guiding Rosie through them feels authentic to their characters as writers.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Scenes:**  \n  The writing is enjoyable, with fun and romantic moments throughout. The scenes where they write and practice kissing and smut scenes together are particularly memorable and well-done.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  There’s a third-act breakup driven by miscommunication, but it fits the characters’ backstories and doesn’t feel forced. The resolution is satisfying and ties the story together well.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The book is a great mix of fun, romance, and steam. It’s a highly enjoyable read, and I’m excited for others to experience it when it releases.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a fantastic read with a well-executed enemies-to-lovers trope, engaging writing, and great chemistry between the characters.

It captures the essence of contemporary romance while offering a fresh perspective.\n\n- **Setting and Theme:**  \n  The backdrop of the literary world resonated deeply with me and likely with many other readers. The theme of Rosie fantasizing about her relationship as if it were in a romance book creates a relatable and understanding link between the reader and the character.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both characters, Rosie and Aiden, feel more comfortable expressing their opinions in writing rather than verbally, which made me reflect on my own communication choices. This aspect added a layer of authenticity and relatability to their personalities.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  My favorite aspect of the book is the clever \"dual POV\" created through their joint novel. While the story primarily follows Rosie's perspective, Aiden's thoughts and opinions are revealed through his writing for the novel. This approach adds depth and meaning to their relationship without confusing the reader with a traditional dual POV. It also maintains a reliable and familiar narrative voice.\n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  The book is a romance with depth that can be binged in one sitting (as I did) or enjoyed over time. It strikes a perfect balance between emotional depth and readability.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a highly recommended romance novel that combines relatable characters, a clever narrative structure, and a compelling literary backdrop.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  - The novel revolves around Rosie and Aiden, academic rivals in a writing workshop, who are forced to collaborate on a manuscript combining their genres—romance and literary fiction.  \n  - The academic rivals trope felt authentic, with both characters constantly challenging and critiquing each other.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - I enjoyed the tension and rivalry between Rosie and Aiden, which felt genuine and engaging.  \n  - However, Rosie’s attitude about romance novels needing a \"happily ever after\" (HEA) to be considered romances felt stereotypical and somewhat off-putting.  \n  - Aiden’s reasoning for his behavior made sense initially, but by the end, it felt like an excuse for his actions, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative:**  \n  - I appreciated the small excerpts from the manuscript they were working on, especially since they were mostly written from the male main character’s (MMC) perspective. These sections effectively conveyed their feelings through their book characters’ thoughts.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  - While I enjoyed the story overall, I found myself getting bored around the 60% mark. The pacing seemed to drag a bit in the middle.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  - I appreciated the representation of a Peruvian female main character (FMC), which added depth and diversity to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this novel, particularly the academic rivals-to-lovers dynamic and the creative use of manuscript excerpts to explore the characters’ emotions. However, the pacing lagged in the middle, and some character attitudes felt stereotypical or overly excused. Despite these flaws, I would recommend it to fans of academic rivals-to-lovers stories and those looking for diverse representation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25 stars"

I had everything mapped out from the beginning, which made it feel formulaic and uninspiring.  \n\n- **Character Development and Ending:**  \n  The ending felt off and out of character.
