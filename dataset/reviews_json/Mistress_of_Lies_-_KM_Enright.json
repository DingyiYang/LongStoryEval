While the plot moves at a good pace, it heavily emphasizes politics with minimal action, leading to a lot of \"telling\" rather than \"showing.\" This made the story feel somewhat monotonous and less engaging.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Magic System:**  \n  The concept of blood magic and the hint of vampires initially grabbed my attention, but the magic system wasn't thoroughly explained. The story primarily focuses on the political dynamics between the Blooded and the Unblooded, which felt more like a commentary on control and communism. The term \"vampire\" was misleading, as the characters don't fit the traditional definition of needing blood to survive.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character, Shan LeClaire, is well-crafted with layers to her personality, making her compelling. However, other key characters, such as Samuel Hutchinson and Isaac, felt underdeveloped. Samuel, in particular, needed more depth given his crucial role in Shan's plans.  \n\n- **Romance and Explicit Content:**  \n  The inclusion of explicit scenes felt unnecessary and detracted from the story. While romance is a natural part of life, the detailed descriptions were excessive and limited the book's accessibility to readers under 18. This aspect cost the book a star in my rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Mistress of Lies* presents an intriguing premise with its focus on blood magic and political intrigue, but it falls short in execution due to its heavy reliance on politics, lack of action, and underdeveloped supporting characters.

Additionally, the book relies heavily on \"tell-don't-show,\" diminishing the impact of crucial events and character development.",

Shan, a brilliant spymaster, doesn't convincingly showcase her skills through her actions. Although Samuel's training is frequently referenced, the time jumps obscure his progress. The romance among Shan, Samuel, and Isaac feels rushed and lacks genuine chemistry, as their relationship is told rather than shown, making it unconvincing.",

The central conflict between the Bloodworkers (the ruling class) and the Unblooded (the oppressed) feels superficial, with the Bloodworkers depicted as almost cartoonishly evil. While the themes of racism and abuse of power are significant, they lack the nuance and depth necessary for thorough exploration."

The romance between Shan, Isaac, and Samuel is central to the story, with varying levels of intensity and emotional depth. The mystery of the murders among the Unblooded drives the plot, while the fantasy elements, including dark magic and court intrigue, are seamlessly integrated into the world-building.  \n\n- **Romance Dynamics:**  \n  The romantic relationships are layered and compelling. Shan and Samuel’s connection burns quickly, while Samuel and Isaac’s relationship carries the weight of their shared history as exes. The tension between these three characters is pivotal to the plot, and the way their romance intertwines with the mystery and fantasy elements is deeply satisfying.  \n\n- **Political Intrigue:**  \n  The political landscape is complex and twisty, reflecting the corruption and tyranny of the ruling classes. Shan’s ambition to restore her family’s name and her realization that political rot cannot be undone by removing one despot add depth to the narrative. The anti-monarchy themes and the depiction of a society on the brink of revolution are both engaging and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The secondary world is richly detailed, with magic (Blood Work) woven into everyday life, including gender-affirming practices as seen through Isaac’s perspective. The dark magic and court intrigue are central to both the plot and the atmosphere, creating a decadent and immersive reading experience.  \n\n- **Themes and Aesthetics:**  \n  The book’s aesthetics are captivating, drawing readers into a world of villain protagonists and anti-monarchy sentiments. Themes of corruption, ambition, and revolution are explored with nuance, making the story both thrilling and intellectually stimulating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Mistress of Lies* is a decadent and multi-faceted romantasy that excels in blending romance, mystery, and fantasy.

            "The story intertwines a romantic buildup with a murder mystery, but unfortunately, neither aspect fully engaged me. The murder mystery only gained momentum in the final chapters, while the romantic development felt unconvincing. My favorite moments were the interactions between Samuel and Isaac, but they were often overshadowed by scenes featuring Shan.",
            "**Shan:** As a key POV character, Shan hails from a disgraced aristocratic family and covertly manages a spy network. Although she is depicted as perceptive and intelligent, I found her frustrating. She often became distracted by high society events and her romantic interests, detracting from the murder mystery. Additionally, her monarchist views and insensitivity to the plight of the Unblooded made her character arc less appealing to me. \n\n**Samuel:** The other POV character, Samuel, is a poor citizen who learns he is the heir to an ancient bloodline. While he starts with noble intentions to reform the country, his obsession with Shan causes him to lose focus on his goals. Unfortunately, his character seemed to diminish as the story progressed, which was disappointing. \n\n**Isaac:** The third member of the central polyamorous triad, Isaac, serves as the king's Royal Blood Worker and stood out as the most intriguing character. His kindness and dedication were refreshing, but the absence of his POV felt like a missed opportunity to delve deeper into his character and secrets. \n\n**Anton and Bart:** Shan’s twin brother, Anton, and his boyfriend, Bart, were standout side characters. Anton’s hidden agenda and dynamic with the central characters were compelling, and I wished they had received more attention, perhaps even their own POV. \n\nThe central polyamorous romance didn't resonate with me; I found Shan's relationships with both Samuel and Isaac to be unbalanced and lacking depth. The minimal interaction between Samuel and Isaac was particularly disappointing, leaving their potential unexplored.",
            "The setting of Aeravin features a stark division between two classes: the Blood Workers, who wield blood magic, and the Unblooded, who do not. This dynamic fosters a clear class struggle, with the Unblooded facing oppression from the Blood Workers. While the worldbuilding serves its purpose, it lacks originality and fails to break new ground.",
            "This book features many elements I usually enjoy in fantasy: a unique blood magic system, a magical murder mystery, a central queer polyamorous romance, and a trans love interest crafted by a trans author. Additionally, it explores a group of characters striving to dismantle systems of oppression. Unfortunately, the execution of these promising elements left me disappointed."

            "The novel centers on Shan, the new matriarch of the declining Le Clair family, as she seeks to regain the King's favor by manipulating Samuel Hutchinson, an Unblooded. However, Samuel proves to be a challenging pawn, and their situation becomes even more precarious when the King orders them to identify a killer targeting the Unblooded, threatening their loved ones in the process. The murder plot is compelling and intricately woven into the backdrop of civil unrest, making it a standout aspect of the story. The reveal of the killer is both surprising and skillfully executed.",
            "Shan is a deeply flawed protagonist, characterized by her cluelessness and selfishness. Her callous attitude toward the Unblooded, including her own brother, is infuriating. While she attempts to reform the system, she clings to her privileges, revealing her failure to recognize the sacrifices necessary for genuine change. This complexity adds depth to her character, yet her lack of self-awareness remains evident even at the story's conclusion.",
            "The story unfolds in a cookie-cutter world marked by a stark divide between the privileged Blooded and the oppressed Unblooded, mirroring systemic oppression and racism. While this theme is familiar, it resonates with contemporary social and political issues, particularly in the U.S. Although the setting feels relevant, it lacks groundbreaking originality. The magic system offers a unique twist on vampirism and blood magic; the Blooded consume blood to enhance their abilities, but it deviates from traditional vampire lore. This allows for unconventional uses of Blood Magic, adding an intriguing layer to the narrative.",

Key developments often occurred off-page, making it feel like the main characters, Shan and Samuel, were not actively engaged in the investigation despite the narrative suggesting otherwise.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world felt shallowly developed, lacking depth and detail that could have made the setting more immersive and believable.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters, Shan and Samuel, never felt more than one-dimensional. Their actions and motivations lacked complexity, making it difficult to connect with them on a deeper level.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The MMF romance was too fast-paced to be believable, lacking the necessary build-up and emotional depth to make it feel authentic.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes several heavy themes and triggers, such as murder, public execution, blood, classism, child abuse, off-page rape (not involving main characters), racism, human trafficking, and the death of a parent.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its intriguing premise and strong start, it ultimately fell short due to stagnant pacing, shallow world-building, underdeveloped characters, and an unconvincing romance. It was a struggle to finish, and I would have considered not finishing it if it weren’t an ARC.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing varied throughout the story, with some slower moments feeling less engaging than the more dynamic scenes. I also wished the polyamorous aspect had been explored in greater depth, as it often seemed overshadowed by the grand parties.",
            "The representation of Filipino culture was a standout aspect for me. I appreciated the inclusion of our dishes and the authentic family dynamics, particularly Shan’s interactions with her brother, Anton. The subtle depiction of Filipino family values resonated with me as someone raised in that culture. All the characters were complex and well-developed, though I found them hard to trust. Shan LeClaire is an iconic anti-hero with relatable motivations, but I wished for more of her scheming and plotting. Samuel’s character development was intriguing, though he sometimes came off as preachy. Isaac was a compelling character with impressive powers, but I felt his perspective was lacking, especially given his significant role in the story.",

It offered everything I could have hoped for and more, including polyamorous relationships, vampires, political intrigue, and dual perspectives."

            "Shan's character was the most disappointing aspect of the story. The blurb and first chapter present her as a cunning, ambitious antiheroine—a brilliant spymaster planning to overthrow a tyrannical king. Instead, she comes off as brash, self-absorbed, and easily manipulated. Her efforts to protect her brother often backfire, and she only complicates matters for the unblooded plebeians she claims to support. Shan refuses to listen to their concerns and mirrors the very nobility she despises, making her hypocrisy and cowardice frustratingly unlikable. \n\nWhile Samuel possesses powerful and unique magic, he remains bland and underdeveloped. His magical growth occurs off-page, and he ultimately devolves into Shan's sidekick, wasting his potential and rendering their dynamic forced and uninteresting. The book also neglects to explore the unblooded perspective, despite its political fantasy premise. The narrative would have been more compelling if it focused on characters like Isaac, Alessi, and Anton, who truly represent the unblooded, rather than on Shan and Samuel's shallow interactions.",

I believe it would have been more engaging had the narrative focused on different characters and perspectives. The first half was particularly hard to get into, but I found myself distracted from these issues by the developing throuple dynamic. Unfortunately, the last 15% of the book failed to deliver, leaving me confused and unsatisfied."

After that point, I was distracted from the lack of quality by the blooming polyamorous relationship (throuple). However, the last 15% of the book was a disaster and didn’t make sense to me.\n\n- **Character Development (Shan):**  \n  Shan’s character was the biggest letdown. The blurb and first chapter portray her as a vicious, ambitious antiheroine, a brilliant spymaster, and a rebel plotter aiming to overthrow a tyrannical king. Instead, she comes across as brash, overconfident, self-obsessed, and easily manipulated. She constantly botches her stated goal of protecting her brother and makes things worse for the unblooded plebeians she claims to champion. She refuses to listen to the unblooded and acts like the nobility she despises. Her hypocrisy, cowardice, and centrist mentality make her a frustrating and unlikable character.\n\n- **Character Development (Samuel):**  \n  Samuel is the most powerful and unique character in terms of his magic, but he is bland and underdeveloped. His magical growth happens off-page, and his character devolves into becoming Shan’s lapdog. His potential was wasted, and his dynamic with Shan felt forced and uninteresting.\n\n- **Plot and Logic:**  \n  The plot’s logic falls apart, especially in the last 15%. Shan kills her father in the first chapter but later opposes murder, even when the victims are slave traffickers. This inconsistency undermines the story’s credibility and leaves me questioning the character’s motivations.\n\n- **Representation and Perspective:**  \n  The book fails to adequately explore the unblooded perspective, despite its political fantasy premise.

I didn’t feel like we were given a good sense of the world or its culture, aside from a few mentions of food here and there.\n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic aspect was a little better. I liked the descriptions of blood working and the claws they wore on their fingers, but it still felt underdeveloped.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  For something billed as a “dark romantic fantasy,” I felt very meh about the romance. Insta-lust never really does anything for me. A slow-burn could have been *so* good here, but alas…\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The story is easy to follow in audiobook format, and I liked the narrator’s accent and tone—she suited this sort of fantasy tale very well. However, I found her narration a bit confusing at times. The emphasis sometimes sounded like it was in the wrong part of the sentence, or there would be pauses where there probably shouldn’t be. For example, “You’ve jeopardized everything for this Aberforth” came out sounding like “You’ve jeopardized everything for this, Aberforth,” as if the character was addressing Aberforth instead of referring to him. These little things tripped me up occasionally while listening.\n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  I just wanted *more* from this—more depth, more darkness, more decadence.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some intriguing elements, such as the magic system and the audiobook narration, it fell short in world-building, romance, and delivering the dark, richly imagined story I was hoping for.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was interesting enough to keep me hooked, but the pacing was all over the place. The plot was straightforward, following a murder investigation, but it got too busy and distracted with political intrigue and other ‘side quests.’ These side elements didn’t contribute much to the story or help me understand the world better.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding was vague, which made it difficult to care about the political intrigue. Despite the book’s length, I couldn’t grasp the bigger picture. There was a lot of showing but not enough telling, leaving me wanting more clarity about the world.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were okay, and I enjoyed the focus on them. However, they didn’t have that ‘oomph’ to make me obsessed with them.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I loved the writing overall, though the repeated use of certain words (like ‘demure’) became grating.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  There was a romance subplot that I didn’t care about, including a love triangle. While I appreciated the trans representation, the romance didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Potential and Comparison:**  \n  The book reminded me of what I imagined Dragon Age would be like—specifically, a non-blood mage in Tevinter going after slavers. I see potential in the series and am excited to continue reading it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed *Mistress of Lies* for its intriguing plot and character focus, the uneven pacing, vague worldbuilding, and lackluster romance subplot held it back from being a standout read. Despite its flaws, the book shows promise, and I’m looking forward to the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded up for potential)."

Both he and Shan fail to understand the true cost of revolution versus oppression, which is frustrating given the story’s political themes.",

Key questions about the magic system—its limits, the implications of using one's own blood versus someone else's, and the distinctions between strong and weak Blood Workers—remained unanswered. This lack of detail felt careless and detracted from the narrative's focus on power struggles.",

After reading negative reviews upon its release, I approached it with tempered expectations. Unfortunately, the book heavily prioritizes romance over its intriguing premise, sidelining the murder mystery to focus on the dynamics between Shan, Samuel, and Isaac. The romance lacks depth, relying on fleeting glances, blood-sucking encounters, and an inexplicable attraction to Samuel's morally ambiguous power. While Shan and Isaac share a connection rooted in their history, Samuel's chemistry with either character is notably absent."

After reading negative reviews upon its release, I went into it with middling expectations.  \n\n- **Plot and Substance:**  \n  *Mistress of Lies* felt like a book written for aesthetics rather than substance. While I can appreciate a \"no plot, just vibes\" approach, it doesn’t work for a dark political fantasy. The murder mystery plot is never taken seriously by the characters, who instead focus on attending parties and indulging in unearned romantic angst.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Magic System:**  \n  The worldbuilding was lacking, with no clear explanation of Blood Working. Basic questions about the magic system—such as its limits, the difference between using one’s own blood versus someone else’s, and the distinction between strong and weak Blood Workers—were left unanswered. This lack of detail felt lazy and undermined the story’s focus on power struggles.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements and Relationships:**  \n  The book leans heavily into Romantasy, prioritizing the romantic relationship over the intriguing premise. The murder mystery is sidelined to make room for the dynamics between Shan, Samuel, and Isaac. However, the romance fails to deliver, with little substance beyond characters making eyes at each other, sucking each other’s blood, and finding Samuel’s morally questionable power inexplicably attractive. Shan and Isaac’s connection has some basis in their shared history, but Samuel lacks chemistry with either of them.  \n\n- **Character Development and Consistency:**  \n  Samuel is the dullest character in the book, with his moral conflict about his power being the only intriguing aspect. However, his inconsistency and lack of depth overshadow this potential. Despite being Unblooded, Samuel shows no real insight or care for their struggles. Both Shan and Samuel fail to grasp the cost of revolution versus oppression, which is frustrating given the story’s political themes.  \n\n- **Overall Disappointment:**  \n  *Mistress of Lies* was a disappointment in terms of plot, worldbuilding, and character development. While I might check out the sequel in the hope that the author has improved, this book fell far short of my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its promising premise, *Mistress of Lies* prioritizes aesthetics and romance over substance, resulting in a lackluster plot, underdeveloped worldbuilding, and inconsistent characters. While it has some intriguing elements, they are overshadowed by its flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Anticipation and Expectations:**  \n  - Mistress of Lies was my number one most anticipated debut of the year. Everything about it sounded amazing, and I couldn’t wait to read it.  \n  - My intuition about the book was spot-on, and it exceeded my expectations, becoming one of my top three favorite debuts ever.  \n\n- **Writing and Storytelling:**  \n  - The writing and storytelling are amazing, making the book an instant favorite and one of my top reads of the year.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - I love vampire novels, especially when they lean into high fantasy rather than paranormal romance. This book delivered a unique take, blending blood magic with vampire vibes.  \n  - The combination of fantasy with sci-fi elements was executed exceptionally well, particularly the fusion of blood magic and science.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  - The poly romance was a standout element, and the development of the relationships was top-tier.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n  - The murder mystery and puzzle-solving aspects were perfectly suited to my tastes, especially within a fantasy setting.  \n  - The court intrigues, morally gray characters, and villainous main characters were brilliantly executed without feeling tropey or trend-following.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The three main characters were incredibly well-written, with compelling arcs that left me eager to see how they evolve in future installments.  \n  - Shan is a personal favorite, but the two male characters were also great in their own ways.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  - The genderqueer and Filipino representation was seamlessly woven into the story, adding depth and authenticity.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Overall Appeal:**  \n  - The book felt like a perfect blend of Six of Crows, These Violent Delights, Game of Thrones, and vampire lore—something I didn’t know I needed until I read the synopsis.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMistress of Lies is a phenomenal debut that combines unique world-building, compelling characters, and expertly crafted storytelling. It’s a must-read for fans of high fantasy, morally gray characters, and innovative takes on familiar tropes. I highly recommend it!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a 5/5 or equivalent high rating."

Her twin, Anton, lacks the family’s Blood Working power, which adds an interesting dynamic to their relationship.

Shan’s mission to find Samuel, who may hold the key to the King’s desires, drives the narrative forward. The murder mystery adds an additional layer of tension and urgency to the story. The pacing is well-balanced, keeping the reader invested in both the characters’ personal agendas and the overarching plot.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The book offers a fresh take on vampire mythology, blending it seamlessly with themes of power, loyalty, and societal ambition.

From the opening pages, I was captivated by a tapestry of political conspiracies and a gripping investigation into the brutal murders of the Unblooded. With its relentless pace and intricate narrative, 'Mistress of Lies' keeps you engaged from start to finish.",
            "The greatest strength of this book lies in its compelling, multidimensional protagonists: Shan, Samuel, and Isaac. United by the injustices they've faced within a flawed system, they share common ground, yet their goals often diverge. This fluidity creates seamless transitions between cooperation and rivalry, desire and denial, loyalty and betrayal. Shan, in particular, stands out as a remarkable female protagonist. While she may not be conventionally likable and some of her choices are chilling, her humanity shines through as she confronts her mistakes, navigates a society that rejects her, and fights for her beliefs. Fantasy needs more heroines like her. Additionally, the book features a well-executed romance subplot and commendable trans representation.",

The author skillfully weaves in classic horror and vampire tropes to craft a unique narrative. Importantly, the worldbuilding is not just a decorative backdrop; it plays a crucial role in the plot. The unjust nature of a system built on rigid social divisions propels the characters' actions and motivations.",

Anton, Shan's brother, is particularly intriguing, and I’m eager to learn more about his societal role. The Eternal King is captivating and becomes even more menacing with his final actions in the novel. However, the insta-love between Isaac and Samuel feels unconvincing; their connection seems based more on lust than on a deeper bond, and their relationship development occurs off-page, which is unsatisfying. Shan’s forgiveness of Isaac lacks clarity. While Isaac is attractive, powerful, and charming, I struggled to understand what truly draws them together beyond superficial traits.",

            "The plot lacks depth, feeling more like a collection of vibes than a cohesive story. Discoveries and plot progression often feel forced and drawn out, with characters either solving mysteries off-page or suddenly generating ideas without context. Meanwhile, the narrative leans heavily on descriptions that do little to advance the plot. The pacing issues and the overly simplistic mystery were significant drawbacks for me.",

Their moments of kindness and love added depth, making them dynamic and compelling. However, I found Isaac to be less engaging, as his character felt sidelined and underdeveloped.",

However, the plot’s lack of organic progression and pacing issues left me conflicted. Despite these flaws, the characters’ depth and intrigue make this book worth considering for readers who can overlook its narrative shortcomings.",

They also had moments of kindness and love, making them dynamic and compelling.  \n  - I did not particularly care for Isaac, as I felt his character was pushed to the side and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  - The plot is somewhat lacking and feels like an example of \"all vibes, no plot.\" Discoveries and plot progression didn’t feel organic and often felt drawn out.  \n  - Instead of the characters uncovering the mystery alongside the reader, they would either do the work off-page or materialize ideas out of nowhere, while the narrative focused on descriptions that didn’t add to the plot’s momentum.  \n  - The pacing issues and the somewhat easy, skimmed-over mystery were significant drawbacks for me.  \n\n- **Premise and Themes:**  \n  - The premise of the story is very interesting, featuring morally grey characters, political intrigue, and representation of diverse groups.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - I would recommend this book to readers who are okay with mystery stories that jump to conclusions rather than walking through the process with the reader.  \n  - If pacing issues and a lack of organic plot progression are dealbreakers, this book might not be for you. However, if you can overlook these flaws, Mistress of Lies should definitely be on your radar, especially for its captivating characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMistress of Lies is a fantasy mystery with a fascinating premise and morally complex characters that I adored, particularly Shan and Samuel. However, the plot’s lack of organic progression and pacing issues left me conflicted. Despite these flaws, the characters’ depth and intrigue make this book worth considering for readers who can overlook its narrative shortcomings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5★"

The best editing in the world can’t fix bad writing, however, and this certainly wasn’t wonderfully written.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  It was quick and punchy, a nice reprieve for my brain after *The Mirror and the Light*.  \n\n- **Concept and Creativity:**  \n  On a conceptual level, it had a great deal of promise.

I also loved the idea of using magic to transition.  \n\n- **Character Development and Arc:**  \n  I’m largely disappointed in the way Isaac’s arc concluded in this volume, though.  \n\n- **Future Potential:**  \n  I hope that Enright continues improving on his technical skills for future installments or even future series.  \n\n- **Personal Investment and Likelihood to Continue:**  \n  I might pick up the next volume from the library when it releases, but I can’t foresee myself buying a match for my Illumicrate edition until I know if I’ll like it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its flaws in writing and editing, its quick pacing, fresh concepts, and bold representation made it an entertaining read.

            "The romance in the story is both intriguing and well-developed, featuring an early attraction without falling into the trap of insta-lust, which I appreciated. While the romance does overshadow the mystery of the serial killer, I found this balance enjoyable. The final act feels somewhat rushed after a well-paced buildup, but the twists and revelations create an enticing setup for a continuation that leaves me eager for more. The novel flirts with the idea of villainizing revolutionaries who resort to violence, but I trust the author is playing the long game, as suggested by the ending.",
            "The polyamorous trio in this story boasts strong chemistry, with their dynamics shaped by essential conversations, although some elements are set to be explored further in future installments. Shan LeClaire, the unapologetically ruthless protagonist, is a complex character whose ambition and self-serving nature create intriguing flaws. Her lack of empathy for marginalized individuals makes her growth compelling to witness. In contrast, Samuel Hutchinson, the other POV character, serves as a gentle foil to Shan with his idealistic perspective, though his storyline was less engaging for me. The novel features a sizzling polyamorous queer romance, rich Filipino representation, and a trans main character, all of which are refreshing and well-executed.",
            "The oppressive regime of the Eternal King and the Blood Worker class provides a compelling backdrop, though the magic system lacks clarity and could benefit from further detail. The introduction of a Blood Tax and the dehumanization of the Unblooded enrich the narrative, highlighting the world's injustices.",
            "This story explores themes of racism, classism, and systemic oppression, delivering a narrative infused with rage and a powerful call for justice for the marginalized. The political tension between the privileged Blood Worker class and the oppressed Unblooded is compelling, though the magic system could benefit from further development."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Mistress of Lies* delivers a compelling polyamorous queer romance, complex characters, and a richly layered narrative tackling systemic oppression. While the magic system could be more fleshed out and the final act feels rushed, the novel sets up an intriguing continuation that promises to delve deeper into its themes and characters. I’m eagerly awaiting the next installment to see how the system burns down.",

This stands in stark contrast to the scrutiny and microaggressions the characters face for not being white. The author skillfully navigates these themes without coming off as preachy or inauthentic.

The chemistry between the three leads is sizzling, and I’m eagerly waiting to see what happens next. I’m rooting for a happy ending involving all three characters.  \n- **Representation:**  \n  The representation in this book is terrific. It’s a very queer story, featuring a major character who is a trans man and a polyamorous love plot. The setting normalizes these elements, which contrasts sharply with the scrutiny and microaggressions the characters face for not being white. Enright handles these themes deftly, avoiding preachiness or inauthenticity.  \n- **Mystery Plot:**  \n  The mystery at the heart of the plot was poorly executed. While the characters supposedly put in investigative effort, they don’t uncover real clues or make progress until the final third, where the answers are handed to them. This makes the mystery feel lazily written and unsatisfying.  \n- **Character Consistency:**  \n  At times, Shan and especially Samuel acted less intelligently than their skills and background would suggest. This made them feel like they were being pushed around by the plot rather than driving it.  \n- **Climax and Pacing:**  \n  Parts of the climax were exciting, but other parts were a hot mess, with some elements eliciting reactions like “….really?” The pacing and execution of the climax were inconsistent.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I did enjoy *Mistress of Lies*. I cared about the characters and am excited to read the sequel. Ultimately, the romance aspect won me over.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has notable flaws, particularly in the mystery plot and character consistency, its strengths in romance, representation, and character dynamics made it an enjoyable read. I’m invested in the story and eager to see where it goes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- As a romantasy: 4 stars  \n- Overall: 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4)"

            "I have a minor concern regarding the author's emphasis on the m/m aspect of the poly romance. It often feels like the female main character (fmc) is sidelined, as mlm relationships tend to be fetishized and portrayed as more exciting. If that’s the case, why not just write a dedicated mlm romance? Nonetheless, I’m hopeful that the next book will delve deeper into Isaac and Shan’s relationship, which I find far more compelling than either of their connections with Samuel. The friends-to-lovers-to-exes-to-enemies dynamic deserves more exploration!\n\nWhat truly captivated me was Shan's unique perspective as a character aligned with the villain rather than the rebellion.

It happens too often where the female main character (fmc) is sidelined romantically because everyone seems to fetishize mlm relationships more, making them seem more exciting. If that’s the case, just write a mlm romance! However, I’m hopeful that the other book will explore more of Isaac and Shan’s relationship, which I find far more intriguing than his relationship with Samuel or Shan’s with Samuel. Friends to lovers to exes to enemies? That dynamic deserves more attention!\n\n- **Character Perspective:**  \n  What intrigued me most is the unique perspective of Shan, who is on the side of the villain rather than the rebellion. She’s aware of her role but stays pragmatic, which is a refreshing change from the usual fantasy protagonist who fights for the rebellion. The rebellion itself is more of a simmering side plot for a side character, which adds an interesting layer to the story.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world is fascinating, especially the concept of vampires wielding blood with their stylish, fashionable nails. It’s a fresh take that I haven’t seen before, and it adds a lot of flair to the setting.\n\n- **Plot Potential:**  \n  I’m very interested to see where the story goes from here. There are so many possibilities: will we get a full-blown villain throuple? Will they all betray each other? Can they come together at all? Will Shan become the big bad that needs to be defeated, or will her love for the people she cares about shift her perspective? The uncertainty is thrilling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my frustration with the romantic dynamics, the novel has a lot of intriguing elements, from its unique character perspective to its creative world-building and open-ended plot potential.

It succeeded in drawing me in and keeping me engaged.  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  I had no specific expectations for the plot, but I wanted a vampire story that would captivate me. The author, Enright, leans more toward courtly intrigue in the shadows rather than epic battles or grand journeys, and this approach works brilliantly.  \n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The heavy atmosphere of uncertainty, a certain harshness, and a lack of trust is fantastic. The limited resources in world-building actually work as a strength, making everything feel suffocating and ambiguous.  \n- **Characters:**  \n  There are few characters, but they are well-defined and concrete.  \n- **Anticipation for the Sequel:**  \n  I am genuinely looking forward to the second volume.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel met my expectations by delivering a gripping vampire story with a focus on courtly intrigue and a tense, ambiguous atmosphere.
