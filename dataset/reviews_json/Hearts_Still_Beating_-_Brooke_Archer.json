            "The story unfolds through the perspectives of two narrators: Mara and Rory. Mara is a complex character grappling with her identity as an Altered—a medicated and re-humanized Tick—who depends on daily injections to maintain control. In contrast, Rory is a strong, protective figure tasked with caring for his family in a deteriorating world. Their shared history as neighbors, friends, and first loves enriches their relationship, adding depth to the narrative.",
            "The world-building in this story is both realistic and immersive. The introduction of Altered Ticks to the island and the community's varied reactions create a tension that enriches the narrative. The characters' struggle to adapt to this new world order is believable and thoughtfully developed.",
            "I approached this sapphic zombie love story with uncertainty, but I was quickly captivated. The fusion of a zombie apocalypse with a sapphic romance felt both fresh and imaginative. The compelling premise follows Mara, a 17-year-old girl transformed into a \"Tick\" yet maintained her humanity with medication, and Rory, a girl forced to mature too quickly. This unique narrative stands out in its genre.",
            "The story maintained a captivating pace that kept me engaged from start to finish. The blend of action, emotional conflict, and romance struck a perfect balance, making it difficult to set down."

            "The story begins slowly with its world-building, but the pace accelerates during the mission on the Tick-infested island, making it a captivating read. I was taken aback by the gritty violence, especially for a YA title, but I appreciated how the author boldly portrayed the harsh realities that Rory and Mara confront.",

I appreciated that their relationship doesn't simply resume as if nothing happened; instead, they must confront the repercussions of their past actions and navigate their new reality together, scars and all.",
            "As a fan of the SFF genre, particularly tales involving zombies and viruses, I was immediately drawn to *Hearts Still Bleeding*, a sapphic zombie story. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the novel begins slowly, allowing for immersion in its grim environment. However, the tension ramps up quickly, especially during a harrowing mission on a Tick-infested island."

It’s gritty, violent, and emotionally charged, with well-developed characters who must confront their pasts to survive in a brutal new world. The slow start is worth it for the intense escalation and the raw, unflinching portrayal of their struggles.",

            "The book is overall gripping, though there are a few moments where the pacing slows down. However, these instances do not significantly diminish my enjoyment. Set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic world where cities have collapsed and only a small fraction of the population remains, the novel explores the profound changes the apocalypse has wrought on humanity, with various factions struggling to regroup and survive. The story is dark, intense, and emotionally charged, leaving me both stressed and fully engaged. I particularly appreciated the author’s portrayal of character transformation, especially the role reversal between Rory and her mother.",
            "Mara and Rory, the central characters, share a deep bond that transcended friendship before the world ended. Now, Mara, transformed into a Tick, grapples with her humanity, while Rory, who remained human, navigates their new reality. Their dynamic is compelling and filled with tension, but I wished for more scenes featuring them together outside of high-action moments. Additionally, Mara’s relationship with her sister, Carter, feels underdeveloped. Although Carter plays a significant role, her infrequent appearances leave their interactions lacking depth.",
            "The novel's world-building is a standout feature, presenting an intriguing post-zombie reality. I appreciated the exploration of various factions striving to rebuild and survive. The evolving behaviors and roles of characters, particularly Rory and her mother, added significant depth to the narrative."

It was dark, intense, and emotionally charged, with strong world-building and compelling character dynamics.

It explores how the apocalypse has changed people, with factions trying to regroup and survive. The story is dark, intense, and emotional, with moments that left me stressed but fully engaged. I appreciated how the author, Archer, showed the transformation of characters, particularly Rory and her mom, who essentially switched roles.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Mara and Rory, the central characters, were best friends with deeper feelings before the world ended. Mara, who was turned into a Tick, struggles to acclimate to being human again, while Rory, who survived without being turned, is trying to adapt to their new reality. Their dynamic is compelling, filled with tension, but I wished for more scenes of them together outside of high-action moments. Additionally, Mara’s relationship with her sister, Carter, felt underdeveloped. Carter plays a significant role but is rarely seen, and I wanted more depth in their interactions.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is a standout aspect of the novel. The depiction of a post-zombie reality is intriguing, and I enjoyed seeing how different factions are trying to rebuild and survive. The changes in people’s behavior and roles, like Rory and her mom, added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  While the book was gripping overall, there were a couple of instances where the pacing dragged slightly. However, these moments didn’t detract significantly from my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Potential for a Sequel:**  \n  The ending left me wanting more, and I’d love to see a sequel that explores life after the events of this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite not typically being a fan of zombie or dystopian stories, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.

            "The pacing felt uneven, especially during the italicized flashbacks, and I wished for deeper exploration of Mara and Rory’s backstories. However, the gripping climax made up for the slower moments, particularly with the engaging trope of characters fighting to break free from mental control, which I absolutely loved.",
            "Mara and Rory were charming, and I appreciated the swift development of their relationship. The romance scenes were well-crafted and engaging. Carter provided plenty of humor with his over-the-top antics, while the antagonists, like Mal, were delightfully cartoonish in their villainy, adding to the story's entertainment.",
            "While the book exhibited some typical debut novel quirks, I found its boldness and originality refreshing. I would love to see more stories set in this world, featuring different LGBTQ+ characters, with occasional cameos from Mara and Rory. No matter what the author writes next, I will definitely be reading it.",
            "The story's smaller scope generally worked well, though I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of the world and its rules. While some readers may find the resolution a bit too tidy, I didn't mind it; after all, this is a YA novel, and I wasn't expecting an in-depth analysis of epidemiology or intricate conflict resolution.",

            "The pacing of the story was uneven, particularly around the two-thirds mark, where it began to drag. The school attack was poorly executed; it’s hard to believe that only 15 students witnessed it and that none would speak up, especially since some were older and capable of understanding the situation. The scene at Carter Hospital was absurd, as it was unrealistic for someone with only one functioning leg to overpower two individuals, one of whom had enhanced strength and speed. Additionally, the burning of the school and boats going unnoticed by the island's inhabitants was a significant plot hole. Mara's sudden recovery from a near-vegetative state to full functionality without Dyebucetin for an hour was unbelievable and poorly explained. Lastly, the immunity subplot felt unnecessary and was poorly integrated into the overall narrative.",
            "The animosity towards the Altered (cured zombies) came across as forced and unrealistic. For instance, Carter’s fury towards her sister and Rory’s urge to kill his loved one felt unconvincing. There was ample opportunity for a more nuanced exploration of conflicting emotions, yet it was simplified into one-dimensional hatred. Additionally, Mal, the antagonist, lacked depth and complexity; he seemed like a generic villain with no clear motivations, serving only to fulfill the role of the bad guy.",
            "The writing style often felt cringey and overly edgy, reminiscent of typical young adult literature. It didn’t resonate with me, making it difficult to engage with the story seriously.",
            "The world felt underdeveloped and lacking in depth. Locations like Daphne’s could have benefitted from further exploration to create a richer, more immersive setting. The island itself was insufficiently fleshed out, leaving the narrative devoid of a sense of a wider world beyond it.",

Areas like Daphne’s could have been explored more to make the setting feel richer and more immersive.\n   - The island itself wasn’t well-developed, and the story didn’t give a sense of a world existing beyond it.\n\n- **Pacing:**\n   - The pacing was uneven, especially around the two-thirds mark, where the story started to drag and feel slow.\n\n- **Plot Logic and Consistency:**\n   - The attack on the school was poorly handled. It’s unrealistic that only 15 kids witnessed it and that none of them would speak up, especially since some were older and capable of understanding what happened.\n   - The Carter Hospital Scene was absurd. The idea that someone with only one functioning leg could overpower two people, one of whom had enhanced strength and speed, was laughably unrealistic.\n   - The burning of the school and boats going unnoticed by the island’s inhabitants was another glaring plot hole.\n   - Mara’s sudden recovery from barely clinging to humanity to being fully functional without Dyebucetin for an hour was unbelievable and poorly explained.\n   - The immunity subplot felt unnecessary and poorly integrated into the story.\n\n- **Small Inconsistencies and Nitpicks:**\n   - In Chapter 13, Rory claims it’s the first time she’s called Mara by her name, but this isn’t true (possibly an ARC issue).\n   - The building they hide in having no windows felt unrealistic.\n   - Personal note: I don’t like the name Aurora, though this isn’t a critique of the book itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the concept of *Hearts Still Beating* had potential, its execution fell flat due to forced character motivations, poor world-building, inconsistent pacing, and numerous plot holes. The writing style also didn’t resonate with me, and the story felt underdeveloped overall. Despite my love for the zombie genre, this book left me disappointed, though I remain hopeful for better zombie media in the future.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2.5 / 5 ✰"

            "My main critique is that much of the action takes place in the past.

This approach could have fostered a deeper emotional connection to the characters and their struggles.",

Unfortunately, I over-hyped it in my head, leading to disappointment when the book turned out to be just \"eh\" rather than phenomenal.\n\n- **Premise and Themes:**\n   - The story features Mara, a dead girl who was once a Tick (a mindless killing machine), and her childhood best friend/crush, Rory. Mara is sweet, quiet, and loves music, while Rory is strong-willed and unafraid to act decisively. The premise involves a post-apocalyptic world, a mysterious disease, body horror, and a lesbian romance.\n   - I enjoyed the premise but found it too similar to Rory Power's \"Wilder Girls,\" which I also didn't love. Both books share elements like a mysterious disease, body horror, and being trapped on an island in a post-apocalyptic setting.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - I struggled to connect with Rory. Mara had qualities like her love for music and sense of humor that made her relatable, but Rory never gave me anything to latch onto. I kept waiting for Rory to present a reason to like her, but she never did. Despite this, I think Mara and Rory work well together as a couple.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**\n   - My biggest critique is that most of the action happened in the past. I questioned why the author didn't start the story with the characters going through the apocalypse and then continue with \"Hearts Still Beating\" as a sequel. This approach might have made me care more about the characters and feel more emotionally invested in their struggles.\n\n- **Strengths and Highlights:**\n   - I enjoyed the concept of the Ticks, the lesbian romance, and found Noah (the five-year-old little brother) adorable. These elements were highlights for me.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - I didn't hate \"Hearts Still Beating,\" but I feel it could have been greatly improved with some revisions and reworking of the structure. I think many people will love this book, but it just wasn't the right fit for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile \"Hearts Still Beating\" had an intriguing premise and some enjoyable elements, it fell short of my expectations due to its similarity to another book, lack of connection with one of the main characters, and a plot structure that felt passive.

The sapphic representation and their second chance at love (and life) were beautifully portrayed, and I couldn’t get enough of their pining.  \n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n  - The story is best experienced by going in blind and immersing yourself in the hardships these characters face.  \n  - The world has so much potential for expansion.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Unique Take on the Zombie Apocalypse:**  \n  I really like this version of the zombie apocalypse! It differed from others in the way it portrayed both zombies and humans. The idea of a potential cure for the infection added depth, but it was unclear whether the cure was truly effective or if the cured zombies could be trusted. This ambiguity created tension and intrigue.  \n\n- **Exploration of Trust and Fear:**  \n  The story raised compelling questions about trust—not just regarding the cured zombies, but also the people around them. The fear and anger of those unaffected by the infection added another layer of complexity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  I appreciated the development of the main characters and how their relationship evolved. They were forced back together after time apart, and their interactions were shaped by one character's reluctance and the other's guilt. This dynamic felt authentic and added emotional depth to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This is one of the best zombie books I've read! The unique elements and strong character work made it stand out in the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers a fresh and thought-provoking take on the zombie apocalypse, blending suspense, moral dilemmas, and compelling character dynamics. It’s a standout in the genre and a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Rory's preference for the name \"Rory\" over \"Aurora\" poignantly illustrates how the apocalypse has reshaped her identity. Mara, an Altered (a former zombie), offers a compelling perspective that contrasts sharply with her sister Carter, who has lost more of her humanity. Each character navigates grief in their own unique way—Mara through traditional means and Rory on a metaphorical level. Their sapphic love story is both heartfelt and uplifting, providing a comforting counterbalance to the otherwise somber narrative. The clash of their personalities feels organic, and the flashbacks to their younger, more awkward selves add an endearing touch.",
            "Set a few years into the zombie apocalypse, this story presents a compelling twist: a potential cure that allows some undead to regain their free will through medication. The author's world-building is masterful, skillfully depicting a society in decline while also highlighting efforts to rebuild.",
            "This apocalyptic story thoughtfully explores the complexities of humanity, particularly through the lenses of grief and blame. The theme of family is poignantly depicted, showcasing the fractured dynamics within both Rory’s and Mara’s families.

Some undead can regain their free will with medication, which I found intriguing.  \n   - Archer’s world-building is excellent, balancing the deterioration of society with attempts to rebuild it.  \n\n- **Themes:**\n   - The exploration of humanity is central, as expected in an apocalypse story, but Archer also delves into grief and blame in a unique and refreshing way.  \n   - The theme of family is beautifully portrayed, with both Rory’s and Mara’s families being broken in different ways.  \n   - Rory’s adopted siblings add a nice twist to the found family trope, juxtaposing themes of losing and finding family.  \n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Rory’s insistence on being called “Rory” instead of “Aurora” is a subtle yet effective way to show how the apocalypse changed her.  \n   - Mara, an Altered (a former zombie), has a compelling perspective, and her contrast with her sister, Carter, who lost more of her humanity, is fascinating.  \n   - Both characters deal with grief in distinct ways—Mara in a traditional sense and Rory metaphorically.  \n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The sapphic love story between Rory and Mara is heartfelt and adds a feel-good touch to the otherwise somber narrative.  \n   - Their personalities clash in a way that feels authentic, and the flashbacks to their younger, more awkward selves are endearing.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Emotional Impact:**\n   - Archer’s writing effectively conveys the emotional weight of grief, blame, and love.  \n   - The story is both heartbreaking and uplifting, making it a compelling read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Hearts Still Beating* is a standout YA zombie apocalypse novel with a sapphic love story that adds depth and warmth to the narrative.

It introduces a virus called the Tick, which transforms people into zombies, but a new drug can partially reverse its effects, restoring them to a mostly human state. The narrative unfolds through the dual perspectives of Mara and Rory, adding depth and emotional complexity to their relationship. After being infected, Mara is sent to live with Rory's family, creating a palpable tension. The world-building is compelling, combining familiar elements with original ideas that evoke comparisons to *The Last of Us*, while maintaining its unique identity.",
            "Mara and Rory's relationship is at the heart of the story, exploring whether their once-close bond can withstand the trauma and changes they've faced. Rory's personal struggles are particularly compelling; she grapples with feelings of neglect from her parents, the loss of her sister to the Ticks, and the harrowing decision to kill her sister to prevent her transformation. These experiences profoundly shape her character and her interactions with Mara. Meanwhile, Mara's guilt over killing her own parents and her fraught relationship with her older sister, who wishes her harm, add further complexity to her character.",

Her journey of reconciling with the monstrous acts she committed while under the influence of the Tick infection and questioning where she truly deserves to be a part of the world again was compelling.\n   - Aurora (Rory) took some time for me to warm up to. Initially, I found it hard to sympathize with her, but as the story progressed, I understood her anger more and appreciated how she learned not to be dependent on it all the time.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building felt slightly shallow, relying too heavily on flashbacks and passive exposition. This made the post-apocalyptic setting less immersive than it could have been.\n\n- **Antagonist:**\n   - The main villain, Mal, was a watered-down version of the Governor from *The Walking Dead*. While the animosity between Mal and Rory was palpable, his presence as an antagonist lacked dominance and menace, which diminished the tension in the story.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**\n   - The romantic aspects of the novel were well done, particularly in the last quarter of the book.

The “touch her and you die” moments were particularly thrilling and had me emotionally invested.  \n   - Watching their relationship evolve—from hating each other to falling in love again—was genuinely amazing and heartwarming.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n   - The angst between Mara and Aurora was intense and added depth to their relationship. It made their eventual reconciliation and love even more satisfying.  \n   - The novel explored themes of survival, love, loss, and redemption in a way that felt both poignant and authentic.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Engagement:**  \n   - The story was consistently engaging, with a perfect balance of action, romance, and emotional depth.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Tone and Atmosphere:** The novel leans toward the darker side of YA post-apocalyptic stories but manages to feel strangely uplifting at the same time.  \n- **Plot and Action:** The story is packed with a lot of action, keeping the narrative engaging and fast-paced.  \n- **Character Dynamics:** The guilt experienced by the previously murderous zombies, who have regained control of themselves, adds depth to their characters.

            "Mara and Rory are well-developed and compelling characters, with a relationship steeped in angst, history, guilt, and trauma that makes their journey toward reconciliation deeply resonant. Mara grapples with her identity and memories of being a Tick, while Rory navigates the emotional toll of survival and the burden of guilt from her actions during the apocalypse. Their romance is thoughtfully executed, especially in the emotionally charged final chapters. Supporting characters, including Rory's family and Mara's sister, are also well-crafted, each confronting their own trauma from the apocalypse.

He is portrayed as a one-dimensional, cartoonish antagonist who lacks nuance and believability. His actions, such as releasing a Tick into a room of children, are extreme and raise questions about his leadership and the community's blind loyalty to him.\n   - The villain's lack of charisma and consistent over-the-top behavior detract from the otherwise strong narrative and create plot holes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the book is a compelling read with a unique premise, well-developed main characters, and a strong emotional core.

            "I absolutely loved Mara; she was well-written, and I felt a strong urge to protect her. I appreciated how the zombie character, Mara, was portrayed as emotional and calm, adding depth to her persona. However, I found Rory less compelling. Her thoughts and actions often annoyed me, and I didn't connect with her as much as I did with Mara. The romance between Mara and Rory also fell flat for me. While I recognize the challenges of crafting a childhood best friends-to-second chance romance, their chemistry just didn't resonate, which was disappointing given that the love story is central to the book.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh perspective on zombies, or \"Ticks,\" and their origins. In a genre saturated with zombie narratives, this version stood out as both unique and captivating. The world-building significantly enhanced the story, keeping me fully engaged throughout.",
            "This novel presents an amazing premise, blending a compelling sapphic love story with a rehabilitated zombie character. I appreciate the theme of humanity as the true monsters in a zombie-infested world, and it's executed beautifully."

The unique zombie lore and world-building also made the story enjoyable. If you’re looking for a sapphic zombie love story, I would recommend giving this one a try.",

I love a good zombie story, and the idea of a sapphic love story where one character is a rehabilitated zombie is incredibly intriguing. The concept of humanity being the true monsters in a world of zombies is a theme I always appreciate, and it was executed well here.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I absolutely loved Mara. She was written well, and I felt a strong desire to protect her. I appreciated how the zombie character (Mara) was portrayed as the more emotional and calm one, which added depth to her character. However, I didn’t like Rory. Some of her thoughts and actions annoyed me, and I didn’t feel she was as compelling as Mara.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  The romance between Mara and Rory didn’t quite work for me. While I understand the challenge of writing a childhood best friends-to-second chance romance, I didn’t feel they had great chemistry. This was a bit disappointing since the love story is a central part of the book.  \n\n- **World-Building and Zombie Lore:**  \n  I really enjoyed the unique take on zombies (or Ticks) and how they came to be. With so many zombie stories out there, this version felt fresh and interesting. The world-building added a lot to the story and kept me engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had mixed feelings about the romantic chemistry and Rory’s character, the novel’s premise, Mara’s characterization, and the exploration of humanity as the true monsters were standout elements. The unique zombie lore and world-building also made the story enjoyable. If you’re looking for a sapphic zombie love story, I would recommend giving this one a try.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This fast-paced book offers a fresh take on the zombie apocalypse trope. The alternating perspectives of Rory and Mara create a dynamic narrative, while flashback anecdotes enrich the context for their present actions and motivations. Central to the story is the \"enemies to lovers\" trope, with Rory's initial hostility towards Mara due to her infection serving as a key conflict. Although the prolonged tension was a minor drawback for me, the eventual romantic payoff is satisfying. The passionate love between Rory and Mara, coupled with the found family dynamic, stands out as a highlight.",

The inner dialogue, particularly the struggle between humanity and the Tick infection, is exceptionally crafted. The characters navigate morally grey areas, resulting in riveting moments as they confront their feelings about the past and their new reality.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and World-Building:**  \n  The book delivers a sapphic zombie apocalypse story with a unique twist: a scientific breakthrough has led to a medication that alters the undead, potentially bringing them back to life. However, societal tensions arise as many survivors oppose reintegrating these \"Altereds\" into their communities. The backstory of the apocalypse and the scientific angle are well-developed, though the pacing is slow in the beginning as it focuses heavily on setting up this world.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The story follows two main characters: a survivor with disabling injuries and her former love, who is now an \"Altered.\" Their relationship is complex, shifting from love to simmering hatred—or perhaps something more ambiguous. The dynamic between them is angsty and sassy, with a \"touch her and you die because I'm gonna be the one to kill her\" energy that I found compelling. While I appreciated their fierce loyalty to each other and their family, I wished for more buildup in their rekindled romance before the big reveals at the end.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The story starts slow but picks up significantly in the middle when the main characters are sent on a suicide mission. This is where the conspiracies and secrets of their town are uncovered, and the action becomes more intense. The pacing during this section is engaging, though the initial setup might feel drawn out for some readers.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The book does not shy away from gore, violence, or the harsh realities of a post-apocalyptic world. The main characters are brutal and badass, willing to do whatever it takes to survive, even as they grapple with survivor's guilt. The messy, unresolved ending felt fitting for the violent setting, and I appreciated that the \"bad\" characters didn't receive neat, tidy resolutions.  \n\n- **Villain and Antagonists:**  \n  The villain's motives felt somewhat bland and overdone, which was a minor disappointment. However, the messy ending provided some satisfaction, as the punishments for the antagonists were fitting for the brutal world the author created.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes heavy themes and graphic content, such as gore, body horror, violence, loss of loved ones, PTSD, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, harm to children, gun violence, arson, and misogyny.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sapphic zombie apocalypse novel delivers a unique premise, complex characters, and a brutal, action-packed plot. While the slow start and underdeveloped romance were minor drawbacks, the intense pacing, messy ending, and fierce character dynamics made for an engaging read. The book’s unflinching portrayal of violence and its morally gray world are standout features.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I often found myself wishing the entire story had been told through her eyes.

            "The ending of the story is both optimistic and satisfying, leaving me with a sense of contentment. It concludes on a hopeful note. The narrative follows Mara, a teenager grappling with a nationwide illness that transforms people into violent, zombie-like creatures due to a tick in their brains. While a daily cure can tame the tick, it doesn’t eradicate it. The novel delves into themes of societal integration as Mara moves in with her godparents and reconnects with Rory, the girl she loves. Its unique premise shifts the focus from typical zombie attacks to deeper societal and emotional conflicts, underscored by the poignant quote, “It isn’t just monsters who end the world. It’s men,” which emphasizes the human aspect of this dystopian world.",
            "The romance between Mara and Rory is both contentious and emotionally charged. While their feelings for each other are clear, their relationship often resembles that of old friends rather than romantic partners. This lack of clarity leaves me with mixed feelings about their dynamic.",
            "The world is captivating yet lacks depth in some aspects. While there are hints at how society has evolved due to the illness, I yearned for more information about the origins of the tick and its wider societal implications. The community where Mara integrates is vividly portrayed, highlighting the tension between those who support and oppose the integration of Ticks.",
            "The story effectively sparks curiosity and evokes strong emotions, particularly through its themes of resilience—illustrated by the idea that “resilience is a never-ending battle”—and societal conflict. The community's internal struggles and the moral dilemmas concerning the Ticks enrich the narrative, adding significant depth."

        "conclusion": "This novel offers a fresh take on the dystopian genre, blending societal conflict, queer romance, and themes of resilience. While the romance could have been more developed and the world-building more detailed, the story is emotionally engaging and thought-provoking. I recommend it to fans of queer romance and dystopian settings.",

It’s men,” highlighting the human element of the dystopia.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n   - The world is intriguing but lacks depth in certain areas. There’s a small glimpse into how society has changed due to the illness, but I craved more details about the origins of the tick and its broader societal impact.  \n   - The community where Mara integrates is well-depicted, showing the tension between those who support and oppose the integration of Ticks.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - The romance between Mara and Rory is contentious and emotionally charged. While their feelings for each other are evident, their relationship often feels more like old best friends than romantic partners.  \n   - The romance didn’t feel fully established, leaving me with mixed feelings about their dynamic.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The story evokes curiosity and emotions, particularly through the themes of resilience (“Resilience is a never-ending battle”) and societal conflict.  \n   - The contention within the community and the moral dilemmas surrounding the Ticks add depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending is optimistic and satisfying, leaving me feeling content. It wraps up the story on a hopeful note.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a fresh take on the dystopian genre, blending societal conflict, queer romance, and themes of resilience. While the romance could have been more developed and the world-building more detailed, the story is emotionally engaging and thought-provoking. I recommend it to fans of queer romance and dystopian settings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars (4 / 5)"

            "This novel delves into the possibility of love during a zombie apocalypse, specifically between a human and a former zombie. The story unfolds through two perspectives: Mara, a 17-year-old ex-Tick who regains control with medication, and Rory, a girl who matures rapidly while safeguarding her family. The premise centers on Mara moving in with Rory’s godparents for daily injections that restore her humanity. Tension arises as the island community wrestles with the integration of the Altered—medicated, re-humanized Ticks. Additionally, Mara's sister, Carter, who has survived but resents Mara's return, introduces further complexity to the narrative. The pacing keeps the reader engaged, skillfully balancing emotional depth with action and tension.",

Mara's journey of overcoming societal prejudice and personal guilt is especially compelling and adds depth to the narrative.",

Given the interpretive nature of the subject matter, I didn't feel the need to nitpick, and I appreciated the author's creative approach to the lore. The novel incorporates several engaging tropes, including Young Adult, Sapphic, Post-Apocalyptic, Zombies, Teen Angst, Second Chance-ish, Friends to Lovers, and Only One Bed.",

Set in a world where a cure has been discovered, the story refreshingly explores how the Altered and humans navigate their new reality. The focus on reacclimatization and the struggle to maintain humanity in the aftermath of the virus was compelling and felt genuinely original.",

The story takes place after a \"cure\" has been found, which was refreshing and allowed for an exploration of how the Altered and humans navigate their new reality. The focus on reacclimatization and the struggle to retain humanity amidst the consequences of the virus was compelling and felt original to me.  \n\n- **Writing and Grammar:**  \n  There were a couple of minor grammatical issues, but they were few and didn’t detract from my enjoyment of the story. I didn’t feel the need to nitpick, especially since the subject matter is open to interpretation, and I appreciated the author’s creative take on the lore.  \n\n- **Favorite Moment:**  \n  The interaction between Rory and Mara in Chapter 6 was a standout for me. Their Joker/Edward Scissorhands/Freddy Krueger exchange was laugh-out-loud funny and gave a delightful glimpse into their friendship before the world fell apart.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  While there isn’t much spice, there’s a good kiss in Chapter 33 that stood out. The romance is more about emotional connection and tension, fitting well within the YA genre.  \n\n- **Standalone vs. Series:**  \n  This is a standalone novel, which I appreciated as it provided a complete story without the need for sequels.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend this book, but not to those looking for smut, as it’s a YA novel. However, it’s fairly graphic in terms of violence. If you enjoy young adult, sapphic, post-apocalyptic stories with themes of teen angst, second chances, and friends-to-lovers, this is a great pick. I was entranced by the story early on and enjoyed it immensely.  \n\n- **Tropes:**  \n  The novel includes tropes like Young Adult, Sapphic, Post-Apocalyptic, Zombies, Teen Angst, Second Chance-ish, Friends to Lovers, and Only One Bed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a highly enjoyable read with a unique take on the zombie genre, focusing on life after a \"cure\" and the emotional struggles of the Altered and humans alike.

            "This novel is a captivating post-apocalyptic romance where love endures amid a deadly plague. The story opens with fifteen-year-olds Rory and Mara sharing a kiss, only for disaster to strike hours later. Those infected become \"Ticks,\" reminiscent of zombies. Mara is placed in a facility and treated with a drug called Dyebucetin that suppresses her violent urges but fails to restore her humanity. She is then sent to live with her godparents on an island near San Diego, who are, coincidentally, Rory's parents. The gripping premise masterfully intertwines action, romance, and a dystopian setting.",
            "The story unfolds through the perspectives of Mara and Rory, each grappling with their own pain and regrets. Rory is hardened and angry from the loss of loved ones, while Mara is consumed by guilt, particularly over the slaughter of her parents. The tension escalates with the presence of Mara’s older sister, Carter, who refuses to forgive her. The characters are richly developed, and their emotional journeys are compelling. A standout feature is the sapphic romance between Rory and Mara, which sizzles with chemistry and draws readers in as they root for Mara's healing and their reunion. Set against a backdrop of violence and hatred, their love story resonates with haunting poignancy.",

            "This story will resonate with fans of *The Last of Us*, *The Walking Dead*, and *The 100*. It revolves around two teenage girls in love, one of whom is affected by a virus. The engaging introduction grabbed my attention right away, and the conflicts throughout kept me invested. While the world-building was initially confusing, it became clearer as the narrative progressed. However, the repetitive use of the term \"Ticks\" became somewhat tedious. The book conveys a positive message and presents a unique perspective on a post-apocalyptic scenario. The ending was solid but not extraordinary, fitting well within the context of the story.",
            "The story unfolds through the dual perspectives of Mara and Rory. Mara, affected by the virus and turned into an experiment, offers an intriguing glimpse into the mind of a \"monster,\" though her character development feels somewhat limited. In contrast, Rory's journey of survival and her attempt to reconnect with her crush are more compelling, making her storyline the standout for me. The side characters are well-integrated and add depth to the narrative, and I found most of them enjoyable. The LGBTQ romance, featuring a second-chance trope, is engaging but could benefit from deeper development."

Rory stands out as the only human immune to the virus. This novel presents a fresh perspective on the zombie genre, moving away from typical gory survival tales. In this post-apocalyptic world, the infected are referred to as \"ticks.\" Humanity has developed a medication that partially restores these ticks, reviving their personalities while suppressing the infection. \n\nThe story centers on Mara, a returned tick now living with her godparents, Rory's parents. Before her transformation, she was Rory's lover. The island community's leader secretly jams outside communications to maintain control. When an accident causes his daughter to revert to her infected state, chaos ensues, resulting in deaths. He exploits this incident to demonize Mara and the other returned, claiming they are untrustworthy.",

Flashbacks enrich the narrative, adding depth to their experiences. Although the underlying message is impactful and surprising—eliciting a genuine gasp from me—the plot becomes somewhat predictable after a pivotal fire scene. The ending is satisfying and slightly cheesy, yet it doesn’t fully make up for the earlier predictability.

His zealous actions elevate the stakes and propel the central conflict, compelling Mara and Rory to unite in defense of their home and loved ones. The novel takes an intriguing approach to the zombie genre, focusing on two teenage girls navigating a zombie apocalypse. One of them, Mara, is a zombie (referred to as a Tick) undergoing treatment to regain her humanity. The story delves into the experiment of integrating recovering zombies with normal humans on a small island, presenting a unique and engaging premise.",

Rory, her former best friend and love interest, is a resilient character who has matured rapidly in the face of the apocalypse. Their shifting relationship, moving from estrangement to reluctant collaboration, enriches the narrative. The tension between them—stemming from Rory’s protective instincts and Mara’s quest to regain her humanity—serves as a central emotional thread.",

            "The story's heavy reliance on past events creates an imbalance in the narrative. It would have benefited from being divided into two parts: one dedicated to the past and the other serving as a sequel.",
            "Mara, the main character, is exceptionally well-crafted. I appreciated her depth and relatability, especially given that she is a zombie, making her the most emotionally compelling character in the story. In contrast, I found it difficult to connect with Rory; I kept hoping for her character to develop further, but she ultimately fell short of my expectations. This was disappointing, particularly since Mara resonated so strongly with me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed watching the dynamic between Mara and Rory unfold, as their relationship added a significant emotional layer to the narrative.",

The love story between Rory and Mara was adorable, and the blend of sweetness, gore, and feral energy made it a standout in the zombie romance genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars."

While the concept isn’t entirely original, it still manages to stand out.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  I loved the beginning of the book, but I started to lose interest a bit by the end. The pacing seemed to falter as the story progressed.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n  The variety of relationships and dynamics, particularly within the Blake family, were interesting and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The isolated island community, headed by a megalomaniac, felt timely and chilling. The setting contributed significantly to the book’s tension and mood.  \n\n- **Plot Twist and Logic:**  \n  The twist ending involving the Altered blood working as an inoculation felt underwhelming. It seemed like a basic medical solution that would have been the first thing doctors tried, which made it less believable.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to Penguin Teen for the 2023 Yall Fest ARC giveaway!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had a strong start with compelling relationships and a chilling setting, but the pacing and the logic of the twist ending left me somewhat disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, some of the cheesiness in the first half didn't feel as intense because it almost felt like you were reading from a teenager's perspective. That's how it is when you're young and in love.

The characters' reactions seemed off to me, and I couldn't connect with their emotional responses.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world in the book felt vague and underdeveloped. It lacked the depth and detail I usually look for in a story, which made it harder for me to immerse myself in the setting.  \n\n- **Theme Execution (Hate):**  \n  The portrayal of hate in the book felt forced and unnatural. It didn’t resonate with me, and I found it difficult to believe or engage with.  \n\n- **Genre Suitability:**  \n  I think I might have outgrown zombie books. The story didn’t hold my interest as much as I hoped, and it didn’t bring anything new or compelling to the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book fell short for me in terms of character development, world-building, and theme execution. While the premise had potential, the execution didn’t resonate with me, and I found myself disengaged.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story centers on a unique zombie virus discovered in the Arctic as a consequence of climate change. Frozen in a glacier, this virus escapes and infects humans, leading to violent behavior. Scientists work to control the virus and restore some humanity to the infected. The narrative follows two girls: Mara, who is infected, and Rory, who is not. Mara grapples with her actions while in her altered state, including harming her parents, which deeply worries Rory. As the girls begin to explore their feelings for each other, chaos unfolds in the world around them. Mara participates in a program aimed at rehabilitating the infected, referred to as the Altered, who are sent to communities with friends or family. While some communities view the Altered as protective assets or a means for resource gathering, others ostracize and blame them. The combination of zombie action and a budding love story makes for a compelling read.",
            "At the heart of the story is the relationship between Mara and Rory, which beautifully intertwines a young love narrative with the harsh realities of a zombie apocalypse. Mara’s journey to regain control over her thoughts and actions deepens her character, while Rory’s protective and empathetic nature shines through in her concern for Mara and those around them.",
