            "The story follows Orla Clarke, a master builder with the ability to see ghosts, and Finlay Thompson, the director of a distillery project. Both characters grapple with troubled pasts and are hesitant to forge new connections. As strange occurrences unfold in the town of Loren Brae, Orla becomes the focal point of these events, capturing Finlay's intrigue and drawing them closer together. While the narrative can be enjoyed as a stand-alone, it is best appreciated in sequence for a richer experience.",
            "Orla Clarke is a strong, independent woman shaped by her upbringing in an orphanage, which has taught her to rely on herself. She possesses the unique ability to see ghosts, a gift that complicates her life. Finlay Thompson, a dedicated professional passionate about his distillery project, has been betrayed by family and past relationships, making him cautious about new connections. The supporting characters, particularly the members of The Order of Caledonia, bring depth and humor to the narrative. As Orla and Finlay navigate the strange occurrences in Loren Brae, their romance develops naturally, grounded in mutual support and understanding. The story is enriched by humorous and unexpected events that add charm to the romantic elements.",

When Orla sustains a minor head injury, he leaves her out of anger over a secret she kept, which felt out of character and frustrating. This reaction was jarring and clashed with the otherwise sweet romance. On a positive note, the hilarious side characters truly stood out and enriched the story.",

When Finlay enters her life, she never anticipates that he would help her dismantle those barriers. As she begins to embrace her unique gift and the Order, she realizes that self-acceptance is crucial before others can accept her. However, the fear of potential rejection makes it difficult for Orla to fully trust Finlay."

            "In *Wild Scottish Fortune*, Orla and Finlay are complete opposites yet irresistibly drawn together by their unique O’Malley-Scottish charm. Their pasts pose challenges that threaten to drive them apart but ultimately highlight the significance of love and family in a breathtaking manner. Orla is a relatable and inspiring survivor, and the journey of her and Finlay's growth together is truly unforgettable. I also appreciated the continuation of Willie and Ramsay's story from book five, as Orla assists in Ramsay's shop, enriching the narrative. The characters are beautifully crafted and feel like old friends, making their appearances in the series a joy. A standout moment occurs when the women of The Order of Caledonia come together, showcasing their unique powers and voices.",

            "I struggled to choose my favorite quotes from this story, as they all resonate deeply. Lines like, “My plans are much the same as they are most nights. To crochet and listen to murder podcasts,” capture a relatable sense of routine. The dialogue, “I guess I could. But why put myself through it if I'll just get hurt?

            "In this story, Fin, the director of a distillery project, becomes instantly attracted to Orla, who has just embarked on her journey. However, he gives her the space she needs to trust him with her secrets. One of my favorite aspects of the book is the characters' self-awareness and empathy. Both Fin and Orla grapple with past issues, including neglectful parents and poverty, yet they acknowledge their own flaws and understand each other's reactions in various situations. They readily admit their mistakes and apologize swiftly, showcasing a refreshing level of maturity. Even their friends play a supportive role in helping them navigate their challenges. Overall, the characters' mental health and maturity stand in stark contrast to those typically found in the genre.",
            "I devoured this book in just two days! It was difficult to put down. It stands on its own effectively, providing enough context that I never felt lost, while revealing just the right amount about the previous books to avoid any spoilers.",
            "I appreciate that this story offers a unique take on fantasy and witchcraft. Rather than relying solely on elemental powers or traditional spells, it presents a more nuanced approach. Orla, the protagonist, is a contractor with the added ability to see and communicate with ghosts, making her a compelling house witch. Other witches in the story specialize in various domains, such as food and plants, adding depth to the supernatural elements. This fresh perspective was a welcome change from my recent reads.  "

The characters are well-developed, self-aware, and emotionally mature, making their relationships and interactions deeply satisfying. Despite being part of a larger work, it stands well on its own, offering enough context without spoiling previous entries.",

It was hard to put down!  \n  - The book held up well on its own, even though it’s the 6th in a series. Enough was explained that I didn’t feel lost, but not too much of the prior books was revealed to spoil them for me.  \n\n- **Originality and Concept:**  \n  - I love that the concept is different from most fantasy/witchy books. The witches' powers are more nuanced than just elements or spells alone.  \n  - Orla, the main female character, is a contractor who happens to also be a \"house witch\" who can see and communicate with ghosts. Other witches specialize in food, plants, etc. I found it a refreshing change from what I have been reading lately.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - Fin, the main male character, is the director of the distillery project that Orla has recently started. He's instantly attracted to Orla but gives her the space and support she needs to come to trust him with her secrets.  \n  - My favorite part of the book is how self-aware and empathetic the characters are. Both main characters have past issues like neglectful parents, poverty, etc. They recognize both their own issues and each other's and understand why they react the way they do in certain situations.  \n  - They even admit their faults and apologize when they are wrong in a fairly swift manner. Even their friends help them talk through their issues.  \n\n- **Mental Health and Maturity in Characters:**  \n  - It's astounding how mentally healthy and mature these characters are compared to other books in the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a captivating and refreshing read with a unique take on witches and their powers. The characters are well-developed, self-aware, and emotionally mature, making their relationships and interactions deeply satisfying.

I particularly enjoyed having a female main character in a traditionally male-dominated profession, and I'm excited to see that the next FMC will follow suit. The series does an excellent job of focusing on each female character, showcasing their distinct backgrounds and personalities, which keeps the narrative fresh and engaging.

The Enchanted Highlands Series is like a warm hug from your best friends.

Orla, an orphan who’s used to everyone leaving, has extremely high walls keeping everyone out. While on the job for Common Gin’s newest build, she meets Finlay, who she immediately writes off as being too posh to get her. Time and circumstance show Orla that you can’t judge people based on your own fears, and that family is what you make it, not what you’re born into.\n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  Of course, being able to see ghosts and finding out you’re a Knight of the Order of Caledonia complicates things as well. Will Orla learn to trust others and in herself, or will she continue keeping everyone at bay, ensuring she never gets hurt?\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I absolutely loved the way Tricia slightly changed how she wrote this book. Introducing the Order earlier in the book and having the female main character (FMC) deal with that plus the budding relationship for longer packed a bit more of an emotional punch.

For example, the second challenge passing is mentioned several days after it happens, which felt underwhelming.  \n\n- **Series Consistency:**  \n  - I expected this book to follow the same pattern as the other books in the series, but it didn’t quite meet those expectations.  \n  - The story felt like a stepping stone to something else, possibly setting up future tension with the Order and the Kelpies.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - The book was cute and enjoyable, but it lacked depth and felt like it ended just as I was starting to get invested.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was enjoyable and had its charming moments, it felt rushed and underdeveloped in terms of character relationships, world-building, and plot focus. It seemed more like a setup for future events rather than a fully fleshed-out story on its own.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, there did feel like there was a bit of a speed difference between the two narrators.  \n\n- **Personal Preference for Narrator:**  \n  I would listen to Will Watt read my grocery list. Actually, Will, could you? It would make grocery shopping more exciting!\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Big thanks to Tricia O'Malley, Dreamscape Select, and NetGalley for an early release copy of this book. This is my honest review.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this audiobook was an enjoyable and engaging experience, perfect for casual listening during daily activities. The magical elements and strong narration made it a standout, though the slight pacing difference between narrators was noticeable. I look forward to continuing the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The tests in this book kept me on the edge of my seat.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - Orla, who runs her own construction company, is tasked with building a new distillery. Her \"meet cute\" with Finley, the project director, didn’t start off well, as he didn’t make a great first impression.  \n  - Orla and Finley come from different worlds and are complete opposites, but their back-and-forth banter was delightful.  \n  - Despite their awkward start, Finley’s patience and persistence eventually win Orla over, and they make a wonderful pair.  \n\n- **Romance and Themes:**  \n  - The romance was charming, filled with magic, found family, and legends.  \n  - The suspense element added a chilling but well-executed layer to the story.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  - I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Amy Landon and Will Watt in dual narration.  \n  - They did a fantastic job, giving the characters distinct voices and personalities.  \n  - Their Scottish accents were well done and understandable, though I had to lower the listening speed slightly at the start. This didn’t impact my enjoyment, and it was a pleasure to listen to their narration.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Wild Scottish Fortune* is a charming addition to *The Enchanted Highlands* series, blending magic, romance, and suspense seamlessly.
