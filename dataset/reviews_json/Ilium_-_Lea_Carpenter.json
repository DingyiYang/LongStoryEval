Raja, a professional, could have easily acquired the required information himself, making the decision to send an inexperienced 21-year-old seem illogical.  \n   - The MC did not provide any critical intel during her spy mission, which further undermined the justification for her involvement.  \n\n- **Believability (Espionage Unit's Feasibility):**  \n   - The idea that the espionage unit could surveil vast regions (England, Europe, the Western Hemisphere) to locate a specific individual with very particular traits (a woman with a streak of white hair, an orphan, likely to fall in love with a much older man, and unlikely to ask questions) stretched believability. The timing of finding such a person also felt contrived.  \n\n- **Writing Style (Dialogue Formatting):**  \n   - The lack of question marks in dialogue was distracting and diminished the reading experience. For example: \"Do you like question marks.\" \"I don't think so. Do you.\"  \n\n- **Character Appeal (Felix):**  \n   - Despite the issues with the plot and character relationships, I found myself drawn to the character Felix, who added a layer of enjoyment to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had moments that drew me in, particularly due to the character Felix, the underdeveloped relationships, illogical plot points, and lack of believability in the espionage elements detracted from my overall enjoyment. The writing style, especially the dialogue formatting, also hindered my immersion in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The narrative effectively alternates between her past experiences and present insights, though this approach becomes intrusive and less effective near the climax. The \"what I know now\" perspective feels forced in the latter part of the novel, diminishing its overall impact. Additionally, key details remain unresolved, such as the fate of the man targeted in the operation and whether the mission was intended to end in his assassination. The narrator's lack of curiosity about her husband's illness also feels unconvincing, even when considering her naivety and their age difference.",

The narrative features insightful tangents that, while momentarily diffusing suspense, enrich the tale by illuminating the intricate orchestration at play and providing essential backstories for characters who might otherwise seem one-dimensional. Without these layers, the plot would have been a straightforward account of a recently widowed young woman entangled in an international espionage operation.",

            "The novel elegantly depicts espionage as a complex interplay of patience, seduction, and passion. It builds a subtle suspense, eschewing the traditional thrills and action, instead highlighting the interconnectedness of characters within the espionage community, where reputations precede them. Amoral in nature, the narrative avoids moral judgment, framing missteps as factual errors rather than ethical failings.",

However, it may resonate with individuals who have had long careers in espionage, even if they would never openly acknowledge it."

It was inconsistent, as question marks were used at other times, which made the writing feel uneven and distracting.  \n\n- **Plot Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  The long mission to kidnap or kill Edouard dragged on, and I nearly gave up again. However, I kept reading to see how it would unfold. Unfortunately, the story ends abruptly with no resolution about what happened to Edouard, leaving me disappointed and unsatisfied.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its spy-related premise, the lack of character depth, inconsistent writing style, and unresolved plotlines left me feeling let down. The story’s pacing and incomplete resolution were particularly frustrating.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded down)"

The protagonist, a lonely young woman, marries the charming, wealthy Marcus just weeks after their first meeting. Soon after, she is tasked with a vague favor: spying on a mysterious Russian named Edouard in the South of France. The story's connection to past events in Beirut feels unconvincing, and the protagonist's lack of curiosity throughout these bizarre occurrences strains credibility.

How did Raja's people locate her so conveniently, and why was she so easily manipulated?",

            "The ending was both emotional and satisfying, but several aspects of the story were perplexing. The addition of another character to Project Ilium felt unnecessary, as Raja already served as Nikki’s friend and intel gatherer. Dasha and Edouard should have been more suspicious of the young woman posing as an art dealer, especially given her evident lack of knowledge about art. The premise of a rootless young woman effortlessly entering a luxurious spy operation was far-fetched and frequently disrupted my immersion in the story. It was hard to believe that skilled spies would allow her into their secure compound, and her presence ultimately contributed nothing to the mission; Jack and Jill could have captured Edouard without her involvement.",
            "The writing is repetitive and circular at times, which can be frustrating. However, the book's short length makes this style more tolerable.\n",
            "The title \"Ilium\" initially suggests a connection to the Iliad, frequently referenced by the characters.

            "The novel centers on a 21-year-old unnamed narrator who encounters Marcus, a man thirty years her senior, at a party. Their relationship immerses her in his world, where she becomes the ideal candidate for a covert operation. The story hinges on her decision to participate.",
            "The characters are a standout aspect of the novel. Although the pace may not match that of typical spy thrillers, the depth and complexity of the characters more than make up for it. The narrator’s insights into Annabel, a key figure, illuminate her exceptional ability to maneuver through influential circles: “Annabel’s gift was that she knew people who knew people. She was at ease in the ‘real’ world of office visits to McKinsey or Goldman Sachs, where people still wore suits and maintained casual pretensions of ‘legitimate’ power.”",
            "This book offers a profound exploration of war, examining its persistent nature and the cyclical patterns of action and reaction. It portrays war as a tragedy, highlighting the themes of loss and the complex interplay between good intentions and malice. The narrator's reflections are particularly striking: “War endures by design. The history of war is a history of romance and mission, of malice slapping the wrist of good intent. The history of war is a history of action, reaction, repeats. War is tragedy, and tragedy, Aristotle knew, is a game of subtraction, a game of loss.” The novel evokes *Absolution* by Alice McDermott, as both works prioritize introspection and deeper themes over mere plot-driven action."

Frequent flashbacks to more thrilling moments add depth, but as the plot intensifies toward the end, it struggles to maintain credibility as a political thriller.",

It avoids gratuitous sex or language, which I found refreshing.\n\n- **Themes and Message:**  \n  The book provides a message (of sorts), which I found meaningful and thought-provoking. This added value to the overall reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Ilium* was a refreshing and enjoyable read, offering a unique narrative style, strong writing, and a meaningful message. While it may not fit the thriller genre, it stands out as a well-crafted and thought-provoking novel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
