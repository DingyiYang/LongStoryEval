            "The story centers on a Flemish housekeeper and a German soldier whose shared passion for art forges a compelling and unconventional bond. The protagonist grapples with a moral quandary when she is asked to engage in espionage in exchange for a letter from a loved one she believed to be deceased, infusing the narrative with tension and emotional depth. The novel delves into profound themes of character, identity, obligation, freedom, and worth, all of which resonated deeply with me.",
            "This book features beautifully crafted sentences that resonate deeply with readers. Its thought-provoking insights make it one of the most highlighted works of fiction I've encountered.",
            "Set in Brugge, Belgium—a city I recently visited—the novel feels particularly personal and immersive. The confined setting, with its focus on specific locations like the protagonist’s home, her secret refuge, and her employer’s residence, amplifies the sense of entrapment and deepens the emotional weight of the narrative. The portrayal of daily life under aerial bombardment is striking, effectively capturing the weariness of war and its profound impact on individuals."

            "In this story, the young protagonist Evelien, around 19, struggles with a lack of life experience, leading her to misinterpret the motivations of those around her and make painful decisions. Coletta, Evelien's mother-in-law, is a strong-willed woman whose convictions often inflict unintentional harm on others. While these two characters are compelling, the narrative's emphasis on their internal reflections and dialogues sometimes hinders overall plot development.",
            "The writing is poetic and descriptive, yet it can feel cumbersome, often necessitating rereading to fully understand the events. This narrative style occasionally distracts from the story, making it challenging to retain minor details or plot points that reemerge later. While the characters' reflective nature is realistic for a wartime setting, it slows the pacing and diminishes the plot's overall engagement.",

The reflective nature of the story, though realistic, detracted from its overall appeal. While it may resonate with readers who enjoy deeper philosophical explorations, it ultimately fell short of expectations.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Time Period:**  \n  The book is set over nine days in 1918 in Bruges, Belgium, during the final days of World War I. The historical backdrop is vividly portrayed, and I found myself learning about the impact of the war on Belgium, which I hadn’t considered before.  \n\n- **Character Development (Evelien):**  \n  Evelien, the main character, is complex and compelling. She is married, but her husband is away at war, and she feels a sense of obligation to her in-laws. Her internal struggles—such as not truly loving her husband (who was her best friend), her desire to be an artist, and her longing to live in France—are beautifully explored. Her emotions of obligation, guilt, apprehension, and affection are portrayed with depth and nuance.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The story is packed with action and tension. Evelien is coerced into stealing a list of names from her German employer for the resistance, with the promise of receiving a letter from her husband. Additionally, she forms a strong connection with a German soldier stationed on her street, who carries his own burdens. These conflicts drive the narrative forward and keep the reader engaged.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The book delves into themes of duty, love, guilt, and personal aspirations. Art is a recurring motif, and I found myself deeply connecting to the discussions about art throughout the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s writing is evocative and beautifully captures the emotional and historical complexities of the time. The pacing is well-balanced, with a mix of introspection and action.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis historical fiction novel is a riveting exploration of one woman’s struggles and aspirations during a tumultuous period in history. Evelien’s journey, combined with the vivid portrayal of World War I’s impact on Belgium, makes this book a compelling read. Fans of historical fiction will find both the story and its protagonist deeply engaging.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I have come to appreciate her style and the way she weaves her stories.\n\n- **Cultural Exploration:**  \n  I greatly enjoyed how both books carry the flavor of countries very different from my own.

It allowed me to fully absorb the cultural nuances and unique flavors of the story. I recommend reading these books without rigid expectations to truly appreciate their depth.\n\n- **Author's Notes:**  \n  I have come to care a great deal about reading the author's notes at the end of a book. In this case, Gian Sardar’s notes greatly enhanced my enjoyment of both books, providing additional context and insight into her inspirations and personal connections to the stories.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed both *Take What You Can Carry* and *What the Wind Gave Quiet*.

            "Set in Brugge in 1918, near the end of World War I, the story follows Evelien, an art lover who has transformed a bombed house into her garden and studio. She works in a residence seized by German occupiers, earning the trust of Vizeadmiral Braun. When approached by the resistance, she is offered a letter from her missing husband in exchange for a list from Braun’s house. Meanwhile, her growing friendship with a German soldier leads her to face a heart-wrenching choice as the war draws to a close. The novel presents a compelling narrative with rich depth and well-developed characters.",
            "The author, who possesses a mixed Iraqi-Kurdish and American heritage, previously wrote *Alles wat je dragen kan*, drawing from her father's life story. Her latest work, *Als alles stil wordt*, is inspired by her Belgian grandmother's experiences during wartime. Set in Brugge, my hometown, the story captivated my interest.",
            "This historical fiction novel weaves true events from the author’s grandmother's life with fictional elements. However, the portrayal of Brugge feels insufficiently researched. For instance, while the bombed house Evelien uses as a garden may be inspired by a charming, lesser-known location, other events—such as a plane crashing into a church tower—did not occur, and no church towers in Brugge were destroyed during WWI. The author overlooked the rich historical archives of Brugge, which could have enhanced the story’s authenticity. A brief epilogue or afterword explaining the fictionalized elements would have bolstered the narrative's credibility. As it stands, the story could have been set in any Flemish city, lacking distinctive details like cobblestones, narrow streets, and Marian statues that truly evoke Brugge during the war. Nonetheless, the author effectively captures the emotional turmoil of living in a war-torn city.",
            "The novel delves into timeless themes of war, survival, and human nature. Through its compelling characters, it illustrates how conflict can transform friends into foes and gentle souls into ruthless individuals. The narrative poignantly highlights the moral dilemmas and betrayals that arise in the struggle for survival.",
            "This historical novel, set in Brugge, disappointed me with its lack of historical accuracy and local detail. Although the story has merit, my expectations were higher. The novel excels in emotional depth and character development, but it ultimately falls short in setting and authenticity."

        "conclusion": "*Als alles stil wordt* is a well-crafted story with strong characters and emotional depth, exploring the impact of war on human lives. However, its lack of historical accuracy and insufficient attention to Brugge’s unique setting detracted from its potential. While it succeeds as a timeless tale of survival and moral conflict, it falls short as a historical novel set in Brugge.",

The pacing improved significantly in the last 100 pages, which were engaging and even included some twists.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style was a mixed experience. Some details were poetic and well-crafted, while others felt unnecessary and weighed down the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character's thoughts were disorganized and hard to follow in the beginning, which made it challenging to connect with the story early on.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the slow start, the last third of the book was highly enjoyable and compelling, to the point where I almost considered giving it a higher rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a slow and challenging start, it ultimately redeemed itself with a strong and engaging final act.

            "In this compelling story, Evelien marries her best friend, Emiel, in an arranged union to safeguard both their families. Their relationship is devoid of romance, and she hasn’t heard from him in years. Evelien works as a housekeeper for a German commander, surviving on ration cards and a hidden garden in a bombed-out house. When a resistance member offers her a deal—steal a list of names from the commander's office in exchange for a letter from Emiel—she faces a moral dilemma. Complicating matters further is her growing attraction to Joseph, a German soldier. As Evelien grapples with her feelings, she remains torn between her uncertain future with Emiel and her evolving desires for marriage and children. Their relationship is underscored by shared secrets, including Joseph’s desertion plans and Evelien's passion for art, yet strained by deception and the impending end of the war.",

            "I appreciate that the book is set during World War I, a period that's often overlooked in favor of World War II. Taking place in Bruges, Belgium—close to the war front and under siege—the story benefits from the author’s personal connection to the region through her mother's ancestry, which lends authenticity to the setting.",
            "This story thoughtfully explores the many facets of love, highlighting that true love involves wanting the best for the other person. It delves into the complexities of relationships, revealing how even the closest individuals may not truly understand one another. Additionally, the narrative examines the tension between duty, selfishness, and selflessness, especially in the context of war."

However, I noted some minor historical inaccuracies, particularly the use of a poppet made from moonbathed amethyst, a concept more aligned with post-WW2 occult practices than early 20th-century beliefs.

            "The romance between Evelien and Joseph feels underdeveloped and surprisingly sudden, possibly driven by wartime desperation. Set in the final months of WWI, the story follows 19-year-old Evelien, who lives in German-occupied Brussels. Employed as a housekeeper for a German officer, she is tasked with safeguarding valuable art and family heirlooms. Evelien dreams of pursuing her art in Paris after the war and finds a kindred spirit in Joseph, a recovering German soldier. Her life becomes more complicated when an Irish man delivers a letter from her husband but demands a list of names hidden in her employer’s office as payment. The pacing of the plot is slow, burdened by excessive inner dialogue that highlights Evelien's anxieties about the Germans, her boss, her coworker, her husband’s uncertain return, Joseph, and her mother-in-law.",

The Belgian accent sounded more Middle Eastern to me, which took me out of the story.

            "The story delves deeply into relationships, yet some plot points were confusing and demanded patience for resolution.

I appreciated the author's development of the mother-in-law as a visionary figure. However, certain character actions, such as Coletta urging Evelien to marry Emiel and their acquiescence, came across as less believable.

            "In the story, Evelien's decision to chat with a Nazi soldier outside her home and divulge information about hidden treasures—priceless paintings and a 7-carat diamond ring—strikes me as illogical. Given his admission of committing terrible acts, her willingness to engage with him and share such sensitive information feels conflicting and hard to understand.",

Given that he is a Nazi and has admitted to doing terrible things, her actions seem illogical.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Depth:**  \n  As a historical fiction lover, I found this book lacking. It failed to provide any meaningful insight into World War I other than the fact that the Germans were everywhere and life was hard.  \n\n- **Themes and Appeal to Specific Audiences:**  \n  Art lovers will enjoy this book due to its strong focus on art and artist themes.

Examples include:  \n     - The shopkeeper is not actually harmed.  \n     - The husband had already committed similar acts and was dead (though the character didn’t know this).  \n     - The mother-in-law blames herself for pushing the marriage and approves of the daughter-in-law’s infidelity.  \n   - This creates a contradictory message: no one can judge others because there is no right or wrong, yet the characters' wrongdoings have no real consequences.  \n\n- **Double Standards in Judgment:**  \n   - The author has a clear sense of right and wrong when it comes to judging the Germans on the list, believing they deserve to be held accountable for their actions.  \n   - This creates a twisted moral framework where the main characters' selfish actions are excused, while others are harshly judged.  \n\n- **Character Portrayal and Themes:**  \n   - Selfish characters are praised, and the author tries to evoke sympathy for them by placing them in terrible circumstances.  \n   - The narrative suggests that following one’s desires and living for oneself doesn’t harm others, which feels unrealistic.  \n   - The reviewer believes true joy and satisfaction come from living for something or someone greater than oneself.  \n\n- **Comparison to Classic Literature:**  \n   - The reviewer contrasts the novel with classics like *Jane Eyre*, which feature heroines who make difficult but virtuous decisions in hard circumstances.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the writing and storyline are not terrible, the novel suffers from moral inconsistency and a contradictory message about right and wrong. The author’s attempt to justify selfish actions without consequences feels unrealistic and undermines the story’s depth. The reviewer prefers classic literature that portrays true heroism and virtuous decision-making.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story offers a fresh perspective on World War I, particularly in Belgium, which I had not previously encountered. It allowed me to envision the experiences of my grandfather, who fought in the war, and to imagine life in the towns and cities of Western Europe during that era.",
            "This book explores the complexities of war, presenting situations that defy clear moral distinctions. It poses challenging questions about morality, such as whether snipers are heroes or killers, and examines the potential for forgiveness in wartime actions. These themes remain relevant in today's conflicts. The novel evoked a profound emotional response, allowing me to truly feel the weight of its narrative.",
            "This novel profoundly enhanced my understanding of my grandfather's wartime experiences, which he seldom discussed. Learning that nearly all his unit perished in the trenches and that he had a metal plate in his skull to repair a fracture added a deep poignancy to the story."

It took me nearly a week to read, whereas a book of this size would normally take me 2 or 3 days.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters were well-written, and even some of the \"bad guys\" were quite likable. This is not an easy feat to achieve.\n\n- **Moral and Ethical Themes:**\n   - I disliked the core part of the story involving adultery. While I understand it was a reflection of the times, Colletta's reaction bothered me. It seemed as though she condoned the cheating just because there was a grandchild involved. I don’t believe a woman of that era would have accepted this so quickly, especially with her daughter-in-law present. The indiscretion, though written discreetly, was still wrong. Two wrongs don’t make a right.\n\n- **Historical Authenticity and Tone:**\n   - The author seemed to sugarcoat the atrocities of the time, making them appear less frightening than they likely were. The events felt \"packed in cotton,\" lacking the raw intensity they deserved.\n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**\n   - Despite the negatives, I really liked the storyline. It was engaging and well-crafted, and I would recommend it to fans of WWI fiction.\n\n- **Historical Context Confusion:**\n   - Occasionally, I found myself confusing the setting with WWII and Nazi Germany instead of Imperial Germany. While the two eras are distinct, they felt surprisingly similar at times.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I enjoyed *When the World Goes Quiet* for its well-developed characters and compelling storyline, though the slow pacing, moral dilemmas, and somewhat sanitized portrayal of historical events detracted from my full enjoyment.

The story takes place in Bruges, Belgium, during the final days of the war, which provides a unique and refreshing backdrop.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  - The plot revolves around Evelien, a maid in a mansion whose employer has fled, leaving the property to his German cousin. Evelien, living with her in-laws, believes her husband, Emiel, is dead after only one day of marriage. She becomes entangled in a scheme to steal from her employer in exchange for a letter from Emiel.  \n  - The story gains momentum in the last third, where it becomes stronger and more engaging.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Evelien is the central character, and her situation is compelling, but most of the other characters felt underdeveloped and uninteresting. At one point, I considered putting the book down because of this.  \n  - The wounded German sentry who befriends Evelien adds complexity to the story. Their shared love of art and the potential for a deeper connection create an intriguing dynamic.  \n\n- **Genre and Recommendation:**  \n  - The book is best described as a historical romance, blending elements of history, intrigue, and personal relationships. Despite its slow start, I would recommend it to others who enjoy this genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the characters were largely unengaging and the story took time to build momentum, the unique setting, intriguing plot, and stronger final third of the book made it worth finishing.

It highlights the experiences of people living in an occupied city and how they cope with the devastating effects of wartime.  \n\n- **Emotional and Psychological Depth:**  \n  The story delves into the complexities of human emotions and coping mechanisms during wartime.

Names would appear, disappear for chapters, and then resurface, making it difficult to keep track of their roles and relationships.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis historical fiction provides a fresh and thought-provoking perspective on WWI, focusing on the lives of civilians in an occupied city. It effectively captures the emotional and psychological toll of war, though the complexity of the characters and their frequent disappearances from the narrative made it somewhat difficult to follow.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
