They say \"never meet your heroes,\" but I have a very hard time believing he would disappoint me!  \n\n- **Book Comparison and Series Appreciation:**  \n  \"We Solve Murders\" is maybe my favorite book I have read all year. One other in the running is \"The Last Devil to Die,\" which is the fourth book of Osman's Thursday Murder Club series, AKA my favorite series of all time. He's really trying to fill the podium up by himself in 2024!  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  More brilliant, witty, eccentric, lovable, whacky, goofy, emotional, tender, sweet characters in this new series. I just want to hug everyone in this book. They are so wonderful and hilarious.  \n\n- **Humor:**  \n  The number of times I laughed out loud at this book has to top twenty. The humor is almost relentless, yet so perfectly timed and never overdone.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  I also really enjoyed the murder mystery that took place. It felt very modern yet classic at the same time. A very clever crime that manages to weave in influencers and ChatGPT without making it feel bloated in any type of social statement. Big points for the creativity and toeing the line!  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Installments:**  \n  I can't wait for the next installment of this new series! I will have two reliable casts that I can turn to for witty and charming mysteries now. How fantastic is that?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis review is a heartfelt celebration of Richard Osman's storytelling, particularly his ability to craft endearing characters, deliver impeccable humor, and weave clever, modern mysteries.

Initially, I was disappointed that his new novel wasn’t another installment of the Thursday Murder Club series but rather the start of a new series.\n- **Character Development:** It didn’t take long for me to warm up to Amy and especially her father-in-law, Steve. Once again, Osman has created unforgettable characters, both with the unusual detective duo (or trio) and the wonderful supporting characters.\n- **Tone and Balance:** The best aspect is the perfect balance between humor and the crime plot. I love British humor, but in crime novels, humor can sometimes lead to a lack of seriousness or even slapstick. Fortunately, Richard Osman never falls into this trap.\n- **Series Potential:** How wonderful it would be if there were a new Thursday Murder Club book and a new \"We Find Murderers\" book every year!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite my initial disappointment that this wasn’t another Thursday Murder Club novel, I quickly grew to love the new characters and the masterful blend of humor and crime.

I breezed through it in just three days, even with a busy gardening schedule. It was highly engaging and completely captivated me.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author’s Reputation and Anticipation:**  \n  I missed that this one was out, but as soon as I got it, I changed all plans to read it immediately. For me, Richard Osman’s reputation is that good—I couldn’t resist, and that theme continued all the way through it.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  I think I read it in three days, despite being busy in the garden. It was highly engaging and kept me hooked.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work (Thursday Murder Club):**  \n  Compared to *Thursday Murder Club*, it’s “same same but different.” The author writes in the acknowledgements, “although the world is new, my brain remains the same.” And of course, that’s why it’s so good. It’s the same humour, the same quirky characters, and the same England.  \n  Curiously, the characters are more working-class; *Thursday Murder Club* is actually rather upper-class. But for working-class characters, there’s an awful lot of very expensive travel going on, which you don’t see in *Thursday Murder Club*—they are much more modest. I’m not sure I’m making sense here!\n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  One thing I like about this book is that there aren’t quite as many plot twists. That doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty—just that it’s a fraction more straightforward.\n\n- **Personal Preference and Enjoyment:**  \n  A friend asked me which series I prefer, and I dithered and finally said this one. It has cars, aeroplanes, and a cat………..but to be honest, they’re about equal. I love both series.\n\n- **Title and Concept:**  \n  By the way, ‘We Solve Murders’ would be an awful business idea, but it’s a great name for a book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book lived up to my high expectations of Richard Osman’s work. It retained the humour, quirky characters, and English charm I love, while offering a slightly different tone and class perspective compared to *Thursday Murder Club*. The pacing was excellent, and the plot was engaging without being overly complex.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book starts with a gripping scene: Andrew Fairbanks is found dead, tied to a rope and thrown overboard from a yacht into the Atlantic. The mystery of who killed him and why sets the stage for a thrilling, globe-trotting investigation. The pacing is intense, with the story delivering a true thriller experience that surpasses even the author’s previous work, *The Thursday Murder Club*.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The new detective duo, Steve and Amy Wheeler, are brilliantly characterized. Their father-daughter-in-law relationship adds a personal and grounded dynamic to the story. Amy, an adrenaline-driven close-protection agent, contrasts sharply with Steve, who prefers a quiet life with his cat, Trouble. Their partnership feels authentic and engaging. However, I would have liked more development of Adam (Amy’s husband and Steve’s son), who felt underutilized in this installment.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Techniques:**  \n  The author’s writing is sharp and effective, with characters using simple yet ingenious techniques to solve the case. The plot is complex and well-crafted, showcasing the author’s storytelling prowess.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  While I loved this book, I missed the charm of the *Thursday Murder Club* gang, particularly Joyce. This new series stands on its own but could benefit from a nod to the beloved characters of the author’s earlier works.  \n\n- **Critiques:**  \n  The book introduces a large cast of characters, some of whom feel unnecessary to the storyline. This occasionally detracted from the focus and clarity of the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a thrilling start to a new series, with a complex plot, well-drawn characters, and a dynamic detective duo. While it doesn’t quite reach the same emotional depth as *The Thursday Murder Club*, it delivers a gripping and fast-paced mystery that leaves me eager for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n🌟🌟🌟🌟 (4 stars)"

Initially, the attempted crime made the story feel less cozy than I expected, but it ultimately leaned more toward the cozy mystery genre.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Most of the characters are laypeople, with a few professionals and semi-professionals involved in the detective work. I ended up loving Rosie, Steve, and Amy, and I’m excited that they (along with other interesting characters) will return in future books. Rosie is a memorable character and might be my favorite in the book. The relationships between the characters are endearing, fun to read about, and sometimes hilarious.  \n\n- **Humor and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The book has a lot of humor, including a few lines that made me laugh out loud. Similar to the *Thursday Murder Club* series, there is also depth to the characters and their background stories. I hope future books delve even deeper into characterizations.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery Elements:**  \n  The story is clever, with many red herrings and a large cast of fascinating characters. I managed to keep track of the characters and didn’t guess the solution to the mystery, both of which made the book a win for me.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Quotable Moments:**  \n  The writing is engaging, with several memorable quotes, such as:  \n  - “And, despite his assiduous preparation, it had taken him by surprise. You can think something often enough, but you will never be prepared for your heart disintegrating.”  \n  - “It’s funny, across a lifetime, the people you pick up. It’s often the most unexpected ones who stick around. There are friendships, forged in fire, which end up disappearing like smoke, and other casual, nodding friendships, which will stay with you for the rest of your life.”  \n  Even the Acknowledgments section is entertaining and amusing.  \n\n- **Series Potential and Author’s Personal Touch:**  \n  This is the first book in a series, and I’m looking forward to more. The author’s characters are usually entirely fictional, but one character, Trouble the cat, is based on his real-life cat companion, Liesl Von Cat, which adds a charming personal touch.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book started slow but ultimately won me over with its clever plot, memorable characters, humor, and emotional depth. The relationships between the characters are endearing, and the mystery kept me guessing. I’m excited for future books in the series and appreciate the author’s engaging writing style and personal touches.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4-1/2 stars"

            "The book took some time to engage me. Osman employs an Agatha Christie-style approach, introducing numerous characters and their backgrounds in the opening chapters, which initially felt overwhelming. However, by the 33% mark, I found myself invested in the central trio: Amy, a bodyguard-for-hire; her retired police officer father-in-law, Steve; and her client, bestselling author Rosie d’Antonio. The story unfolds as a madcap adventure, with the trio racing across exotic locations—from a private island off South Carolina to Saint Lucia, Cork, and Dubai—while evading assassins hired by the shadowy villain François Loubet. The plot is filled with shootouts, surprising alliances, social media distractions, and narrow escapes. While the settings are diverse and intriguing, only the New Forest offers a level of immersion that goes beyond a mere travel brochure.",
            "The central trio is both engaging and relatable, appealing to a broad audience. The supporting cast, featuring well-crafted villains and allies, enhances the story. Osman’s signature dry British humor adds charm, though it can occasionally feel repetitive.",
            "I anticipated *We Solve Murders* to be a gritty, high-octane thriller based on its blurb, but it ultimately presents a more lighthearted, character-driven narrative. Although it includes action elements, the story's familiar core is likely to resonate with readers, paving the way for a successful future series."

While it may not be groundbreaking, it delivers an entertaining experience with engaging characters and exotic settings.

Initially serving as Rosie’s bodyguard, Amy finds herself in the crosshairs and believes in confronting problems with guns and decisive action.

            "The story unfolds at a brisk pace, filled with action and mystery as bodies drop frequently. However, the reliance on chance and coincidences to resolve key plot points is ultimately unsatisfying. While the pacing kept me engaged, some elements could have benefited from a more deliberate execution. Centered on Amy, a bodyguard drawn into a tangled web of money laundering, murder-for-hire, and stolen blood samples, the narrative connects her to multiple crime scenes. Spanning locations like Hawaii, Dubai, Ireland, and Alaska, it creates a sense of global intrigue. Yet, the frequent shifts in setting often feel more like a superficial attempt at safety rather than a meaningful exploration of these diverse places.",

In contrast, her father-in-law Steve, a retired detective, stands out as a bright, observant, and resourceful character with a great taste in music, adding depth and charm to the narrative. However, the cat, Trouble, feels underutilized, missing the opportunity to become a quirky detective duo.",

            "Nicola Walker’s narration drew me into the story by the end of the second hour. Initially, the clever plot felt overly slick and lacked charm, reminiscent of a fake Doric portico on an executive home.

However, I didn’t feel as immersed in the story as I did with the author’s previous works, such as *The Thursday Murder Club* series. It was just an okay read for me, and I’m unsure if I’d continue with future books in this series.\n\n- **Target Audience and Appeal:**  \n  Fans of the *RED* film franchise, featuring Helen Mirren and Bruce Willis, will likely enjoy this book, as it carries very similar vibes.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Many thanks to @prhaudio for providing a complimentary ALC (audiobook) in exchange for my honest review.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has its strengths, including a twisty plot and a compelling cast of older characters, it didn’t captivate me as much as the author’s previous works. It’s a decent read but not one that left me eager to follow the series further.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It feels like a poor choice by the editor or publisher.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Steve is mildly interesting but lacks sufficient development.  \n  - Rosie comes across as a stereotype reminiscent of characters from second-rate Hollywood movies.  \n  - Amy, the bodyguard, is a victim of reverse stereotyping, with exaggerated male-action-figure traits that feel forced and unnatural, likely intended to shock or delight because she is a woman.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot is weak and lacks depth. The constant jetting around to international locales seems like an attempt to mask the lack of a compelling storyline. It fails to engage or hold interest.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  The book pales in comparison to the author’s *Thursday Murder Club* series, which featured realistic, warm, funny, and intelligent characters; thoughtful, deep plots; and charming English village settings. Joyce’s narrative voice is particularly missed. It’s disappointing to see the author abandon such a strong series for this new one, which feels like the antithesis of what made the first series so successful.\n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  The book was abandoned at page 211, as it failed to justify the time invested. Life is too short to spend on unengaging reads.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book falls short in multiple areas, including its title, character development, and plot.

We never really get to know Amy, who is ostensibly one of the main characters, or understand much about her relationship with her husband Adam or her father-in-law Steve.\n\n- **Plot Complexity and Engagement:**  \n  There were so many people and so many locations, which made the story tiresome. By the time the mystery was solved, I didn’t really care anymore. The complexity of the plot and the lack of connection to the characters made it difficult to stay engaged.\n\n- **Series Comparison:**  \n  I’ll keep reading the Thursday Murder Club books because they excel in character development and storytelling. However, I’m done with this series, as it failed to deliver the same level of enjoyment and connection.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a big disappointment compared to the Thursday Murder Club series.

            "The story presents as a convoluted mess, introducing an excessive number of characters with unclear purpose and development. Key plot points, like Amy breaking into the sheriff's home, lack logical consistency—she breaks a window yet avoids taking obvious evidence. Unrealistic scenarios, such as her jumping into a covered pool while under gunfire without being noticed, further undermine the story's credibility. The central mystery of identifying the money launderer targeting Amy gets overshadowed by unnecessary subplots and character interactions. The pacing is uneven, with a disproportionate focus on trivial details instead of advancing the main plot.

Her relationship with her husband, Adam, is described as a soulmate connection, but their limited interaction—only two texts over 380 pages—weakens this assertion. Meanwhile, Steve, Adam's father and a retired cop, lacks depth, contributing little to the narrative. Rosie, a famous author, is overly verbose and self-absorbed, which quickly becomes grating. The supporting characters are simplistic, often switching loyalties too easily, which undermines their believability. Overall, the lack of complexity in both character development and relationships detracts from the story's impact.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Cohesion:**  \n  The story lacked cohesiveness, feeling more like a collection of unrelated YouTube shorts rather than a unified narrative. The chapters didn’t flow well together, making the overall plot feel disjointed and poorly structured.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were underdeveloped and failed to come to life. Their actions didn’t align with their supposed roles or titles. For instance, Amy didn’t exhibit any traits or behaviors that would justify her being a superhero bodyguard, and Steve bore no resemblance to an ex-cop. Rosie, in particular, felt unnecessary and poorly conceived, with her name and role adding nothing meaningful to the story.  \n\n- **Relationships:**  \n  The relationships between characters were strange and unconvincing. The dynamics between Amy and Adam, Amy and Steve, and Rosie with everyone else felt forced and lacked depth, contributing to the overall lack of believability in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel was a disappointing read, plagued by a disjointed plot, underdeveloped characters, and unconvincing relationships. The lack of cohesion and believability made it difficult to engage with the story or care about the characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
