The plot weaves together secrets, prophecies, and danger, creating a thrilling mix of mystery and adventure that keeps you engaged. However, some dialogue and character descriptions can be confusing, leaving gaps in the narrative. The cliffhanger ending is both shocking and emotional, with the unexpected death of a character introducing chaos and heartbreak that will leave readers eagerly anticipating the next installment.",
            "Wren Nightingale is a relatable and well-crafted character. Her fear of change and inclination to conceal her emotions make her both human and endearing. Her transformation from Mundane to discovering her powers is compelling, with her growth beautifully depicted throughout the story. Lee Young is a refreshing presence—supportive, snarky, and deeply caring. His struggle to balance his family’s legacy with his desire to protect Wren feels authentic and relatable. His vulnerability and willingness to let down his guard around Wren elevate him as a standout character."

The humor often felt juvenile, with characters joking and speaking like twelve-year-olds, lacking the maturity and depth I anticipated.",

The magic system is fun, easy to grasp, and whimsical, making it a great starter fantasy for young teens.\n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n  The writing style was a struggle for me. It reads like a middle-grade or chapter book with a \"quirky\" sense of humor that didn’t resonate with me.

I would recommend it to younger readers, but if you’re already a firm lover of either genre, you won’t find anything new or standout here. It’s best suited for those just dipping their toes into these genres.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a charming setting and an accessible magic system, its writing style, humor, and lack of originality make it better suited for a younger audience than its intended YA demographic.

(I can relate because my bad fanfiction at 15 sounded just like this.)  \n- **Characterization:**  \n  The fact that our main characters are eighteen does not come across easily, as they often behave and speak like ten-year-olds.  \n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  I could not get through it, even though I always do my best not to DNF books, especially this early into them. Life is too short to read about adult people who sing “grace kelly is smelly.”  \n- **Potential:**  \n  I really wish I could have gotten through more of this book because it might have ended really well.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the novel is intriguing, the execution fell short for me due to the immature prose, unrealistic characterization, and lack of engagement. Despite its potential, I couldn’t continue reading past the 30% mark.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF @ 30%  \n\nThank you to NetGalley & Wednesday Books for the eARC in exchange for an honest review."

Because of that, I held this book to a high standard. The overall story felt flat and short, and I think part of that comes from the fact that *HoN* has 20 books built into it. There is so much world-building and character development in *HoN* that it’s a feast, while this felt like an appetizer.  \n\n- **Similarities to Other Stories:**  \n  I couldn’t help but notice the similarities between this story and *HoN*. Both involve a teenage girl who gets randomly chosen by a female entity and given a large amount of mysterious power no one understands. She goes off to a special school to master her abilities, finds out the female leader of the school is secretly evil, and her best friend dies.  \n\n- **Genre Reflection:**  \n  I’m noticing that lackluster storytelling is a trait I’m seeing more and more in YA novels, and it does make me feel like I’ve outgrown them. However, there are still a few left on my list to give a read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a solid 3-star YA novel. While the concept had potential and the writing was enjoyable, the story felt flat and short compared to the author’s other work, particularly *The House of Night* series.

While the characters are meant to be 18, their behaviors and attitudes often feel more suited to much younger teens.

The concept of four houses aligned with four \"moons\" or astrology signs at a magical school is intriguing, but I wish it had been more fleshed out.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Wren, the \"chosen one,\" is an orphan living with her uncles, which feels reminiscent of other fantasy tropes. Her discovery of her destiny felt too obvious for my taste. Sam, who resembles Hermione, is a character I would have liked to see more developed. Lee’s dedication to both the Moonstruck way of life and Wren makes me curious about how he reconciles these loyalties.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story progresses quickly, with trials pushing Wren to learn about her magic. The romance and friendships evolve naturally, which I appreciated. However, the ending drops at a huge cliffhanger, which works well as a setup for the second book in the duology.  \n\n- **Writing and Character Behavior:**  \n  The characters are supposed to be 18-year-olds, but their behavior and attitudes seem more fitting for much younger teenagers. Additionally, clues to a key element for Wren’s answers felt obvious, and I was surprised that Sam, portrayed as intelligent, took so long to crack the code.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book has an engaging premise with a magical school setting and a fast-paced plot.

            "In this story, we follow Wren Nightingale, an ordinary girl who discovers her magical powers on her 18th birthday. She is quickly drawn into Moon Isle, a prestigious lunar academy, alongside her best friends, Sam and Lee. While the novel attempts to weave in dark academia elements—secrets, power struggles, and mysterious deaths—the execution falls flat and fails to engage. The plot is predictable and overly simplistic, making it hard to stay invested.\n\nThe romance between Wren and Lee feels underwhelming; his inability to confess his feelings and reliance on clichéd poetic expressions result in a contrived subplot that lacks depth and emotional resonance. Overall, the book was not a page-turner for me. The pacing is sluggish, making it a struggle to reach the end. Despite attempts at suspense and plot twists, they remain either too predictable or poorly executed, ultimately leaving me unimpressed.",
            "The protagonist, Wren, embodies the overdone \"chosen one\" trope, suddenly acquiring remarkable powers without sufficient depth or development. Her friends, Sam and Lee, lack complexity as well; Lee’s unrequited love for Wren, conveyed through unshared poems, feels clichéd and uninspired. Overall, the characters are one-dimensional, failing to create any meaningful emotional connection.",
            "Moon Isle and its lunar academy present an intriguing setting, but the world-building ultimately falls short. Features such as the overtly labeled \"forbidden books\" section and the protagonist being referred to as the \"chosen one\" by a supernatural entity feel heavy-handed and lack the necessary subtlety."

            "The plot was enjoyable, but as a 35-year-old, I quickly figured out the major twists. Nonetheless, I can easily see how my younger self would have been captivated by it.",
            "The book skews towards the younger end of the Young Adult genre, which is perplexing considering the characters are 18 and preparing for college. While characters like Lily, Ruby, Sam, and Luke exhibit behaviors appropriate for their age, the main characters, Wren and Lee, often behave more like early high schoolers. This inconsistency gives the impression that the book is better suited for a lower YA audience, with moments reminiscent of a young teen's diary.",

            "I enjoyed the unique premise of how magic operates in this world, though I was a bit disappointed that Pisces isn’t one of the Moonstruck signs—especially since I was born on a full moon night! The familiar Pacific Northwest setting further enhanced the allure.",
            "This story effectively highlights themes of friendship, communication, intuition, and the journey of shaping one's future. The romance between Wren and Lee is endearing, though at times it veers into cringeworthy territory—an aspect that's relatable for their age. I also commend the strong effort to create an inclusive YA narrative.",

There wasn’t enough buildup to the relationship between Wren and Lee. While they were friends for years, we’re dropped into the middle of that relationship without seeing its development, only being told it’s there.

This straightforward sequence leaves little room for character development or complexity, making the story feel rushed and underdeveloped. The romance, in particular, suffers from a lack of chemistry; the main characters frequently express their attraction with superficial remarks like, “OMG, I love them, they’re so pretty,” without delving into the reasons behind their feelings or showcasing their connection. By the end, I found myself wishing the characters would end up with other individuals—Lee with Ruby and Wren with Sam—who exhibited better chemistry and more meaningful interactions.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**  \n  The prose felt very YA, almost middle-grade, despite all the characters being 18+. The writing lacked depth and sophistication, which made it hard to fully engage with the story.\n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The plot was pretty basic and followed a predictable sequence: opening -> school intro -> 1st trial -> 2nd trial -> end. There wasn’t much development or complexity in between these major events, making the story feel rushed and underdeveloped.\n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic system was easy to grasp, but the “learning magic” aspect wasn’t explored in depth. It felt superficial and didn’t add much to the overall narrative.\n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance was underdeveloped and lacked chemistry. Both main characters spent most of the book saying things like “omg I love them they’re so pretty” without showing why they felt that way or elaborating on their connection. By the end, I almost wanted the characters to end up with other people (Lee with Ruby and Wren with Sam) because they had better chemistry and more meaningful interactions.\n\n- **Setting and Descriptions:**  \n  The constant references to the Pacific Northwest (salty air, coffee, etc.) became repetitive and distracting. It felt like the author was trying too hard to emphasize the setting, which took away from the story rather than enhancing it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a straightforward plot and an easy-to-understand magic system, it lacked depth in character development, romance, and world-building. The repetitive setting descriptions and underdeveloped relationships made it hard to fully enjoy the story. Overall, it felt more suited to a younger audience despite the characters’ ages.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 rounded up."

Wren’s arrival at the school disrupts his expectations.  \n  The novel is a fun and entertaining read about coming of age in a magical world, with a compelling premise that sets the stage for the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Wren’s journey from believing she is powerless to discovering her magic is engaging and relatable. Lee’s character, with his sense of a predetermined destiny, undergoes a shift as Wren enters his life, adding depth to his arc. Both characters are well-developed and contribute to the story’s charm.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The magical world created by the authors is intriguing, with elements like the Academia de la Luna and the concept of elemental powers adding richness to the setting. The rules of magic and the societal expectations within this world are well-integrated into the narrative.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story is well-paced, balancing character development with plot progression. As the first part of a duology, it effectively sets up the narrative while leaving readers eager to find out what happens next.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  I found the novel to be a highly enjoyable read, with its blend of magic, coming-of-age themes, and character dynamics. The anticipation for the next installment is strong, as the story leaves several intriguing threads unresolved.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Draw Down the Moon* by P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast is a captivating and entertaining novel that skillfully blends magic, character growth, and world-building. It’s a promising start to a duology, and I’m excited to see how the story unfolds in the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While the book targets a Young Adult audience, it often seems more appropriate for a younger demographic. Despite the characters being 18 and pursuing adult aspirations, their behavior and dialogue align more with 14- to 15-year-olds, which undermines the story's intended maturity.",
            "While the book has its flaws, it offers several elements that may resonate with younger readers moving from middle-grade to Young Adult. Key features include a dual first-person perspective, a magical academy on a hidden island, the Chosen One trope, the discovery of powers, a secret crush, childhood best friends, and a found family dynamic.",
            "The novel presents an intriguing premise with a distinct magic system centered around moon signs and elemental guardians. However, the execution falls short, lacking depth and failing to differentiate itself from other magical school narratives. Although the power originates from the moon, this concept isn't sufficiently explored, leaving the focus on elemental magic feeling disjointed. While hints about the magic's origins are provided towards the end, the opportunity for deeper development is unfortunately overlooked."

            "This story leans on the \"chosen one\" trope, showcasing Wren's unique powers that distinguish her from others. However, the ending disappoints; the buildup leads to an unsatisfying conclusion, leaving readers puzzled about Wren's transformation and her departure from the school. The narrative would have benefited from being a standalone, with smoother exposition and a more cohesive resolution.",
            "The characters, particularly Wren, often come across as younger than their 18 years, behaving more like 12-year-olds. While Wren's loyalty to her friends and her determination to unravel the mystery lend her perspective some intrigue, she ultimately lacks a clear character arc. Lee is more compelling, shaped by family expectations and his sister’s memory, but his blind adherence to rules and incel-like tendencies can be frustrating. Sam strikes a balance, exhibiting both immature and more typical 18-year-old behavior; her intelligence and protectiveness add depth to her character. Unfortunately, secondary characters like Luke, Lily, and Ruby are underdeveloped and feel more like plot devices than fully realized individuals.",
            "The dialogue often comes off as unnatural and overly expository, reminiscent of the clichéd trope of \"remember how our parents are dead.\" Although there are moments that successfully show rather than tell, the heavy reliance on clunky dialogue for exposition is a significant drawback. The writing feels juvenile, almost as if crafted by a middle schooler, which undermines its young adult classification. Additionally, the characters' interactions and clothing choices appear unrealistic for high school students.",

            "The main leads were enjoyable, especially Lee, whose passion for poetry was charming. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly Wren recognized her romantic feelings for Lee; their love confession at the 75% mark felt organic, given their five-year friendship. However, Lee's response to what he perceived as a romantic rejection, leading to mutual distancing, was frustrating and slightly affected my overall rating. Sam emerged as a standout character, and her death felt unnecessary; I would have preferred her to be seriously injured or in a coma instead. Ruby and Lily made minimal impressions, with Lily coming off as overly perfect and lacking depth. The group dynamics felt contrived, as characters seemed paired off rather than forming a cohesive unit. While there wasn't much character development, it didn't detract from my enjoyment, as the story was more plot-driven. Wren was the only character to undergo significant change, mainly in her circumstances.",

The tropes of pining, magic, and dark academia are effectively used.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story evoked strong emotions, particularly through the themes of loss, toxic family dynamics, and bullying. The relationships between the characters felt genuine, and the emotional stakes were high.\n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The romance is sweet and tender, with only kissing scenes, making it suitable for a younger YA audience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed *Draw Down the Moon* for its engaging plot, well-developed characters, and immersive world-building. The narration enhanced the experience, and the emotional depth kept me invested. While the cliffhanger ending left me eager for the next installment, I appreciated the opportunity to read the ARC of *Give Up the Night* to continue the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Narration: 4/5  \n- Emotion: 4/5  \n- Couple: 4/5  \n- Overall Rating: 4/5  \n- Spice Level: 1/5 (kissing only)"

            "On her eighteenth birthday, Wren is unexpectedly moonstruck, discovering that those born under Aquarius, like her mother and Lee, possess healing abilities. Each zodiac sign confers unique powers: Taurus individuals have exceptional memories, Leos can influence group emotions, and Scorpios are exceptionally strong. Wren is revealed to be a rare one-in-a-generation special moonstruck, endowed with conduit powers to aid other moonstruck individuals.\n\nAs Wren delves into their history, she uncovers a tale of three women—the Elder, the Maiden, and the Mother—who were once granted power, until Selene broke the pact, resulting in a loss of abilities. With the recent murders of all other special moonstruck, Wren fears for her own safety, believing this may also be the reason behind Maya's death.\n\nWren's feelings of unease intensify with the unsettling presence of Rottingham and Celeste. When she tries to express her concerns to Lee, he dismisses her worries, unaware of the danger since she fails to mention his sister. A confrontation with Celeste ensues, leading to a fierce fight that leaves Celeste injured. In the midst of the chaos, Wren undergoes a transformation and vanishes.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the introduction of the characters Wren, Lee, Sam, Lily, and Ruby. They quickly became favorites of mine. Wren Nightingale, a mundane grappling with the loss of her parents five years prior, is best friends with Lee Young, who, like Wren, is moonstruck and possesses elemental powers. As Wren struggles to adapt to her classes and harness her abilities, Lee is haunted by the death of his sister, Maya, on campus. Their friendship strains when Wren and Lee argue over unexpressed feelings, leading to weeks of silence between them. Eventually, they reconcile and confess their love for one another.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam assists Wren in discovering her powers while expressing concern about Rottingham's interest in her. Tension escalates when a student named Wyatt is killed for trespassing in a restricted area. The situation becomes more dire with Sam's death, but Wren follows her final advice to read a book in the moonlight, uncovering vital truths. Lee, devastated by the revelation of his sister's murder, accompanies Wren as she confronts Celeste, revealed to be the original maiden, Selene. Heartbroken, Lee carries Celeste to Rottingham in hopes of finding a solution to the turmoil they face.",
            "I was captivated by the enchanting elemental world in this story. Wren and Lee's journey at Moon Isle Academy, where they learn to harness their powers, is compelling. The trials they face not only challenge them but also determine how their abilities will align.",

The male character strongly leans on the \"just friends\" dynamic, and the female character doesn’t seem overly interested in him initially. Then, unexpectedly, they declare their love for each other without any gradual buildup or yearning—it comes across as somewhat instant. While they've known each other for a long time, the rest of the book sees them functioning more as partners than as a couple, which adds to the feeling of disconnect in their romance.",
            "The pacing of the story was uneven, with certain sections feeling overloaded with information, particularly at the beginning and end, while the middle lost momentum. The writing, at times, felt choppy due to an abundance of short sentences, which made it difficult for me to maintain my focus. While I appreciate the importance of world-building, I believe the narrative could have benefited from more action to sustain engagement throughout.",

I was fully engaged by the story and its magical elements, and I'm eager to see where the plot goes next. There are numerous questions raised that I hope will be addressed in the second book, which I definitely look forward to reading. I enjoyed watching the main characters develop, and I hope their growth continues in the next installment.",

Plus, I love the cover so much.  \n\n- **Premise and Worldbuilding:**  \n  I was interested in the Moonstruck idea and the island where these people go to learn about their powers. I almost expected them to get through all three trials over the course of the book, but I guess we need content for a sequel—so it’s easy to tell this will be the first in a series (if you didn’t already know). The book does go through two other trials though, and they were definitely action-packed!  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  There is a bit of romance between two of the characters, and while it was sweet, it felt disjointed too. The guy really leaned hard on the \"she just wants to be friends\" ideology, and she didn’t seem too hot on him either, then *poof* they are suddenly announcing their love for each other. Zero slow buildup or pining here—it feels a little insta-lovey (but it’s not, they have known each other for a long time). Then…that is kind of it for the romance? The rest of the book they work together like a team, but they feel more like partners than romantically involved. Like I said, disjointed.  \n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**  \n  The pacing of the story felt a bit off at times, and the writing felt choppy in places. It could be a personal preference, but when I noticed the choppy writing, it was hard to stop focusing on it. So many short sentences! For pacing, the first and back sections of the book had a ton of information crammed into them, but the middle dragged a little bit. I know that worldbuilding is important, but there could have been more action throughout.  \n\n- **Engagement and Character Development:**  \n  I was invested in the story, the magical aspects, and where the plot was headed. I feel like there are a ton of questions that will (hopefully) be answered in book two, which I would be interested in reading. I liked seeing the main characters come into their own, and hopefully, that development continues in the sequel.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  Death, violence, blood, loss of a loved one, bullying, grief.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the magical premise and action-packed trials, though the romance felt disjointed and the pacing uneven.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Target Audience and Character Maturity:**  \n  The book is intended for ages 12-18, a challenging age range due to varying rates of mental, emotional, and physical growth. While the characters have graduated high school, their actions, thoughts, and manner of speaking feel more appropriate for first-year high school students. This inconsistency made it difficult to connect with the characters as intended.\n\n- **Plot and Writing Consistency:**  \n  The book suffers from noticeable inconsistencies that disrupted the reading experience. Several times, I had to stop and verify if what I read matched earlier pages, which broke immersion. These issues were significant enough that I believe young adult readers would also notice them.\n\n- **Originality and Parallels to Other Works:**  \n  The book features blatant parallels to a popular young adult series, which isn’t inherently problematic, but the execution didn’t work for me. The lack of originality in certain aspects detracted from the overall experience.\n\n- **Character Development and Narrative Perspective:**  \n  While I appreciated Jordan Barton’s performance of Lee’s character, I didn’t understand the need for Lee’s point of view throughout the novel. The book didn’t delve deeply enough into the characters’ psyches to justify his chapters, making his perspective feel unnecessary.\n\n- **Magic System and Potential:**  \n  I enjoyed the magic (or “magick”) system and believe the series has the potential to resonate with its intended audience. Despite its flaws, the book could still be a hit with young adult readers.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I’m unsure if it’s fair to compare this book to others like *Divine Rivals* and *Legendborn*. While my rating reflects the inconsistencies and parallels, I acknowledge that a young adult book isn’t inherently bad based solely on character maturity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Draw Down the Moon* has potential, particularly with its magic system, it struggles with inconsistencies, character maturity, and originality. The execution of certain elements didn’t work for me, but it could still appeal to its intended audience. I’m curious to hear others’ thoughts on the book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating score was mentioned in the review."

His inner monologues and actions seem unrealistic for an eighteen-year-old, such as his poetic comparisons of mundane moments—like likening the morning sun to a stuck yolk or wishing to capture Wren's laugh as an alarm tone. His attempts to mimic Regency-era noblemen feel forced and disconnected from his age. While Lee identifies as a hopeless romantic, this portrayal comes across as exaggerated and difficult to relate to. In contrast, Wren's chapters are more enjoyable and grounded; she feels like a relatable character, making her segments easier to engage with.",

I wanted to stop reading multiple times, but the intriguing premise kept me going, which is why I gave it 2 stars.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing often felt like it was aimed at children, with explanations reminiscent of *Dora the Explorer*. This made it hard to take seriously as a YA novel. With some adjustments to scenes and character ages, it could have been more digestible for a younger demographic, similar to *Percy Jackson*, *Harry Potter*, or *Keeper of the Lost Cities*.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  Reading this book with the expectation of it being a YA novel was disappointing. It didn’t meet the standards I associate with that genre.\n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  The cover is absolutely beautiful.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the world and magic system were intriguing, the poor character development, frustrating ending, and overly simplistic writing style made this book a letdown for me. It didn’t meet my expectations as a YA novel, though I can see how others might enjoy it. Ultimately, it just wasn’t for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars."

The concept of Moon Magick, while intriguing, was poorly handled by the authors.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Wren Nightingale, the main character, felt like a watered-down version of Zoey Redbird from the authors' previous series. She embodies the stereotypical \"not like other girls\" trope, which comes off as forced and unoriginal. Her character lacks depth and feels like a caricature of a Tumblr-esque, pseudo-intellectual teenager.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is very juvenile, leaning heavily into the \"young\" aspect of young adult fiction. It reads like something I would have enjoyed in middle school but feels out of place for a more mature audience.  \n- **Representation:**  \n  As a POC reader, I found the portrayal of the interracial relationship problematic. The FMC is repeatedly described with terms like \"pale,\" \"innocent,\" and \"platinum blonde,\" which feels fetishizing and uncomfortable.

This series might appeal to someone just getting back into reading, but it wasn’t for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the zodiac-based magic system had potential, the poorly developed characters, juvenile writing style, and problematic representation made this book a disappointing read.

As a moon enthusiast, I was instantly drawn to her character. Wren’s dynamic with her best friend, Lee—who has also been moonstruck—is a highlight for me. My favorite character is the Air Elemental; if I were Wren, I would definitely befriend all the elementals. Sam’s character arc is both heartbreaking and brilliantly executed—her death deeply affected me in a profound way. Celeste, the original maiden, serves as a compelling antagonist with intriguing ties to Nepheret, although it’s disheartening that Lee chose to believe her despite the evidence. The sweet romance interwoven throughout the story adds a charming touch to the overall magical and witchy themes.",

The ending was gratifying, leaving me eager for the next installment. I look forward to seeing how the authors develop the world and characters further.",

The romance was decent but lacked the chemistry and tension typical of a romance-focused story, feeling underdeveloped compared to other elements.",

The unique magic system intrigued me, and the cover art caught my eye.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  I absolutely loved the representation in this book! It features a diverse cast of characters, including the girls, gays, and theys, as well as POC representation, which made the story feel very colorful and inclusive.  \n\n- **Plot and Writing Issues:**  \n  As I listened to the story, I noticed several errors and plot holes early on. Characters would say something and then seemingly forget it the next moment. Many things didn’t add up if you looked too closely, which really irked me.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship (Wren and Lee):**  \n  My main issue with the book was the relationship between Wren and Lee. The lack of communication between them significantly detracted from the story for me. Much of the conflict could have been resolved if they had just sat down and had an honest conversation. If you dislike the miscommunication trope, I would advise steering clear of this book.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Recommendation:**  \n  While I don’t think this story was for me, I would recommend it to a younger audience. Although the characters are 18-20 years old, I would emphasize the “young” in young adult. I believe high schoolers would enjoy this story, especially if they don’t mind a somewhat juvenile tone or minor plot inconsistencies.  \n\n- **Cultural Representation (Side Note):**  \n  I appreciated the attempt to include ethnic foods in the story, but it was frustrating that the narrator mispronounced some of them. For example, “pho” should be pronounced like the beginning of the F word but with a question mark (e.g., “Fuuu???”), not “Fo.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some appealing elements, such as its unique magic system and diverse representation, it was ultimately let down by plot holes, poor communication between characters, and a tone that felt more suited to a younger audience.

Additionally, Wren is depicted as a fearful and dependent character, frequently needing Lee for protection or comfort, which undermines her supposed status as the “chosen one.”",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  I absolutely adored this YA fantasy book. The premise of a mystical school, a mysterious death, and a magickal romance was captivating. Wren Nightingale’s unexpected powers and her journey to the Academia de la Luna kept me hooked. The blend of elemental powers, astrological full moons, and a hidden magickal school created a unique and immersive world.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Wren and Lee’s dynamic was a highlight for me. Wren’s transformation from a Mundane to someone with glowing powers was compelling, and Lee’s internal conflict between upholding his family’s legacy and protecting the girl he loves added depth to his character. Their evolving relationship felt genuine and added emotional weight to the story.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The setting of the Academia de la Luna, a secret magickal school on a hidden island off the Seattle coast, was vividly described. The grueling trials, the Moon Council, and the web of secrets and prophecies enriched the world and made it feel alive. The inclusion of murder and danger added an exciting layer of suspense.\n\n- **Narration and Audio Experience:**  \n  Thanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for the ALC of this book! The narration by Ina Marie Smith and Jordan Barton was excellent, bringing the characters and story to life. Their performances enhanced my enjoyment of the book.\n\n- **Anticipation for the Sequel:**  \n  I’m eagerly looking forward to book two! The story left me wanting more, and I can’t wait to see how Wren and Lee’s journey unfolds.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis YA fantasy novel was a delightful read with a unique premise, engaging characters, and rich world-building. The blend of romance, mystery, and magick kept me thoroughly entertained, and the audio narration was a fantastic addition. I highly recommend it to fans of the genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The magical system and world-building were reminiscent of *Harry Potter* (e.g., restricted library section, magic school, chosen one trope) and *The Magicians* (e.g., using hands for magic, different schools for different magic types). However, these elements weren’t explored in enough detail to make the world truly captivating.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The characters and their relationships felt rushed and underdeveloped. Specifically, I disliked the relationship between Lee and Wren. I’m not a fan of the best-friend-to-lovers trope, and Lee’s emotional reliance on Wren was problematic. Both characters seemed scared of each other, and I believe they could do better individually. Lee, in particular, needs to work through his unresolved issues, such as his fixation on reviving his dead sister’s legacy, rather than relying on Wren for emotional regulation.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusion:**  \n  I appreciated the inclusion throughout the book, as it was handled thoughtfully and didn’t define the characters solely by their identities.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style felt shallow, as if I were reading an idea from a TikTok roleplay series rather than a fully developed novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws, I found the book entertaining and enjoyable as a light, magical good-vs-evil story with a chosen one trope.

While the premise is engaging, I felt the narrative only scratched the surface and left me wanting more depth and exploration of the world and characters.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Wren is a character I truly loved. Her journey from believing she was Mundane to embracing her newfound powers was compelling. Lee, on the other hand, was harder to connect with. His struggle between upholding his family’s reputation and his feelings for Wren was intriguing, but his inability to listen to Wren when she offered solutions made him frustrating at times.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The romantic tension between Wren and Lee added an emotional layer to the story. However, I found the trope of the guy thinking he needs to save the girl, only to realize she’s the one saving him, to be overused and exhausting. Despite this, I appreciated the complexity it brought to their relationship.\n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The story builds steadily, but the ending was particularly impactful, leaving me eager for the conclusion. The cliffhanger was well-executed and has me excited to see how the story resolves.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel for its engaging premise and strong protagonist in Wren.

I absolutely cannot fault them for that. They were great, and I'd love to hear them in other works.\n\n- **Target Audience and Maturity Level:**  \n  This reads much more like a middle-grade novel than a young adult book with leads meant to be eighteen years old starting their adult lives. If this had been written with thirteen-year-old leads and marketed as middle grade, my review would be completely different. As it is, this just read as very immature.\n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**  \n  Wren is different! She's tiny and blonde but has pink streaks in her hair and a double-bird name! And she isn't supposed to have magic, but she's special! And the adults at school want to kill her for it!  \n  Lee is under so much pressure to do everything right! Except not really because he will literally throw everything away for Wren.  \n  And do not even get me started on the Japanese character who randomly spouts out one word of Japanese in an otherwise very clear English sentence.\n\n- **Writing Style and Details:**  \n  Plus, I had to hear way too much about Grace Kelly the Frenchie. And all of Wren's Frenchie-themed clothes... All of Wren's weird, punny clothes, honestly.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the narrators delivered a commendable performance, the novel fell short of my expectations, feeling more suited for a middle-grade audience than young adults.

The enigma of Moon Isle and the series of unexplained accidents generate tension and maintain the narrative's intrigue. The pacing strikes a perfect balance, seamlessly integrating action, character development, and world-building.",
            "Wren is a relatable protagonist who grapples with the challenge of catching up to her peers, all of whom have already mastered their powers.

She is taken to Moon Isle to explore her newfound powers with her best friends, Lee and Sam. The idea of Moonstruck abilities linked to specific Moon signs—Aquarius, Taurus, Leo, and Scorpio—adds an intriguing layer to the narrative, especially as Wren's sign remains a mystery. I look forward to seeing this aspect further developed in the series."

            "While I initially struggled to overlook the similarities to a beloved magical academy book from my childhood, I ultimately found myself enjoying the story. The plot centers on an orphaned Chosen One who discovers their magic in their later childhood or teenage years. The academy features four distinct \"houses\" and explicitly forbids modern technology. The narrative includes a misleading teacher as a red herring, along with another character who isn’t who the main characters believe them to be. Overall, the book offers a fun reading experience, balancing action and intrigue effectively. While the pacing kept me engaged, some predictable elements, such as the red herring teacher, slightly diminished the overall impact.",
            "The main character is well-developed, supported by two best friends who enhance the story's depth. One is a brilliant and outspoken young woman, especially when defending her loved ones, while the other is a male character driven to prove himself to his family. Although these characters are engaging, the romance between the main character and one of her friends often feels awkward. At times, their interactions make them appear younger than their 17/18 years.",
            "The magic system in the book was a standout feature, rooted in astrology, where various moon signs bestow different powers. This concept is both intriguing and distinctive, though I wish it had been explored more deeply. Hopefully, the sequel will expand on this fascinating idea."

One is an exceptionally brilliant young woman who is curious and outspoken, especially when she or her loved ones are wronged. The other is a male character who has something to prove to his family. While the characters were engaging, the romance between the MC and one of her best friends felt cringy. Despite being 17/18, their relationship dynamics made them seem much younger.\n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic system was one of the highlights of the book. It’s based on astrology, with different moon signs granting different powers. This concept was cool and unique, though I wish it had been explored in more depth. Perhaps the sequel will flesh it out further.\n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  Overall, the book was fun to read, with a good balance of action and intrigue.

I’d read some of it, then set it aside because I didn’t connect with it or it didn’t grab my attention as much.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved Wren’s character growth. At first, she’s a prank-loving, immature girl, but once she arrives at Moon Isle, her demeanor changes. She becomes more shy initially but opens up as she makes friends. She still has room to grow, but since it’s only the first book, I’m not surprised.  \n  Lee’s character is well-written, and I love the banter and playful chemistry he has with Wren. However, I have mixed feelings about him because he seems to be focusing on the wrong things, like following his parents’ expectations rather than forging his own path.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic:**  \n  The world-building, especially the magic system, is explained to Wren throughout the book, which I enjoyed because it felt like I was learning alongside her. This helped me connect with her emotions and experiences more deeply.  \n\n- **Themes and References:**  \n  There are many references to Bridgerton and a similar era, with titles like “Lord” and “Lady.” While it’s supposed to be cute, I felt it was overdone and became a bit much.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The story started to pick up closer to the end, with more action, romance, and angst. I’m glad I continued reading because it got progressively better.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some challenges with engagement and pacing, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The character development, world-building, and magic system were highlights for me. While it took some effort to get through initially, the story improved significantly as it progressed. I’m looking forward to the second book!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars. The book didn’t grab my attention as much as I’d hoped, and I had to power through parts of it, but I ultimately enjoyed the world-building, magic, and character growth."

Despite minor issues with pronoun consistency for a side character, the story is immersive and emotionally resonant, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

It feels closer to middle-grade (MG) than new adult (NA), especially since the characters are reminded they’re legally adults but are treated like children, which adds to the youthful vibe.\n\n- **Writing Quality and Errors:**  \n  There are quite a few errors in the book, though it’s an ARC (Advanced Reader Copy), so some mistakes are expected. However, I feel these issues should have been caught during the initial review process.\n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The term \"magick\" is used to describe both the magic cast and the person casting it. If you’re \"moonstruck,\" you’re a magick. To bring forth abilities, a Naruto-style finger jutsu is required, which felt cheesy to me. While I have no hate for Naruto, this element made the story feel less serious.\n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The story is interesting but basic, with predictable and convenient developments. The romance lacks chemistry, making it feel flat and unconvincing.\n\n- **Ending and Cliffhanger:**  \n  The book ends on an irritating cliffhanger due to a character’s poor decision. While I might consider reading the next installment, I’m not particularly eager to do so.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book has a youthful tone and a basic, predictable plot with a magic system that feels a bit cheesy.

            "I appreciated the friends-to-lovers romance subplot, which offered a refreshing alternative to the commonly seen enemies-to-lovers trope in fantasy literature. This element added a unique charm to the story. The narrative follows Wren, who discovers her magical powers and enrolls in a magical school with her best friend, Lee. The school's structure, organized by zodiac signs, ties into the magic system in an intriguing way. However, I was left with more questions than answers, particularly regarding the exclusion of certain zodiac signs and whether this school is the only one in existence. The ending, unfortunately, left me craving more clarity.",

I was pleased to find that, although the characters are 18, the romances and dialogue remain firmly within the YA spectrum and do not cross into New Adult territory, as many current YA books tend to do.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The magical system, which combines the moon and astrological symbols, was both interesting and intriguing. I appreciated the dark academia elements that maintained a balance without becoming overly twisted or dark.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The book struck a great balance between thrill, spooky elements, romance, and magic, making it a story that both adults and teens can enjoy. The romance, in particular, was refreshing because it avoided the pressure and immaturity often associated with male love interests in YA. Instead, it portrayed an innocent, puppy-love dynamic with enough emotional maturity to allow for healthy decision-making.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you're looking for a YA series that you can share with your up-and-coming teens, *Draw Down the Moon* is definitely the one for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by the Casts is a well-crafted YA fantasy that balances magic, romance, and dark academia in a way that appeals to both teens and adults.

It’s a quick, fun read with a beautiful cover and plenty of genre-specific charm.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Overall Rating: 3.31/5\n- Characters: 2.5/5\n- Cover: 5/5\n- Story: 3/5\n- Writing: 2.75/5\n- Fantasy: 5/5\n- Magic: 5/5\n- Romance: 4/5\n- Witch: 5/5\n- YA: 5/5"

            "This story follows Wren, whose mundane life in Fern Valley shifts dramatically when she becomes Moon-touched on her eighteenth birthday. As she grapples with her newfound magic under the watchful eyes of the Lunar council, her friends Lee and Sam prepare for Moon Isle. The dual point of view enriches the narrative, particularly highlighting Lee’s ambition to join the Lunar council and his feelings for Wren. The plot is filled with action and intrigue, but the ending feels abrupt and leaves readers on a cliffhanger.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  - The plot is interesting, with a premise involving a school of magic where students become moonstruck with Elemental magic at the age of 18.  \n  - However, the school setting feels more like a middle/elementary school rather than a college campus, which doesn’t align with the characters being 18-year-olds about to enter college.  \n  - A specific scene where students are lined up like elementary school children further detracts from the intended college-like atmosphere.  \n\n- **Characterization and Perspective:**  \n  - I didn’t connect with the main character, Wren Nightingale, and found her unlikable.  \n  - I was more interested in the secondary main character and potential love interest, Lee Young.  \n  - The dual first-person perspective leans heavily into Wren’s thoughts, which was frustrating since she is new to the magical world, while Lee already knows about his magic.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  - The book feels reminiscent of *Harry Potter*, particularly in how Wren and her family discover the school (similar to Dumbledore visiting the Dursleys).  \n  - It also includes a “Tournament of Skill,” which adds to the *Harry Potter* parallels.  \n  - The overall tone and style evoke early 2000s YA novels like *Twilight*, *The Hunger Games*, and the *House of Night* series by P.C. and Kristin Cast.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Nostalgia:**  \n  - The book has a younger YA feel, which might appeal to readers seeking nostalgia for early 2000s YA literature.  \n  - However, this tone may not resonate with readers looking for a more mature or contemporary YA experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the plot and premise of the book are intriguing, the execution fell short for me. The school setting felt too juvenile for the characters’ ages, and I struggled to connect with the main character, Wren. The heavy focus on her perspective, combined with the book’s nostalgic but dated YA tone, ultimately led me to stop reading. Fans of early 2000s YA novels might enjoy this for its nostalgic feel, but it didn’t work for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- DNF (Did Not Finish) at 25%."

            "The story employs a familiar \"training academy trials of fortitude\" formula, complemented by some engaging twists and turns. While entertaining, the plot does not offer originality in terms of concept or tropes.",
            "The female main character embodies the “not like other girls” trope, appearing entitled, spoiled, and somewhat clueless. Although I found her unlikeable, her character was crafted to emphasize her perceived uniqueness, which I didn't find too bothersome. In contrast, the male main character felt underdeveloped, often resembling a side character, which was disappointing. The romance unfolds as a slow burn—an approach that may resonate with some readers, but I personally felt it was overly drawn out.",

Despite not being a favorite, it left me interested enough to continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 out of 5 Stars"

I found myself aggravated with almost everything happening by the time I reached about 65% of the book, which led me to stop reading.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were a major drawback for me. Almost all of them ruined the experience, making it difficult to stay engaged with the story.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance portion of the novel was problematic. It was built on one of the most gaslighty encounters I’ve ever read, and the fact that this behavior was encouraged by supporting characters made it even more off-putting.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I can see where a younger audience might enjoy this book, but it just wasn’t for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a promising premise and an interesting magic system, its execution, characters, and romance subplot ultimately made it an unsatisfying read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It didn’t meet my expectations, which was unusual given my past experiences with both the genre and the author.\n\n- **Target Audience and Maturity Level:**  \n  The book felt a bit immature for the age range it was intended for. The tone and content didn’t align with what I expected for the target audience.\n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  I couldn’t seem to sync with any of the vast array of characters. They lacked depth and relatability, which made it difficult for me to connect with the story.\n\n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  The plot felt reminiscent of *The Hunger Games*, but with astrological signs as the central theme. However, the execution felt more immature and less compelling compared to *The Hunger Games*.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book didn’t resonate with me due to its immature tone, lack of engaging characters, and underwhelming execution of its concept.

            "The POV chapters of both Wren and Lee were enjoyable, though Wren felt somewhat inconsistent at times. For instance, Lee has never seen her cry before, yet she breaks down multiple times in this book. Lee embodies the intense 'professional grown-up' vibe, weighed down by family expectations. I found him to be the most mature character, with his shifting motives adding intrigue. While Wren and her friends are supposed to be 18, they often come across as more like 16, highlighting Lee’s inner maturity in his POV chapters. \n\nAs for the romance, it wasn’t overly prominent but was filled with the typical teenage angst of fearing that feelings might ruin friendships. Moments like \"maybe I’ll mention another girl to mask my feelings\" were painfully relatable. Overall, though, I appreciated the friends-to-more storyline, finding it sweet, with the addition of a queer side relationship.",
            "Wren and her friends are meant to be 18, yet their behavior feels immature. The book's darker themes resonate with the characters' ages, featuring several graphic and violent moments. It also includes pop culture references and humor that today's true YA audience will likely enjoy.",
            "I loved the setting and the diverse magics in Moonstruck, particularly how the powers originated from the moon itself and the intriguing backstory behind it, along with the Elementals. The worldbuilding was well-developed, providing enough explanation while leaving some mysteries to explore in the sequel. The atmosphere of the hidden Academia on a Pacific Northwest island added to the charm, and the plot consistently kept me engaged.",
            "This story was an absolute blast! Not once did I find myself bored. While it may not be the most mature or complex narrative, I truly enjoyed every moment and will definitely be reading the conclusion to the duology!"
        ],
        "conclusion": "While *Draw Down the Moon* may not be the most mature or complex story, it is an incredibly fun and engaging read. The magickal school setting, well-crafted worldbuilding, and fast-paced plot make it a delightful experience. Despite some inconsistencies in character behavior and a somewhat angsty romance, the book shines with its atmospheric setting and intriguing mysteries. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to the conclusion of the duology.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n  - I’m not usually a fan of boarding school or magical academy settings, but there are exceptions, like The Scholomance trilogy by Naomi Novik.  \n  - Draw Down the Moon is largely set in a magickal academy, which initially made me hesitant, but the beginning of the book drew me in.  \n  - I was intrigued by the moon magick and the elementals surrounding it, but the academy itself felt a little off to me.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - I liked the characters, especially Wren, whose apprehension about attending a new school felt relatable.  \n  - Wren’s struggle to catch up academically while navigating her new feelings for her best friend Lee was well-portrayed.  \n  - Lee’s internal conflict—trying to live up to his family’s reputation while dealing with his feelings for Wren—added depth to his character.  \n  - Wren’s other best friend, Sam, was a character I liked, but her inconsistent actions toward the end left me frustrated.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The writing seemed aimed at a younger YA audience, which isn’t usually an issue for me, but it felt mismatched with the characters’ ages (17/18 years old).  \n  - Some of the conversations made me inwardly cringe, as they didn’t feel authentic for the characters’ age group.  \n  - I didn’t connect as well with the writing, which ultimately affected my overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The reveals at the end were good and left me wanting to know more about the magick and Wren’s fate.  \n  - I think I would have eventually warmed up to the story, but the pacing and tone made it harder for me to fully engage.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the intriguing moon magick, relatable characters, and strong ending, the writing style and tone felt mismatched with the characters’ ages, making it harder for me to connect with the story. I would recommend this book to a younger YA audience or those who enjoy magical academia settings, but I remain conflicted about my overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Definitely entertaining.  \n\n- **Accessibility for Beginners:**  \n  I’m a bit of a beginner when it comes to the fantasy genre, but I found this generally pretty easy to understand.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  Wren grew up knowing about moon magic but had settled into her circumstances of being a mundane despite two magical parents. Until her 18th birthday, that is. We get a good ole “yer a wizard Harry” scene before she is whisked off to a magic school with her two best friends. Chaos ensues.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  This book reminded me of *A Deadly Education* with the school for magic kids where students die (not quite as often) and there are monsters lurking around (elementals) and a mystery about the school to solve. Even a magical book! If you liked *A Deadly Education*, this is maybe a younger version of that.  \n\n- **Tone and Target Audience:**  \n  Speaking of young, a lot of this did come off pretty juvenile, especially the drama with the main couple, Wren and Lee. However, this is clearly marketed as YA, so I can’t be mad at that.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  I did feel like a lot of questions were left unanswered, but this will be a series, so I expect to hopefully get more background in the next books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEntertaining and engaging, but the tone felt a little too young for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

Their dynamic adds an interesting layer to the story. However, I felt that the characters, who are supposed to be 18, acted much younger, making the book feel more suited for a middle school audience.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  While the story has potential, the characters' behavior and the overall tone seem more appropriate for readers aged 13 to 15 rather than older teens or adults.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for providing the e-ARC in exchange for an honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has an intriguing premise with its focus on moon magic, astrology, and mystery. However, the characters' behavior and tone make it feel more suited for a younger audience. It’s a great read for middle schoolers, particularly those aged 13 to 15.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
