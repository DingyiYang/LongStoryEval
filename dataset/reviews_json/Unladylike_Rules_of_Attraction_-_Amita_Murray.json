At times, the narrative feels rushed, and the numerous subplots can make it difficult to connect with each character’s journey. Although the resolution addresses most loose ends, it ultimately lacks the depth and nuance the story merits.",

            "The story centers on Anya, a court musician caught between wealth and poverty as she navigates a world rife with sexism, racism, and classism. When a client bequeaths her a fortune, Anya faces a pressing deadline: she must marry before her 25th birthday to claim her inheritance, with the handsome yet exasperating Lord Damien Ashton as the will's executor. Meanwhile, the Budleigh family, convinced they’ve been cheated, will stop at nothing to reclaim the fortune, adding layers of tension and intrigue to the narrative.",
            "This rivals-to-lovers romance beautifully captures the gradual connection between Anya and Damien as they lower their defenses and begin to care for one another. Their interactions highlight their growing bond and mutual respect, making for an engaging read. The book also stands out for its diverse representation, tackling themes of race, class, and gender in the Regency era. Fans of diverse Regency romances will find this series essential.\n\nAnya, a clever and compassionate protagonist, has worked hard for her success yet remains guarded due to her status as the half-Indian, illegitimate daughter of an earl. In contrast, Damien, the grandson of a Black woman, initially appears standoffish due to the prejudice he's faced, but his caring and loyal nature gradually shines through. The chemistry between Anya and Damien is sizzling and swoon-worthy, although their relationship develops slightly faster than expected.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Damien’s brother Jeremy, Anya’s protégé Trixie, and cameos from Lila, Ivor, and Walsham, are delightful additions that enhance the story's depth."

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the main plot, which, much like *Unladylike Lessons*, showcases the author's talent for crafting a compelling mystery. The inciting event rivals any historical romance's Act 3, presenting high stakes and a whirlwind plan that unfolds over a week. The writing is concise and well-structured, taking readers on an exhilarating journey filled with unexpected twists. True to form, the author drops subtle hints early on for observant readers to notice. This is one of the few books where both the inciting incident and the historical romance Act 3 delivered heart-pounding stress, leaving me gasping in excitement. \n\nWhile the resolution may be controversial for some, I found it grounded in realism, honoring the characters and the meticulously developed world.",
            "While I wish the scenes had lingered longer, their inspired ideas and acts felt underexplored in terms of their full sexy potential. However, the groveling montage from HR was a standout highlight, delivering in spades. I also appreciated how the romantic arc seamlessly intertwined with the main plot, and the author's skill in crafting a strong supporting cast truly elevated the narrative. Additionally, I admire how she reflects on societal issues from the past while acknowledging that similar villainous personas still exist today.",
            "This story caught me off guard with its emotional parallels to the real experiences of readers of color. I appreciate how the author challenges all readers to confront these realities, as some of us cannot simply close the book and move on from the conflicts depicted. I also praised the previous installment, and I continue to adore the fractured sisterhood at the heart of this series. It’s an incredibly compelling aspect of the novels. In this installment, the sisterly moments truly shine, complementing the already captivating storyline. The mystery of their origins unfolds beautifully, and I eagerly anticipate the next chapter!",
            "Having read the first novel exactly a year ago, I entered this author's latest work with clear expectations. The author is known for her murder mystery plots, where romance takes a backseat. While I was prepared for this, new readers might be surprised. This story deviates from the typical narratives in its genre, serving as a refreshing antidote to Bridgerton. While Bridgerton has been praised for its diversity in historical romance, Amita Murray thoughtfully integrates authentic characters of color into her narrative. I particularly appreciate and resonate with the portrayal of the Marleigh sisters as Indian, just like me."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Series Context and Expectations:**\n   - As someone who read the first novel of the series exactly a year ago, I knew exactly what I was coming into with an Amita Murray novel. Ms Murray loves her murder mystery plots, and the romance comes secondary. I was well prepared for that, but I think some new readers might not be.\n   - This series is not quite like Bridgerton. It feels like an antidote to Bridgerton. While Bridgerton has been heralded as the baseline of diversity in the HR genre, Amita Murray actually takes the care and consideration to write actual people of colour into her books grounded in realism. I especially love and relate to the fact that all the Marleigh sisters are Indian, just like me.\n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**\n   - With Unladylike Rules of Attraction, it feels like Amita Murray has finally found a good balance between her thrilling plots and the romance. I definitely enjoyed the chemistry and sex scenes between Anya and Damian in this book more than the previous installment.\n   - I do wish the scenes themselves had lasted longer than most men do 😂. The ideas and acts for the various scenes were inspired but felt as though they were not tapped into their full sexy potential.\n   - I really did like the romantic progression of the two. Some of the most beautiful lines came from both Anya and Damian when they were being introspective about their lives and each other. Amita perfectly laid out their flaws and where those traits came into conflict.\n   - I do love a great grovelling montage from anyone in HR, and this book definitely delivered in that respect. I also loved how seamlessly the romantic arc of this book intertwined with the main plot.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**\n   - Speaking of the main plot, I loved this particular one very much. Just like Unladylike Lessons, Amita knows how to write a great mystery plot with an inciting event to rival any HR Act 3, high stakes, and a high-speed plan that will take place over a week.\n   - The plot was not only well written, but the writing of this book was extremely compact - the book was very well structured. It also took me for a joyride, with twists and turns I did not expect.\n   - In true Amita Murray fashion, she did lay some hints early enough for sharp-eyed readers to catch. This is one of the few books I've read where the inciting incident AND the HR Act 3 both were stressful. They both had me gasping loudly in the best way.\n   - While the resolution of the plot may seem controversial to some, I think it was very rooted in realism, which honoured the characters and world-building.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - Of course, it wouldn't be an excellent book without a wonderful set of secondary characters! I admire how she knows how to write a supporting cast that props up their leads well.\n   - I adored how Trixie and Jeremy supported their respective leads and how some characters connected back to the first book! I loved how the really lovely callbacks stood well on their own if you hadn't read the first book.\n   - Her villains are written all too well in the most horrifying ways. I think what makes them so terrible is that they feel real. We have all met people like this in person. Our very existence of being different threatens them, so they do everything in their power to make you feel small.\n   - I will always appreciate how Amita holds up a mirror not just to society back then but how people like these villains still exist in this day and age.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**\n   - The parallels at times really catch me off guard and have me very emotional. It is a very real part of our lives as readers of colour, and I like how Amita has all her readers confront the fact. Some of us don’t get to close the book and move on with our lives from the conflicts present in the book.\n   - Last and certainly not least, I sang all the praises for the last book as well: I absolutely adore that their fractured sisterhood is the thread of this series. It’s such a compelling part of the books. In this novel, the sister scenes really shone on their own alongside the already intriguing story. The mystery of their origins keeps unravelling in the best way, and I cannot wait to read more!\n\n- **Critique and Suggestions:**\n   - My only complaint for this book would be the fact that I wanted it to be longer overall! Just so the romance could have been explored even more in depth. A few extra scenes here and there to fully illustrate their connection. I could sense and feel it by Act 2, more specific scenes of connections would have made this book stellar!\n   - And of course, I would never complain about more descriptive sex scenes 😂.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this is the best book of the series to date (and I love Lila dearly!). It is for anyone looking for a more realistic look into the historical side of historical romance novels! If you’re into that, murder mysteries, and compelling characters and themes, this book is for us. Happy Reading everyone, and I can’t wait for this book to be in everyone’s hands!\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5\n- Spice Level: 🌶️🌶️🌶️"

            "This novel is faster-paced and more thrilling than its predecessor. The marriage plot is particularly engaging: Anya must marry within four months to inherit half her fortune, or it will go to Damian, a suspect in a murder case. The mystery elements are light yet entertaining, striking a perfect balance for readers who prefer a less intense approach to the genre.",
            "Anya and Damian's chemistry is immediate and captivating, marked by snappy, playful banter. Their relationship develops rapidly, which is somewhat surprising, yet their dynamic remains engaging. Both characters are outsiders in English society, grappling with racism and fetishization, which deepens their bond. Damian’s younger brother introduces an intriguing supporting element, particularly with his quiet jealousy simmering from across the ballroom. The romance is open-door but not overly explicit; while some scenes are well-crafted, they could benefit from more detail. The heat level is moderate, akin to Lorraine Heath’s works, providing enjoyment while leaving room for greater intensity. Anya’s trauma regarding her separation from her sisters is thoughtfully portrayed, highlighting her internal struggle between the desire to reconnect and the feeling of being unable to do so. Similarly, Damian’s outsider status and the assumptions surrounding him add complexity to his character, elevating him beyond a mere romantic lead.",
            "This novel explores profound themes of racism and societal exclusion through the experiences of Anya and Damian. Anya faces exoticization at court, dealing with jealousy from women and objectification from men, while Damian grapples with the assumption that he has murdered his way to his title due to his Jamaican heritage. Despite these challenges, the story strikes a balance between realism and optimism, allowing the protagonists to find love while confronting the harsh realities of their world.",
            "This novel has been likened to *Bridgerton*, yet it stands out as smarter and more attuned to racial issues. It's enjoyable, unique, and distinctly its own, making it a remarkable addition to the genre."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Unladylike Rules of Attraction* is a fast-paced, engaging romance with well-developed characters and a thoughtful exploration of race and societal exclusion. While the relationship progresses quickly and the mystery elements are light, the chemistry between Anya and Damian, along with the novel’s astute social commentary, makes it a compelling read. It’s a smart, fun, and unique addition to the genre, offering both romance and depth.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The novel is the second in Amita Murray’s Marleigh Sisters series and is faster-paced and more exciting than the first installment.\n   - The marriage plot setup is engaging: Anya must marry within four months to inherit half the fortune, or it goes to Damian, who is suspected of murder.\n   - The mystery and murder elements are light but entertaining, making it a good balance for readers who aren’t typically into heavy mystery.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Chemistry:**\n   - Anya and Damian’s chemistry is immediate and compelling, with a lot of snarky, fun banter.\n   - Their relationship develops quickly, which was a bit surprising, but their back-and-forth remains enjoyable.\n   - Both characters are outsiders in English society, facing racism and fetishization, which adds depth to their connection.\n   - Damian’s younger brother adds a nice supporting dynamic, especially with his quiet jealousy and seething from across the ballroom.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**\n   - The novel tackles serious issues like racism and societal exclusion, particularly through Anya’s and Damian’s experiences.\n   - Anya is exoticized at court, facing jealousy from women and objectification from men, while Damian is assumed to have murdered his way to his title due to his Jamaican heritage.\n   - Despite these challenges, the story maintains an optimistic yet realistic tone, allowing the leads to fall in love while acknowledging the harsh realities of their world.\n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**\n   - Anya’s trauma surrounding her separation from her sisters is handled well, showing her internal conflict between wanting to reconnect and feeling unable to bridge the gap.\n   - Damian’s outsider status and the assumptions about him add layers to his character, making him more than just a romantic lead.\n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Content:**\n   - The romance is open-door but not overly explicit, with a few scenes that are well-written but could have used more detail.\n   - The heat level is moderate, comparable to Lorraine Heath’s works, which is enjoyable but leaves room for more intensity.\n\n- **Comparisons and Overall Appeal:**\n   - The novel is compared to *Bridgerton* but is noted to be smarter and more attentive to issues of race.\n   - It’s described as fun, different, and very much its own thing, making it a standout in the genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Unladylike Rules of Attraction* is a fast-paced, engaging romance with well-developed characters and a thoughtful exploration of race and societal exclusion. While the relationship progresses quickly and the mystery elements are light, the chemistry between Anya and Damian, along with the novel’s astute social commentary, makes it a compelling read. It’s a smart, fun, and unique addition to the genre, offering both romance and depth.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Heat Index: 6/10"

Anya Marleigh is a complex figure—sweet and caring, yet possessing a steel spine and moments of distrust. Lord Damian Ashton comes across as unfriendly and aloof, but his snarky demeanor eventually won me over. The supporting cast shines as well, particularly Jeremy, Trixie Cleaver, and Lady Budleigh, who is wonderfully detestable. I also adored Sally and Prinny, Damian's pygmy goats; they were irresistibly cute and provided plenty of humor.",

The pacing also suffered from repetitive scenes, particularly Damian's frustration over Anya's interactions with potential suitors, which contributed little to the overall narrative.",

A pivotal moment where Damian assumes the worst about Anya underscores the absence of trust and emotional depth. Additionally, many of the character decisions, especially Anya's, feel illogical and frustrating; her reckless confrontation with a suspected highwayman exemplifies this issue. Damian's poorly conceived plan to propose to Anya while simultaneously feeling jealous of her interactions with others adds to the sense of repetitiveness and lacks coherence.",

            "The book features a late-arriving mystery element that ultimately proves predictable. I identified the culprit right away, which lessened the intrigue and suspense.",
            "In this story, the protagonists Anya and Damian stand out from typical characters of the Georgian/Regency era. Anya is depicted as strong and witty, while Damian exudes intelligence and confidence. Both characters grapple with traumatic pasts and societal challenges that shape their responses throughout the narrative. However, Anya's tendency to hesitate, withdraw, or lash out, combined with Damian's emotional distance and poor communication, hindered my enjoyment of their romance.",
            "Amita Murray is a talented writer, and her book is expertly crafted. The palpable anxiety and danger faced by the characters showcase her ability to evoke strong emotions. The narrative effectively highlights their growth, particularly Anya's journey toward better communication and self-forgiveness, as well as Damian's insights on openness and forgiveness. However, these positive developments seem insufficient to offset the prevailing negative emotions.",
            "The book's romance is intense, focusing heavily on physical intimacy. However, the emotional connection between Anya and Damian feels weak, and their conflict-ridden relationship detracts from enjoyment. Instead of offering the escapism and fantasy I usually seek in this genre, the romance is overshadowed by the characters' struggles and a pervasive sense of dread."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the book is well-written with unique characters, but it was not an enjoyable read for me. The romance lacked the escapism I desire, and the characters' struggles overshadowed any sense of happiness or fulfillment. If you enjoy angsty and conflict-driven relationships, this book might be worth a look. However, it did not meet my expectations for a satisfying romantic experience.",

Instead of a typical Regency England romance between a court singer and a member of the elite, it delivered a rich blend of murder, mystery, drama, action, and romance. The plot centers on Lord Ashton, who is wrongfully accused of murder, and Anya and Damian’s race to identify the true culprit before his execution.

These aspects may be addressed in future installments of the series.",

The story follows Anya Marleigh, a half-Indian musician and singer in the court of George III and Queen Charlotte, who grapples with societal challenges stemming from her illegitimacy and darker complexion. A pivotal plot point arises when Lady Budleigh, a wealthy patroness, bequeaths her unentailed wealth to Anya on the condition that she marries before her twenty-fifth birthday; otherwise, the fortune will go to Lord Damian Ashton, a trustee with a mysterious past. Lady Budleigh's children attempt to contest the will and pressure Anya into marrying someone from their family. Caught between two admirers at court, Anya finds herself increasingly drawn to the enigmatic Lord Ashton.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel, *Unladylike Rules of Attraction*, is an engrossing and steamy historical romance with a mix of danger, drama, romance, emotion, and longing. The plot is intricately crafted, featuring a series of accidents, conspiracies, murders, passionate nights, misunderstandings, heartaches, and a botched marriage proposal. The story revolves around Anya Marleigh, a sitar player at court, who must marry by her twenty-fifth birthday to secure an inheritance.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Anya is a strong, resilient, independent, smart, and complex heroine, which I greatly appreciated. Damian, the male lead, is also well-developed and likable. The supporting characters, particularly Trixie and Jeremy, stood out as favorites. Lila, from the previous book, remains a force, and I adored the sisterly moments of healing between the Marleigh sisters.  \n\n- **Representation and Diversity:**  \n  The novel features diverse characters, which is refreshing, especially in a historical romance. I particularly loved that the heroine plays the sitar—a unique and unexpected detail.  \n\n- **Writing and Narration:**  \n  The audiobook narration was well-done, enhancing the overall experience. However, the miscommunication trope dragged a bit, and I wished Anya and Damian had spent more time together instead of being separated near the end due to the prolonged misunderstanding.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  While the story was engaging overall, the pacing faltered slightly during the miscommunication sections. I also felt a bit disappointed that Anya didn’t get to exact revenge for being bowled out by Damian in the opening cricket scene.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Investment:**  \n  The novel left me emotionally invested in the Marleigh sisters, and I’m eagerly looking forward to Mira’s book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Unladylike Rules of Attraction* is a captivating historical romance with a strong, diverse cast and a richly layered plot. Despite some pacing issues with the miscommunication trope, the story is filled with drama, passion, and emotional depth.

            "Lord Damian Ashton is a captivating character, blending a wicked sense of humor with a compelling vulnerability. His attractiveness is complemented by some tantalizingly spicy scenes. Anya, the fiercely independent female protagonist, grapples with insecurities and struggles to believe that anyone could genuinely care for her—seeing suitors as only interested in her superficial qualities, like her singing. One of the book's standout features is the rich diversity of the main characters' backgrounds: Anya is the daughter of an English Earl and his Indian mistress, while Lord Ashton is originally from Jamaica. This diversity adds significant depth to their experiences of animosity throughout the novel. The supporting cast is equally engaging; Jeremy Ashton is a lovable sweetheart, while the Budleigh family is utterly detestable, making their treatment of Anya and Damian all the more disappointing.",

The moment “the Man” turned up during the cricket game, I was completely captivated.  \n\n- **Character Development (Lord Damian Ashton):**  \n  Lord Damian Ashton was divine. I loved his wicked and sarcastic sense of humour, yet there was a vulnerability to him that made him deeply compelling. He was also very attractive, and there were some deliciously spicy scenes involving him.  \n\n- **Character Development (Anya):**  \n  Anya was a fabulously feisty female main character (FMC). I admired how she had found her own independence in the world presented to her, though she struggled with insecurities and couldn’t understand why anyone would genuinely care for her. She believed suitors were only interested in her singing and other superficial qualities.  \n\n- **Diversity and Representation:**  \n  One of the strongest aspects of the book was the diverse backgrounds of the two main characters. Anya was the daughter of an English Earl and his Indian mistress, while Lord Ashton hailed originally from Jamaica. These backgrounds led to much of the animosity they faced throughout the novel, adding depth to the story.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  The side characters were all fabulous. Jeremy Ashton was a sweetheart, and it was impossible not to love him. The Budleigh family, on the other hand, were completely odious, and I hated how they treated both Anya and Damian.  \n\n- **Historical and Royal Elements:**  \n  I particularly enjoyed the little snippets featuring Queen Charlotte and her relationship with Anya, which added a delightful historical touch to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Series Potential:**  \n  I was delighted to read this brilliant Regency romance. I enjoyed it so much that I can’t wait to pick up the other books in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating Regency romance with well-developed, diverse characters, engaging side characters, and a richly layered plot.

Amita Murray’s novel is a delightful addition to the genre.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story is both sweet and clever, with a mystery woven throughout. It captures the drama one expects from this time period, making it engaging and immersive.  \n\n- **Standalone vs. Series:**  \n  I didn’t read the first book in the series, but this novel read perfectly fine as a standalone. That said, I do wish I were more of a completist, as I’m now eager to go back and read the first book.  \n\n- **Author’s Style:**  \n  I appreciate Amita Murray’s writing style, which is both enjoyable and compelling. It’s a key reason I’ll definitely return to the first book in the series.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, *Unladylike Rules of Attraction* is an enjoyable story that left me satisfied and eager to explore more of the author’s work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Regency historical romance is a delightful read, blending sweetness, cleverness, and drama with a touch of mystery. While it works well as a standalone, it also piqued my interest in the series as a whole. Amita Murray’s style is a standout, making this a book I’d highly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As a sitar player for Queen Charlotte, she defies the typical portrayal of unmarried women in period romances, proving that being 24 and single doesn't equate to being a 'spinster.' The side characters, particularly the charming Jeremy, were a standout aspect of the story. I appreciated how they united to support Anya in her pursuits.",

I loved how they all came together to support Anya in achieving her goals.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  This book is perfect for fans of period romance, mutual pining, strong female main characters, found family dynamics, and a touch of the miscommunication trope.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Unladylike Rules of Attraction was a fun and engaging read that delivered everything I look for in a period romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a delightful period romance with a strong female lead, charming side characters, and a heartwarming found family dynamic.

            "The story centers on Anya, a singer and sitar player at the Royal Court, who must marry before her 25th birthday to inherit a substantial fortune. Her choice of husband requires the approval of Lord Damian Ashton, the trustee appointed in the will. With its blend of drama, romance, intrigue, and spice, this regency novel is a captivating read.",
            "Anya, a spirited and fearless character, defies societal norms in favor of her passion for cricket. As the daughter of an Earl and his Indian mistress, she stands apart from the elite, much like Damian, a wealthy loner with Jamaican roots. Their initial animosity creates a compelling dynamic, filled with witty banter and palpable chemistry. As their relationship evolves from mutual irritation to a deeper bond, it faces a setback when Damian mistakenly believes Anya has betrayed him. The enemies-to-lovers trope is skillfully executed, enriched by their shared experiences as societal outsiders. The story also highlights South Asian representation through Anya’s mixed heritage and Damian’s background, exploring themes of societal prejudice, family, and reconciliation, particularly illustrated through Anya’s relationship with her sister Lila.",
            "This sequel to *Unladylike Lessons in Love* effectively builds on its predecessor while generating excitement for the upcoming story focused on the third sister, Mira. The engaging characters, diverse representation, and charming Regency romance elements have made this book a personal favorite."
