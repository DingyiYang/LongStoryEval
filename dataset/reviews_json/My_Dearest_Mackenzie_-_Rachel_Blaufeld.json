            "I found the female main character, Frankie, frustrating due to her stalking behavior toward the male main character, MacKenzie. Her relentless pursuit of him to uncover a historical love story felt obnoxious and unjustified, especially since MacKenzie owed her nothing and was unaware of her intentions. Additionally, the excessive use of multiple names and nicknames for characters was confusing. For instance, MacKenzie's grandmother was referred to as Milly, while his coworkers called him Millsy, which only added to the confusion without enhancing the narrative. \n\nThe romance between MacKenzie and Frankie felt inauthentic. Despite MacKenzie brushing her off multiple times, he suddenly described her as spunky and intriguing, which lacked believability. Their interactions were inconsistent and jarring; for example, MacKenzie invited Frankie out but then abandoned her at a restaurant. Overall, the story struggled with character development and coherence.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Theme:**  \n  I absolutely loved the concept of this book and the message that you can find love, no matter how late you feel it is. Age is not a constraint when fate has beautiful plans in store for you. The story promises hope, finding a connection with the person you'd least expect, and a love you earned but didn't think you deserved or would be blessed with.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Mackenzie Miller, the billionaire in his mid-forties, has always been the eternal bachelor. His parents' way of life instilled in him that love is neither important nor meaningful. However, his dearest Granny Rose had other ideas for her grandchild, and even in death, she is instrumental in bringing love and light into his life. Frances, in her late thirties, is bold, feisty, and done with the idea of being a \"good girl\" and pursuing marriage. Her ex taught her a harsh lesson, and now she’s focused on resolving the mystery of the letters her grandpa received from a woman named Rosie.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story revolves around Frances stalking Mackenzie to help her connect the dots and uncover the answers behind the letters. After relentless efforts, she ropes him into her mission, and together, they begin to understand the incomplete love story of their grandparents. As they spend time together, their chemistry becomes irresistible, though acknowledging their feelings proves difficult. The pacing felt natural, and the gradual development of their relationship was satisfying.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  This is an enemies-to-lovers story with a second chance at love (though they weren’t together before). The middle-aged couple dynamic didn’t feel stereotypical; instead, their connection was fiery and authentic. The sweet chemistry between Frances and Mackenzie was heart-touching, and their journey to love was fulfilling and touching.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story was very fulfilling and touching, as two souls are brought together by people who didn’t get their happy ever after. It was heartwarming to see them find this chance at love together. The emotional depth of the story, combined with the themes of hope and unexpected connections, made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is not your typical romance but a heartfelt story that delivers a powerful message about love, hope, and second chances. The characters are well-developed, the plot is engaging, and the emotional impact is profound. It’s a sweet, touching, and fulfilling read that leaves you with a sense of warmth and optimism.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n❤️❤️❤️ (Highly recommended for its emotional depth and unique take on romance.)"

            "The story had a Hallmark-like quality but managed to steer clear of excessive sentimentality, which I found refreshing.",
            "I appreciated the maturity of both the hero and heroine, with Mac in his forties and Frankie in her late thirties. They are lonely individuals with limited personal lives—Frankie grappling with a significant loss and Mac focused on his commitment to the family business. Mac's initial skepticism about his grandmother's secret love story added depth to his character, and his eventual involvement in uncovering the past felt organic. The romance between Mac and Frankie was engaging and authentic, avoiding the overly sweet tone often found in similar stories. Their connection developed naturally as they collaborated to reveal their grandparents' history. However, I found Rose/Milly to be an unlikable character. Frankie’s father seemed fortunate to have escaped her influence, as Rose/Milly was unkind to her family, except for Mac. Her favoritism toward him came at the expense of her daughter and other grandchildren, and it’s likely she would not have approved of Frankie being with Mackenzie if she were still alive.",
            "I was captivated by the book's concept, where the hero and heroine connect through love letters from a long-ago forbidden romance between their grandparents. Frankie’s quest to find Rose, the recipient of her beloved Paps' letters, and her eventual encounter with billionaire Mackenzie Miller was particularly intriguing."

In contrast, the romance between the two main characters lacked clarity; their feelings for each other didn't resonate as deeply. Instead of a genuine connection, their relationship seemed more like a transitional phase on their journey to finding their true loves rather than a fulfilling happily-ever-after.",
