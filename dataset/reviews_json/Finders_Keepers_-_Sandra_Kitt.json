The blurb is a bit misleading, as there isn’t a big mystery about the money, but it serves as the reason Olivia meets FBI agent Sloan Kendrick.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Olivia is venturing back into the dating world after her divorce, which makes her cautious, especially about dating a white man, as that was a factor in her failed marriage. Sloan also has his own backstory, which adds depth to his character.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance is nice and basic, featuring dinner dates, hiking, and Sloan arranging a tour of the FBI offices for some of Olivia’s students. I appreciate that the characters act and talk like the adults they are, with consent, passion, and mature interactions.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative:**  \n  I like Kitt’s distinctive writing style. The story is told from both Olivia’s and Sloan’s points of view, and at times, there’s almost a shorthand in their communication, which feels natural and engaging.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  This is the third book in *The Millionaires Club* series. I’ve read the previous book, *The Time of Your Life* (Feb 2022), but these novels can easily be read as standalones.  \n\n- **Reader Expectations and Reception:**  \n  I’m surprised by the lower ratings this book has received. I think some readers may have expected a mystery due to the blurb and Sloan’s role as an FBI agent, which might have led to disappointment.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  I’m looking forward to the next book in the series or whatever Kitt writes next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a well-written, adult romance with relatable characters and a straightforward plot.

Although it’s the third book in a series, I didn’t feel lost or confused, as it worked well as a standalone.  \n\n- **Themes and Topics:**  \n  I appreciated how the author addressed heavy topics relevant to an interracial relationship. She also incorporated and challenged various stereotypes, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Conflict:**  \n  The pacing felt uneven at times, and I noticed there wasn’t a single central conflict driving the narrative. This made the story feel a bit scattered.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance was sweet and focused on adults in love. However, I’m not a fan of on-page sex scenes that exclude oral intimacy—it’s a personal preference and somewhat of a dealbreaker for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Finders Keepers* was a heartfelt story about love and relationships, with thoughtful exploration of interracial dynamics and stereotypes. While the pacing and lack of a central conflict were drawbacks, the sweetness of the romance made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The initial intrigue about the money found in the walls was completely abandoned, and the story instead focused heavily on the interracial relationship between Sloan and Olivia, which felt out of touch with modern times.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship between Sloan and Olivia was the central conflict, but it was handled in a way that felt more suited to the 1820s than 2024. Their constant anxiety over the color of their skin dominated the narrative, leaving little room for other character development or meaningful interactions.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The pacing was slow and monotonous.

Instead, the focus shifted to Olivia spending the money, which added little to the plot or my interest.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  I know Kitt is capable of writing better than this. The book fell short of my expectations, especially given the promising start and the author’s previous work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was a disappointment.
