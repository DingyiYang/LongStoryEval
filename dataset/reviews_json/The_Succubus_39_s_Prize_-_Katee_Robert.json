            "The story's tone felt disjointed, blending seductive demon deals with heavy themes of religious and alt-right trauma. This tonal imbalance detracted from the overall experience. The cult-related elements could have been more engaging with additional exploration or deeper development.",
            "The heroine's past trauma and internal struggles overshadow the narrative, resulting in an excessive focus on her misery. Her persistent self-doubt and sense of unworthiness (“I don’t deserve good things”) hinder a connection with her journey. I longed for more agency and active engagement in her healing process, rather than mere reflection on her trauma. The character development lacked nuance and depth, leaving me yearning for either more pages or a thorough exploration of her growth."

The lingering shame and hurt of being queer in an unaccepting religious environment are powerfully depicted. The emotional depth of the story left me in tears multiple times."

It begins with the demon merchant Azazel discovering Belladonna, who agrees to a contract to spend seven years in the afterlife and endure seduction by a monster in exchange for her sister’s cancer recovery and financial stability. However, much of the narrative feels stagnant as Belladonna struggles to sacrifice herself for the succubus community and faces psychological exhaustion. Rusalka, the succubus, attempts to assist her during this challenging time.",

Rusalka, a succubus who appears nearly human—save for her hooved feet and claw-like fingers—can sense people's dreams and desires, manipulate their sleep, and feed on their emotions. What sets this book apart is Azazel, the demon merchant, who expresses genuine concern for Belladonna's mental well-being and urges Rusalka to choose her. This nuanced interaction adds a unique depth to the narrative.",

The focus on \"religious trauma\" as the sole backstory for the female main character (FMC) was insufficient and left me wanting more.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author, Katee, tends to overload sentences with pronouns, which becomes distracting and obnoxious. Using six versions of pronouns in a single sentence is excessive and disrupts the flow of the narrative.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  There was a notable absence of world-building, particularly concerning the succubus character. This lack of detail made the setting feel underdeveloped and less immersive.\n\n- **Emotional Depth:**  \n  The story lacked real angst or drama, which made it feel flat and less engaging compared to other books in the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I am a fan of the series, this installment fell short in several areas.

The plot primarily focuses on Belladonna’s trauma, leaving limited space for other significant developments.",
            "The central theme of Belladonna's religious trauma is compelling, but the resolution feels incomplete. She continues to carry shame from her experiences, and her breakthrough would have been more impactful if it were linked to a genuinely enjoyable sexual experience that resembled a religious epiphany. Rusalka's appearance is difficult to visualize, despite my efforts to imagine him. The side characters come across as irrelevant and poorly defined, with confusing names, pronouns, and roles that hinder the flow of scenes involving them. While I appreciate the author's commitment to inclusivity regarding gender and identity—one of my favorite aspects of her work—the lack of significance and inconsistent descriptions of the side characters ultimately detracts from the overall impact of this inclusivity.",

I even had to look up what a succubus was!

When she signs her deal with Azazel, he worries about her ability to advocate for her own self-harm, as required by the contract.

As someone who hasn’t read a true sapphic romance before (only some FFM), this was a fantastic introduction to the trope and genre.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style and Series Appeal:**  \n  Honestly, if Katee Robert writes it, I’ll read it. I love these bite-sized monster novellas and wish she’d write 17 more of them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Succubus’ Prize* is my favorite book in the Deal with a Demon series so far.

They complemented each other well, and their love felt genuine and profound.  \n  - I enjoyed watching them heal together and grow as a couple.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  - The book felt rushed, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n  - The main focus on reprogramming Belladonna’s religious trauma was an important theme, but it felt poorly executed due to the limited time and length of the book.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The banter and sexual tension between the characters were unmatched and made the story engaging.  \n  - The epilogue was delightful and left me feeling giddy.  \n  - The quotes, such as “We’re all just doing our best, and sometimes we bruise the ones we most care about in the process” and “It’s the flaws and the bumps and bruises that make you perfect, little one,” resonated deeply with me and added emotional depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a captivating sapphic monster romance with strong character dynamics and emotional depth. While the rushed pacing and handling of certain themes could have been improved, the chemistry between Rusalka and Belladonna, along with the steamy and heartfelt moments, made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5🌶️"

These familiar aspects added a sense of continuity and nostalgia.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n   - The romance in this book fell short of my expectations. Beyond the series' recurring elements, there wasn’t much depth or development in the romantic storyline.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Intuition:**  \n   - I enjoyed Rusalka's intuitive understanding of Belladonna's feelings. This added a layer of emotional depth to their interactions.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - The sex-positive lands of the Succubi were a fun and unique setting to explore. It added an interesting dimension to the story.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Releases:**  \n   - I’m looking forward to buddy-reading *The Demon's Queen* upon its release in 2025 to conclude the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t fully meet my expectations, particularly in terms of romance, it still offered enjoyable moments through its familiar series elements, Rusalka’s intuition, and the intriguing Succubi setting. I rated it with the series in mind and remain excited for the final installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

With a fast-paced plot, the narrative centers on their evolving relationship, marked by challenges but culminating in a satisfying happy ending. This tale can be enjoyed as a standalone.",
            "**Belladonna** features a mid-sized/plus-sized protagonist grappling with religious trauma, shame, and guilt. She is self-sacrificing, often prioritizing others' needs over her own. However, her healing journey feels rushed, and the portrayal of her religious trauma is somewhat heavy-handed. **Rusalka**, a selfless leader dedicated to their people's well-being, is protective of Belladonna but struggles to accept help. The supporting cast includes Rusalka's court members, Azazel, Ramanu, and brief mentions of characters from previous books. \n\nThe romance between Belladonna and Rusalka feels underdeveloped and hurried, lacking the depth needed for a healthier, more organic connection. The swift acceptance of sexual situations, despite Belladonna's religious trauma, comes off as unrealistic and uncomfortable, particularly given the magical influence on desires. While the explicit sex scenes are rated 3/5 for spice, they lack the intensity found in other works. Overall, the story presents intriguing themes but could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of its characters and relationships.",

When her sister is diagnosed with cancer, Belladonna makes a desperate pact with a demon, sacrificing seven years of her life and the possibility of future children conceived in the demon realm to save her sister.

Multiple sexual partners can be acceptable, but bringing a new life into the world shouldn't involve such complexities.",

The moments of inclusivity seemed forced and disrupted the story's flow rather than integrating seamlessly. Rusalka's constant use of \"little one\" for Belladona was particularly grating, coming off as infantilizing and out of place. Additionally, Belladona's reflections on significant issues felt overly polished and unrealistic, especially her rapid recovery from a lifetime of abuse, which strained credibility.",

Where was the editor this time?  \n\n- **Character Development and Dialogue:**  \n   - Rusalka calling Belladona \"little one\" all the time was super annoying. It felt infantilizing and didn’t suit the context.  \n   - Belladona's reflections and responses to big questions and issues were too perfect and unrealistic. Her quick recovery from a lifetime of abuse wasn’t believable.  \n\n- **Inclusivity and Representation:**  \n   - I appreciate the author’s effort to be inclusive, but it felt very preachy. The inclusive moments were not woven naturally into the story; instead, they stood out as separate, forced moments that disrupted the flow.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - I didn’t like how all churches were lumped into one negative assumption. It’s naive to imply that all churches are unaccepting of people who identify differently from their assigned gender at birth.  \n\n- **Plot and Moral Dilemmas:**  \n   - As a mother, I found the idea of having four potential fathers for a baby disturbing. While I understand children are treasured in this world, the concept of not knowing who fathered the baby I’m carrying is unsettling. Multiple sexual partners are fine, but creating a life shouldn’t be a multiple-partner endeavor.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book fell short of my expectations, especially compared to the rest of the series.

Watching each of these women come into this new realm and experience things outside of the way our current society is has been truly lovely.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The Succubus's Prize is probably the one I was most concerned about, given the religious trauma/undertones. I will admit there were parts that made me uncomfortable, but in a good way—in a way that challenged my thoughts and somehow welcomed me in. I loved the care with which the demons, incubi, and succubi took with Belladonna. Even though they might not fully trust what she's saying, they were willing to let her explore and trust her own heart.  \n\n- **Spice Level and Balance:**  \n  The book includes a lovely amount of spice (it is a Katee book, after all), which adds to the overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  My only complaint was that I wanted more.

She confronts characters’ unresolved traumas head-on, pushing them to face their pain while encouraging self-acceptance and growth.  \n\n- **Genre and Personal Preference:**  \n  While the reader is not typically a fan of sapphic romances, they appreciate Katee Robert’s storytelling and her ability to dismantle oppressive religious views. The book aligns well with the themes and pacing of the previous novellas in the series.  \n\n- **Potential Audience Reaction:**  \n  The reader acknowledges that the book may not resonate with everyone and could even be off-putting to some, particularly those who might find the exploration of trauma or specific themes uncomfortable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a powerful exploration of religious trauma and healing, offering a cathartic experience for those who resonate with its themes. While it may not appeal to everyone, it stands as a strong addition to Katee Robert’s series, maintaining the emotional depth and pacing of her previous works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

In exchange, Belladonna agrees to spend seven years as Rusalka's consort in her realm.",

            "I adore this series for the sense of safety it provides within the author's enchanting world. Despite the mysterious magic and ongoing conflict, I find solace in the pages. However, while the sequels strive to recapture that initial magic, they often feel rushed and lack the detailed world-building that originally drew me in. This is a significant reason why my love for the story has diminished in the later books.",

Even though the magic is mysterious and there is conflict abound, my mind feels protected amongst the pages. However, I feel like each of Roberts’ sequels following the first book, *The Dragon’s Bride*, is chasing that magical feeling but not quite able to capture it. The subsequent books have felt a bit rushed, with less detailed world-building, and this is a big part of why I loved the series in the beginning.  \n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n  The best part of Belladonna’s story is her journey to overcome her religious trauma, shame, and coming to understand that being useful and being loved aren’t the same. I also enjoyed the inclusivity within the succubi kingdom—Rusalka uses She/They pronouns, and there is no prejudice amongst their subjects based on gender or sexual identity.  \n\n- **Plot and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  This is the 4th installment in the ‘A Deal with a Demon’ series, and it focuses on Rusalka, a powerful succubus. Belladonna, the human in this story, agrees to the demon’s bargain in exchange for money for her younger sister to complete medical treatment for her cancer and to attend the college of her choice after she recovers. In return, Belladonna will spend 7 years as consort to Rusalka in their realm.  \n\n- **Series Consistency and Expectations:**  \n  While I enjoyed this book, I feel like the sequels haven’t quite lived up to the magic of the first book.

            "I found the exploration of religious trauma in this book somewhat unsettling, as it seemed more reminiscent of a character raised in a cult with abusive parents. However, the LGBTQ focus is refreshing, particularly the thoughtful discussion of pronouns, which I believe is important. The presence of primarily one main character in each book adds an intriguing dynamic to the narrative.",
            "This book stands out for its deep emotional connection, surpassing others in the series. The monsters and territories are intricately woven into the same timeline, adding significant depth to the narrative.",
            "This book diverges from my typical romcom choices, embracing a darker theme that I found refreshing. With a high spice level of 5, it offered an intriguing depth that I thoroughly enjoyed."

        "conclusion": "This book stands out for its emotional depth and darker tone, though the religious trauma theme was less enjoyable for me. The LGBTQ representation and focus on pronouns are highlights, and I’m eager to continue the story. However, it’s not for everyone, especially those who might be uncomfortable with monster-human relationships.",

The LGBTQ representation and focus on pronouns are highlights, and I’m eager to continue the series.

Since it was such a deep issue that the main character dealt with for her entire life, it felt resolved too easily. While I get that the point of these books is to be quick reads, this resolution didn’t feel as genuine as the rest of the series.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n  I loved the mutual respect between all the characters and how Belladonna was able to overcome her internal struggles.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  I’m a HEA (happily ever after) girly, and I love Katee’s inclusion of so many varieties of identity.

While I didn’t have parents like Belladonna’s, I grew up in a highly religious Texas town with similar beliefs. My own journey of leaving the church at a young age (around 11-13) and embracing paganism made Belladonna’s struggles feel incredibly relatable. I’m still working through my own shame and trauma, so her arc of self-acceptance and embracing her pleasure was profoundly moving to read.\n\n- **Character Development (Belladonna):**  \n  Belladonna’s character arc was one of the highlights of the novel. Her journey toward self-acceptance and embracing her desires was beautifully written and deeply satisfying. It was inspiring to see her grow and overcome the internalized shame imposed by her upbringing.\n\n- **Romantic Relationship (Belladonna and Rusalka):**  \n  The relationship between Belladonna and Rusalka was a joy to read. Rusalka’s patience and understanding, coupled with her clear desire to be with Belladonna without pressuring her, made their dynamic feel authentic and heartwarming. Their interactions were well-written and added depth to the story.\n\n- **World-Building and Interconnected Stories:**  \n  As a fan of the *Deal with a Demon* series, I appreciated how this novel expanded on the world and the dynamics between the leaders. It was both interesting and amusing to see how each leader viewed the others. Katee Robert masterfully balances making me love the current protagonist while feeling annoyed with the others, only to flip that perspective in the next book. This layered storytelling keeps the series fresh and engaging.\n\n- **Author’s Skill in Character Portrayal:**  \n  Katee Robert excels at crafting characters who feel real and multifaceted. Her ability to make me empathize with each leader’s perspective, even when they initially seem antagonistic, is a testament to her skill as a writer. Each novel in the series deepens my appreciation for the characters and their interconnected stories.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a powerful and emotional read, particularly for its exploration of religious trauma and self-acceptance.

While the spice is enjoyable, it is less detailed compared to other books in the series, and the religious elements and parental storyline may not resonate with all readers. Despite being the reviewer’s least favorite in the series, the protagonist’s journey and the playful romance still leave a memorable impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

Their interactions and growth together are a highlight, though the relationship feels somewhat rushed (insta-love).  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is intriguing but could have been expanded further. More time spent developing the setting and the interactions with other bargainers would have enriched the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The novel is a quick read with excellent tension and engaging discussions.

While the religious trauma undertone was initially off-putting, Belladonna’s journey and her relationship with Rusalka made it a compelling read. The only downside is that I wished for more content to explore the characters and their future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It made perfect sense why the previous books focused heavily on a breeding kink, while this one did so less.  \n\n- **Inclusivity and Representation:**  \n  The book uses inclusive language and helps readers get accustomed to better, more respectful terminology. It’s very queer, and I especially loved the prominent representation of lesbians.  \n\n- **Plot and Content Expectations:**  \n  For a court that revels in orgies, there was a surprising lack of them in this book. I was expecting more and would love to see a bonus scene to make up for it!  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Enjoyment:**  \n  I absolutely loved this book! It was a fantastic addition to the series, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a standout in the series, offering a fresh and inclusive narrative while maintaining the series' unique charm. Despite some unmet expectations regarding certain content, it was an incredibly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- None explicitly mentioned, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating."

The characters are compelling and resonate with me.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n   - I love the care that is shown in the relationships. It could easily have been a dynamic of power, but instead, it’s tender care combined with sexy times—a great combination.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pace:**  \n   - I read this book in 2 days, which shows how engaging and fast-paced it was.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel effectively explores relatable themes of guilt and self-worth, features compelling characters like Rusalka, and balances tender care with passionate moments in its relationships.

This aspect of the character's journey felt unrealistic and rushed.\n\n- **Pacing of Relationships:**\n   - The relationship was way too rushed. It didn't allow for a believable or deep connection to form between the characters.\n\n- **Use of Pronouns and Clarity:**\n   - I'm all for preferred pronouns, but it was really confusing at times, especially with multiple people in the scenes. This made it difficult to follow the dialogue and interactions.\n\n- **Editing and Quality:**\n   - There were SO many typos in this book, which detracted from the overall reading experience and made it feel less polished.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was my least favorite in the series so far.

It was hard to believe she could overcome such a significant issue so quickly.  \n- **Dialogue and Characterization:**  \n  Rusalka repeatedly calling the MC \"little one\" was grating and negatively impacted my enjoyment of the story. It felt overused and added unnecessary annoyance.  \n- **Series Expectations:**  \n  With only one book left in the series, I’m hopeful the conclusion will be satisfying and wrap up the story well.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its flaws, particularly in the rushed handling of the MC's trauma and the irritating dialogue, I remain cautiously optimistic about the series finale.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n-1 star for the rushed character development and -1 star for the repetitive and annoying dialogue."

However, it felt overwhelming at times due to the complexity.\n- **Pacing and Timeline:** I wish the book had been longer to allow for better fleshed-out timelines. The pacing felt rushed in certain areas, which detracted from the overall experience.\n- **Purpose and Structure:** While the depth was impressive, I recognize that the book’s purpose may not have been to provide extensive timelines or detailed pacing, which left me wanting more.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel stands out for its depth, but the complexity and rushed pacing made it feel overwhelming. I would have preferred a longer, more detailed timeline to fully appreciate the story. Despite this, I acknowledge that the book’s purpose may not align with my expectations for pacing and structure.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "I appreciated how the protagonist, Belladonna, navigated her trauma, though I wished for a more in-depth exploration of her journey. An additional 50-100 pages would have enriched the narrative. Rusalka stood out to me as a refreshing and intriguing succubus, with her caring nature adding depth to her character. Belladonna’s trusting and accepting attitude toward the traditions of succubi and incubi was admirable; her curiosity and lack of judgment made her a compelling protagonist. As with the author’s previous works, the LGBTQ+ representation was thoughtfully integrated and well-executed.",

It’s still one of my most-viewed videos on YouTube, which shows how much I enjoy the series overall.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  This was one of the books I was most looking forward to once the author explained it as being part of a series. However, I was slightly disappointed because it didn’t live up to the wildness and excitement of some of the other books in the series.  \n\n- **Series Continuity and Progress:**  \n  I believe there’s one more book in the series, and while I’m looking forward to it, this installment felt like an okay part of the series rather than a standout. Still, I’m glad to be one step closer to finishing the series.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The wait between these (very short) books has been a bit frustrating, but I’m hopeful that the final book will be worth it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t quite meet my expectations compared to the others in the series, it was still an enjoyable read and a necessary step in the overall story. I’m excited to see how the series concludes and hope the final book delivers on the anticipation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

Belladonna, shaped by the religious trauma of growing up as a queer person in a conservative Christian environment, grapples with her need for multiple partners. This complexity enriches her relationship with Rusalka, which evolves into a strong partnership more swiftly than in many other stories—a refreshing change that I appreciated.",

The exploration of succubi culture, especially their perspectives on love, relationships, and community, is particularly noteworthy. Open relationships are prevalent, and there's a shared sense of responsibility in child-rearing, which I found both intriguing and appealing.",

It maintained the quality and charm of the series, even if it fell short in some areas.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book was enjoyable and maintained the high quality of the series, its shorter length and lack of depth in character relationships made it feel less satisfying compared to the others.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
