            "The frequent shifts in point-of-view characters from chapter to chapter were disorienting and often made it challenging to follow the plot. This narrative style reminded me of *Let it Snow*, where the varying quality of interconnected stories impacted my enjoyment. While some storylines, like the alien communication plot, were engaging, others, such as the spy mission, felt less compelling and disrupted my immersion.",
            "The review emphasizes the diverse characters and storylines in *Floating Hotel* as its standout feature. I value the inclusion of queer characters and the touching depiction of a found family of outcasts, which resonates with me on a profound level. This contrasts sharply with the gaming world, where diversity often faces criticism, highlighting how literature embraces these themes more seamlessly.",
            "While the narrative faced some challenges, I commend the consistently high quality of the writing. Ultimately, it was strong enough to win me over, even if it took a little time.",
            "This book's exploration of societal issues like oppression and the resilience of marginalized groups resonated deeply with me. The portrayal of a broken yet hopeful universe, where characters forge their own homes among the stars, is both poignant and inspiring. Additionally, the theme of dismantling an empire adds significant depth to the narrative.",
            "Initially, I struggled to connect with the book, likening my experience to watching a favorite movie while feeling disinterested. However, I persisted and eventually grew to appreciate the story, even if it took some effort to engage with it fully."

Despite some narrative flaws, the reader’s persistence paid off, and they ended up liking the book.",

            "The novel suffers from poor pacing and structure, primarily due to its approach of shifting perspectives with each chapter. This technique makes it challenging to connect with any character; just as I began to understand one’s backstory and motivations, the narrative would abruptly change focus. Consequently, I felt emotionally distant and disengaged. Additionally, the plot is underdeveloped and inconsistent. Although there are hints of an intriguing storyline involving rebels and secretive groups, these elements remain underexplored. The author's emphasis on introducing new characters detracts from plot progression, leading to a disjointed and forgettable narrative.",

Although the concept of a found family among the crew is central to the narrative, their relationships feel superficial, as they seem to merely tolerate one another. The author introduces an excess of characters too rapidly, which hampers meaningful development and emotional investment.",

While the world is bleak and rife with injustice, it ultimately highlights hope and human connection, leaning more towards hopepunk than cozy.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**\n   - The book has a unique structure, with each chapter told from the point of view of a different character, either a guest or a staff member of the Grand Abeona, a spaceship hotel orbiting the galaxy. Their stories interweave and intersect.\n   - This structure is both a strength and a weakness. While it ensures that every reader will find at least one point-of-view character they enjoy, it makes it difficult to get deeply invested in any single character due to the limited space devoted to each storyline.\n   - The book would have benefited from being longer or focusing on fewer characters to allow for deeper character development.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**\n   - The setting, both the Grand Abeona hotel and the wider galaxy, is well-drawn and realistic.\n   - The story is set in a dystopian future under a totalitarian government, featuring high stakes, including murder, famine, death, and the destruction of entire planets for resource harvesting.\n   - The world is full of darkness and injustice, but it also emphasizes hope and human connection, making it more \"hopepunk\" than cozy.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**\n   - The focus of the story is on hope and human connection, despite the dystopian backdrop.\n   - The tone is less cozy than expected, with a strong emphasis on the harsh realities of the world, but it ultimately conveys a message of hope through acts of kindness and solidarity.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author's Potential:**\n   - I enjoyed the book very much and will be keeping an eye on future works by this author.\n   - The book was received as an advance copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel offers a unique narrative structure and a richly detailed setting, blending dystopian elements with themes of hope and human connection. While the multiple perspectives make it hard to fully invest in any one character, the story's depth and emotional resonance make it a compelling read. I look forward to more from this author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story unfolds chapter by chapter through the diverse perspectives of its characters, sometimes overlapping in time and occasionally propelling the plot forward. This frequent shift in point of view can be jarring at first, necessitating a mental reset with each new chapter. However, the vignettes function as self-contained short stories, creating a rich and intricate depiction of life aboard the Abeona. The narrative prioritizes character exploration over a strong central plot, using the storyline mainly as a backdrop for individual arcs. While the book introduces some mysteries and elements of jeopardy, these aspects are not thoroughly developed, suggesting untapped potential for a more plot-driven narrative. The resolution ties up loose ends and mysteries in the closing chapters, but it comes across as somewhat weak. ",
            "The novel showcases an ensemble cast of crew and guests, each with distinct and overlapping stories. The characters are vividly portrayed, some exhibiting deep emotional authenticity that is both poignant and moving, such as Angoulême. However, while certain characters receive dedicated chapters, their minor roles in the overall plot often render their inclusion feel less essential, despite their engaging backstories.",
            "The Abeona, a hotel in space, is a vividly imagined setting brought to life by the intertwined stories of its inhabitants. The narrative immerses readers in the hotel's atmosphere, fostering a strong sense of place and community."

        "conclusion": "The novel excels in its rich character development and immersive setting, offering a vibrant portrayal of life aboard the Abeona. While the narrative structure and minor character inclusions present some challenges, the emotional authenticity and layered storytelling make it a compelling read. The plot, though secondary, provides a satisfying conclusion, even if it feels underdeveloped.",

            "In this engaging tale, we follow Carl, the manager of the Grand Abeona Hotel, a spacecraft journeying through the galaxy, alongside a cast of employees and guests whose stories intertwine. The novel culminates in a gripping confrontation that endangers Carl, his guests, and the hotel itself. Its structure, with each chapter showcasing a different viewpoint character, offers a rich perspective on the hotel and its unique atmosphere.",
            "The author masterfully employs shorthand characterization, providing each character with enough depth to warrant their own novel or novella. Initially, I found the absence of immediate backstory for Carl frustrating, but as the story unfolded, I became invested. While some characters only receive fleeting attention, their brief moments feel bittersweet yet fitting.",
            "The tone transitions seamlessly from quirky and charming to serious and tense in the latter half, yet the book maintains its wit and charm throughout.",
            "The story features multiple intertwined mysteries, including the identity of the Lamplighter and the enigmatic message explored at the Problem Solvers conference. Although the answers to these puzzles are somewhat predictable, they take a backseat to the richly immersive setting and well-developed characters. The narrative delves into themes of pursuing one’s passions, the bittersweet nature of goodbyes, and the notion that sometimes the best tactic is to abstain from the game altogether.",
            "The book masterfully balances tragedy and comedy, offering a narrative that is both heartwarming and heart-wrenching. Its surprising yet hopeful ending reminds readers that life continues, and it’s always possible to move forward, even after experiencing loss."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Floating Hotel* is a beautifully balanced novel that combines quirky charm with emotional depth. While its mysteries may not be intricate, the immersive setting, rich characters, and poignant themes make it a standout read. The book’s ability to shift tones seamlessly and deliver a hopeful yet bittersweet ending is particularly impressive. It’s a delightful and thought-provoking story that I highly recommend.",

Nevertheless, this was a minor flaw in an otherwise engaging and well-paced narrative. The story centers on the Problem-Solvers’ Conference, where academics are challenged to crack a mysterious code under secretive conditions. It also weaves in subversive messages from the Lamplighter, who critiques the oppressive 500-year-old Emperor and the Empire's denial of non-human life. The tension mounts as Imperial spies suspect a staff member to be the Lamplighter, while the professors’ efforts on the code hint at unsettling truths about the Empire.",

            "The Grand Abeona Hotel offers a captivating backdrop, featuring impressive world-building that enhances a story set mostly off-world. This luxurious space hotel traverses a pre-programmed route, welcoming a diverse mix of guests—from vacationers and celebrities to honeymooners and dignitaries—all eager to explore the galaxy and indulge in fine dining.",
            "This novel comes highly recommended as a cozy read, a genre I had not previously explored. Cozy mysteries are characterized by their avoidance of graphic violence, sexuality, and explicit language, and this book exemplifies those qualities beautifully."

            "This book utilizes a mosaic narrative structure, with each chapter spotlighting a different character and offering a multifaceted perspective of the spaceship hotel and its residents. While this approach reminded me of *The Ten Percent Thief*, I wished the hotel had been more prominent as a character itself. The central mystery of uncovering the dissenter behind the anti-Empire messages added intrigue, although the resolution felt predictable. Nevertheless, the engaging ending leaves room for a potential continuation, which I would eagerly explore to delve deeper into this world and its unresolved elements. The story's slow-paced, cozy tone might attract fans of relaxed sci-fi, but I found myself bored at times, perhaps due to not being in the right mood for this narrative style.",

His choice to say goodbye out of love, rather than condemning Kipple, reflects his inherent kindness and thoughtfulness. Central to the narrative is the theme of love, which enables characters to find joy and connection even in dire circumstances. The author employs a unique structure, dedicating each chapter to a different character, allowing readers to delve into their pasts, presents, and self-perceptions.

Set against a backdrop of a universe being systematically destroyed, the story examines humanity's destructive tendencies as it stretches across the stars. It delves into how capitalism has decimated the cosmos, governed by a dictator, where free speech is deemed an act of rebellion. Balancing a brutally dark narrative with moments of levity, the book focuses on the lives of colleagues aboard a spaceship called Home. Key themes include the cyclical nature of human folly, the resilience of chosen family, and the tension between survival and love in a harsh universe.",

Despite the harsh universe they inhabit, the story is ultimately one of hope, love, and the enduring strength of found family.",

Her debut novel, *Frontier*, came out in February last year, and I read it in July. My recommendation is to read *Frontier* and not this one.  \n\n- **Engagement and Readability:**  \n   - This book was a DNF (Did Not Finish) for me. I managed to get through 50 pages in one sitting, but after putting it down, I had no desire to pick it up again.  \n   - I found myself skimming from about page 30 because the author uses an excessive number of words to say very little.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n   - By the 20% mark, there was no hint of a plot emerging, which made me suspect there might not be one at all.  \n   - The narrative consists of a series of backstory character profiles that culminate in the characters ending up in the Floating Hotel, the titular setting.  \n\n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n   - A hotel on a spaceship doesn’t inherently make the story science fiction in my opinion. The setting felt like a painted backdrop rather than an integral part of the story.  \n   - Everything I read could have just as easily been set in 1920s Chicago without changing anything. For example, the pneumatic tube messaging system would fit better in that era than on an interstellar spaceship.  \n\n- **Comparison to Similar Works:**  \n   - I think this book is trying to emulate *The Spare Man* by Mary Robinette Kowal. If you liked that book, you might enjoy this one. However, *The Spare Man* was also a DNF for me, though for different reasons, and at least it had a plot.  \n\n- **Future Expectations:**  \n   - If Grace publishes another book, it will be a pass from me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel failed to engage me due to its lack of plot, excessive wordiness, and unconvincing science fiction setting.

It felt like a cozy sci-fi mystery, which was exactly what I needed.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and POVs:**  \n  The story is told through a rotating cast of characters, with each character roughly getting one POV chapter. This structure took some getting used to, but it worked incredibly well in fleshing out the setting—a hotel—and the major events happening within it.  \n\n- **World-Building and Depth:**  \n  While it’s not an overly complex or dense sci-fi novel, the world-building was impressively thorough and deep. Each character’s backstory contributed to painting a larger, more expansive universe.  \n\n- **Character Development and Arcs:**  \n  What stood out to me most was how satisfying the personal arcs were for each character. These arcs were sourced from multiple POVs, not always including their own, which I think is a mark of a talented writer. This approach was a step up from the author’s previous work, *Frontier*, where the different POVs didn’t always support each other as effectively.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  At first, I found the writing style a bit shallow, but as I read on, I came to appreciate its thoughtful pacing and deft minimalism.

I’m excited to see what else they can create!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful blend of cozy sci-fi and mystery, with a well-structured narrative, deep world-building, and satisfying character arcs.

However, as a disabled reader, I found the use of outdated and ableist language such as \"idiot,\" \"moron,\" and \"disfigured\" troubling. It was disheartening to see such terms in a book set hundreds of years in the future, as they imply a stagnation in the treatment and respect for disabled individuals.",

Rather than centering on a romantic relationship, it presented a broader narrative, featuring characters in various relationships without focusing on one couple's ups and downs.

The engaging plot was easy to follow, with memorable characters and settings that kept me eager to discover what would happen next.",

At first, I worried that the one-chapter focus on each character would limit their development, which I deeply appreciate in narratives. However, the author expertly integrates these characters throughout other chapters, enabling me to witness their decisions and growth, even when they aren't the central focus. This approach fosters a sense of connection among the characters and makes the ship itself feel more tangible.",

Although the story unfolds 800 years in the future, it resonates with elements of our contemporary world, notably in its enduring reflections on art and culture, including the lasting influence of Shakespeare.",

I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys cozies and is either seeking something with a bit more substance or wants to dip a toe into sci-fi. This is one that should appeal to a wider audience for that reason.  \n\n- **Format and Experience:**  \n  I originally picked this up as a hardcover before checking out the audiobook version. I love audiobooks for when I'm traveling, so this is a nice addition to my Audible library. It was nicely done, and it's one that I'm sure I'll listen to again.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a unique blend of cozy mystery and sci-fi, offering a fresh take on the genre that appeals to both cozy mystery enthusiasts and those curious about sci-fi. The audiobook version is well-produced and adds value to the overall experience, making it a worthwhile addition to any library.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Character-driven pacing takes precedence over action, focusing on the lives of employees and guests as they work to unravel the mystery of the \"Lamplighter.\" While the gradual revelation of the Lamplighter's identity adds intrigue, it ultimately feels underwhelming, lacking sufficient clues to make the reveal more satisfying. The conclusion offers some thrilling moments, yet unanswered questions suggest the potential for further exploration.",

The fact that it was published on my birthday felt like a sign to pick it up.\n\n- **Plot Structure:**\n   - The story lacks a traditionally structured plot and doesn’t focus on one or two main characters. Instead, it jumps between different characters aboard the Grand Abeona, with each chapter introducing someone new. Mysterious messages from a Lamplighter are interspersed throughout. While this might seem tedious, it somehow works.\n\n- **Setting and Cohesion:**\n   - The hotel itself acts as a common denominator, binding the story together. The lives of the characters intersect, especially in the second half, where connections become clearer. What initially seems like a collection of character backgrounds and random events becomes more layered as secrets are uncovered.\n\n- **Pacing:**\n   - The beginning is slower, but once you suspect something strange is happening on board, the story becomes much more intriguing.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - The book is heavily character-driven, with a large cast of characters. Despite their number, they are easy to keep apart, as many appear in multiple POVs. Some characters may feel stereotypical, and it’s not entirely believable that most love their hospitality jobs (which are far from easy), but I enjoyed spending time with this quirky group.\n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**\n   - Despite being set in the far future and in space, the book has a cozy feel, and the sci-fi elements are not overpowering.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Floating Hotel* is a unique and quirky cozy sci-fi story featuring a diverse group of misfits and a space hotel where more is happening than meets the eye.

            "The novel features a distinctive narrative structure, with each chapter narrated from a different character's perspective. The author skillfully balances fluidity and believability, allowing each voice to shine while maintaining the story's momentum. Delving into the minds of various characters is a delightful experience, providing fresh insights into familiar figures and introducing both unexpected and anticipated viewpoints. The pacing is leisurely, inviting readers to savor the unfolding tale while incorporating intriguing twists. Initially resembling \"cosy sci-fi,\" the story's complexity deepens as real stakes emerge, blending a comforting sense of security with tension. However, the resolution, while thematically satisfying, feels underwhelming; the mystery concludes predictably, aligning too closely with reader expectations rather than delivering a surprising or resonant finale. This lack of impact is particularly noticeable against the backdrop of the novel's otherwise excellent execution.",

            "This book is challenging to describe, as it feels more like an immersive experience. To fully appreciate it, you must lean back and allow yourself to be absorbed. The narrative primarily follows one character before shifting to another, with only one character receiving two story arcs. This structure takes some adjustment, but eventually, it becomes rewarding. It enables the author to explore a vast universe through the diverse perspectives of the hotel's staff and guests, each with their own unique backgrounds and stories. While there is an overarching plot that connects these individual narratives, it takes time to emerge and is not the main focus. Instead, this plot serves as a backdrop, motivating the characters’ actions and explaining why they are at the hotel. Ultimately, it acts as a vehicle for introducing us to a richly developed cast rather than being the story's central element.",

I want to ensure that the books I request are ones I genuinely want to read, as reading should feel like entertainment and a hobby, not a chore. In this case, the combination of \"cozy\" and \"sci-fi\" piqued my curiosity, so I requested a copy, which Hodderscape kindly granted.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  The book is hard to describe—it feels more like an experience. The best way to enjoy it is to lean back and immerse yourself. The narrative follows one character for a while before switching to another, with only one character getting to tell their story twice. This structure took some getting used to, but I ended up appreciating it. It allowed the author to showcase a vast universe through the perspectives of the hotel's staff and guests, each with unique backgrounds and stories.\n\n- **World-Building and Character Development:**  \n  The book excels at world-building by introducing us to a variety of planets, societies, and jobs through the diverse characters. The casual way this information is presented reinforces the sense of a vast, lived-in universe. The characters, who now feel like friends, are colorful and unique, and their individual stories are compelling.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  There is a larger plotline connecting the individual stories, though it takes time to become clear. This overarching plot isn't the main focus of the story but serves as a motivation for the characters' actions and behaviors. In some cases, it’s the reason they’re at the hotel in the first place. The plot acts more as a vehicle to introduce us to the rich cast of characters rather than being the central element.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a unique blend of cozy and sci-fi, offering a rich, immersive experience.

This layered narrative adds depth, though it occasionally leads to a fragmented feel, resembling a collection of backstory vignettes instead of a cohesive plot. The pacing is slow and deliberate, which may not resonate with readers seeking a faster tempo. While this leisurely development enriches the characters, it sometimes undermines the story's momentum. Additionally, the spy/assassin subplot contains several plot holes, and the final twist lacks the necessary buildup to be truly impactful. Despite these shortcomings, the overall concept is compelling, and the story remains enjoyable.",

I particularly liked Azard, who is a language expert.  \n\n- **World-Building and Plot Structure:**  \n  The novel feels almost like a collection of individual short stories that come together to build a larger political world. The found family, which is the crew of a hotel starship, adds depth to the narrative. The story includes an empire, aristocrats, spies, conspiracy theories, and a code to decipher, making it exciting to start a new chapter and discover a new character.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  The concept and writing style are interesting and will appeal to cozy readers as well as those who enjoy political intrigue and stories about oppressive governments.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**  \n  In my personal opinion, the story lacked tension, and I only felt it in the last chapter.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Although I’m not one hundred percent the target reader for this book, it was a refreshing new kind of read, and it was worth discovering this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a unique blend of character-driven storytelling, intricate world-building, and political intrigue. While the pacing and tension could have been stronger, the book is a refreshing and worthwhile read, especially for those who enjoy cozy yet thought-provoking narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The hotel is known for providing exceptional service to its guests, and the story revolves around its staff, led by Carl, the manager, who stowed away as a child and ended up there. The premise is intriguing and well-conceived, with a solid central mystery and some lovely moments throughout the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each member of the staff has their own backstory and secrets, which are gradually revealed as the story progresses.

This approach leaves little time to develop or deepen the reader's connection with the characters already introduced.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing suffers due to the extensive focus on individual backstories, which disrupts the flow of the main narrative. This structure made it difficult for me to become emotionally invested in the characters or the overarching story, despite the clever writing and intriguing premise.  \n\n- **Engagement and Emotional Connection:**  \n  The lack of sustained focus on the central plot and characters made it challenging to care about their fates or the story as a whole. While the book has its strengths, the fragmented structure ultimately hindered my ability to fully engage with the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Grand Abeona* boasts a fascinating premise, a solid central mystery, and moments of brilliance, its pacing and structure—particularly the extensive focus on individual backstories—detract from the overall experience. The slow introduction of characters and lack of sustained narrative focus made it difficult for me to connect with the story or its characters, which is a shame given the book's potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The tension is minimal, making it a relaxing read.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each chapter focuses on a different character, which I found frustrating. The frequent perspective shifts and lack of revisiting characters made them feel unmemorable and unrelatable.  \n\n- **Plot and Focus:**  \n  The story lacked a clear central problem or focus. Elements like the lamplighter and the mystery code felt underdeveloped, leaving the plot feeling surface-level and disjointed.  \n\n- **Engagement and Readability:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the novel was engaging enough that I read it in its entirety without skimming.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel offers a cozy, low-stakes experience with a unique space setting, its lack of character depth, unclear focus, and surface-level storytelling detract from its potential. Nonetheless, it remains a readable and enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The narrative structure’s use of multiple characters and perspectives effectively creates a sense of community within the hotel. However, this technique limits individual character development. The pacing is gentle and unhurried, allowing for a gradual unveiling of a deeper, darker plot beneath the surface. Yet, this slow reveal can feel drawn out at times, particularly when key plot points are predictable. Although the overarching plot is hinted at through foreshadowing, the pacing of these reveals can sometimes lag, diminishing the impact for readers who anticipate the outcomes. The emotional payoff is mixed; while individual chapters offer moments of catharsis, the overall emotional resonance is somewhat diluted by a lack of deep character investment.",
            "The characters are introduced as nearly fully formed, making them immediately memorable and distinctive. The grumpy linguistics professor stands out, for instance. However, the absence of recurring perspectives limits character development, which ultimately diminishes the emotional impact of the story’s conclusion.",
            "The hotel's world-building is impressive, showcasing detailed descriptions and the daily interactions among the crew. The pre-chapter snippets effectively enhance the broader galaxy's depth. However, once the narrative moves beyond the hotel, the world-building becomes less cohesive, leaving some questions unanswered and certain resolutions feeling hurried.",
            "This book skillfully examines themes of class and social change within the evolving context of a luxury space hotel. The nuanced exploration of class consciousness adds a compelling layer to the narrative, offering a refreshing perspective often lacking in space-set science fiction and fantasy.",
            "This book masterfully establishes a consistent and delightful atmosphere, reminiscent of Wes Anderson's films. Its whimsical, plinky-plunky quality captivates readers, even as the narrative shifts between various characters and plotlines. The cohesive backdrop is a standout strength, effectively uniting the story's diverse elements."

It has a whimsical, plinky-plunky quality that keeps the reader engaged despite the frequent shifts between characters and plotlines.\n   - The atmosphere is a major strength, providing a cohesive backdrop that ties the disparate elements of the story together.\n\n- **Structure and Pacing:**\n   - The narrative structure involves hopping between different characters and perspectives, which works well to build a sense of the hotel as a community. However, this approach limits the depth of individual character development.\n   - The pacing is gentle and unhurried, allowing the reader to gradually uncover a deeper, darker plot beneath the surface. However, this slow reveal can sometimes feel drawn out, especially when the reader has already predicted key plot points.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - Characters are introduced as nearly fully formed and are immediately memorable and distinctive. The grumpy linguistics professor is a standout example.\n   - However, the lack of repeat perspectives means that characters don’t develop much depth over time, which can make the emotional payoff at the end feel less impactful.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building within the hotel is excellent, with detailed descriptions of the space and the daily interactions of the crew. The snippets of pre-chapter text are particularly effective in adding depth to the wider galaxy.\n   - However, when the story expands beyond the hotel, the world-building feels less well-managed, with some questions left unanswered and some resolutions feeling rushed.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**\n   - The book subtly addresses themes of class and social change, particularly in the context of a luxury space hotel that has evolved over decades. This is handled competently and adds an interesting layer to the story.\n   - The exploration of class consciousness is more nuanced than typically found in space-set SFF, which is a refreshing change.\n\n- **Plot and Emotional Payoff:**\n   - The overarching plot is gradually revealed through hints and foreshadowing, but the pacing of these reveals can sometimes feel too slow, especially if the reader has already guessed the outcome.\n   - The emotional payoff is mixed; while there are moments of great catharsis within individual chapters, the broader emotional impact of the story is somewhat diluted by the lack of deep character investment.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**\n   - The book is compared favorably to Becky Chambers' Wayfarers series, particularly in its ability to create a sense of community and cohesion among its characters.\n   - It is also compared to Adrian Tchaikovsky's *City of Last Chances*, but with the advantage of feeling more tethered to its characters and their interactions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Floating Hotel* is a charming and atmospheric novel that excels in creating a vivid sense of place and community. While it has some rough edges, particularly in character depth and plot pacing, it offers a delightful reading experience for those who enjoy vibes-forward storytelling. The book’s subtle exploration of class and social change adds depth, and its unique structure sets it apart from more conventional narratives.

            "The novel showcases quirky characters, appealing to readers who enjoy stories set in apartment buildings filled with unique individuals. However, the romanticized portrayal of hotel work feels unrealistic; despite the challenges of confined spaces, limited family contact, and difficult guests, the characters appear to genuinely love their jobs. A stronger contrast with harsher working conditions elsewhere, such as those in terra-fracking companies, could have offered better context and justification for their job satisfaction.",
            "The tone occasionally feels inconsistent, which detracts from the overall experience. However, the enjoyable writing style and quirky characters make the book a fun read.",
            "The story unfolds in a universe dominated by a totalitarian government, rampant planetary destruction for mining, and various grim realities, but these elements lack a compelling resolution. In contrast, the Abeona, a boutique hotel in space, serves as a more appealing backdrop, offering a respite from the environmental degradation typically associated with cruise ships.",
            "The ending is subtle, hinting at future changes rather than providing a definitive resolution. While this approach is realistic, it leaves some readers feeling unsatisfied.",
            "Despite a few minor issues, my overall experience with the novel was positive; I found it engaging and entertaining.",
            "This book presents a vignette-style sci-fi narrative that evokes the charm of a quirky indie film. While some may argue for its classification as Cozy sci-fi, it contains darker elements, such as depictions of torture, spacing, and death, which complicate this designation."

        "conclusion": "Floating Hotel is a unique, vignette-style sci-fi novel with a quirky indie film vibe. While it has some dark moments that challenge its Cozy label, the narrative structure and character perspectives are engaging, though occasionally uneven. The world-building is rich but lacks a strong resolution, and the romanticization of work in the hotel feels somewhat unrealistic. Nonetheless, the enjoyable writing style and quirky characters make it a fun and entertaining read.",

Although Carl, the hotel manager, serves as the central figure linking these characters, he is not the main narrator. This approach weaves an intricate tapestry of interconnected stories but hampers the reader's ability to form deep attachments to any single character. While the central plot unifies the various storylines, its progression tends to be slow due to this narrative style.",

However, the frequent shifts in perspective hinder readers from building lasting connections with them. By the conclusion, I struggled to recall their names, and none left a lasting impression beyond the pages of the book.",

            "The plot centers on the Lamplighter, a mysterious figure revealing truths about the Emperor, with clues suggesting a connection to the Abeona. Told from multiple perspectives, each character adds depth to the unfolding mystery. The narrative flows smoothly, gradually revealing details, but the stakes seem low despite the backdrop of rebellion. The bittersweet ending weaves together the characters’ arcs and unveils the Lamplighter’s identity. Ultimately, the story prioritizes character development and their relationships over high-stakes action.",

Carl, the hotel manager, takes center stage as he genuinely cares for both the establishment and its inhabitants. While the diverse cast of crew and guests is engaging, they typically stay within their defined roles and lack deeper development. Nevertheless, their interactions create a dynamic akin to that of a dysfunctional family, making for enjoyable relationships throughout the narrative.",

            "Set aboard the Grand Abeona Hotel, a once-luxurious space hotel now in decline, this novel immerses readers in a richly detailed environment that juxtaposes the hotel's former grandeur with its worn back corridors. The atmosphere is cozy yet exhilarating, effectively blending softness with moments of tension. The narrative crafts a galaxy filled with interstellar travel and political intrigue, subtly hinting at the world beyond the Abeona without overwhelming the audience. The Lamplighter's actions and the conference's secretive code-solving further enrich the story, adding depth to its complexities.",

While the Lamplighter storyline is well-developed, the encrypted message feels underexplored and ultimately unresolved. Initially, the story has a calm, cozy, slice-of-life quality that I appreciated. However, this tone shifts dramatically toward the end, introducing darker themes of kidnapping, torture, and execution. Unfortunately, the conclusion felt rushed and left several major plotlines unanswered, particularly concerning the fates of key characters like Daphne, Sasha, and Ooly. The missed opportunity to fully explore the encrypted message storyline also suggests potential for a sequel that is never realized, leaving a disappointing gap in the narrative.",

Each character's individual narrative intertwines with the overarching themes of rebellion and mystery. Throughout the book, they experience significant growth, embarking on journeys of self-discovery, standing up for themselves, and finding a sense of belonging. The novel excels in representation, showcasing LGBTQ+ characters—including a non-binary character who uses they/them pronouns—as well as a blind character, a character with a stutter, and one who likely has autism.

            "The background of the evil empire is underdeveloped and lacks depth. The emperor comes across as distant, and the depiction of the empire's actions—such as strikes and environmental damage—feels cursory. Additionally, the setting resembles that of *Ancillary Justice*, another tale featuring a generic evil empire, which I found unenjoyable.",
            "For fans of cozy reads and light sci-fi, such as those by Becky Chambers, this book offers a pleasant experience and is better crafted than many in the genre. However, the saccharine tone and lack of grit left me unsatisfied, leaving me craving something darker and more intense afterward.",
            "The book's premise is both fun and intriguing: agents of an evil empire chase a rebel propagandist in a decaying luxury space hotel, creating an engaging mystery as readers try to identify the eclectic hotel staff member responsible. However, the story suffers from a lack of consistent conflict, making it feel more like a female-targeted sci-fi with lower stakes. I must admit I didn't guess the propagandist's identity, which added an unexpected layer of intrigue."

        "conclusion": "While *Floating Hotel* has an engaging premise and decent writing, its inconsistent tone, underdeveloped world-building, and lack of meaningful conflict make it a mixed experience. It may appeal to fans of cosy, mild sci-fi, but for those seeking depth and grit, it falls short. The mystery element is a highlight, though the overall execution leaves much to be desired.",

The emperor feels distant, and the empire's actions (e.g., strikes, environmental damage) are lazily described.  \n   - The setting feels derivative of *Ancillary Justice*, another book about a generic evil empire, which the reviewer did not enjoy.  \n\n- **Diversity and Representation:**  \n   - The book is self-consciously diverse, with a cast that includes a wide range of sexualities, races, and disabilities. However, this feels somewhat random and forced, as if the author is ticking boxes rather than integrating diversity organically.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Appeal:**  \n   - For fans of cosy reads and mild sci-fi (e.g., Becky Chambers), this book will likely be enjoyable, as it is better written than many others in the genre.  \n   - However, for the reviewer, the saccharine tone and lack of grit made it unsatisfying, prompting a desire for something darker and more intense afterward.  \n\n- **Mystery and Plot Resolution:**  \n   - The reviewer admits to not correctly guessing the identity of the propagandist, which adds a layer of intrigue to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Floating Hotel* has an engaging premise and decent writing, its inconsistent tone, underdeveloped world-building, and lack of meaningful conflict make it a mixed experience.

The exploration of their struggles and hopes for a better future is compelling. However, while the character backstories are richly developed, their current actions and behaviors are less prominent, creating a disconnect that makes it challenging to link their histories to the main narrative.

            "The book's unique structure, featuring nearly every chapter from the perspective of a different Abeona staff member, provides a well-rounded narrative.

I can’t understate how much I love the illustration.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Mood**  \n   - The book is as cozy as it’s marketed to be. It’s a feel-good novel with low stakes, making it a non-stressful read for 2024.  \n\n- **Plot**  \n   - The story is set on the Abeona, a hotel spaceship traveling through the galaxy. It’s a cozy place with great service, but it harbors many secrets. The plot follows the staff of the Abeona as they navigate their duties and the mysteries of their workplace.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Character Development**  \n   - The book’s structure is unique, with almost every chapter following a new character (a member of the Abeona’s staff) as they carry out their duties. While this approach makes the narrative well-rounded, it also prevents the reader from becoming deeply invested in any one character’s story. There are too many characters, and we spend too little time with each of them.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Prose**  \n   - Curtis is a technically skilled writer. The prose is easy to follow without being juvenile, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes**  \n   - The book is a cozy mystery, and it succeeds in being a low-stress, enjoyable read.  \n\n- **Adaptation Potential**  \n   - This story would make an excellent episodic miniseries, but its segmented structure makes for an awkwardly paced novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t feel fully invested in the characters due to the narrative structure, I can see why others might enjoy this cozy, low-stakes mystery.

            "The Grand Abeona Hotel stands as a tranquil refuge amid the galaxy's chaos, offering a comforting and immersive environment. The hotel's atmosphere is pivotal to the narrative, fostering a sense of community and acceptance where every guest has a unique story to share.",
            "The novel deftly explores political and social themes like imperialism, capitalism, environmental degradation, and xenophobia. Set against the backdrop of a tyrannical empire, the author critiques these issues while preserving a cozy tone that keeps them from overshadowing the narrative. The presence of queer and disabled characters feels organic and unforced, avoiding any reliance on homophobia or ableism as plot devices.",
            "Floating Hotel is a charming sci-fi novel that offers a cozy, observant, and warm reading experience. Unlike its predecessor, Frontier, which promised action but fell short, Floating Hotel thrives on its low-stakes, slice-of-life narrative. The story embodies the essence of cozy sci-fi, focusing on gentle, humorous mysteries with an almost complete absence of high tension."

        "conclusion": "Floating Hotel is a gentle and masterful piece of cozy sci-fi that marks a significant improvement from the author's debut. It excels in creating a warm, interconnected world with well-developed characters and subtle social commentary. The novel’s low-stakes, slice-of-life approach, combined with its immersive setting and thoughtful themes, makes it a standout in the genre. My faith in the writing has been fully restored.",

Instead of epic adventures, it emphasizes interstellar travel, a ragtag crew of spacefarers, and a slice-of-life narrative. The concept of a spacefaring hotel, reminiscent of an interstellar cruise ship, is both fascinating and unique.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Inspiration and Vibe:**  \n  The book strongly reminds me of Becky Chambers' *The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet* and its sequels. It aims for a similar cozy sci-fi vibe, focusing on interstellar travel, a ragtag group of spacefarers, and a slice-of-life narrative rather than epic adventures. The concept of a spacefaring hotel, akin to an interstellar cruise ship, is fascinating and unique.  \n\n- **Premise and Setting:**  \n  The story revolves around Carl, the manager of the Abeona, a luxury spacefaring hotel. The ship is his home, and he is deeply committed to maintaining it despite challenges like rising costs, wear and tear, and staffing shortages. The setting is rich with potential, featuring a variety of dramas among the staff and guests, including a science conference, government agents, a former pop star, and a small-time criminal turned chef.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  The book excels in capturing the laid-back, luxurious atmosphere of the hotel and its transient guests. I particularly enjoyed the interactions between the staff, the revolving door of lives, and the small-scale dramas, such as workplace romances and personal conflicts. The worldbuilding is grand and intriguing, with hints of a corrupt empire that adds depth to the setting.  \n\n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  The biggest issue is the overwhelming number of characters with POV segments. The constant switching of narrators prevents any single character from receiving enough focus or emotional resolution. This leaves numerous plot threads unresolved by the climax, making it difficult to feel invested in any one character. The story would have benefited from a tighter focus or being expanded into a series to give each character and subplot the attention they deserve.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Floating Hotel* is an enjoyable read with a unique premise and a cozy, slice-of-life vibe reminiscent of Becky Chambers' work. However, its attempt to juggle too many characters and subplots results in a lack of emotional depth and resolution.

            "The story is rich with intriguing mysteries, including enigmatic Shakespearean love letters, an illegal code being decoded, a hidden alien film discovered in the basement, and imperial spies among the hotel residents. The plot intricately weaves together the mysterious backgrounds of both staff and guests, leading to a sudden and almost heartbreaking conclusion. However, the narrative can feel convoluted at times, with numerous threads and details that may overwhelm the reader. The book features a heavy backstory, requiring attention to a lot of information, which occasionally complicates the plot's clarity.

            "The book features approximately 12 different points of view, each confined to a single chapter. This structure effectively allows readers to explore the characters and their interactions. However, the frequent POV shifts hinder a deeper connection with any individual character, as each chapter introduces someone new. While the two-week timeline suits the story, the narrative feels overcrowded with multiple mysteries and subplots, given its length. Consequently, the ending appears abrupt and rushed, as if it’s merely fulfilling a requirement rather than delivering a satisfying resolution.",
            "Each POV character has a backstory or secret that contributes to the overall mystery, adding depth to the narrative, though it can feel overwhelming at times. The diverse cast is a standout feature, although a few perspectives seem superfluous by the conclusion.",

            "The Grand Abeona Hotel, a once-elegant space cruise ship, now shows signs of aging, with its overstretched staff and a pervasive sense of weariness. However, the stunning and immersive setting elevates the narrative, making the ship itself a standout feature of the story.",

This structure worked well overall, allowing readers to learn about the characters and their interactions.  \n   - However, the frequent shifts in POV made it challenging to connect deeply with any single character, as each chapter introduced someone new.  \n\n- **Character Development and Backstory:**  \n   - Each POV character has a backstory or secret that ties into the overall mystery, which added depth but sometimes felt overwhelming.  \n   - The diverse cast of characters was a highlight, though some POVs seemed unnecessary by the end.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Complexity:**  \n   - The timeline of about two weeks worked well for the story, but the book felt overcrowded with multiple mysteries and subplots for its length.  \n   - The ending felt abrupt and rushed, as if it were merely ticking a box rather than providing a satisfying resolution.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre Expectations:**  \n   - The book is marketed as \"cosy,\" but the frequent POV shifts and some intense scenes (e.g., bathtub torture) make this label feel inaccurate.  \n   - The story has extremely low action and low stakes, which some readers might appreciate, but it doesn’t align with the cosy genre’s typical tone.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n   - Comparing the book to Becky Chambers’ *Wayfarers* series does it a disservice, as they are not very similar.  \n   - A better comparison would be *The Spare Man* by Mary Robinette Kowal, which also features a murder mystery on a cruise ship in space.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Appeal:**  \n   - The writing is addictive and engaging, making the book hard to put down.  \n   - The author’s unique storytelling approach, as seen in her debut novel *Frontier*, is evident here and adds to the book’s appeal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Floating Hotel* is a captivating read with a stunning setting and a diverse cast of characters.

However, the narrative subverts these expectations. Instead of a gentle tale, it delves into darker themes, delivering tense thrills that elevate the stakes. While there are hints of coziness, the story veers more toward a blend of slice-of-life moments and high-stakes political intrigue. As a soft sci-fi novel with a mystery element, the plot's mystery feels unevenly developed and resolved rather quickly. The found family dynamic resembles a close-knit group of coworkers rather than a traditional familial bond.

            "The story centers on Carl, who escapes his past to join a hotel at 12 and eventually becomes its manager 40 years later. The plot delves into the mysteries and dangers that jeopardize the hotel's future, influenced by events unfolding in the galaxy. Interludes about the Empire between chapters enhance the intrigue and depth of the narrative. However, the pacing is uneven, with some storylines feeling longer or less engaging than others. Additionally, the shifts between past and present can be jarring, and certain character perspectives seem disconnected from the main plot.",
            "The story presents a rich tapestry of characters, each offered a chapter that explores their origins and intricately woven storylines.",
            "The writing is clever, cozy, and whimsical, infused with moments of intensity. The tone remains charming, even during gut-wrenching scenes, skillfully balancing humor, introspection, and adventure. The phrase \"different folks, different strokes\" encapsulates the book's exploration of individuality within a societal context.",
            "The Grand Abeona Hotel is a luxurious spaceship that journeys through the galaxy, providing an unparalleled experience. This enigmatic hotel is steeped in mysteries and secrets, impacting both guests and staff alike. The vivid and whimsical descriptions offer a sensory feast, captivating the imagination with wondrous details. Intriguing elements, such as love poems delivered via the tube system and the Problem Solver's Conference, enrich the setting.",
            "This story intricately explores human nature, particularly our superiority complex and societal hierarchies. The hotel setting fosters a sense of belonging and creates a found family, infusing the narrative with warmth and contentment. With an intimate understanding of human behavior, the book skillfully blends charm, humor, introspection, and subtle ominous undertones."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Floating Hotel* is a cozy sci-fi novel with a whimsical flair and a deep understanding of human nature. While its lush descriptions and intriguing mysteries captivate, the uneven pacing and occasional disjointedness in the narrative structure may detract from the overall experience. Nevertheless, it is a charming and introspective story that balances humor, adventure, and ominous undertones, making it a unique and memorable read.",

            "The story is presented through a series of character-driven vignettes, a unique and engaging approach that I appreciated. Each chapter stands alone, focusing on an individual character, allowing me to explore the narrative at my own pace. This structure enhanced my enjoyment as I connected with the characters and their intertwined lives. The pacing is generally gentle and cozy, which I found delightful.

The setting of the Grand Abeona Hotel, a luxurious yet aging floating hotel, is majestic and serves as a perfect backdrop for the story. The comparison to Becky Chambers' works also drew me in, as I enjoy cozy sci-fi with a focus on character dynamics.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  The book is told through a series of character-focused vignettes, which I found to be a unique and engaging approach. Each chapter is essentially self-contained, focusing on an individual character, which allowed me to dip in and out of the story. This structure worked well for me, as I enjoyed getting to know the characters and their interconnected lives.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The characters are a lovable band of misfits and rogues who come together in a found family unit—one of my favorite tropes in fiction. I became deeply invested in their lives and relationships, and the gradual reveal of their backstories added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  For the majority of the book, the pacing is gentle and cozy, which I appreciated. However, around the 65% mark, the story shifts to a tenser, more high-paced mystery plot. While this shift was exciting, it felt abrupt and somewhat truncated, especially the ending, which left me wanting more detail and development.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Grace Curtis's writing style is beautifully flowing and immersive. I found myself eager to read on as the story unfolded, and the prose added to the overall charm of the book.  \n\n- **Ending and Potential for Future Stories:**  \n  The ending felt abrupt and left me slightly dissatisfied, as I wanted more resolution for the characters and the mystery plot. However, the open-ended nature of the conclusion leaves room for potential future stories, and I’m secretly hoping for a sequel to explore these characters further.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed *Floating Hotel*. Its unique narrative structure, lovable characters, and cozy sci-fi atmosphere made it a delightful read. While the abrupt shift to the mystery plot and the open-ended conclusion left me wanting more, the book’s charm and potential for future stories have me eagerly anticipating what Grace Curtis might write next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

            "This collection of short stories explores the intertwined lives of the hotel staff and its customers, fulfilling my expectations based on the synopsis. While most narratives captivated me, a few felt less engaging. The ending was particularly satisfying, solidifying Kipple—an irritable recluse with a secret fondness for the hotel and a knack for writing politically charged articles—as my favorite character, despite not having his own dedicated story. The pacing was excellent, gradually escalating the mystery and intrigue throughout the collection.",

Details about Ephraim's parents' construction jobs and Olly's real name weren't necessary. In contrast, the Appleseeds' espionage subplot and their complex relationship were captivating. Additionally, Daphne's transformation from a stuttering people pleaser to a confident waitress was a standout aspect of the story.",

As a huge Douglas Adams fan, I had fond memories of the game, which helped me through a difficult time in my life. I initially imagined the book as a “what if *Starship Titanic* had not crashed on its maiden voyage” scenario and was positively inclined toward it before even starting.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**\n   - The book is part space opera, part mystery, and a deep exploration of the lives and humanity of the people onboard the ship. The story is told through the voices of different characters, both staff and guests, as the ship voyages through space. This multi-perspective approach adds depth and richness to the narrative.\n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**\n   - The book raises thought-provoking questions about how we treat our planet, its resources, and its people. It highlights the disparities between the rich and poor, explores the lives of displaced individuals, and examines societal attitudes toward them. The parallels between the fictional world and real-world issues are cleverly drawn, making the story highly relevant to contemporary life.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Character Development:**\n   - The humanity within the pages of the book struck me the most. I felt deep empathy for the characters, some more than others, and the story touched me on an emotional level. The blend of tenderness, excitement, and thought-provoking moments made the reading experience truly memorable.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - The book exceeded my expectations and stood on its own merits, independent of my initial comparison to *Starship Titanic*. I thoroughly enjoyed the reading experience and felt like I had learned something meaningful by the end. I highly recommend *Floating Hotel*, even to those who might not typically read this genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Floating Hotel* is a beautifully crafted novel that blends space opera, mystery, and deep human exploration.

            "The story presents a slice-of-life narrative that feels at odds with its spaceship hotel setting. Much of the plot, including both present-day scenes and flashbacks, unfolds on land, resulting in a lack of a cohesive sense of place. The pacing is slow, causing me to lose interest several times in the first half, and I even contemplated not finishing it. I found myself skimming through the second half. While the mystery was initially intriguing, it was resolved rather loosely just four pages from the end. Additionally, a torture scene felt jarring and inconsistent with the established tone, which left me questioning the book's overall direction.",
            "While I enjoyed characters like Carl and Daphne, the frequent introduction of new main characters—one in every chapter except the last—made it difficult to connect with them or grasp their personalities. This lack of depth left me feeling distanced from most of the characters.",
            "I anticipated the hotel would be a prominent feature in the story, but it quickly faded into the background after the first chapter. Although the spaceship hotel setting started with great potential, it ultimately did not feel as central or relevant as I had expected.",

While I appreciated the slow-paced, character-driven slice-of-life elements and the hotel setting, the plot’s lack of continuity, underdeveloped characters, and inconsistent tone left me disappointed. The mystery resolution felt rushed, and the inclusion of a torture scene was jarring. If you approach this book with adjusted expectations—less whimsical, more thriller, and not cozy—you might enjoy it more.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Cover Design and Aesthetic:**  \n   - The cover is lovely and aligns well with the description of the Hotel Abeona at the start of the book.  \n   - The lyrical prose complements the cover's aesthetic.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot is a slice-of-life story, which feels mismatched with the spaceship hotel setting.  \n   - Much of the story (both present-day and flashbacks) takes place on land, leading to a lack of sense of place or continuity.  \n   - The pacing was slow, and I lost interest multiple times in the first half, even considering not finishing the book.  \n   - I ended up skimming the second half liberally.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Some characters, like Carl and Daphne, were enjoyable to read about.  \n   - However, each chapter (except the final one) introduced a new main character, and I barely got a sense of their personalities.  \n   - I didn’t feel connected to most of the characters.  \n\n- **Mystery and Resolution:**  \n   - The mystery aspect of the plot was intriguing but was resolved very loosely on the fourth page from the end.  \n   - I wanted more denouement and a stronger resolution.  \n\n- **Tone and Consistency:**  \n   - The inclusion of a torture scene felt out of place and didn’t fit the tone established earlier in the book.  \n   - This inconsistency made me distrust the book’s direction.  \n\n- **Setting and Relevance:**  \n   - I expected the hotel to play a larger role in the story, but it became a background element after the first chapter.  \n   - The spaceship hotel setting, while initially promising, didn’t feel as central or relevant as I had hoped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had potential, but it didn’t meet my expectations. While I appreciated the slow-paced, character-driven slice-of-life elements and the hotel setting, the plot’s lack of continuity, underdeveloped characters, and inconsistent tone left me disappointed. The mystery resolution felt rushed, and the inclusion of a torture scene was jarring. If you approach this book with adjusted expectations—less whimsical, more thriller, and not cozy—you might enjoy it more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The academic contest subplot felt unnecessary and could have been removed, despite Ooly being an interesting character. The ending was underwhelming and anti-climactic, featuring a confusing timeline that made events difficult to follow. While the story's premise was intriguing, the execution ultimately fell short. The conclusion was neither satisfying nor entirely disappointing, leaving many loose ends. Although the fate of the hotel is somewhat addressed, the characters' futures remain unresolved, suggesting a potential continuation. This lack of closure was disappointing, especially as readers hoped for more fulfilling resolutions.",
            "The story features a large cast of characters, each with detailed vignettes that reveal their backstories and how they arrived at the spaceship hotel. However, the main character, who lacks a backstory, is central to the mystery, which feels intentional yet ultimately unsatisfying. While most characters are likable, the frequent shifts between them make it challenging to keep track, particularly after the halfway point.",
            "The book failed to hold my interest, nearly prompting me to abandon it after 75 pages. While the initial premise and a few characters, like Carl, piqued my curiosity, the overall experience felt lackluster. I doubt I will revisit this book or read any potential sequels.",
            "While the book is marketed as science fiction, it falls short of delivering significant sci-fi elements. The technology feels more reminiscent of the 1950s than a futuristic society, relying on color-coded paper sent through tubes for communication. Additionally, medical advancements appear stagnant, despite the story's setting being over 800 years in the future."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Growth and Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  I was hugely excited to read *Floating Hotel* after having already devoured this author's 2023 debut, *Frontier*, which was a brilliantly quirky space western romp with lesbian gunslingers and drug-smuggling tortoises. But somehow, Curtis has surpassed herself with *Floating Hotel*.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  *Floating Hotel* is poignant yet funny, earnest and full of warmth but still with the sharp edge of pointed social commentary. It was everything I wanted in a contemporary sci-fi novel.  \n\n- **Genre and Structure:**  \n  Defying genre boundaries, it's a brilliant murder mystery intertwined with small moments and personal dramas, set aboard a roaming luxury hotel-spaceship (the Abeona, which is certainly a character in its own right). The novel is also a series of intimate character studies weaving in and out of the backstories of the ensemble cast of characters.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each character is written with depth and care. Even without the broader plot that draws them all together, I would have been content learning about them all and how they came to find a family and a home aboard this strange, wonderful ship.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and World-Building:**  \n  As I read *Floating Hotel*, I experienced the odd feeling of longing for a place I've never been. I won't spoil the ending, but I closed the book with that familiar heartache that means the author did one hell of a job of making me care.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  I'd highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys Becky Chambers (although *Floating Hotel* had more of an overarching plot than Chambers' more slice-of-life narratives), hopepunk, found families, and vividly imagined future worlds.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Floating Hotel* is a masterful blend of genres, combining a gripping murder mystery with intimate character studies and a richly imagined setting. It’s a poignant, funny, and heartfelt novel that left me deeply moved and longing for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the style and pacing of *Floating Hotel* may not appeal to everyone, I found myself instantly captivated. Similar to *Frontier*, the author's writing possesses a unique rhythm that I appreciate.

Much like *Frontier*, Grace Curtis's writing has a unique rhythm that I enjoy. The story is heavily character-driven, with individual stories that interact with each other on various levels. This approach kept me engaged, and I was a quarter of the way through the book before I even realized how much I had read.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book is heavily weighted toward character development, which I found to be a strength. Grace Curtis has a talent for creating compelling characters, and I enjoyed the way their stories intertwined. The themes of love, betrayal, and found family added depth to the narrative, making it both cozy and occasionally sharp, like \"razor wire that will occasionally snag you.\"  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The overall tone of the book is light, but it has darker edges that create a satisfying balance. This blend of tones allows the story to culminate in an ending that felt right and well-earned.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  My one minor gripe is that the ending felt slightly rushed. However, it left me with the impression that there could be more to explore with these characters in the future. I hope Grace Curtis returns to this world, as it would be a shame to see the door close on it for good.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Previous Work:**  \n  As a huge fan of *Frontier*, I found *Floating Hotel* to be similarly engaging. Both books share a sense of potential for further exploration, which might just be Grace Curtis's signature style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Floating Hotel* is a character-driven story with a unique blend of light and dark tones, exploring themes of love, betrayal, and found family. While the ending felt slightly rushed, the overall experience was highly enjoyable, leaving me hopeful for more stories in this world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 out of 5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

            "The ending was a bit disappointing; it felt rushed and lacked the depth I had hoped for. I wanted more exploration into the origins of the Lamplighter. I remember guessing who the Lamplighter would be at one point, but now I can’t recall the reasoning behind it, which is frustrating (though that's not a fault of the book). Upon reflection, I think it might have been Kippl warning Sasha about Flora. I was also confused about the backstory: does Caesar’s wife being 17th in line mean they were both connected to the emperor? If so, why did they leave and how did that happen? I wished for more development of the academic competition plot, as it felt somewhat abrupt. On a positive note, I appreciated the casual queer and disability representation, the themes of second chances, the found family dynamics, and the political critiques—though it’s disheartening how accurately they reflect future realities.",
            "I enjoyed how each chapter introduced a new character, allowing me to delve into their backstories. This approach was executed effectively and remained clear throughout, although I did find myself a bit confused by the intertwined plots of the pianist, Jean, and Renée, especially in relation to Uwade's storyline at one point.",

The final chapter, centered on Carl, provides some closure to his arc, although it falls short of being entirely satisfying.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations and Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  I loved Grace Curtis’s previous book *Frontier* and was excited to read this one. The idea of a cozy sci-fi novel intrigued me, but the book didn’t live up to my expectations.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The Floating Hotel is akin to a cruise ship on Earth, though it has become faded and run-down over time. Once the height of luxury, it now feels a bit tatty around the edges. The setting provides a sense of refuge and safety, which contributes to the cozy vibes of the story.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Character Development:**  \n  Each chapter is told from the perspective of an inhabitant of the hotel, including both guests and staff. The story begins with Carl, who sneaks aboard the hotel, setting the stage for other characters who are also running from something and find solace on the Grand Abeona Hotel. However, the narrative relies heavily on being character-driven, and I didn’t feel a strong connection to any of the characters. We don’t learn much about them, and there’s little development throughout the story, with the possible exception of Daphne.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  There’s an ongoing mystery involving the writer of anti-imperial leaflets, who may or may not be hiding on the hotel. This seemed like it would develop further in the second half of the book, but it ultimately fizzled out without much resolution.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Readability:**  \n  The book was an easy and pleasant read, making it a nice way to spend an evening. However, I had hoped for more from this author, given my enjoyment of her previous work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Floating Hotel* had an intriguing premise and a cozy atmosphere, it fell short in terms of character development and plot execution. The unresolved mystery and lack of emotional connection to the characters left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and the publishers Hodder and Stoughton for providing this ARC in exchange for my honest review."

            "*Floating Hotel* starts with a seemingly light premise, but it gradually evolves into a more intricate and perilous narrative. The story is presented through a series of character studies, with each chapter spotlighting a different crew member, their backstory, and their journey to the ship. While the early chapters evoke a pastoral atmosphere, they effectively foreshadow the darker and more complex themes that ultimately emerge.",

Each crew member is well-developed, with their unique stories enriching the narrative's depth.",

She takes familiar tropes, such as the Western in *Frontier* and the intergalactic cruise liner in *Floating Hotel*, and imbues them with nuance, complexity, and a sense of danger. Her work expertly balances whimsy and tenderness with more severe themes, including violence and abuses of power. The overall tone strikes a blend of lightheartedness enriched by an underlying edge.",

            "The characters are well-developed and believable. Although Carl, who takes on the role of hotel manager, has a few dedicated chapters, the narrative unfolds through the perspectives of several characters.",
            "The book is marketed as cozy, featuring charming elements such as Carl and the welcoming ship culture, the formation of a found family, and the heartwarming premise of a luxury interstellar hotel staffed by passionate, hardworking waifs. However, the presence of a dark, oppressive Galactic Empire and a sadistic agent who employs torture complicates the cozy classification. While the antagonist ultimately faces consequences, they are for murder rather than for their cruel methods, which undermines the overall coziness of the narrative.",
            "I anticipated that the book would center on Carl, the abused orphan from a mining planet taken in by the staff of the luxury hotel spaceship, the Grand Abeona.

Their intertwined stories collectively uncover the mysteries of both the hotel and the Galactic Empire."

Just as something engaging was unfolding in the present, the narrative frequently shifted to irrelevant flashbacks, making it difficult to invest in them.

While this puzzle-like structure is an intriguing idea, it ultimately fell short for me.",

The idea of exploring the lives of the crew members, each with their own messy and tragic backstories, was intriguing. It felt like a unique way to build a narrative, especially since only a certain kind of person would leave everything behind to work on an interplanetary spaceship.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book introduces the crew members one by one, which I initially enjoyed.

The story often switched to irrelevant flashbacks just as something interesting was happening in the present. This made it hard for me to care about the flashbacks because I was still preoccupied with the main plot.

While these sections were good for world-building and highlighting the found family dynamic, they felt disconnected from the main plot.  \n   - I enjoyed the story more when it returned to Carl and a few other main characters, as the vignettes of different characters made the story feel longer without advancing the plot.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n   - The world-building was well-done, especially through the different character perspectives. It helped me appreciate the setting and the dangers posed by outside forces.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n   - The plot felt slow at times due to the focus on multiple character vignettes. While the story eventually came together, I would have preferred more depth and progression in the main plot.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n   - Braden Wright, a new narrator for me, delivered a strong performance. His voices and emotional tones, particularly for Carl, were very effective.  \n   - I started listening at 1.3x speed and, after a couple of hours, adjusted to my usual 1.5x speed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Floating Hotel* is a charming story with strong world-building and a found family theme. However, the multiple character perspectives sometimes detracted from the plot's progression. The audiobook narration by Braden Wright was enjoyable and added depth to the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 hearts"

However, this book pleasantly surprised me, proving that Goodreads ratings aren’t always reliable.  \n\n- **Storytelling Style:**  \n  Grace Curtis’ *Floating Hotel* is less of a sci-fi epic and more of a character-driven exploration of a rebellion. The story is non-linear, told in a semi-anthological style reminiscent of *Lost*, with each chapter focusing on a different character, sometimes through flashbacks. These perspectives are interwoven into the main plot, creating a rich tapestry of interconnected narratives.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There is no single main character, though the story is bookended by one individual. Characters introduced in earlier chapters often reappear in supporting roles later on. At first, the connections between the ensemble cast—comprising both crew members and hotel visitors—aren’t immediately clear. However, as the story progresses, the political stakes and relationships become more intriguing. I personally enjoyed spending time with each character and their unique perspective, never feeling bored or disinterested.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The novel offers a cozy, character-driven exploration of a futuristic world grappling with a dissatisfied political structure and the seeds of rebellion. Once I adjusted my expectations and embraced the story’s unique approach, I was able to fully immerse myself in the world Curtis created.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIf you’re looking for a cozy, character-driven sci-fi novel that delves into political dissatisfaction and the beginnings of rebellion, *Floating Hotel* is worth a chance.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Theme and Tone:**  \n  The novel embodies a cozy, found-family theme, focusing on a group of misfits who come together to find home, connection, and belonging. This resonates deeply in today's world, offering a comforting escape akin to \"the red lipstick of the reading world.\"  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story revolves around solving a mystery, told through the shifting perspectives of various characters aboard the Abeona. While the plot is secondary to the exploration of relationships and belonging, it provides a compelling framework for the narrative.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are all damaged in some way, each searching for something unnamed—home, connection, or belonging. Their individual journeys and interactions form the heart of the story.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The Abeona, a luxurious yet complex spaceship, serves as a central character. Its opulent corridors and suites contrast with the hidden, seedy underbelly where the crew works to keep it operational. This duality adds depth to the setting.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  The book is recommended for fans of authors like Becky Chambers, Travis Baldree, and Aliette de Bodard, as it shares a similar focus on character-driven, cozy science fiction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFloating Hotel is a heartwarming, character-driven novel that explores themes of found family, belonging, and connection against the backdrop of a mysterious, richly detailed spaceship. It’s a comforting read that feels particularly resonant in today’s world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Just as you become immersed in one character's story, the narrative transitions to another, seldom revisiting the same perspective unless characters interact later on. The pacing feels uneven, with significant momentum building only in the final chapters. The ending rushes to a conclusion, leaving me wanting more.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Genre:**  \n  The novel, *Floating Hotel*, is described as a cozy sci-fi, perfect for fans of Becky Chambers. The setting of the Grand Abeona Hotel, a luxurious space hotel with an eclectic mix of characters, delivers on this promise.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story is told through multiple perspectives, with each character getting their own section. While this approach is interesting, it makes the novel feel more like a collection of vignettes rather than a cohesive narrative. This structure might have been more appreciated if it had been expected from the start.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book is not very long and reads quickly, which means there isn’t much buildup. This contributes to the vignette-like feel of the story.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The author, Curtis, does an excellent job of creating a diverse cast of characters, each with unique voices and perspectives. Each character is impactful and garners different reactions from the reader. However, despite the richness of the characters, I didn’t fully immerse myself in the novel, which sets it apart from Becky Chambers’ works.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential:**  \n  While I didn’t fully connect with the story on this read, I appreciate the richness of Curtis’ work and the depth of the characters. I remain hopeful that I’ll fall in love with the novel upon revisiting it in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Floating Hotel* is a cozy sci-fi novel with a unique narrative structure and a richly diverse cast of characters. While it reads more like a collection of vignettes and lacks the immersive quality of its comps, it remains a promising and impactful work that I look forward to revisiting.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

While the imaginative setting of *The Grand Abeona*, a once-trendsetting luxury cruise liner now in decline, is compelling, a lack of attention to detail in certain areas dampens immersion.

Their former lives and reasons for joining the hotel were fascinating, adding depth to their characters.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was decent, as the story frequently shifts between different points of view and narratives. However, this structure made it a little difficult to fully immerse myself in any one story, knowing it would switch to another in a few pages.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution:**  \n  Not all the individual storylines felt wholly wrapped up at the end of their chapters, though some further closure was provided at the end of the book.

            "The novel presents an episodic structure, with each character's journey resembling a standalone story. While this offers depth to the characters, it disrupts the overall flow and pacing. A more cohesive exploration of each arc might have enhanced the narrative without overwhelming the reader. Set in a universe under the control of an Emperor intent on manipulating his subjects' thoughts and actions, the story also highlights aristocrats exploiting the working class. Centered around a floating hotel that travels between planets, the diverse cast struggles to maintain operations in challenging circumstances. Although the fantastical setting is captivating, the plot suffers from an excess of character-driven subplots that scatter the narrative.",
            "The characters are well-developed and likable, each boasting unique stories that contribute to their engaging arcs. I appreciated how their personal journeys seamlessly intertwined with the main plot and the broader universe. However, the large number of characters and their individual narratives sometimes detracted from the central storyline.",

The emotional core is compelling, and the ending skillfully weaves together the characters' journeys with the central plot. However, the fragmented structure diminishes the emotional impact, making it challenging to remain fully engaged."

It might become a new favorite for me.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  - I really enjoyed the narrative style, which provided perspectives from different members of the ship's staff and guests. This approach gave insight into both the events happening on the ship and the backstories of how each character ended up there.  \n\n- **Character Development and Interconnectedness:**  \n  - The characters were wonderfully interconnected, and I loved how they came from diverse backgrounds but found a sense of belonging with each other. This mix of personalities added depth and richness to the story.  \n\n- **Mystery Element:**  \n  - The mystery element was well-executed, providing the story with a clear drive and direction. It also created a sense of unease that I found engaging and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Ending and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The ending was deeply melancholic. Carl’s realization that his relationships with people were more important than the hotel, which he had dedicated his life to, was both poignant and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a lovely and thought-provoking read that left me reflecting on its themes and characters long after finishing it.

The transitions to the past were seamlessly executed, providing essential backstories. I also appreciated the inclusion of archive entries and introductory chapters, which added a unique touch. Using past tense for backstories and present tense for current events was a fun and engaging choice. The plot was captivating, and I found all the characters compelling, eager to learn more about each of them due to their well-developed portrayals.

I wanted more insight into how each character would move forward and what actions Lamplighter might take, particularly regarding the empire.

Without a reason to care or something to root for, I found it difficult to stay invested.  \n\n- **Pacing and Patience:**  \n  As a reader who values immediate engagement, I found the pacing too slow. I’m not willing to wait through 3 or 4 or more POVs for the story to develop, which ultimately led me to stop reading (DNF).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel’s multi-POV structure and lack of early engagement made it difficult for me to connect with the story.

The central mystery of the rebel author is gradually unveiled and adds an intriguing element that culminates in a satisfying reveal at the end.",

While the heist sequence was dramatic and well-executed, it was abruptly abandoned without further development, leaving loose ends. The ending was confusing, as Carl appeared to abandon ship only to return shortly after, creating inconsistencies.

This book lacks the coziness and deep emotional connection I felt with Chambers' *Wayfarers* series.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The chapter structure (one per character) made it difficult for me to get to know or care about any of the characters.  \n  - In contrast, I felt a strong connection to the characters in the *Wayfarers* series (e.g., Sissix).  \n\n- **Editorial Quality:**  \n  - There were several editorial oversights, such as mismatched sonnet numbers, inconsistent spelling of a character's name (Ralf/Ralph), and odd phrases like \"the corner of the sphere\" and \"rub-pulversing hug.\"  \n  - A factual error about rats not having chins was also noted.  \n\n- **World-Building and Diversity:**  \n  - The world-building was interesting and well-developed.  \n  - The book featured a good amount of character diversity, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Naming Choices:**  \n  - I found the naming of characters and places (e.g., Lan Hydrock and Tywarn) jarring, as they closely resemble real locations in Cornwall. While most readers might not notice, it bothered me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  - The pacing was slow at the start, which made the abrupt ending feel unsatisfying. It didn’t deliver the big reveal I expected in a mystery; instead, it felt like the only logical conclusion left.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  - Apart from the editorial oversights, the writing was generally of a good standard and easy to read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had its strengths, particularly in world-building and character diversity, but it also had several flaws, including editorial oversights, jarring naming choices, and an unsatisfying ending.

While the characters’ feelings about their coworkers are mentioned, there’s not enough on-page interaction to truly show this dynamic.  \n   - The found family aspect is told rather than shown, which made it feel less impactful.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n   - The plot scaffolding is present but not strong enough to make the ending feel impactful.  \n   - The mystery element is intriguing, but I was never fully invested due to the lack of on-page action and tension.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The Abeona Hotel is a charming, decaying spaceship that serves as a home and refuge for its inhabitants, creating a unique and immersive setting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed *Floating Hotel* for its strong character development and unique setting. However, the slow pacing, underdeveloped plot, and lack of on-page interaction between characters left me underwhelmed. While the individual stories were engaging, the book didn’t fully deliver on the promised found family theme or the mystery’s potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the ending feels somewhat rushed compared to the deliberate pacing of the earlier sections, which focused on character introductions and world-building.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  While the initial pacing is slow and methodical, allowing for detailed character and setting exploration, the conclusion accelerates, leaving less room for resolution and potentially detracting from the overall balance of the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers a richly detailed setting and a diverse cast of characters, with a plot that gradually reveals its purpose. However, the rushed ending contrasts with the slower, more deliberate pacing of the earlier sections, which may leave readers wanting a more balanced conclusion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
