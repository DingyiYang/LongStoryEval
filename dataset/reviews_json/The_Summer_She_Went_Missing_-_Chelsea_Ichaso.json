The reviewer felt that the pacing and lack of distinct characters made the story drag.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were criticized as \"undistinct\" and unmemorable. The reviewer noted that the characters did not stand out, which contributed to the overall lack of engagement with the story.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery was described as formulaic and unengaging, following a repetitive pattern of \"first we talk to this person and then we talk to that person and then we put it all together.\" While there were a few twists at the end that were appreciated, the reviewer felt that the author struggled to build a compelling plot leading up to those moments. It seemed as though the twists were conceived first, but the journey to reach them was poorly executed.  \n\n- **Comparison to Similar Works:**  \n  The reviewer compared this novel unfavorably to *A Good Girl's Guide to Murder*, stating that the latter is \"actually good\" and suggesting that the author of this book could take notes from it.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite a few redeeming moments in the final chapters, the reviewer found the novel largely unenjoyable and felt that five solid chapters were not enough to redeem the entire book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had potential with its mystery premise and a few late twists, but it ultimately fell short due to slow pacing, undistinct characters, and a lack of engaging plot development.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  - The book failed to deliver a compelling mystery. Instead, it focused heavily on the romantic subplot between Dylan and Paige, which felt unnecessary and detracted from the main storyline.  \n  - The sense of urgency and suspense that should have been central to the mystery was lacking, even during moments of danger.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - The characters, particularly Dylan and Paige, were underdeveloped. Their romantic relationship felt forced and added little to the plot.  \n  - The teenage angst and relationship drama were overdone and made the characters less relatable.  \n  - The suggestion that Paige having a crush on Audrey instead of Dylan would have been more interesting highlights the dissatisfaction with the current romantic dynamic.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Humor:**  \n  - The dialogue was described as cringy and unnatural, failing to resonate with the reader.  \n  - Attempts at humor fell flat and came across as juvenile, making it difficult to connect with the intended young adult audience.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Authenticity:**  \n  - The book felt overly juvenile, even for a young adult novel, which was disappointing for a reader who is still within the target demographic (a university student).  \n  - The portrayal of teenagers felt inauthentic, as if the author didn’t understand how to write for or about them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel fell short of expectations, particularly in its execution of the mystery and character dynamics. The overemphasis on a poorly developed romantic subplot, coupled with unnatural dialogue and juvenile humor, made it difficult to engage with the story. While the premise had potential, the execution left much to be desired, resulting in a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The novel was a swift read, beginning with the summer a girl goes missing, then jumping ahead a year when the investigation has stalled and leads have gone cold. I appreciated the insights from 'The Girl's' perspective, which enriched the narrative and gradually unveiled a larger, more intricate story.",
            "In the story, Paige, the seventeen-year-old protagonist, occasionally exhibits bratty or naive behavior that can make her seem younger, almost like she's fourteen. Her jealousy toward Dylan feels excessive, and she frequently indulges in typical teen drama, which I found less engaging. However, it's important to remember that she is still young and inexperienced as an investigator.",

The balance of suspense, mystery, and emotional depth made it a standout read.\n\n- **Author’s Style:**  \n  Ichaso’s writing style was captivating and enjoyable.

Although the narrative is fast-paced, it is hindered by an abundance of implausible events crammed into a few days, which detracts from its realism.",

        "conclusion": "Overall, the novel offers an engaging premise with strong detective elements and a memorable plot twist. However, the unrealistic events and pacing issues detract from its overall appeal.",

While the pacing starts off slow, significant events pick up around page 60, at which point the suspense builds steadily as Paige and Dylan delve into Audrey's disappearance. The plot effectively maintains engagement by shifting suspicion among characters in nearly every chapter, and several surprising twists leave a lasting impact, keeping me constantly questioning Audrey's fate.",
            "The characters are engaging, yet their physical descriptions are somewhat lacking. Paige, Dylan, and Audrey each have distinct personalities: Paige is strong, independent, and fiercely determined to find her best friend; Dylan is angsty, protective, and deeply caring, particularly toward Paige; and Audrey is ambitious, stubborn, and embodies the traits of an overachiever. The presence of mistrust among certain characters adds depth to the narrative. The romance between Paige and Dylan is understated yet sweet, fitting well within the best friend's older brother trope. Dylan's protective nature and subtle gestures reflect his care for Paige, which nicely balances the plot's primary focus on mystery rather than romance.",

The lack of foreshadowing and the confusing narrative structure detracted from the overall experience. However, it wasn’t a horrible read, and I don’t regret picking it up.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This approach gradually unravels the mystery, and the pacing allows the truth to unfold in a satisfying manner. However, the resolution leaves something to be desired, as I wished for more insight into how the characters move forward after the summer's events. The novel has a vibe reminiscent of a teen slasher film, though it steers clear of horror, focusing instead on the intriguing transformation of a good girl from a respectable family into someone secretive who ultimately disappears. Driven by hidden objects, questionable actions, and the disappearance of another girl, the story adds depth to the mystery. Packed with unexpected twists and turns, it offers a high-energy reading experience. The enigma surrounding Audrey—whether she fell victim to a con, witnessed something alarming, or encountered a predator—keeps readers guessing.

            "The plot minimally emphasizes character development and features little teenage angst or romance. It centers on Paige and her family as they spend summer with their affluent friends, the Covingtons, in Clearwater Ridge. The town is split between \"vacationers\" and \"locals,\" and the story is propelled by the mysterious disappearance of two girls—one local and Paige's best friend, Audrey. A year later, Paige and Dylan delve into Audrey's case, revealing a tangled web of lies and deceit. The twist is effectively executed, adding an enjoyable surprise that enhances the thriller aspect of the story.",

            "The characters in the story are generally mediocre, with Audrey being the only one who genuinely stands out. Paige, the main character, seems more preoccupied with her faltering relationship with Dylan than with the mystery of her missing best friend, Audrey, which diminishes her appeal. Their dynamic feels lackluster, as their personal issues are treated with equal importance to the central mystery, undermining the story's sense of urgency.",

However, the rushed ending and complexity of the character pool made the experience less satisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐️ (rounded down) – with special praise for Amy McFadden’s narration! 👏  \nThank you to NetGalley, RB Media, & Tantor Audio for the opportunity to listen to this audiobook ARC in exchange for my honest thoughts."

The narrative could have been more impactful if it had been condensed into a single summer.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing was solid, and the interplay between Paige and \"The Girl\" filled in gaps while ensuring narrative coherence. However, the fairy tale-like “one year later” conclusion felt overly neat and did not resonate with me.",
            "Paige, the main character, can be frustrating due to her insecurities, hasty conclusions, jealousy, and unwarranted distrust of Dylan, making it difficult to sympathize with her. Yet, her bravery—sometimes misguided—and fierce loyalty add depth to her character. I appreciated how both Paige and Dylan make mistakes and erroneous assumptions, which significantly impact the story's outcome.",

The romance between Paige and Dylan is subtle, allowing the mystery to remain the story's central focus.",

            "This story follows lifelong best friends Paige and Audrey, whose lives are shattered by Audrey's mysterious disappearance. As Paige teams up with Audrey's brother, Dylan, to uncover the truth, the plot thickens with the introduction of Madison Blake, a con artist linked to both Audrey's disappearance and her own past. The mystery is captivating, keeping me engaged throughout, although the ending felt a bit questionable, yet not entirely implausible. The pacing is solid, with Madison’s storyline standing out as the most compelling element. While the friendship between Paige and Audrey didn't resonate as strongly, the overarching mystery was enough to keep me hooked.",

            "The book features chapters focusing on “the girl,” whose narrative aims to parallel those of other missing girls to build suspense. However, this approach reduces the victims to indistinguishable archetypes—girls who grapple with ‘bad staff,’ have a fondness for horses, and date wealthy boys. This lack of individuality undermines the emotional resonance of their stories. While the novel presents an intriguing teen thriller that explores the conflict between the privileged (incel-turned-serial killers) and the marginalized (con artists and grifters), its execution ultimately fails to make the narrative compelling.",
            "I found it difficult to connect with or invest in the characters. The villains' motivations were vague, and the reasons behind the disappearance of the main girl were equally unclear. Additionally, the relationship between the lead couple felt underdeveloped; they broke up off-page and reconciled within a chapter, which made their dynamic feel rushed and unconvincing."

However, I found it odd that the main character became angry with her love interest for something she had done herself just a chapter earlier; this felt more like forced drama than meaningful character development.

However, each person plays an important role in how the story evolves, which made them integral to the plot.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The chapters titled *The Girl* were particularly gripping and kept me on the edge of my seat. I had so many guesses about who the girl could be, and this element was a great addition to the book.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The story is heavy and suspenseful, but there’s also a blooming romance between two characters that added a bit of fun and lightness to the overall tone.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you’re looking for a compulsive thriller with a touch of summer romance, I definitely recommend picking this book up!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a compelling thriller with a complex plot, well-developed characters, and unexpected twists. The addition of a romantic subplot adds a refreshing layer to the otherwise intense narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It seemed so stupid of her to not bring anyone in on what was happening.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  I didn’t mind the romance in this book. I think it was handled well, though it could have been developed a bit more.  \n\n- **Mystery and Evidence:**  \n  I think the evidence portion of the story could have been more detailed. Maybe I just struggle with solving mysteries, but I felt like there wasn’t enough to work with.  \n\n- **Suspense and Predictability:**  \n  The killer wasn’t really a shock to me. The story pointed fingers at so many people that it started to lose its impact and meaning.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I think this was a good book, but the twist involving the missing girl didn’t work for me. The romance was enjoyable, though it could have been expanded, and the mystery aspect felt a bit lacking in evidence. The suspense was diluted by the overuse of red herrings, making the reveal less impactful.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Since the book only takes place in the summer, we never see Paige at work being influenced by or connecting with the elders. It felt like a forced attempt to give her personality, as without it, she’s only defined by her crush on Dylan.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  It’s not a bad summer beach read, but there’s nothing terribly compelling here.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book isn’t bad, it falls short compared to Chelsea Ichaso’s other works.

It felt underwhelming and didn’t leave an impact.  \n\n- **Character Development (Main Character):**  \n  The main character annoyed me to the point where I couldn’t root for her. Her constant questioning and doubting of the people around her, including the guy and her best friend, made it hard to connect with her or understand her motivations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book fell short for me due to its slow pacing, unengaging plot, and an unlikeable main character. The audiobook narration also detracted from the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I really loved *That’s Not My Name*, so when I heard this book was similar, I got excited. However, I quickly realized this book felt too YA for my liking and came across as overly childish.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  My enjoyment of *That’s Not My Name* set a high bar, and I hoped this book would deliver a similar experience. Unfortunately, it didn’t meet those expectations.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  I ended up not finishing the book (DNF’ed) because it didn’t resonate with me. The tone and style felt too immature, which made it hard for me to stay engaged.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this book due to its comparison to *That’s Not My Name*, it ultimately fell short for me. The overly childish tone and style made it difficult to enjoy, leading me to stop reading it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story centers on Paige Redmond and her family, who vacation at the Covingtons' home every summer. Tensions rise when Audrey Covington, Paige's best friend, begins to act erratically and eventually goes missing. Meanwhile, Madison Blake, a local town resident, also disappears but is quickly dismissed as a runaway due to her history of conning men. Determined to uncover the truth, Paige teams up with her crush, Dylan (Audrey's brother), to investigate Audrey's disappearance.\n\nThe narrative unfolds over two summers, with the first focused on Audrey's vanishing and the second on the ongoing investigation. As the search drags on, the relationship between Paige and Dylan becomes strained. Ultimately, they take matters into their own hands, solving the mystery themselves and confronting a villain introduced at the first summer party.\n\nWhile the resolution provides some satisfaction, it feels heavily reliant on Paige and Dylan's amateur sleuthing and is undermined by a lack of adult involvement or law enforcement, making the plot less believable. A key twist reveals that Madison faked her death and adopted a new identity—a contrived turn of events. Additionally, Audrey is found to have been kidnapped and held captive for more than a year with Madison. Though the final revelation resolves the story, it is riddled with coincidences and lacks logical consistency, notably in Madison's decision to remain in the same small town.",
            "Paige emerges as a determined and resourceful leader in the investigation, while the enigmatic character of Audrey, marked by her moodiness and eventual disappearance, propels the plot forward.

The amateur sleuthing by Paige and Dylan feels forced, and the resolution relies too heavily on coincidences. Despite these flaws, the story kept me entertained, earning it a 2.5-star rating, rounded up for its nostalgic resemblance to other works I enjoy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars (rounded up to 3 stars)."

            "The protagonist is an insecure teenage girl who struggles with her self-worth, feels that her crush isn't interested in her, and believes other girls are more attractive. While her lack of assertiveness can be frustrating, it only occasionally shines through when she grapples with vague notions of morality. This well-worn trope feels uninspired. Additionally, her relationship with her best friend is troubling; despite being mistreated, the protagonist remains unwaveringly loyal, which seems unrealistic and fosters unhealthy dynamics. This portrayal undermines the complexities of young women's relationships."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The novel falls short in its portrayal of the protagonist and her relationships, relying on overused and uninspiring tropes. The insecure teenage heroine and her toxic friendships do little to empower or represent young women in a meaningful way.",

Her lack of backbone is frustrating, except when it comes to vague notions of \"doing the right thing.\" This trope feels overused and uninspiring.  \n- **Relationships:**  \n  The protagonist's relationship with her best friend is problematic. Despite being treated poorly by her best friend, she remains endlessly loyal, which feels unrealistic and perpetuates unhealthy dynamics. This portrayal does a disservice to young women and their relationships.  \n- **Representation of Young Women:**  \n  The novel relies on tired and outdated tropes that fail to empower or accurately represent young women. The protagonist's insecurities and lack of agency, combined with her loyalty to toxic relationships, reinforce negative stereotypes rather than challenging them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel falls short in its portrayal of the protagonist and her relationships, relying on overused and uninspiring tropes. The insecure teenage heroine and her toxic friendships do little to empower or represent young women in a meaningful way.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
