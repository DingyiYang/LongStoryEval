The couple maintains a secret relationship to avoid the scrutiny of the heroine’s father. To keep up appearances, the heroine goes on a date with another man, but nothing develops between them.

The father employs a particularly attractive assistant, whom he dislikes, resulting in a repetitive cycle of secret affairs and pizza orders that occupy much of the narrative. The plot concludes on an ambiguous cliffhanger, leaving readers uncertain about whether to continue the series.

Far from the typical mafia archetype, he is charming and emotionally invested, treating Scarlett with both respect and passion. \n\n**Dante (Scarlett’s father):** As a protective figure, Dante disapproves of Axel and Scarlett’s relationship, introducing tension and conflict.

            "I’ve always been a fan of dual POVs, and this story leaves me wanting for nothing. However, the cliffhanger had me screaming for the next book! I absolutely loved how, when Axel was forced to break things off, she didn’t believe him because she knew better. Her confession to Dante took me by surprise—I honestly didn't see that coming. I found myself frustrated with her for remaining oblivious to Axel, even though I understood her feelings. ",
            "I absolutely adore Axel. He's charming, fun, and nearly perfect—everything I look for in this genre. Their connection is sweet, and Axel's reactions to Scarlett are incredibly endearing. I empathize with him, especially given his troubled relationship with his parents; I admire his decision to stand by them, despite their failures. However, I was disappointed when Scarlett began to doubt Axel after seeing him with another woman, believing he would choose someone ‘better.’ My heart shattered at that moment. From the start, I found Dante suspicious. The way he treats Scarlett raises questions about whether he genuinely wants her to succeed him. It feels like he isn’t adequately preparing her for that future.",
            "I absolutely adore the forbidden romance trope. The recurring line, \"like a date, not a daughter,\" along with his possessive \"I've got plans for her,\" effectively underscores the tension in their relationship. It's intriguing how he shelters her, leaving her unaware of his true identity and the extent of his actions—she remains blissfully oblivious to so much.",
            "What a thrilling experience! I anticipated loving this story and falling for Axel, and I wasn't disappointed. It was an enjoyable, effortless read filled with playful banter and the enticing forbidden romance trope that I adore. The fast pacing and steamy moments kept me engaged, and I found myself rooting for this couple no matter the obstacles. Overall, I had a fantastic time reading this and can't wait to see how they reunite."

        "conclusion": "This novel was an exhilarating and emotionally charged read, blending a forbidden romance trope with fast-paced storytelling, compelling characters, and a gripping cliffhanger.

Despite these minor frustrations, the book was a thoroughly enjoyable experience, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next installment.",

            "The cliffhanger ending was satisfactory, but the book requires substantial revisions in narration, sex scenes, and body image representation. The story shows promise, particularly with the portrayal of the father as manipulative yet not entirely monstrous—a refreshing take in Mafia literature. While the storyline is decent, these flaws prevent it from fully shining, though it still deserves some stars for its potential.",

            "\"Pretty\" has quickly become my favorite nickname. The chemistry between Scarlett and Axel is electrifying, and I thoroughly enjoy the author's approach to writing their spicy moments. These two criminals struggle to contain their attraction, only to have it shattered by an evil father. The story unfolds from a dual perspective, but it leans more heavily on Axel, the male main character, which I appreciated. Scarlett, the female lead, is deeply committed to making her father proud, feeling a strong sense of obligation after being raised by him as a single parent. Meanwhile, Axel has faced numerous challenges and discovers trust and belief in himself through his connection with Scarlett.",

            "The author excels at crafting emotionally evocative characters—some endearing, others infuriating. Axel starts off as cocky and arrogant, but as the story unfolds, his complexity transforms him into a deeply sympathetic figure.

I hope she comes to understand the importance of pursuing her own happiness and passions instead of merely fulfilling her father's expectations.

However, I found Scarlett a bit naïve, considering she grew up with a drug-dealing kingpin as a father.

I hope to see Scarlett develop more strength against her father in the next book, as she appeared to be gaining some confidence by the end of this one."

She seemed to know that her dad was a bad guy but also didn't think he was capable of doing bad things.\n  - I am hoping that Scarlett gets more of a backbone against her father in the next book, as it seemed she was starting to at the end of this book.\n\n- **Plot and Logic:**\n  - I did not understand why she told the guys that she was dating (even the hinge date she went out with once) that her dad was a drug dealer. That's usually something you keep quiet so that no one gets arrested.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**\n  - I listened to the audiobook of this from Netgalley. I think that both narrators did a good job but would've liked Axel's narration to be a bit rougher sounding.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I enjoyed this book and will definitely be reading the next one immediately.

I am very familiar with mafia documentaries, thanks to my partner’s deep love of learning about gangs and organized crime. My assumption is that this is mafia-light for the genre, as it places far more emphasis on the romance and smut.\n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**\n   - This was a fast and amusing read. The main characters' (MCs) chemistry is easily felt, and I loved their banter.\n\n- **Narration Quality:**\n   - The narration was good as a whole. However, I did think the female lead’s persona provided by the narration was a bit off; the way she was voiced made her seem more flippant than her character truly was. This wasn’t a huge deal, but I noticed it several times throughout the listen.\n\n- **Series and Availability:**\n   - This is the first book of the Betrayal series. I’m on the lookout for book 2’s audiobook. The ebook/print books are already available for books 1-3 as of 4-22-24.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**\n   - Audiobook ARC: thank you NetGalley, Penelope Sky, and Dreamscape Media.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this was an enjoyable and fast-paced mafia romance with strong chemistry between the main characters. While the narration was generally good, the portrayal of the female lead felt slightly off at times.

Her father, a billionaire, is both kind and oppressive—working her tirelessly without pay. This dichotomy paints her as somewhat naive and passive. The introduction of her father's business partner introduces a secret romantic subplot, but their relationship quickly becomes fraught when the father threatens to kill the partner's father to keep him at bay.

This choice of language doesn’t align with traditional notions of masculinity or strength.  \n\n- **Ending and Pacing:**  \n  The book ends on a cliffhanger, which adds suspense but may leave readers feeling unresolved.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started strong and had an intriguing premise, it lost momentum midway. The character dynamics, particularly the father-daughter relationship and the romantic subplot, were compelling but occasionally frustrating. The dialogue choices for the male lead felt inconsistent with his character. Despite its flaws, the series picks up later, and the cliffhanger ending keeps readers curious.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The book feels incomplete and seems designed to push readers toward purchasing the next installment, which left me disappointed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story kept me hooked until 3 a.m., as I couldn’t put it down. The dynamic between Axel and Scarlett is electric, and their romance has a sweet yet intense start. The tension with Dante, Scarlett’s possessive father, adds a layer of suspense and frustration, making me eager to see his eventual downfall.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Axel is portrayed as the epitome of sexiness—dominant yet submissive, allowing Scarlett to take charge without pushing her. His kind heart and level head, despite his painful past with his ex and family, make him a deeply sympathetic character. Scarlett is a humble and determined beauty, fighting to earn her place in her family business. Their chemistry is palpable, and they move in sync as if they’ve been together for years. Dante, on the other hand, is a deeply flawed and manipulative character whose possessiveness over Scarlett is both scary and infuriating.  \n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**  \n  The romance between Axel and Scarlett is steamy and intense, with sex scenes so hot they required breaks to process. Their connection feels authentic and deeply emotional, making their relationship the heart of the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Penelope’s writing continues to impress, with each book getting hotter and the characters becoming more captivating. The pacing is excellent, keeping me engaged and eager to read “just one more chapter.”  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story evoked strong emotions, from the frustration and disgust with Dante’s behavior to the desire to protect and root for Axel. The ending left me impatiently waiting for Book 2 to see how the unresolved conflicts, particularly Dante’s schemes, will unfold.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a thrilling and steamy read, packed with intense romance, complex characters, and a gripping plot. The chemistry between Axel and Scarlett is electric, and the tension with Dante adds a layer of suspense that keeps you hooked. Penelope’s writing is as captivating as ever, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."
