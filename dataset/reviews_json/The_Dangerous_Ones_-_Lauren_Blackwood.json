            "The relationship between Jerusalem and Alexi is troubling. Jerusalem often resorts to physical and verbal aggression towards Alexi, who endures it without retaliating. This dynamic feels abusive, highlighting a stark contrast between Alexi's unwavering love and Jerusalem's hostility. This aspect of the story was disappointing and diminished my overall enjoyment of the book.",
            "The modern language employed by the characters, particularly Jerusalem, undermines the 1863 setting. Terms like \"dumbass,\" \"stank-ass,\" \"cute-ass,\" \"fancypants,\" and \"hella\" feel out of place, as do references to contemporary concepts like thread count and concussions. While this choice may have been intentional, it ultimately detracts from the story's authenticity and disrupts immersion in the historical context.",
            "The story's premise is captivating, seamlessly intertwining historical events like the Civil War with supernatural elements, including vampires, werewolves, and humans with extraordinary abilities. The romantic subplot enhances its allure. The main characters, Jerusalem—a Saint with supernatural powers—and Alexi, a 3,000-year-old vampire, are engaging, united by their common foes and distinct backgrounds."

        "conclusion": "While the novel's premise is creative and engaging, the execution falls short due to the jarring use of modern language and the portrayal of an unhealthy relationship dynamic. The historical fantasy elements and romantic subplot had potential, but the immersion-breaking language and problematic character interactions made it difficult to fully enjoy the story.",

Jerusalem's continuous verbal abuse towards Alexei, despite his protective nature and frequent declarations of love, undermines their relationship. While her trauma with vampires is understandable, her constant insults diminish her character's sympathy. Similarly, Alexei's excessive expressions of love make him seem one-dimensional, as his character is overly fixated on Jerusalem.",

            "Set against the backdrop of the Civil War, this story weaves supernatural elements like vampires and Saints into its historical narrative. The inclusion of the Underground Railroad and the Union army adds depth, though some aspects of the Underground Railroad could have been more fully developed. The premise of Jerusalem, a Saint on a quest for revenge against the vampire who murdered her family, is both compelling and unique.",
            "Jerusalem, the protagonist, boasts a strong and engaging character arc; however, some secondary characters lack depth. Expanding their backstories and relationships would have heightened the emotional impact. Additionally, the romantic subplot between the main characters pales in comparison to the more heartfelt and genuine romance of their friends.",
            "The use of pet names between the main characters was often confusing and, at times, unsettling. While shortening names can be endearing, some of the nicknames felt inappropriate or even creepy. Additionally, the title, *The Dangerous Ones*, carries an ominous tone but fails to connect clearly to the story's conclusion, leaving me questioning its relevance.",
            "The concept of Saints—individuals endowed with enhanced strength, reflexes, and endurance—was intriguing but needed more backstory. Additional details about their origins, purpose, and history would have enriched the narrative. The creative twist of incorporating vampires into both sides of the Civil War conflict was compelling, yet their motivations and societal dynamics warranted further exploration.",

        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Dangerous Ones* is a quick and enjoyable read with a unique blend of paranormal and historical fiction.

The title and some aspects of the writing style were slightly confusing, but the novel remains a solid choice for fans of YA paranormal fiction.",

While I understand this is a YA novel, the modernization didn’t work for me and impacted the story and characters negatively.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The structure of the book didn’t resonate with me. The time jumps disrupted the flow and made it harder to stay immersed in the narrative.  \n\n- **Action and Fight Scenes:**  \n  I did enjoy the fight scenes, which were well-executed and added some excitement to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Dangerous Ones* had an intriguing premise and some enjoyable action sequences, it ultimately missed the mark for me.

However, the character development is insufficient, leaving readers feeling as though they are stepping into a sequel rather than a standalone story. While flashbacks to their pasts offer some context, they do not adequately clarify the characters' motivations or relationships.",
            "The use of modern slang such as \"minute,\" \"hella,\" and \"fancypants\" feels jarring in the Civil War setting, undermining the historical authenticity. Additionally, Jerusalem's language is inconsistent; while slang appears in dialogue, it is not consistently reflected in the narration, which disrupts immersion and makes the story harder to follow.",

The narrative follows Jerusalem, a \"Saint\" endowed with demi-god-like powers, as he escapes slavery and embarks on a quest for revenge. The incorporation of the Underground Railroad and the mission to liberate Black slaves enriches the storyline, adding significant depth to the overall plot."

It was a lot of chatting and not a lot of action.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I liked the writing and will definitely be checking out Blackwood's other books.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Much love to NetGalley & Macmillan Audio for my ALC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the novel was intriguing and unique, blending historical fantasy with paranormal elements during the American Civil War, the execution fell short for me due to its heavy focus on dialogue and lack of action. That said, I enjoyed the writing style enough to explore the author's other works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "The story suffers from uneven pacing, featuring excessively long chapters—one stretches to 41 pages, or over an hour in the audiobook—which disrupts the flow. Frequent point-of-view switches within chapters, alongside flashbacks, contribute to a disjointed and confusing narrative. Key events, such as Jerusalem's encounters with the Saints and Alexi, are presented as flashbacks rather than in real time, undermining character and relationship development.",
            "In this story, Jerusalem's impulsive behavior seems inconsistent with her traumatic past as a former slave. Her dialogue, filled with modern slang and repetitive phrases (like “dumbass” and “smartass”), feels anachronistic for 1863 and detracts from her character's depth. Alexi, a 300-year-old vampire who is eternally 18, has a narrator's voice that feels overly mature, leading to awkward and uncomfortable interactions with Jerusalem. The side characters lack development, appearing disposable and adding little to the narrative. Even the main villain feels one-dimensional, with insufficient backstory to make her compelling. Additionally, the romance between Jerusalem and Alexi is forced and underdeveloped; their interactions, often delivered through flashbacks, lack authenticity. Alexi’s obsession with Jerusalem comes off as toxic rather than romantic, further weakening their relationship.",
            "The world-building in this story is lacking, offering minimal insight into the magical system and the origins of vampires and Saints. Key questions, such as the reasons behind vampires' arrival in America and the source of Saints' powers, remain unanswered. Historical elements, including the Underground Railroad, are poorly integrated, often overshadowed by unnecessary jokes and lengthy, irrelevant discussions. The use of modern language, such as \"reparations,\" in a Civil War setting is jarring and disrupts immersion. Overall, the historical context feels under-researched, with only superficial references to significant events like the Battle of Gettysburg and figures such as Lee and Grant.",
            "*The Dangerous Ones* presents an intriguing premise, merging the Civil War era with vampires and demi-gods. It evokes comparisons to *Lincoln: Vampire Hunter* and *Dread Nation*, both of which effectively reimagined historical events through a supernatural lens. While the concept of vampires backing the Confederacy and Saints supporting the Union Army holds great promise, the execution ultimately fails to deliver on that potential."

            "The book is marketed as a romance, but I found it lacking in that regard. From the beginning, Alexei is consistently kind, understanding, and loving toward Jerusalem. In contrast, Jerusalem spends 75% of the story physically and verbally assaulting him, yet he endures it and continues to love her. While I empathize with her trauma and intense emotions, they do not excuse her ongoing abuse, especially toward someone she considers a friend. I recognize that Jerusalem is only 18, and I remember how challenging it can be to manage emotions at that age. However, she directs her turmoil at those around her without making any effort to heal or reflect on her actions.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  - The novel is set during the American Civil War and combines elements of YA fantasy, vampires, and demi-gods (Saints).  \n  - The story follows Jerusalem, a Saint who escaped slavery from a Southern vampire, and Alexei, a vampire fighting for the Union, as they seek revenge against the vampire who enslaved Jerusalem.  \n  - The timeline was confusing at times due to unannounced flashbacks, which disrupted the flow of the story.  \n  - The language used often felt inconsistent with the Civil War setting, making it jarring when reminded of the historical context.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - The romance between Jerusalem and Alexei felt abrupt and lacked chemistry, with their connection primarily revolving around Alexei's attraction to her blood.  \n  - The male narrator's portrayal of Alexei's voice leaned too heavily into a \"predator and prey\" dynamic, which didn't align with the intended protective and loving relationship.  \n\n- **Narration and Audio Experience:**  \n  - The audio narration was challenging to follow, particularly due to the lack of clear transitions between flashbacks and the present timeline.  \n  - The male narrator's tone and delivery did not resonate well, further detracting from the listening experience.  \n\n- **Themes and Potential:**  \n  - The novel explores themes of slavery, white privilege, and the Civil War, with a unique blend of vampires and demi-gods.  \n  - Despite its promising premise, the execution fell short, leaving the story feeling underdeveloped and lacking in emotional depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Dangerous Ones* had a compelling premise with its Civil War setting, vampires, and demi-gods, it ultimately did not deliver for me. The romance felt rushed and lacked chemistry, the timeline was confusing, and the narration did not enhance the story. The inconsistent language and jarring reminders of the historical setting further detracted from the experience. However, readers who enjoy YA romantasy with themes of slavery, white privilege, and supernatural elements may still find it worth exploring.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The depiction of a woman recently freed from slavery felt underdeveloped. Considering the historical context, she would have encountered substantial dangers from society, not just from supernatural threats like vampires and werewolves. This crucial aspect of her experience was overlooked, missing an opportunity to add depth to the narrative.",
            "I struggled to suspend my disbelief for several reasons. The language in the book felt inconsistent with its 1863 setting; for example, Jerusalem would not have employed modern vernacular, even amidst rebellion. Furthermore, the vampires, portrayed as centuries old, lacked dialogue that reflected their age and origins. Alexei, a recent immigrant from Russia, should have spoken in a more historically accurate manner. Overall, the narrative would benefit from deeper research to enhance the believability of its historical fantasy elements.",

I was highly intrigued and excited to dive into the story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Sadly, I didn’t enjoy *The Dangerous Ones*. The book failed to meet my expectations, and I found it difficult to fully engage with the story.\n\n- **World-Building and Historical Accuracy:**  \n  I was unable to suspend my disbelief for several reasons. The language used in the book was not consistent with the historical setting of 1863. For example, Jerusalem, no matter how rebellious, would not have been using modern language. Additionally, the vampires, who were supposed to be centuries old, did not speak in a manner reflective of their age or origins. Alexei, who came from Russia not long ago, should have had a more distinct and historically accurate way of speaking. I believe more research was needed to make the historical fantasy elements believable.\n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n  The portrayal of a woman who had just been freed from slavery felt underdeveloped. Given the time period, she would have faced significant dangers from human society, not just from supernatural threats like vampires and werewolves. This aspect of her story felt overlooked and could have added depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of *The Dangerous Ones* was compelling, the execution fell short for me.

            "The FMC's irrational decisions made her insufferable, consistently endangering both herself and others. Despite being depicted as intelligent, her actions contradicted this portrayal, rendering her frustrating and unrelatable. Her verbally and physically abusive behavior further alienated her, making it difficult for readers to empathize with her. Odessa began as a redeeming character, but her uncharacteristic choices ultimately led to her and her friends’ deaths. Alexei, while well-written and likable, found it hard to connect with the FMC, especially given her abusive tendencies. Their romance felt unrealistic and problematic, marked by jarring shifts from hostility to affection—such as going from attempting to kill him to kissing him—which came across as forced and unnatural.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Premise:**  \n   - The concept of combining the Civil War, the Underground Railroad, vampires, werewolves, and vampire hunters is fantastic and highly imaginative.  \n   - The setting and backstory are well-crafted and engaging.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n   - The interactions between the main characters (MMC and FMC) were disappointing.  \n   - The MMC is portrayed as deeply in love with the FMC from the start, while the FMC constantly puts him down despite her attraction to him.  \n   - The transition from frienemies to a romantic relationship feels forced, with over-the-top pet names and excessive fawning, which feels out of place in the middle of a war.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Authenticity:**  \n   - The dialogue often uses modern slang and terminology, which detracts from the historical setting and feels anachronistic.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Appeal:**  \n   - The story feels tailored for a teenage audience, with a formula reminiscent of *Twilight*.  \n   - While it may not resonate with older readers, it has the potential to engage younger readers and spark an interest in history.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n   - The book contains mature content, including violence, trauma from enslavement, and nudity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel boasts a creative and intriguing premise, it falls short in execution, particularly in character dynamics and dialogue authenticity. The story seems better suited for a younger audience, as it follows a formula that could appeal to teenagers. Despite its flaws, the book has redeeming qualities, such as its imaginative setting and potential to inspire an interest in history.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

However, the romance felt one-sided, and I found Jerusalem's treatment of Alexei to be unkind. While her trust issues and anger are understandable given her past, it raises the question of why they end up together if she continues to mistreat him. I believe Alexei deserves someone who genuinely appreciates him.",

            "Initially, I rated the book four stars, but my opinion shifted around the 70% mark when the plot took an unexpected turn. The sudden introduction of Sasquatches, werewolves, and a giant octopus felt jarring and poorly explained. While the teleporting Sasquatches were an amusing touch, I was already too confused by the world to appreciate it. Additionally, the subplot involving Alexei's attempt to persuade the Underground Railroad council felt disjointed; it was hard to understand why the main characters would take such a dangerous risk, especially when the council threatened to kill Alexei if he failed. \n\nHowever, I found the concept of vampires in the Civil War intriguing, particularly the Saints—a group of superhumans with the unique strength to combat them. I also enjoyed the revenge arc of a former slave who returns to confront her former masters, finally unleashing the powers she had long suppressed.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed both main characters. Jerusalem was fantastic—her strength as a fighter and her supernatural abilities made her relationship with Alexei feel more balanced than typical vampire/human romances. Alexei, a compelling and formidable vampire with a rich backstory, seamlessly shifted from badass to gentle and sweet. I appreciated that he wasn't the typical alpha male; instead, he genuinely cared for Jerusalem and consistently demonstrated his affection.",
            "I appreciated the book's tone and style, despite some historical anachronisms, such as the use of modern terms like \"badass\" in a Civil War setting. Given that it's a vampire story, I was willing to overlook these inconsistencies.",
            "From the outset, I struggled with the storytelling due to insufficient worldbuilding. It felt as though the author was hesitant to provide a comprehensive infodump, which ultimately hindered my immersion. Key questions about the world remained unanswered: How long have vampires existed? Are all humans aware of them? What is the nature of the smoky haze blocking the sun, and how do people and crops survive beneath it? Additionally, the Saints were underdeveloped—who are they, where do they come from, and why do they possess powers? Jerusalem, the protagonist, seemed oddly indifferent to these crucial questions, which should have been central to her character."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite its flaws, I really enjoyed the first 70% of the book, largely due to the strong character development and engaging plot. However, the lack of worldbuilding and the sudden introduction of unexplained supernatural elements in the latter part of the story left me feeling bewildered and disconnected. While I appreciated the creativity and the main characters, the inconsistencies and unanswered questions ultimately hindered my enjoyment. I think this book could work well for readers who are less concerned with detailed worldbuilding and more focused on character-driven stories.",

I love that she was such a strong fighter and a supernatural in her own right. It made her relationship with Alexei seem a lot less one-sided than vampire/human romances tend to be in these types of books.\n   - Alexei was a really awesome, threatening vampire with a great backstory, who could be badass one minute and really gentle and sweet the next. I appreciated that he wasn’t the asshole alpha type and that he really cared about Jerusalem and showed it often.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - I loved the idea of vampires in The Civil War and the concept of the Saints, a group of superhumans with enhanced strength who are the only ones strong enough to kill the vampires.\n   - I enjoyed the revenge story of a former slave who returns to take vengeance on her masters and finally unleashes the abilities she had been holding in check for so long.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**\n   - I had a problem with the storytelling from the beginning due to the lack of worldbuilding. It felt like the author was anxious to do a huge infodump at the start, but my immersion suffered because it wasn’t there.\n   - Key questions about the world were left unanswered: How long have vampires been around?

The introduction of Sasquatches, werewolves, and a giant octopus creature felt sudden and unexplained.\n   - The teleporting Sasquatches were a fun detail, but by that point, I was already too confused about the world to fully appreciate it.\n   - The subplot about Alexei convincing the council of the Underground Railroad felt unnecessary and out of place. It didn’t make sense why the main characters would risk it, especially since the council admitted they would kill Alexei if he failed.\n\n- **Tone and Style:**\n   - I enjoyed the book’s tone and style overall, even with the historical anachronisms (e.g., using modern terms like “badass” in a Civil War setting).

            "Initially, I struggled to connect with the characters, but as the story unfolded through flashbacks, this concern diminished. By the end, Alexi and Jerusalem felt fully developed, and most side characters had sufficient depth as well. While the romance seemed rushed at first, it ultimately prioritized the growth of their relationship. However, I would have appreciated more insight into the evolution of their feelings earlier in the narrative. Some romantic elements felt clichéd, particularly Dess's constant teasing about their attraction, which may be a common trope in the genre.",
            "The modern language resonated with me, though I understand it may not appeal to everyone. I would have appreciated a discussion in the author’s note explaining her choice.",
            "This book prompted me to reflect on the portrayal of toxic relationships in literature, serving as a metaphor for expressing internalized rage and hurt—an insight I found compelling. The engaging banter between characters added a delightful touch of levity to the narrative.",
            "I found the premise of the book captivating, especially as a fan of horror and fantasy reimaginings of dark historical events. While some twists were predictable, I was particularly intrigued by Dess and Gael's decision and how Jer and Lex responded to it afterward."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, I’m glad I finished the book despite my initial disappointment. The premise was compelling, and the characters became more fleshed out as the story progressed. While the romance felt rushed and some elements were cliché, the nuanced handling of trauma and abuse, particularly in Jer and Lex’s relationship, made the book stand out. The modern language worked for me, but I wish the author had explained her choice. The banter and deeper themes added layers to the story, making it a worthwhile read.",

I’m super into horror/fantasy reimaginings of terrible historic events.  \n   - The twists were somewhat obvious, but Dess and Gael's decision was especially interesting to me because of how Jer and Lex discussed/handled it afterward.  \n\n- **Character Development**  \n   - At first, I felt like we weren’t getting to know the characters, but as we got more backstory through flashbacks, that became less of an issue.  \n   - By the end, I felt like Alexi and Jerusalem were fully fleshed out, and most of the side characters had appropriate depth too.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships**  \n   - The romance felt rushed initially, but I think it was done to focus more on the development of their actual relationship.  \n   - I wish we had seen more of how their feelings developed earlier in the book. Some of the romance felt cliché, like the constant “~omg but you totally like him~” from Dess, which might just be a genre thing.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Language**  \n   - The modern language worked for me, but I can see how it didn’t work for others. I wish the author had included a discussion in the author’s note about why she made that decision.  \n\n- **Handling of Trauma and Abuse**  \n   - I appreciate that the author used the characters to show multiple responses to trauma.  \n   - Jer and Lex’s relationship was clearly abusive, and at first, I hated how the author seemed to gloss over that. However, I liked that Jer later realized she was harming Lex and decided to take steps to change.  \n   - The author showed that Jer was acting out of trauma, not intentionally trying to be abusive, which added nuance to the story.  \n   - I also liked that Lex’s past abuse was explored, making him more susceptible to future abuse.  \n\n- **Themes and Nuance**  \n   - The book made me think about why toxic relationships are often portrayed in literature. It felt like a metaphor for letting out internalized rage/hurt, which I found insightful.  \n   - The banter between characters was enjoyable and added a lighter touch to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I’m glad I finished the book despite my initial disappointment.

Their romance unfolds as a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers narrative, intertwined with themes of trauma and PTSD. While the relationship is engaging, it could benefit from further development, as it feels somewhat underexplored and lacks seamless integration into the overall plot.",

Moments of introspection reveal the disparities between them, enriching the depth of their relationship.",
            "The author’s previous novel, *Wildblood*, was a remarkable exploration of black pain and magic. In *The Dangerous Ones*, they delve into similar themes while incorporating romantic fantasy elements that are often more subdued in their serious works. Although *The Dangerous Ones* may not reach the same heights as *Wildblood*, it offers a fun and engaging reading experience.

More historical detail and a slower build in certain relationships would have enhanced the experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a creative and engaging historical fantasy with a unique premise and strong characters. While it has some pacing issues and could benefit from more depth in certain areas, it’s an enjoyable read with a satisfying conclusion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

            "The plot follows Alexei as he seeks revenge on The Red Mask, while Jerusalem targets the vampire mistress responsible for harming her family. The story unfolds at a brisk pace, keeping me thoroughly engaged.",
            "Alexei and Jerusalem are captivating characters, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journeys. Jerusalem is an intriguing protagonist, though her impulsiveness and fierce independence can occasionally feel excessive. Alexei, driven by his convictions and admiration for Jerusalem, is equally compelling. The supporting characters enrich the narrative through their relationships with the main duo. The romance between Alexei and Jerusalem is both sweet and authentic, unfolding at a medium pace; Alexei expresses his feelings early on, while Jerusalem remains more reluctant.",
            "Incorporating vampires and fantasy into a Civil War setting occasionally undermines the gravity of historical issues. Nonetheless, the narrative consistently connects to the struggles of Black Americans and the pervasive racism of the time. This unique historical fantasy romance deftly blends various elements, showcasing well-crafted writing that captivates from the very first page."

        "conclusion": "*The Dangerous Ones* by the author is a well-written historical fantasy romance with engaging characters and a compelling plot. While the fantasy elements occasionally overshadow the historical context, the story remains grounded in the struggles of Black Americans during the Civil War. The romance is sweet and genuine, and the pacing keeps me invested. Overall, it’s a solid read and a great choice for fans of the genre.",

As a fan of the romantasy genre, this book was right up my alley.  \n\n- **Main Character and Plot Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Jerusalem, is a human with supernatural abilities who escapes slavery after losing her family to a vampire attack. She joins the Union army and is trained by Alexei, a 3,000-year-old vampire fighting for the Union. Their shared adversaries create a compelling dynamic, as Jerusalem despises vampires but must work alongside Alexei. The enemies-to-lovers trope is well-executed, with plenty of banter and tension between the two characters.  \n\n- **Historical Authenticity and Language:**  \n  One issue I had with the book was the use of modern language by Jerusalem, which felt out of place for the 1860s setting. Words like “dumbass,” “hella,” and “cute-ass” disrupted the immersion and didn’t serve the storytelling effectively.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The narrators, Angel Pean and Jay Ben Markson, did an exceptional job. Their use of a Southern accent added depth and flavor to the story, enhancing the overall listening experience. I look forward to hearing more from them in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an engaging audiobook that combines historical fantasy and romantasy elements.

As an adult in my late twenties, I struggled with the discussions of sexual violence and torture, and I can only imagine how overwhelming it might be for younger teens. While I understand the importance of addressing the horrific experiences of Black people in U.S. history, I was uncomfortable with the detailed depiction of torture in a YA context. It seems inconsistent that graphic portrayals of violence are acceptable while detailed discussions of normal human sexuality are often avoided in the genre. I want to clarify that this is not a critique of the author or her story, but rather a comment on its marketing and classification. I love the concept—vampires and the Civil War, with a touch of romance! The portrayal of slave owners as vampires and the exploration of power and trauma were particularly intriguing.",

            "In this captivating story, Vampire Alexei finds himself on the Union side, where he falls for Jerusalem, a fellow Saint who possesses enhanced strength and speed. Jerusalem's drive for revenge is relatable, yet it leads her to make impulsive choices that highlight her youth. Meanwhile, I often had to remind myself that Alexei, while appearing more mature, is eternally only 18—perhaps a reflection of his vampire nature.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  I really enjoyed the premise of this novel and found it an interesting concept. It’s essentially a historical romance set during the Civil War, but with the added twist of vampires.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  Vampire Alexei is on the Union side and falls in love with Jerusalem when she arrives at the camp he’s in with other Saints (what she is). This means she is stronger and faster than an average human. Jerusalem has her heart set on revenge, which is understandable, but it leads her to make some impulsive decisions that remind you she is really young. On the other hand, I had to keep reminding myself that Alexei is only (eternally) 18. He felt older, but that could have been due to his vampire nature.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The topics in this novel were really heavy in my opinion, and I didn’t even realize it was categorized as YA. I think if the characters were aged up a few years, it would fall perfectly into a “New Adult” category. However, I understand that anything containing teen main characters often gets slotted into YA.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I accompanied this read with the audiobook and really enjoyed the narrations! I think it added a lot to the experience, and I could feel Jerusalem’s passion and Alexei’s love for her through the narration.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the novel engaging, with a unique blend of historical romance and supernatural elements. The heavy themes and character dynamics made it a compelling read, though the YA categorization felt slightly off. The audiobook narration enhanced the experience significantly.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While this dynamic was intriguing, I didn’t feel the chemistry between Jerusalem and Alexei, even though Alexei claims to be in love with her. I also didn’t feel connected to them as characters.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The past and present timelines got away from me at times, and I felt lost. However, I did enjoy the dual POV between Jerusalem and Alexei, which added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Recommendation:**  \n  I think readers who enjoy YA fantasy should give this a try and see if it’s the right story for them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise was strong and unique, the execution left me wanting more. The lack of chemistry between the main characters and the confusing timeline shifts detracted from my overall enjoyment. However, the dual POV and the vampire elements were highlights that might appeal to YA fantasy fans.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "In this story, the protagonist, Jerusalem, is an 18-year-old Saint with enhanced strength and a background as an escaped slave. While her righteous anger is compelling, her character lacks meaningful development, remaining static and overly focused on violence. The love interest, Alexei, a Union vampire, is similarly underdeveloped and lacks personality; his immediate infatuation with Jerusalem feels forced and superficial. Supporting characters like Odessa, Gael, Julia, and Gus are minimally developed and contribute little to the narrative. The relationship between Jerusalem and Alexei lacks tension and progression, as he falls for her instantly, making their connection feel shallow. Introducing a more complex dynamic, such as self-serving motives from Alexei, could have added much-needed depth to their relationship.",
            "The worldbuilding in this novel is confusing and lacks thorough research. It fails to clarify how the presence of vampires and Saints impacts the historical context of the Civil War. A notable plot hole arises when vampires block out the sun with bonfires, which contradicts the agricultural practices of the South, especially cotton farming. Additionally, the reference to Van Helsing as the first Saint feels anachronistic and poorly justified, indicating a disregard for historical accuracy. The Civil War backdrop seems like an afterthought, with minimal exploration of how fantasy elements interact with real events. While the depiction of the Underground Railroad introduces a lesser-known figure, Ely Parker, it undermines the bravery of actual conductors by attributing their success to magical beings. Overall, the novel lacks the necessary historical detail and research to create a cohesive narrative.",
            "This novel adeptly deconstructs the Lost Cause mythology, particularly illustrated in a pivotal scene where Jerusalem confronts Garfield, a seemingly benevolent master, and comes to terms with the fundamental evil of slavery. While the theme of racial justice is present, it could have been explored more deeply, especially considering the historical context. The introduction of a vampire-controlled Confederacy and their natural adversaries, the Saints, adds an intriguing twist. The notion of a vampire joining the Union is especially refreshing, creating a distinct narrative within the historical YA fantasy genre."

        "conclusion": "The Dangerous Ones has a promising concept and some strong thematic elements, particularly in its critique of the Lost Cause mythology and its exploration of racial justice.

            "Set during the Civil War, this story features vampires aligning with the Confederates to sustain slavery. Jerusalem, a powerful Saint, battles these vampires while searching for her brother, who she believes may still be alive. However, the narrative suffers from confusing time jumps and flashbacks that detract from the main plot. The storyline feels disjointed, attempting to blend an enemy-to-lovers romance with intense Civil War action that fails to gel. The forced romance clashes with the darker, action-driven themes of the story, and the enemy-to-lovers dynamic doesn’t seamlessly integrate with the overarching conflict between vampires and the Civil War. While the audiobook narration is decent, it struggles with pacing, and the disruptive flashbacks undermine the story’s flow.",

            "Jerusalem's anger, hurt, and pain are entirely justified, but her relentless aggression towards her closest ally, Alexi, feels excessive. Though Alexi is a powerful, ancient vampire capable of enduring her outbursts, the severity of her actions—literal maiming and multiple murder attempts—clashes with the story's theme of love conquering evil. The transition from her suffering to healing, love, and understanding is poorly executed, making their interactions frustrating. Both my partner and I found it hard to root for their relationship; Jerusalem needed time to grow and heal before entering a romance with someone who triggers her traumas.\n\nAlexi, while portrayed as nearly perfect, comes off as too passive. His infatuation leads him to engage in trivial antics to garner Jerusalem’s attention, yet he endures her lethal anger without standing up for himself. While the notion of a devoted partner is appealing, it loses its charm when that love leads to actual harm. Though Alexi faces his own challenges, they are only briefly touched upon, leaving readers wanting more insight into why he is so drawn to Jerusalem beyond the concept of fated mates. As the older vampire, he should take a more active stance rather than merely looking stunned by her hurtful actions.\n\nThe unique dynamic between a Black woman with enhanced abilities and an Alucard-like figure is intriguing, but their love story struggles to flourish. Their relationship remains one-sided and fraught with hostility until the very end, with only a handful of tender moments. To develop a meaningful connection, a second book would be necessary, as everything feels rushed in this one. The finale, while enjoyable, arrives too late to salvage their bond.\n\nSierge, a perplexing character, is both an abused abuser and a protector, helping Alexi yet inflicting pain on those he feeds from. His potential for redemption—particularly in teaching Alexi how to feed without killing—offers an interesting angle that could draw parallels to humanitarian efforts like the Underground Railroad. Unfortunately, his storyline appears abandoned and unresolved, leaving readers craving more depth.",
            "I appreciated the modernized language, which made reading (or listening) much more enjoyable. In fantasy, I believe it's perfectly acceptable to take liberties with language.",
            "The premise is outstanding, and the world-building sets the stage for a truly captivating story. I appreciated the introduction of Saints and the inclusion of various supernatural beings. However, many of these elements, aside from the vampires, felt underdeveloped and left me wanting more. For instance, the instant-transmission Sasquatches and the limited exploration of werewolves and vampires were disappointing. I did enjoy the portrayal of the Underground Railroad and the collaboration between humans and non-humans to aid Black individuals in their quest for freedom. Nonetheless, it was unfortunate that nearly all vampires were depicted as evil, with the exception of Alexi and the new blood introduced at the end."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book has an amazing premise, interesting side characters, and decent world-building. The pain and vengeance were handled well, though some antagonists got off too easily with quick deaths. The ending was the best part, and I wish it had happened midway through the story, allowing the relationship between Alexi and Jerusalem to progress more naturally. A second book could explore their growth and the world further. Despite its flaws, I’d be interested in a follow-up.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Language and Style:**\n   - I didn’t mind the modernized language at all. It made reading (or listening to it) less of a slog. In fantasy, taking liberties with language is totally fine with me.\n\n- **Premise and World-Building:**\n   - The premise is stellar, and the setup and world-building were there for a truly remarkable and gripping story. I enjoyed the setup of Saints and the inclusion of other supernatural beings. However, any supernatural elements besides vampires felt tacked on and left me wanting more. For example, the instant transmission Sasquatches and the lack of exploration of werewolves and vampires were disappointing. I loved the handling of the Underground Railroad and how humans and non-humans worked together to help Black folks to freedom. However, it was unfortunate that almost all vampires were portrayed as evil, except for Alexi and the new blood at the end.\n\n- **Character Development (Jerusalem):**\n   - Jerusalem’s anger, hurt, pain, and fury are all justified, but her constant lashing out at her closest ally, Alexi, was excessive. While Alexi is an ultra-strong, old vampire who can take her abuse, the literal maiming and multiple murder attempts were too much for a story that’s supposed to have love conquering evil. The transition from pain to healing, love, and understanding was too hard to tie together for Jerusalem, making her interactions with Alexi frustrating. I, and my partner who listened with me, didn’t want them to get together. Jerusalem needed space and time to grow and heal before entering a relationship with someone who embodies all her triggers. She couldn’t see past her trauma and constantly lashed out, which made it hard to root for their relationship.\n\n- **Character Development (Alexi):**\n   - Alexi is too perfect, which is a problem when paired with such a strong and triggered character like Jerusalem. He is way too passive, doing little annoying things to get her attention because he’s so infatuated with her. However, her anger literally kills, and he just takes it. While a ride-or-die lover is appealing, it’s not when they’re literally dying because of their love for you. Alexi had his own issues, but they were only scratched at towards the end. I wanted more insight into why he fell so hard for Jerusalem beyond her smell (fated mate stuff, I guess). I also wanted him to stand up for himself more. He’s the older one by 200+ years and should have been able to do or say more than just look stunned every time Jerusalem hurt him.\n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**\n   - The main draw for me was seeing how a Black woman with enhanced abilities falls in love with an Alucard-like character. However, the love between Jerusalem and Alexi couldn’t thrive. It was one-sided and filled with malice until the very end. The tender moments were far and few between, and for them to have a real relationship, a second book would have been needed. Their relationship suffered because Alexi put Jerusalem on a pedestal, and everything had to be wrapped up in one book. The finale was enjoyable, but it was too little, too late. They both need to grow up and meet again before anything meaningful could happen.\n\n- **Side Characters and Subplots:**\n   - Sierge was a confusing character. He was an abused abuser who cared enough for Alexi to help him get free but tortured those he drank from. It would have been interesting if he had been the one to teach Alexi how to drink without killing. His potential redemption arc, especially in helping new bloods to safety, could have paralleled the Underground Railroad and shown that not all vampires are evil. However, his storyline felt dropped and unresolved.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book has an amazing premise, interesting side characters, and decent world-building. The pain and vengeance were handled well, though some antagonists got off too easily with quick deaths. The ending was the best part, and I wish it had happened midway through the story, allowing the relationship between Alexi and Jerusalem to progress more naturally. A second book could explore their growth and the world further. Despite its flaws, I’d be interested in a sequel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3.5, rounded up to 4."

            "The inclusion of the Underground Railroad was a clever touch that added excitement to the story. The unexpected introduction of sasquatches was enjoyable, but the presence of werewolves and the chimera felt out of place and confusing. Additionally, Jerusalem's relentless pursuit of revenge overshadowed her potential to use her powers for a broader cause, which was disappointing.",
            "The integration of vampires into the Civil War, particularly as plantation and slave owners, is both imaginative and well-executed. Alexei, the main vampire, is a complex character with a rich backstory, and his loyalty to the North, coupled with his internal struggles, is compelling. However, the Saints, especially Jerusalem, are intriguing yet underdeveloped; their powers and history lack sufficient explanation, leaving gaps in understanding their significance. Jerusalem's character is powerful, but her repetitive inner conflict regarding her feelings for Alexei becomes tiresome, and her eventual shift in attitude feels sudden and lacks depth. The relationship between Alexei and Jerusalem is inconsistent and frustrating, with the concept of fated mates hinted at but never fully realized. Jerusalem's violent behavior towards Alexei is hard to overlook, making her acceptance of her feelings feel abrupt. In contrast, the subplot involving Odessa and Gael adds complexity and tragedy, enriching the overall narrative.",
            "The buildup to the romance between Alexei and Jerusalem was extensive but ultimately unsatisfying due to its late development. The revelation that Jerusalem’s enslaver was also Alexei’s creator and tormentor was anticipated yet lacked the dramatic impact it could have delivered."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Atmosphere/Characters:**\n  - The concept of integrating vampires into the Civil War, particularly as plantation/slave owners, was imaginative and well-executed.\n  - Alexei, the main vampire, is a complex character with a rich backstory. His loyalty to the North and his internal struggle with his past fears were compelling.\n  - The Saints, particularly Jerusalem, were intriguing but underdeveloped. Their powers and history were not well-explained, which left gaps in understanding their significance.\n  - Jerusalem’s character was powerful but her repetitive inner conflict about her feelings towards Alexei became tiresome. Her eventual shift in attitude felt sudden and lacked depth.\n\n- **Plot:**\n  - The inclusion of the Underground Railroad was clever and added excitement to the story.\n  - The introduction of sasquatches was unexpected but enjoyable, while werewolves and the chimera felt out of place and confusing.\n  - Jerusalem’s relentless pursuit of revenge overshadowed her potential to use her power for broader liberation, which was disappointing.\n\n- **Relationships:**\n  - The relationship between Alexei and Jerusalem was inconsistent and frustrating. The concept of fated mates was hinted at but never fully realized.\n  - Jerusalem’s violent behavior towards Alexei was hard to overlook, and her eventual acceptance of her feelings felt abrupt.\n  - The subplot involving Odessa and Gael added a layer of complexity and tragedy that enriched the overall narrative.\n\n- **Intrigue:**\n  - The buildup to the romance between Alexei and Jerusalem was extensive but ultimately unsatisfying due to its late development.\n  - The reveal that Jerusalem’s enslaver was also Alexei’s maker/tormenter was anticipated but fell flat, lacking the dramatic impact it could have had.\n\n- **Generalized Reaction/Enjoyment in Reading:**\n  - The initial two-thirds of the book were a struggle due to Jerusalem’s repetitive and frustrating inner monologue.\n  - The story improved significantly once Jerusalem and Alexei’s relationship progressed, but the overall enjoyment was marred by the earlier sections and the abrupt resolution of key plot points.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel had an imaginative premise and some compelling characters, the execution fell short in several areas. The underdevelopment of the Saints, the inconsistent relationship dynamics, and the uneven pacing detracted from the overall experience. Despite these issues, the story had moments of brilliance and a unique blend of historical and supernatural elements that made it worth reading.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Concept: 8/10\n- Character Development: 6/10\n- Plot Execution: 5/10\n- Relationship Dynamics: 5/10\n- Overall Enjoyment: 6/10"

            "In this story, Jerusalem, the protagonist, is a deeply traumatized Saint who grew up in slavery and seeks revenge for her family's murder. Her overwhelming anger and distrust are understandable, yet they often overshadow her character. Odessa, another Black Saint, serves as a source of admiration and comfort for Jerusalem. In contrast, Alexei, a white Russian vampire, is a complex figure who assists Jerusalem despite her constant insults. His backstory—being turned into a vampire against his will—adds depth to his character, making his vulnerability and fear when confronting past tormentors relatable and likable. However, Jerusalem's relentless insults toward Alexei, despite his kindness, create a sense of conflict and discomfort. Their strained dynamic highlights Jerusalem's struggle to trust him, even as their bond grows. The revelation that not all vampires choose their fate shocks Jerusalem, but this moment feels underdeveloped and jarring.",
            "The worldbuilding is impressive, seamlessly merging historical and supernatural elements. However, the modern language—such as phrases like \"feeling salty\" and \"dumbass\"—feels out of place for the year 1863, which undermines the overall immersion.",
            "The book elicits a mix of emotions, capturing relatable moments, such as Alexei's fear, alongside more frustrating aspects, like Jerusalem's repetitive insults. While the narrative acknowledges the emotional weight of Jerusalem's trauma, her actions frequently feel disconnected, making it challenging to empathize with her.",
            "Although the book isn't dull, it struggles to sustain consistent interest, resulting in a sense of disconnection. The repetitive insults from Jerusalem and the use of modern language further diminish engagement.",

Even minor characters like Gus and Jules are thoughtfully developed, leaving me eager for a spinoff featuring them. The parallels between Jerusalem and Alexei, the vampire, are skillfully drawn, highlighting their shared struggles and growth.

Her family's tragic enslavement and murder by Vampires ignite her deep-seated hatred for them.

However, the dual first-person perspective between Alexei and Jerusalem can be somewhat confusing. Alexei's inconsistent use of Jerusalem's name and his nickname for her, \"Tiny,\" adds to the ambiguity. Additionally, some flashbacks are vaguely labeled (e.g., \"One Year Later\") but actually occur many years earlier, further complicating the narrative.

Resilient and determined, she navigates her flaws with strength. **Alexei**, a 300-year-old vampire from 1500s Russia, brings a tragic depth to the story. His slow-burn romance with Jerusalem is enriched by their witty banter and undeniable chemistry. **Odessa**, a former slave and mother figure to Jerusalem, leads missions against the Confederates, while **Gael**, a Saint in love with Odessa, adds further complexity to the narrative. The villain, **Adelaide Troy (Red Mask)**, an Ancient vampire, is responsible for much of Jerusalem's suffering, and **Zamir the Mangler**, another Ancient vampire, shares a complicated history with Alexei. While Odessa and Gael's relationship lacks the same satisfaction, it is understandable given their shared trauma.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - The narrators, Angel Pean and Jay Ben Markson, brought the story to life with their distinct accents (Jerusalem's Southern twang and Alexei's Russian accent).  \n   - The pacing was excellent, flowing seamlessly with the story.  \n   - The narration and the author's writing were perfectly in sync.  \n   - The audiobook format is highly recommended for its adjustability (speed control, easy skipping) and vivid character portrayal.  \n\n- **Setting and Genre:**  \n   - The story is set in Virginia in June 1862, blending historical, paranormal romance, and fantasy elements.  \n   - Tropes include magic, vampires, Saints (humans with preternatural abilities), and New Bloods (vampires 50 years old or less).  \n   - Themes to watch for: racial discrimination, slavery, physical abuse, SA attempt, and murder.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - **Jerusalem (Dido):** An 18-year-old headstrong heroine seeking revenge for her family's death. She is resilient and determined, even when flawed.  \n   - **Alexei:** A 300-year-old Ancient vampire with a tragic past, turned in 1500s Russia. His relationship with Jerusalem is a slow-burn romance filled with witty banter.  \n   - **Odessa:** A human ex-slave and mother figure to Jerusalem, leading missions against the Confederates.  \n   - **Gael:** A Saint in love with Odessa, adding depth to the story.  \n   - **Adelaide Troy (Red Mask):** A villainous Ancient vampire responsible for much of Jerusalem's suffering.  \n   - **Zamir the Mangler:** An Ancient vampire with a complicated history with Alexei.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The story combines star-crossed lovers, war, and action-packed sequences.  \n   - The Underground Railroad is woven into the narrative, highlighting the historical struggle of enslaved people seeking freedom.  \n   - References to *Twilight*, *Interview with the Vampire*, and *John Carter* add a nostalgic layer for fans of the genre.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n   - Jerusalem and Alexei's romance is a slow burn, fitting given Jerusalem's traumatic past. Their witty banter and chemistry are highlights.  \n   - Odessa and Gael's relationship, while not as satisfying, is understandable given the trauma they endure.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Satisfaction:**  \n   - The ending is satisfying, though I would love to see more adventures with Jerusalem and Alexei.  \n   - The story delivers on its promises, blending history, fantasy, and romance seamlessly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Dangerous Ones* is a captivating blend of historical fiction, paranormal romance, and fantasy. With strong characters, a well-paced plot, and excellent narration, it offers a satisfying read. While some relationships could have been explored further, the story leaves a lasting impression and a desire for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  \n- Spice Level: 4/5 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️"

            "The enemies-to-lovers trope between Jerusalem and Alexei was present but didn't fully resonate with me. While Alexei's feelings for Jerusalem were evident from the beginning, her journey to understand her own emotions felt rushed and unnatural. Additionally, the significant age and experience gap—Alexei being thousands of years old and Jerusalem only 18—created an uncomfortable dynamic, especially given the modern tone of Jerusalem's dialogue.",
            "Jerusalem, a Black girl and a Saint, is a fearless and compelling protagonist whose backstory of struggle and flight to the North for freedom adds depth to her character. Alexei, a centuries-old vampire trapped in an 18-year-old body, carries a tragic history of loss and enslavement to his maker. The dynamic between Jerusalem and Alexei is intriguing, as he is captivated by her feisty spirit, though their romance occasionally feels forced. A standout aspect of the story is Jerusalem's relationship with Odessa, who attempts to guide her, adding a layer of camaraderie to the narrative.",
            "Jerusalem's contemporary speech felt incongruous within the historical setting, creating a disconnect between her and Alexei. The stark contrast in their dialogue underscored their age difference, which felt jarring and diminished their chemistry.",
            "The author consistently presents unique and captivating concepts, which initially drew me to this book. The intriguing blend of America’s Civil War with vampires was a premise I couldn't resist exploring. The integration of Saints—individuals with supernatural powers—alongside vampires and werewolves in this historical context felt both fitting and well-executed.",
            "The portrayal of the Civil War's historical context and the horrors endured by Black slaves was both well-executed and impactful. The integration of paranormal elements, such as vampires, werewolves, and Saints, into this historical backdrop was seamless. However, I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of the Saints and their abilities, as this aspect was particularly intriguing."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, the book had a unique and engaging premise with strong historical and paranormal elements. However, the romance subplot felt forced, and the modern tone of Jerusalem’s speech created a disconnect that made the relationship dynamics uncomfortable. While I enjoyed the action, historical details, and the concept of Saints, the execution of the romance and dialogue could have been improved. It was an okay read, but not without its flaws.",

            "The book flows seamlessly through multiple timelines, exploring Alexei's capture and transformation, alongside the murder of Jerusalem's family. The tension and connection between Jerusalem and Alexei are palpable throughout the narrative.",
            "Jerusalem, a former slave whose family was killed by vampires, escapes to the North to train for battle against the South and its vampire allies. As a Saint—an extraordinary human with powers to combat vampires—she harbors a deep hatred for them. However, her perspective shifts when she befriends Alexei, an ancient vampire fighting for the North. Changed against his will, Alexei has a unique compassion for newly turned vampires who lacked choice. Though he loves Jerusalem, he grapples with understanding her experiences as a Black woman and former slave.",

            "The story delves into themes of loss, struggle, and survival against all odds, highlighting the profound love of family and friends. It also examines the complexities of identity, power, and prejudice.",
            "The story is both painful and heartbreaking, particularly in its depiction of the abuse Jerusalem suffers at the hands of men and vampires. Rather than allowing this trauma to defeat her, she is fueled by it, showcasing her resilience.",
            "Set against the backdrop of the Civil War, this book presents a captivating tale where vampires coexist with humans. The creative blend of historical events and supernatural elements is brilliantly executed, making for a truly engaging story."

            "The story's pacing felt rushed, with significant time jumps and key events summarized rather than depicted, which hindered character development and my overall engagement. While the swift pace kept the narrative moving, it made it challenging to fully invest in the plot or its characters. Although the ending effectively resolved Jerusalem’s quest for revenge, it left the larger conflict of the war unresolved. The absence of an epilogue or closure regarding the war was disappointing and created a lingering loose end.",
            "While Jerusalem's character showed promise, she ultimately lacked meaningful growth, remaining immature and unlikable throughout the story. In contrast, Alexei was better developed in terms of background and motivations, yet still came across as bland and unremarkable. The romance between Jerusalem and Alexei felt forced and unrealistic, as their relationship was already established by the time they were introduced.",
            "The use of slang and vernacular felt anachronistic and jarring, detracting from the overall reading experience. Additionally, the narrative's frequent shifts between the main story and flashbacks lacked clear transitions, disrupting the flow and making the story feel disjointed.",
            "The world-building fell short, particularly in clarifying essential concepts such as the nature of being a Saint, the origins of people's powers, and the specifics of those abilities. Additionally, the historical setting and fantasy elements felt underdeveloped and poorly integrated.",
            "The concept of merging the Civil War with vampires is intriguing and starts off strong. The story begins in the midst of action, capturing attention immediately. However, it ultimately falls short by not exploring the broader context of the war in greater depth."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While *The Dangerous Ones* had an intriguing premise and some engaging action scenes, it fell short in execution. The lack of world-building, disjointed narrative structure, rushed pacing, and underdeveloped characters made it difficult to fully enjoy. The ending, while satisfying for Jerusalem’s personal arc, left the broader story unresolved. Overall, the book didn’t live up to its potential, and I wouldn’t recommend it or return to this author’s works in the future.",
