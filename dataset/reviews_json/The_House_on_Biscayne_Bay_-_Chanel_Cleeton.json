            "This novel unfolds across dual timelines: one in 1918, featuring Anna Barnes, and the other in 1941, centered on Carmen Acosta. Both narratives revolve around Marbrisa, a glamorous estate on Biscayne Bay in Miami, Florida. The story alternates between Anna’s and Carmen’s perspectives, skillfully intertwining multiple mysteries and secrets. While the pacing is generally slow with a gradual plot development, it culminates in a few surprising twists towards the end.",
            "In the 1918 timeline, Anna Barnes finds solace in the garden of Marbrisa, despite her disdain for its garishness. Meanwhile, in 1941, Carmen Acosta arrives at Marbrisa to reconnect with her estranged sister, Carolina, and her brother-in-law, Asher Wyatt, who manages Carmen’s inheritance until she turns 21. The characters are compelling, and their intricate relationships add depth to the narrative.",
            "The author’s vivid descriptive writing brings Marbrisa to life, making the estate and its glamour easily imaginable. The novel captures the allure of the era, focusing on the influx of wealthy industrialists into Florida during the early 20th century.",

            "The epilogue offers a modest redeeming quality, while the cover is commendable for its stunning aesthetic. However, the novel ultimately falls flat, feeling trite, dull, cliché, and predictable. It fails to fulfill its promise as a thriller or gothic narrative, instead presenting a dual-timeline women's fiction story focused on two troubled marriages. The inclusion of a lackluster Nancy Drew-like subplot feels disconnected and uninspiring. Additionally, the villain's motives lack logic, leaving unexplained actions, such as the off-page slaughter of an alligator and a peacock.",

            "This novel weaves a compelling mystery across two timelines: 1918 and 1941. In 1918, Robert is constructing a grand mansion, Marbrisa, for his wife, Anna, who has no enthusiasm for Florida or the house. After the mansion's completion, a woman is found dead at a party, and while Anna initially suspects an accident, unsettling rumors about her husband soon surface. Fast forward to 1941, and Carmen is sent to live with her sister and brother-in-law at Marbrisa following their parents' death.

I didn’t experience their fear, disappointment, or feel vested in their survival.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**\n   - The novel offers a unique perspective on the time periods of 1918 and 1941, which I found enjoyable.\n   - The mystery, while engaging, was somewhat predictable, though there was a surprising twist that added some intrigue.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The author’s writing is beautifully descriptive, creating a vivid and immersive experience.\n   - This is my first novel by this author, but I plan to read her previous works and would definitely read her again in the future.\n\n- **Aesthetic Appeal:**\n   - The book has a stunning cover, which initially drew me in as I am a fan of beautiful book designs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I enjoyed the novel for its rich setting, descriptive writing, and unique take on the gothic genre. However, the lack of emotional connection with the characters and the predictability of the mystery slightly diminished my overall experience. Despite these drawbacks, I appreciate the author’s talent and look forward to exploring more of her work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n⭐️⭐️⭐️💫✨ (3.75/5)"

            "This dual-timeline historical mystery unfolds at the Marbrisa estate on Biscayne Bay, alternating between 1918 and 1941. In 1918, Anna Barnes becomes the mistress of Marbrisa, a gift from her husband, as she grapples with her new life in Miami. Tragedy soon strikes, setting the stage for a compelling mystery.

It felt repetitive at times, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were extremely flat—pancake-esque, to be precise. They lacked depth and complexity, which made it hard to connect with them.  \n\n- **Setting and Imagery:**  \n  The vivid imagery of Florida was a standout positive. The descriptions were really vivid and helped create a strong sense of place.  \n\n- **Suspense and Pacing:**  \n  The story was suspenseful, though the suspense felt repetitive rather than building effectively.  \n\n- **Accessibility:**  \n  The book is great for individuals with elementary school-level reading comprehension, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing but might not appeal to more advanced readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the vivid imagery and suspenseful elements were enjoyable, the lack of a compelling twist, flat characters, and repetitive writing style made the overall experience underwhelming. The book is accessible but may not satisfy readers looking for deeper engagement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nOriginally intended to be 4 stars, but due to the letdowns, the final rating is likely lower (though not explicitly stated)."

The time periods of WWI and WWII are only briefly mentioned, and the setting of Miami lacks a distinct sense of place. The story could easily be set in the present day, as it doesn’t immerse the reader in the historical context or the unique atmosphere of Miami. The house feels generic, like any slightly rural house from a typical thriller.  \n\n- **Thriller Elements:**  \n   - The thriller aspect is heavy-handed but underdeveloped. The house is portrayed as creepy with inexplicable bad vibes, but this isn’t explored in depth. Carmen’s immediate decision to investigate and her sister’s obsession with the house’s dark past feel forced and lack sufficient motivation. The sister’s death, tied to her investigation, isn’t well-justified, leaving the plot feeling contrived.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Most characters lack depth. George’s motives are unclear—he claims the house is his inheritance, but Robert was broke, and his actions (killing animals and the sister) aren’t logically explained. The only character with some depth is Sarah from the earlier timeline, but even her development feels minimal.  \n\n- **Plot Coherence:**  \n   - The plot lacks cohesion and logical progression. Key elements, such as the house’s history, the characters’ motivations, and the connection between timelines, aren’t fleshed out. This leaves the story feeling disjointed and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has potential, it falls short in establishing a strong historical setting, developing its thriller elements, and creating well-rounded characters.

However, the whodunnit elements failed to engage me, as the ending felt far-fetched and unconvincing, with several mystery resolutions not standing up to scrutiny.",

            "The novel exudes a subtle horror ambiance, set against the backdrop of a hauntingly large house, enigmatic deaths of both humans and animals, and a captivating historic Miami setting. The narrative unfolds through two perspectives: Anna, who relocates to Miami after WWI, and Carmen, who arrives in 1941 after fleeing Cuba. Both timelines are marked by mysterious occurrences and untimely deaths. While Florida's post-WWI growth and investment context is intriguing, I found myself yearning for greater historical depth, particularly concerning Carmen's ties to Cuba.",

            "The novel unfolds across dual timelines—1918 and 1941—set against the backdrop of Marbrisa, an estate on Biscayne Bay. The first timeline centers on Anna Barnes, who receives the gaudy estate as a gift from her husband, Robert, despite her aversion to its ostentation. The second timeline introduces Carmen Acosta, who visits Marbrisa, now owned by her estranged sister, Carolina, and her husband, Asher Wyatt. Alternating between Anna’s and Carmen’s perspectives, the narrative intertwines mysteries and secrets. However, the pacing tends to drag, with only a handful of surprises appearing toward the conclusion. While the novel is richly detailed and entertaining, its slow-burn plot may not satisfy readers in search of a more fast-paced experience, although the eventual surprises do offer some reward.",
            "The characters are compelling, especially Anna and Carmen, whose lives are intricately linked through the estate. Anna’s disdain for Marbrisa sharply contrasts with her husband’s vision of it as his legacy. Meanwhile, Carmen's quest to uncover family secrets adds depth to her character. The dynamics between the sisters and Asher Wyatt further enhance the novel's intrigue.",
            "The author’s descriptive prose brings Marbrisa to life, vividly portraying both the estate's glamour and Miami's early 20th-century historical context. The novel skillfully explores the arrival of wealthy industrialists in Florida, emphasizing themes of wealth, legacy, and societal change.",

It’s a standout addition to Chanel Cleeton’s works and one I highly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book unfolds through two perspectives across different timelines: Anna in the 1920s and Carmen in the 1940s. Anna's husband has just completed a mansion on Biscayne Bay, where a celebratory party takes a dark turn when a woman drowns. Two decades later, Carmen arrives at the same house to reconnect with her estranged sister and begins to unravel the mansion's mysterious past, revealing that not everything is as it seems. While the mystery itself is engaging, I found some issues with the motive behind the murder—it left me questioning how it truly resolved the villain's problems. The dual timelines and perspectives enrich the narrative, yet the resolution of the mystery felt somewhat underdeveloped.",
            "Anna’s point of view captivated me with its authenticity and depth, while Carmen’s perspective seemed more like a means to unravel the mystery. Unfortunately, we learn little about her or the characters in her timeline, which diminished her appeal. Additionally, I would have appreciated more distinction in the voices of the two women.",
            "The author skillfully crafted a gothic atmosphere of tattered luxury that perfectly suits the book. The depiction of 1920s Miami is vivid and captivating, immersing the reader in its beauty and keeping me eagerly turning the pages."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this novel excels in its atmospheric setting and immersive portrayal of 1920s Miami. While the mystery and character development in Carmen’s timeline could have been stronger, Anna’s perspective and the gothic ambiance make it a compelling read.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  Cleeton did a fantastic job of creating the gothic and tattered luxury atmosphere this book deserved. The description of Miami in the 1920s was spot on and truly shone throughout the story. The setting was beautiful and immersive, keeping me engaged and turning the pages.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery itself was fine, though I had some issues with the motive for the murder. It’s possible I missed something, but I’m not sure how murder solved the villain’s issues. The dual timelines and POVs added an interesting layer to the story, but the mystery felt somewhat underdeveloped in terms of its resolution.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Anna’s POV captured me far more because it felt genuine and well-developed. In contrast, Carmen’s POV felt more like a vessel through which the mystery is solved. We never get to know much about her or any of the characters in her timeline, which made her perspective less compelling. I also wish the voices of the two women were more distinct.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book is told from two POVs in two different timelines: Anna in the 1920s and Carmen in the 1940s. Anna’s husband has just built a mansion on Biscayne Bay, and they throw a party where a woman drowns. Carmen arrives at the same house 20 years later to meet her estranged sister and begins to uncover the house’s history, discovering that not everything is as it should be.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel excels in its atmospheric setting and immersive portrayal of 1920s Miami. While the mystery and character development in Carmen’s timeline could have been stronger, Anna’s perspective and the gothic ambiance make it a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded up)."

However, the last few chapters redeemed the story for me. The author managed to wrap up what initially seemed like a convoluted mess quite nicely.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The setting was supposed to be Florida, but I found it very challenging to conjure up any sense of time or place. Simply sprinkling the text with references to alligators and heat didn’t effectively evoke the essence of Florida.\n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The first couple of chapters were particularly difficult to get through, and I almost didn’t want to continue reading. The pacing and initial engagement were lacking, which made the start of the book a struggle.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a rocky start with predictable elements and a lackluster sense of setting, the final chapters saved the experience for me. The author’s ability to tie everything together in the end made the journey worthwhile, despite the initial challenges.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As someone from a Cuban family, I felt something was missing in their portrayal.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Period Details:**  \n  - The book lacked the necessary details and research to fully immerse the reader in the time period.  \n  - I love period pieces, but this one fell short in capturing the essence of the era.  \n\n- **Setting and Local Details:**  \n  - I loved all the Miami details. As a Miamian, I appreciated the references to Miami landmarks, wildlife, and culture.  \n  - It was clear the author is a fellow Miamian, which added authenticity to the setting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book for its engaging plot and the fun, easy reading experience it provided. While I appreciated the authentic Miami details, the cultural representation of the Cuban characters and the historical accuracy of the time period felt lacking. Despite these shortcomings, it was an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Anna's tale begins with her husband Robert's unexpected decision to build Marbrisa as a gift, despite her unease with Florida’s climate. Meanwhile, Carmen, an orphan, arrives at Marbrisa and senses an ominous presence surrounding the estate and her sister Carolina. The alternating timelines create a palpable tension and intrigue, particularly with the whispers of a curse and the ghost of Anna.

The combination of Gothic Historical Fiction, a Miami setting, and a dual timeline intrigued me, making it an instant choice for me.\n\n- **Author’s Inspiration and Setting:**\n   - In the author’s note, Chanel Cleeton mentions being inspired by Florida’s landscape and wildlife, and this passion is evident throughout the story. The novel’s moody atmosphere, combined with its exploration of love, family, betrayal, and greed, is deeply rooted in the setting of Biscayne Bay.\n\n- **World-Building and Imagery:**\n   - The description of Marbrisa, the mansion, is vivid and haunting. I imagined it as a grand, imposing structure, much like Villa Vizcaya, which is described as a piece of Italy in Miami. The house’s eerie presence, surrounded by the swampy Florida landscape, adds to the Gothic tone of the story.\n\n- **Dual Timeline and Characters:**\n   - The dual timeline alternates between Anna Barnes in 1918 and Carmen in 1941. Anna’s story begins with her husband Robert’s surprising decision to build Marbrisa as a gift, despite her discomfort with Florida’s environment. Carmen, an orphan, arrives at Marbrisa in 1941 and senses something ominous about the estate and her sister Carolina. The alternating timelines build tension and mystery, especially with the rumors of a curse and a ghost named Anna.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Tension:**\n   - The novel’s atmosphere is enhanced by the screaming peacocks and the juxtaposition of the two timelines. The sense of dread and tension is palpable as the mysteries unfold: the deaths at Marbrisa, the curse, Anna’s fate, and Carmen’s strange behavior.\n\n- **Characterization and Writing Style:**\n   - While Anna and Carmen’s voices felt somewhat similar, the setting, descriptions, and world-building are exceptionally well-developed. The writing style is highly readable, with realistic dialogue and an effective point of view. The plot kept me engrossed from start to finish.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**\n   - The novel explores themes of marriage, sisterhood, feeling like an outsider, secrets, murder, and ghosts from the past. These elements create a rich, emotional narrative that resonated with me.\n\n- **Ending and Overall Impact:**\n   - The ending left me curious about Miami’s history and eager to read more of Cleeton’s work. The story’s blend of mystery, history, and Gothic elements made it a compelling read.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*The House on Biscayne Bay* is a captivating Gothic Historical Fiction novel that masterfully weaves together mystery, family dynamics, and a haunting setting. The dual timelines, vivid descriptions, and atmospheric tension kept me engaged throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed this tale and look forward to exploring more of Chanel Cleeton’s work, particularly *The Cuban Heiress*.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific numerical rating was provided in the review.

            "The story unfolds through the alternating perspectives of Anna Barnes, starting in 1918, and Carmen Acosta, beginning in 1941, both profoundly impacted by their experiences at Marbrisa. Anna's husband, Robert, constructs Marbrisa as a grand gift for her, but Anna feels uneasy about the opulence and prefers the vibrancy of New York City. Meanwhile, Carmen, an orphaned eighteen-year-old from Cuba, arrives at the estate to join her estranged sister Carolina and her husband Wyatt, driven by a desire to claim her inheritance. The narrative introduces mysterious elements—screaming peacocks, unexplained deaths, disappearances, strange noises, and hidden passageways. However, the novel struggles with building suspense; the ending feels abrupt and unanticipated, lacking foreshadowing. Ultimately, the house’s atmospheric presence overshadows the development of tension and intrigue.",
            "The characters in this story lack depth and emotional resonance, making them feel shallow and unrelatable. Carmen, at eighteen, comes across as much older, stripping her of the innocence typical for her age and reducing the reader's concern for her safety in perilous situations. Overall, the characters feel robotic and predictable, lacking the nuanced revelations needed to make them compelling or likable.",
            "Set in post-WWI Miami, this novel captures the influx of wealthy Americans arriving via Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway. At the heart of the story is Marbrisa, a grand mansion that evokes an unsettling atmosphere for all who enter. The house seems haunted by ghosts, curses, and malevolent spirits, reflecting the dark legacy of its owners.",
            "The author excels in chic lit, but the foray into mystery and gothic genres is less successful. The narrative leans too heavily on red herrings and superficial descriptions, failing to create a cohesive and engaging mystery."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the novel has an intriguing setting and atmospheric descriptions of Marbrisa, it struggles with shallow character development, predictable plotlines, and a lack of suspense. The abrupt ending and failure to build tension make it a less satisfying read, particularly for fans of mystery and gothic genres. The author's talent may be better suited to chic lit, where her strengths can shine.",

Anna's obliviousness to her husband's business dealings diminishes her relatability. Although Carmen exhibits more sass and initiative, her character development remains insufficient.

            "As an avid reader of the author's works, I must admit I was disappointed by her last book. However, with this latest novel, she is undoubtedly regaining her status as one of my favorite historical fiction writers. Although her previous books began to feel repetitive, this one offers a refreshing change. While it may not achieve a five-star rating for me, it stands as a solid entry in the genre.\n\nSet after World War I, the story follows Robert Barnes, a wealthy man who builds a mansion in Miami—a city that is quite different from what we know today. His wife, Anna, is far from pleased with their new home, and after her untimely death, the circumstances raise questions of accident versus murder. Years later, Carmen Acosta visits her sister, Carolina, who now resides in the estate. Unfortunately, Carolina also dies under mysterious circumstances, echoing Anna's fate. The novel weaves a compelling mystery as Carmen works to unravel the truth.\n\nOverall, the author’s willingness to explore new themes and settings in this book is commendable, signaling her potential for continued growth and creativity in her writing.",
            "Her books usually deliver, and I suspect her next one could be a five-star read. It remains in her favored genre of historical fiction and features a dual-timeline narrative, which I personally enjoy. The novel also delves into gothic elements, a genre I've only recently begun to explore and appreciate. As a gothic mystery, this marks a new direction for the author, and I hope she continues to write in this vein—until it no longer feels fresh."

While it may not yet reach five-star status for me, it is a solid and engaging read that showcases her ability to evolve as an author. I appreciate the new direction she has taken and look forward to her future works, which I believe have the potential to be even stronger.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Evolution and Consistency:**  \n   - I have read most of Chanel Cleeton's books and would describe myself as a fan.  \n   - The last book I read of hers before this one was a letdown, but with this novel, she is clawing her way back to the top of my go-to historical fiction writers.  \n   - For a while, her books started to feel similar, and I became less interested in her writing due to the sameness.  \n   - While this book is not a five-star read for me, it is a solid work of historical fiction and has a different feel than her previous books, which I think is a good thing.  \n   - Chanel Cleeton writes many books, and I believe that for an author to remain fresh, they sometimes need to change things up.  \n\n- **Genre and Style:**  \n   - This is still the genre she generally writes—historical fiction.  \n   - It is a dual-timeline story, which I tend to like.  \n   - The novel is also \"gothic,\" a genre I have only recently started to explore and enjoy.  \n   - As a \"gothic mystery,\" this is a very different direction for Ms. Cleeton, and I hope she continues to write books like this (until it no longer feels fresh).  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - After World War I, Robert Barnes, a wealthy man, has a mansion built in Miami. His wife, Anna Barnes, is not very happy about it because Miami then is not the Miami of today.  \n   - Anna dies, and there is the question of whether this was an accident or murder.  \n   - Many years later, Carmen Acosta visits her sister, Carolina, who now lives in this estate with her husband. Carolina dies under mysterious circumstances, much like Anna did.  \n   - This is a mystery, with Carmen unraveling it.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Expectations:**  \n   - Her books do not disappoint for the most part, and I am thinking her next one may be a five-star read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nChanel Cleeton's latest novel marks a refreshing departure from her previous works, blending historical fiction with gothic mystery. While it may not yet reach five-star status for me, it is a solid and engaging read that showcases her ability to evolve as an author. I appreciate the new direction she has taken and look forward to her future works, which I believe have the potential to be even stronger.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned, but implied to be less than five stars but still a solid effort."

            "The story unfolds through dual perspectives across two historical timelines—spanning the late 1910s to early 1920s and the 1930s.

            "This story unfolds across two timelines: shortly after WWI and just before WWII. It centers on Robert and Anna Barnes during the 1920s South Florida real estate boom, where they construct the fictional mansion Marbrisa. Two decades later, Carmen Acosta moves from Cuba to Miami to live with her sister Carolina and her husband Asher at Marbrisa, where she begins to uncover long-buried secrets. While the plot is somewhat predictable, it remains engaging enough to finish in a few days. The two time periods, however, feel too closely linked to create distinct atmospheres. I have a mixed relationship with this author; her first book didn't impress me, but her later novels have been decent. I keep returning to her work because she writes about familiar people and places, though this may be the last book of hers that I read.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Time Period:**  \n  The novel features an interesting setting and time period, with dual timelines. The first is set during the construction and completion of an opulent mansion in post-WWI Miami, where New York couple Anna and Robert Barnes settle into a new life. The second timeline is a couple of decades later, focusing on nineteen-year-old Carmen, who leaves Cuba after her parents' deaths to join her sister Carolina and her husband Asher at the now-notorious Marbrisa mansion.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I liked Anna and Carmen enough, as they were compelling protagonists. However, I wasn’t as invested in the other characters, many of whom felt a little flat and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Themes:**  \n  The novel successfully creates an uneasy Gothic vibe, with both Anna and Carmen feeling trapped in the gorgeous yet ominous house and in their own circumstances. The themes of entrapment and the house's tortured history involving death and possible murder added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  While the dual timelines maintained a good pace and were interesting, the mysteries themselves were underwhelming. The intrigue surrounding the house and its history didn’t captivate me as much as the commentary on Anna and Carmen’s lives and struggles.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  As a historical fiction melodrama, the novel was satisfying, offering a rich exploration of its characters' lives and the societal pressures they faced. However, as a mystery, it fell a bit short of expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The House on Biscayne Bay* is a solid historical fiction novel with an intriguing setting and strong Gothic undertones. While the mysteries were not as compelling as I had hoped, the exploration of the protagonists' lives and the atmospheric tension made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe review does not include specific numerical or star ratings. However, the overall sentiment suggests a moderate level of satisfaction, particularly for fans of historical fiction and melodrama."

            "The dual-story structure was engaging, and the interweaving of the two narratives was skillfully done. While I appreciated the mystery elements, it's not my favorite genre.",
            "Initially, it took me around 75 pages to connect with the story and its characters. The gothic elements, reminiscent of du Maurier, didn’t resonate since I have moved on from that style. However, Anna’s narrative, with its stronger romantic element, captured my attention more effectively. I did find myself questioning the characters’ ages at times, which was distracting, but ultimately I was able to move past it.",

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a fun read with a well-crafted dual narrative and strong historical context. While it took some time to fully engage with the story, the author’s writing and character development kept me invested.

The other timeline centers on Carmen, who moves from Havana to live with her sister and brother-in-law after the tragic loss of her parents. As the narratives converge, Carmen delves into the mysterious deaths and disappearances of women linked to the estate, including her sister, Carolina.

The mystery—unraveling the identity of the culprit—resembles a game of Clue, featuring an array of suspects: the husband, housekeeper, architect, and gardener. The story begins in 1918 with Anna, who is less than thrilled when her husband gifts her a mansion in Miami called Marbrisa. During a grand unveiling party, a woman's death casts a shadow over the estate. Fast forward to 1941, when Carmen arrives at Marbrisa to stay with her sister following their parents' death.

The house becomes a source of curiosity and scandal.  \n   - Twenty years later, Marbrisa is purchased by a young married couple, Asher and Carolina. When Carolina's parents pass away in Havana, her 18-year-old sister comes to live with them, and tragedy strikes again.  \n   - The central question revolves around whether the house and its secrets are the cause of the unfolding tragedies.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - It was a perfect read for spooky season!  \n   - The story was super interesting, and I couldn't put it down.  \n   - I expected a bit more romance, considering it was a Cleeton novel, but the story didn’t need it.

The Gothic mansion, Marbrisa, and its secrets created a captivating and spooky atmosphere, making it an engaging and unputdownable read.

            "The novel intertwines two captivating storylines: one set in 1918 featuring Anna in the burgeoning city of Miami, and the other in 1941 with Carmen. In the earlier timeline, Anna navigates life in a grand yet isolating house called Marbrisa, gifted to her by her husband, Robert. Meanwhile, in 1941, Carmen moves into Marbrisa after losing her parents in Cuba, delving into the mysteries surrounding two deaths from 1918.",

            "Set against the vibrant historical backdrop of Miami in 1918, a time marked by early development and significant investment from wealthy Northerners, this story offers a rich and immersive experience. The grand yet lonely Marbrisa house emerges as a powerful symbol of isolation and mystery, further amplifying the Gothic atmosphere.",
            "The novel weaves a Gothic mystery centered on two deaths in 1918, which drive Carolina's investigation and ultimately lead to her tragic end. The interconnectedness of these deaths, coupled with themes of trust, enhances the suspense and intrigue of the narrative."

            "*The House on Biscayne Bay* presents an engaging plot that weaves together two timelines: the opulent 1920s and the tumultuous 1940s. The 1920s segment showcases a post-World War I Florida, where individuals flock to create lavish homes, while the 1940s section reveals the shadow of World War II and its effects on American life. Central to the story are two independent women, Anna and Carmen, whose lives intersect through the enigmatic Marbrisa estate. The mystery surrounding the deaths at Marbrisa adds both intrigue and depth to the narrative.",

Her storyline, particularly the revelation of her cheating husband, came across as clichéd and anticlimactic.

I appreciated her dynamic with Nathaniel and wished they had more interactions; their banter was a standout element from the beginning.",

The resolution of Carmen’s story is quite predictable, which undermines the suspense's effectiveness.

Overall, I enjoyed the story despite its predictability.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some repetitive elements and pacing issues, the historical timelines, Gothic atmosphere, and strong characters made it an engaging read. Despite predicting the mysteries early, the story remained enjoyable and compelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While it touches on the post-WWI land boom in Florida, there is very little historical depth beyond that.  \n- **Plot Twists and Endings:** The mysteries in each timeline were intriguing and intertwined well. Both endings were surprising and not something I saw coming.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a good story with strong world-building and a well-executed dual timeline structure.

It grew on me as I continued reading.  \n\n- **Genre and Style:**  \n   - The novel has the feel of a gothic novel, which adds a unique and intriguing atmosphere to the story.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n   - Similar to the author’s other works, the story alternates between timelines spanning over 30 years, creating a layered and immersive narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial hesitation due to the departure from the author’s usual themes, I found myself increasingly drawn into the novel. Its gothic tone and the skillful use of dual timelines made it a compelling and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Years later, the story shifts to Carmen, who moves to Marbrisa to be with her sister after losing both her parents.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I loved the intertwining of the two women's stories and how the events during Anna's time in the house directly lead to Carmen's experiences there as well. The story is filled with murder, love, family dynamics, and suspicions of not knowing who to trust.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  The gothic atmosphere was just perfect for this story! It added depth and intrigue to the narrative.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you have never read this author before, I would recommend picking up this book or any of her previous works. All of them are fantastic!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating blend of mystery, romance, and family drama, set against a beautifully crafted gothic backdrop. The dual timelines and interconnected stories of Anna and Carmen make for a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Murder, obsession, and adultery abound.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I kept reading \"one more chapter\" and staying up past my bedtime because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I appreciate NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review an advanced copy of this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by Chanel Cleeton is a captivating departure from her previous family sagas, offering a richly atmospheric setting, a dual-timeline narrative, and a plot filled with intrigue and drama. The story's pacing and mysteries kept me thoroughly engaged, making it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"
