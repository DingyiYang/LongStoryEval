            "The story follows Eva as she leaves her mother and two brothers to attend university after her father’s betrayal leaves the family in financial ruin. After her father's death in prison, she struggles to make ends meet while living in a trailer park and working at a pizza place. A key figure in her life is Cole, who has been stalking her, and there’s a subplot involving a mysterious box left by her father. The narrative delves into Eva's strained family dynamics, her hardships with poverty, and her complicated relationship with Cole, who suddenly professes his love for her despite a history of bullying. However, the pacing is disjointed, with abrupt shifts in focus and unclear character motivations, particularly concerning Cole. Significant scenes, like the family dinner and the interactions surrounding the box, feel rushed and underdeveloped, making the storyline difficult to follow at times. Moreover, the romance between Eva and Cole comes across as forced; his sudden declaration of love and her swift forgiveness don’t resonate with their past, rendering the romantic subplot unconvincing.",
            "Eva is a resilient character grappling with her family’s decline and her father’s betrayal. Cole’s character is perplexing, shifting abruptly from bully to love interest without clear motivation. Ethan, Eva’s brother, displays a protective instinct by attempting to assist her financially, while their mother wrestles with the harsh new reality. The antagonistic father figures—Eva's dad and Cole's dad—heighten the conflict, with Cole's father emerging as the true villain behind their struggles. The exploration of family dynamics, particularly Eva's relationships with her mother and brothers, is a standout aspect, with the tensions surrounding financial hardships adding depth. However, the resolution of these dynamics feels unsatisfactorily incomplete.",
            "The novel delves into themes of betrayal, family loyalty, poverty, and forgiveness. Eva's journey illustrates how financial instability affects family dynamics and the challenges of overcoming betrayal. While forgiveness is a central theme, Eva's rapid forgiveness of Cole, despite his troubled past, raises questions about the complexities of healing."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The novel has an intriguing premise with its focus on betrayal, family struggles, and financial hardship. However, the execution falls short due to inconsistent character motivations, a rushed romantic subplot, and disjointed pacing. While the family dynamics are compelling, the overall story lacks coherence and depth, particularly in the development of the central romance.",

The narrative also explores Eva’s strained family dynamics, her struggles with poverty, and her complicated relationship with Cole, who suddenly declares his love for her despite a history of bullying.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Eva is portrayed as a resilient character dealing with her family’s downfall and her father’s betrayal.

However, this aspect should not influence the overall rating of the book itself.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, who are college-aged, felt underdeveloped. The dialogue was stiff and stilted, which made it hard to connect with them.

This dynamic felt outdated and uncomfortable.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Chemistry:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers trope was poorly executed. There was no genuine sense of tension or chemistry between the MMC and FMC. Even scenes meant to be sizzling with passion fell flat, making the romance unconvincing.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Interactions:**  \n  The dialogue between characters, particularly the MMC and his friends, was off-putting. One of the MMC’s friends was overly controlling, and their conversations felt unnatural and unpleasant.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The narrative was overly descriptive to the point of being tedious. Scenes were drawn out unnecessarily, making them boring and hard to engage with.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The plot felt loosely held together and lacked cohesion. It needed more development and strengthening to make the story compelling.  \n\n- **Missed Opportunities:**  \n  The role of the MMC’s father was a significant element in the story, but it was poorly handled. This felt like a missed opportunity to add depth and complexity to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book struggled with inconsistencies in character development, dialogue, and plot structure.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n  I went into this book thinking it would be an enemies-to-lovers romance, and to a certain extent, it is exactly that. However, as the story progresses, I became more inclined to think of it as a hidden crush story.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed every part of Poppy and Ethan's story. Their back-and-forth interactions were incredible to read, but it was when they couldn’t deny their true feelings for one another that made me love this story even more.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  There is a small bit of drama in the book, but each time the person involved tried to cause trouble, Ethan stepped up time and again. He came across as a lot older than his years, and it really showed how much Poppy meant to him.  \n\n- **Subplots and Future Potential:**  \n  There were a couple of sub-stories involving minor characters, and everything points to these being released as future books. If that is what is going to happen, I will definitely want to be reading them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations, blending elements of enemies-to-lovers and hidden crushes beautifully. Poppy and Ethan's relationship was compelling, and the minor subplots hinted at exciting future stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The separation between the main characters feels irreparable. The female main character (FMC) loses her entire life, including her father, and watches her mother deteriorate. Meanwhile, the male main character (MMC) seems to revel in her suffering, and I believe he would have needed to undergo significant personal growth to redeem himself, which never occurs. The story might have been more compelling if the FMC had transitioned from ultra-rich to middle class, her father had remained alive, and the downfall hadn’t been instigated by the MMC’s family. Overall, the plot was predictable and dull; by the 20% mark, I could foresee the entire trajectory of the story. Despite the characters having a prior connection, their relationship felt like insta-love, and I struggled to understand the basis for their affection, let alone their love for each other.",
