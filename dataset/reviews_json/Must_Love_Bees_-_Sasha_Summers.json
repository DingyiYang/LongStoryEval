I found Astrid and Charlie's relationship endearing, particularly when they finally came together. However, it felt somewhat unbalanced, as Astrid seemed to carry most of the emotional weight.

I appreciated how Astrid effectively navigated these barriers, helping to ease his stress. One of the most heartwarming moments was her ability to facilitate a deeper connection between Charlie and his daughters, showcasing her patience and understanding.",
