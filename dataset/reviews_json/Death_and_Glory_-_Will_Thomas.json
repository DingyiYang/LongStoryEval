            "This book presents a fascinating premise: a US Confederacy Treaty with Britain and a group of exiled individuals claiming to represent the Confederate States of America. Their goal is to secure an iron-clad boat purchased before the end of the Civil War but never delivered. The narrative follows Barker and Llewelyn as they work to verify the delegation's legitimacy and intentions, all while facing skepticism from both British officials and the Confederate group. The story is fast-paced and engaging, maintaining a sense of intrigue throughout. The suspense surrounding the authenticity of the documents and the true identities of the delegation members keeps readers captivated until the very end.",
            "Although many beloved characters are missing or reduced to cameo appearances, the emphasis on Barker and Llewelyn remains strong. Their dynamic and investigative skills shine through, establishing them as equals—if not superiors—to Holmes and Watson.",
            "The author solidifies his status as a worthy successor to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle with a compelling narrative that highlights his exceptional storytelling skills. This book proves that there are still plenty of engaging cases to explore.",
            "This novel skillfully weaves historical events, like the Trent Affair, with captivating conspiracy theories, such as Llewelyn’s claim that the supposed Confederate President is actually Jesse James and another delegate is John Wilkes Booth. Set in 1894, the narrative explores the enigmas surrounding the deaths of these notorious figures. The author's portrayal of Victorian London is particularly striking, immersing readers in the era's rich atmosphere through vivid descriptions and meticulous detail. The setting truly shines as a standout feature of the book."

        "conclusion": "This latest installment is a thrilling addition, blending historical intrigue, conspiracy theories, and Victorian charm. While some familiar characters take a backseat, the central mystery and the dynamic between Barker and Llewelyn ensure the story remains captivating.

It adds depth and authenticity to the story.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The story is well-plotted, with a complex and satisfying mystery that keeps the reader engaged.  \n\n- **Characterization (Thomas):**  \n  Thomas is snarky and remains an intriguing character, though I wish we could learn more about Barker.  \n\n- **Characterization (Rebecca and Philippa):**  \n  I was a little disappointed in the behavior of Rebecca and Philippa. They both acted out of character, and for a series with such a male-centric cast, it’s a letdown to see the only women reduced to jealousy and pretty gowns.  \n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  This book is a great addition to the series and might even entice new readers to go back to *Some Danger Involved* and start at the beginning.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some disappointments with the portrayal of female characters, the novel delivers a compelling mystery and maintains the high standards of the series in terms of historical setting and plot. It’s a strong addition that could attract new readers to the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot centers on a conspiracy theory in which men purporting to represent the Confederate States of America enlist Barker to facilitate a meeting with the Prime Minister to reclaim a battleship commissioned before the war's end. Tensions rise when Llewelyn suspects that two of these men are, in fact, John Wilkes Booth and Jesse James. They assert that they hold a treaty between England and the Confederacy that could jeopardize relations with the United States.",
            "Barker and Llewelyn make for an intriguing duo; Barker embodies the heroic archetype, while Llewelyn is more of a homebody. Llewelyn's wife, Rebecca, is Jewish—a fact that poses no issue for them but could create challenges in the broader society. Her mother disapproves of Llewelyn, feeling that Rebecca could have chosen better. Meanwhile, the charming yet menacing Southerners are gaining traction in their plan to revive the Confederacy and slavery, garnering support in both the U.S. and England.",

            "This novel marks the fifteenth installment in the Barker & Llewelyn series, set in 1894. The protagonists are approached by representatives of the Confederate States of America, who claim to be part of a secret society and heirs to a British warship. The mystery revolves around uncovering the true identities and motives of this group, revealing layers of complexity. The title, *Death and Glory*, aptly reflects the journeys of both the Confederates and the protagonists over the past decade, during which they have gained recognition and a royal warrant. Notably, the storyline shifts away from the traditional UK-focused mysteries, with London taking a back seat—a change that some readers may find disappointing.",
            "Barker and Llewelyn have evolved, their growing recognition altering their approach to crime-solving. The limited appearances of secondary characters offer a refreshing change, especially after their prominent roles in recent installments.",
            "The story spans both sides of the Atlantic, featuring London and its surroundings, though they are not central to the mystery. This departure from a traditionally British-focused narrative is noteworthy, and there is hope for a return to classic mysteries in future installments.",
            "The Confederates are captivating, though the shift away from a UK-centric storyline is noticeable. Still, the intricate mystery and the growth of the protagonists maintain the story's engagement."

            "The novel presents a fresh perspective on the Holmes/Watson relationship while delving into the dynamic between the UK and the Confederate government. Set against the backdrop of the Trent Affair—a critical moment in the early Civil War that nearly entangled the UK in the conflict—the author skillfully weaves this historical event into a narrative that unfolds thirty years later. Barker and Llewelyn work to secure an audience with the new Prime Minister regarding a delicate matter: individuals claiming to represent the Confederate government have produced a signed treaty linking the UK with the Rebels. The conclusion feels authentic, suggesting deeper layers to the cover-up than even the protagonists manage to reveal.",

            "In this caper, Barker and Llewelyn take on a case from a small group of alleged ex-Confederate soldiers who remain loyal to the Confederate cause. They seek assistance in arranging a meeting with the British Prime Minister to reclaim an ironclad warship purchased by the Confederacy thirty years earlier, which was never delivered due to the Civil War's end. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that this enigmatic group may not be who they claim to be, raising questions about their true intentions, the size of their group, and the potential for renewed conflict between the ex-Confederates and the United States. The narrative also examines the implications for American-British relations and the legitimacy of the agreement they seek to enforce. Barker and Llewelyn find themselves navigating not only this mysterious faction but also the British Prime Minister, a shadowy U.S. agent, and others in a pursuit where the hunters become the hunted.",
            "Cyrus Barker and his young partner, Llewelyn, are private enquiry agents in late Victorian London—though they prefer not to be called private detectives. Picture a brawny Sherlock Holmes, skilled in both combat and weaponry, ready to confront any threat. Llewelyn, smart, athletic, and strong, complements Cyrus’s more cerebral approach. While Cyrus can certainly ponder a case with the same intensity as Holmes, he is also a man of action with a thrilling past. Together, they form a dynamic duo of crime-solvers, tackling challenges with both intellect and physical prowess.",
            "The author's characterizations and vivid descriptions of 1894 London are exceptional. You can almost feel the fog enveloping you as you navigate a dimly lit street toward a pub that has been in business for over a century (and is still operating in 2024). The story is filled with action, offering mental challenges regarding the who, what, and why that engage any armchair detective. While it may not possess the same intellectual depth as a Sherlock Holmes tale, the surprising action sequences maintain interest and propel the narrative at a brisk pace.",
            "Upon reading the first novel, I quickly became addicted, and after devouring fourteen in total, my admiration for the writing, the late 19th-century London setting, and the rich characterizations remains strong. The latest installment, *Death and Glory*, met all my expectations, solidifying the author's status among the great adventure-suspense writers. I highly recommend it to fans of Victorian-era mystery-action stories. The author masterfully captures the essence of Victorian London—its pubs, streets, and local highlights—creating an immersive experience that transports readers directly into the era. Filled with action and sprinkled with historical context, this book is a thrilling read."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Death and Glory* is a thrilling addition, showcasing the author’s mastery of adventure-suspense storytelling. With its vivid Victorian London setting, engaging characters, and a plot full of action and intrigue, this novel is a must-read for fans of the genre.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Consistency and Quality:**  \n   - I became addicted to the Barker & Llewelyn series by Will Thomas upon reading the first one, and fourteen novels later, my appreciation for the writing, the settings of late 19th century London, and the great characterizations hasn’t abated.  \n   - His latest, *Death and Glory*, fulfilled all my expectations and I believe puts Will Thomas into the ranks as one of the great adventure-suspense writers around.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Cyrus Barker and his young partner Thomas Llewelyn are private enquiry agents (don’t dare call them private detectives!) in late Victorian London.  \n   - Think of a Sherlock Holmes with muscle, who is handy with his fists and adept with various weapons to thwart any attacker.  \n   - Thomas Llewelyn is a young, smart, athletic, and strong Watson to Cyrus’s Sherlock.  \n   - While Cyrus is certainly smart and can sit with pipe in hand and brood about the facts of a case as easily as Sherlock, he is also a man of action with a varied and exciting past.  \n   - Together, the two are an intrepid pair of crime-solvers.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - This caper finds them accepting a case from a small group of alleged ex-Confederate soldiers, still loyal to the Confederate cause, who seek Barker’s help in setting up a meeting with the British Prime Minister.  \n   - Their goal is to retrieve what they believe is rightly theirs—an ironclad warship purchased by the Confederacy thirty years before from the British but never delivered due to the end of the Civil War.  \n   - It develops that this strange group may not be who they claim to be, raising questions about their real mission, the size of their group, and the potential for war between the ex-Confederates and the United States.  \n   - The story also explores the implications for relations between America and England and the authenticity of the agreement they are seeking to enforce.  \n   - Barker and Llewelyn soon find themselves dealing with not only the mysterious group but also the British Prime Minister, a mysterious agent of the United States, and other individuals involved in a chase where the hunters are also the hunted.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n   - As usual, Will Thomas’ characterizations are spot on, as are his detailed descriptions of 1894 London.  \n   - It’s hard not to feel the fog slowly covering you as you trod down a dimly lit street toward a pub that has been in business for over 100 years (and is still serving in 2024).  \n   - The action is plentiful, and there are enough mental exercises regarding the who, what, and why to keep the armchair detective engaged.  \n   - While perhaps lacking the mental rigor of a Sherlock Holmes story, the action sequences—with their surprising beginnings and endings—keep the reader’s interest and move the story along at a solid pace.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Appeal:**  \n   - Highly recommend. This series is for those who love Victorian-era mystery-action stories.  \n   - Mr. Thomas has a firm and effective grasp of Victorian London, its pubs, streets, and other local highlights, which puts the reader in a “you are there” mode throughout.  \n   - The book is action-packed with some history thrown in.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death and Glory* is a thrilling addition to the Barker & Llewelyn series, showcasing Will Thomas’s mastery of adventure-suspense storytelling. With its vivid Victorian London setting, engaging characters, and a plot full of action and intrigue, this novel is a must-read for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nFive stars!"

While the ebook was still enjoyable, I would have liked to hear the narrator perform the Confederate southern drawl, as I couldn't quite get Barker's voice right in my head.\n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  Though the book is set in London, I appreciated the inclusion of a little U.S. history lesson, which added depth to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was enjoyable, but I feel the audiobook format would have enhanced my experience, particularly with the accents and character voices. The historical elements, despite the London setting, were a pleasant surprise.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The background of the story, set in 1894, involves Confederate patriots attempting to equip themselves with a warship to resume their battle for independence.\n   - Some events and people alluded to are real, such as the Trent Affair (1861) and Jubal Swindell, who appears in a dramatic prologue. Others might be real, but their identities are uncertain.\n   - The author’s note at the end provides some clarity on what was historically accurate, which I found interesting, though I wished it had been longer.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The idea of Confederate leaders persisting in their patriotic goal for three decades was fascinating. However, their characters never fully came alive for me, which made it harder to connect with them emotionally.\n\n- **Plot Engagement and Resolution:**\n   - While there is a lot of action, the actual plot was surprisingly not very engaging. Additionally, some elements were left unresolved by the end of the book, leaving me feeling a bit unsatisfied.\n\n- **Series Continuity and Reading Order:**\n   - I enjoyed the early books in the Barker and Llewellyn series, but I stopped after book 4. As a result, I wasn’t up to date on significant events in the protagonists’ lives. While it’s not absolutely necessary to read the books in order, I would recommend doing so. I plan to go back and fill in the gaps.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - Despite some shortcomings, the historical premise was intriguing, and I appreciated the blend of fact and fiction. I would recommend this book to fans of historical mysteries, especially those who have followed the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis fifteenth installment in the Barker and Llewellyn series offers a clever mix of historical events and investigative drama, though the plot and character development fell short of fully engaging me.

The detecting duo spends a significant portion of the book infiltrating the Confederate delegation to investigate their motives and legitimacy. However, the mystery lacks depth and can be solved quite easily, missing the intricate detection methods found in previous installments. The reliance on signature verification as a crucial plot point feels underwhelming, as the determination of validity seems more reliant on guesswork than solid evidence.",
