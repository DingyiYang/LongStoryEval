The suggestion that Antonela has control over Estela's body feels unnecessary and undermines the story's earlier developments.",

While Estela's shift from fear to intense love could be attributed to her youth and emotional turmoil, Sebasti√°n‚Äôs feelings develop too quickly. His choice to forgo a chance to return home and bind himself in a vampire marriage comes across as abrupt.",

It‚Äôs a unique gothic tale with surprising twists and turns.  \n  - The world-building and lore surrounding the castle and its history were well-executed and appreciated.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Tone:**  \n  - As a YA novel, it sometimes felt a bit juvenile, particularly in the romance department.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Bastian‚Äôs character lacked depth, which made him feel shallow.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The romance lacked tension and didn‚Äôt resonate with me.  \n  - The development of the romance felt underdeveloped and didn‚Äôt add much to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  - The story took some unexpected turns, which I found intriguing.  \n  - However, the progression in the second half didn‚Äôt work for me, as it relied on a trope I‚Äôm not particularly fond of.  \n\n- **Personal Preference vs. General Appeal:**  \n  - While I didn‚Äôt enjoy certain aspects, I can see how many readers might appreciate the way the story unfolds.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Castle of the Cursed* is a unique gothic novel with strong world-building and lore. While the romance and character depth fell short for me, fans of gothic stories will likely find it worth reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "The story is filled with engaging twists and turns, complemented by introspective moments in which Estela confronts her trauma and unravels the mysteries around her. While a romantic subplot is woven in, it feels somewhat rushed and falls into the ‚Äúinsta-love‚Äù trope, marking a minor drawback for me. Set in an eerie Spanish town with a cursed castle, this narrative offers a fresh take on the haunted house theme. After surviving a tragic subway accident that claimed her parents, Estela moves in with long-lost relatives, and the town‚Äôs mysterious, unsettling atmosphere deepens the tension throughout the tale.",
            "In this compelling story, Estela wrestles with survivor's guilt and grief, haunted by the nagging question of whether she could have saved her parents. Her determination to uncover the castle's secrets propels the narrative forward. The family she stays with is distant and enigmatic, offering only vague warnings that intensify her curiosity and urge to explore.",
            "The novel skillfully blends dark and creepy elements with touches of humor and heart, ensuring it never veers into overwhelming grimness.",
            "The novel confronts intense themes, including grief, suicide, mental health challenges, parental loss, sex, and violence. The author provides an explicit warning, urging readers to ensure they are in the right mindset before diving in."

That saved this book from a 1-star rating.  \n\n- **Insta-Love Romance:**  \n  The insta-love was the real culprit. I‚Äôve read and disliked insta-love before, but never have I ever gagged to myself while reading one. The romance between Estela and Sebastian was cringe-worthy, especially the ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù scene. It was hard to believe they were dating after knowing each other for less than a fortnight. The blood-sharing ‚Äúproposal‚Äù moment was the cherry on top of this absurdity.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The main character meets the vampire, questions if he‚Äôs a figment of her imagination, they kiss, break up, engage in questionable intimacy, and devote their lives to each other‚Äîall in the span of 13 days. It felt rushed and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Ending and Epilogue:**  \n  The last sentence in the epilogue got my brain swirling. I‚Äôm inclined to love endings that make you second-guess, and this one did just that. However, I‚Äôm still unsure about its true meaning.  \n\n- **Secret Message in the Hardcover:**  \n  The secret message on the hardcover copy was intriguing. I tried to solve it before reading the book but gave up, thinking it was gibberish. After finishing the book, I revisited it and cracked the code (it reads: Twin Antonela). I was hoping it would reveal the true meaning behind the ending, but it didn‚Äôt clarify much.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  No hate to the author‚ÄîI thought this book had some really fun parts, but overall, it was a no from me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the gothic imagery and setting were captivating, the insta-love romance, rushed plot, and questionable character dynamics overshadowed the book‚Äôs strengths.

However, as the narrative progressed, the pacing slowed considerably, and the plot stagnated for a while. Around the 30% mark, the introduction of numerous questions, characters, and a complex magic system caused confusion.

Initially, the narrative unfolds logically, as she applies skills taught by her father and moves to a haunting castle in Spain. The introduction of supernatural elements and her struggle with sanity adds depth. However, the plot soon spirals into telenovela absurdity, featuring convoluted twists that are challenging to follow and hard to take seriously. The epilogue further diminishes the story, as the protagonist contradicts her earlier moral convictions by resorting to murder, resulting in an unsatisfying and inconsistent conclusion.",
            "In this story, the protagonist, Estela, begins as a relatable figure fueled by grief and curiosity but quickly devolves into an unlikable and irrational character. The love interest, Sebastian, is introduced as a mysterious presence but quickly reveals himself to be a problematic and unconvincing partner. Supporting characters, such as the fanatical friend, are underdeveloped, adding to the narrative's chaotic atmosphere. Overall, the characters lack depth, and their actions often feel contrived or inconsistent.\n\nThe romance between Estela and Sebastian is particularly weak, marked by a lack of chemistry and an over-reliance on physical attraction rather than genuine emotional connection. Their relationship feels superficial, with grand declarations of love that seem insincere given their limited time together. Additionally, their interactions raise concerns due to instances of non-consensual behavior and a lack of meaningful development. The physical aspects of their relationship are awkwardly portrayed, featuring unrealistic details that ultimately detract from the story's credibility.",

The writing style is inconsistent; while there are moments of clarity, they are often overshadowed by absurd and nonsensical plot developments. Additionally, the pacing is uneven, starting slowly before rapidly descending into chaos."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  - The beginning was intriguing, with the protagonist's parents dying under mysterious circumstances and her quest to uncover the truth.  \n  - The story initially made sense, with her using skills taught by her father and moving to a creepy castle in Spain.  \n  - The introduction of supernatural elements and the protagonist questioning her sanity added some intrigue.  \n  - However, the plot quickly devolved into \"telenovela insanity,\" with nonsensical twists and turns that were hard to follow or take seriously.  \n  - The epilogue worsened the story, with the protagonist contradicting her earlier moral stance and engaging in murder, which felt inconsistent and unsatisfying.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - The protagonist, Estela, starts as a relatable character driven by grief and curiosity but becomes increasingly irrational and unlikable.  \n  - Sebastian, the love interest, is introduced as a mysterious figure but quickly becomes a problematic and unconvincing romantic partner.  \n  - The supporting characters, like the fanatical friend, are underdeveloped and contribute to the story's chaotic feel.  \n  - The characters lack depth, and their actions often feel contrived or inconsistent with their established traits.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The romance between Estela and Sebastian is poorly developed, with zero chemistry and a reliance on physical attraction rather than emotional connection.  \n  - Their relationship feels hollow, with grand declarations of love that come across as insincere given the short time they've known each other.  \n  - The romantic interactions are problematic, including instances of non-consensual behavior and a lack of meaningful development.  \n  - The physical aspects of their relationship are awkwardly handled, with unrealistic and convenient details that detract from believability.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The tone shifts dramatically from a serious mystery to a chaotic, over-the-top drama that feels out of place in a fantasy novel.  \n  - The writing style is inconsistent, with moments of clarity overshadowed by absurd and nonsensical plot developments.  \n  - The story's pacing is uneven, with a slow start followed by a rapid descent into chaos.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - The book was a painful read, with the only redeeming quality being the intriguing beginning.  \n  - The nonsensical plot, unlikable characters, and poorly developed romance made it difficult to finish.  \n  - The epilogue further diminished any remaining enjoyment, leaving a sour impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel started with promise but quickly spiraled into a chaotic and unsatisfying mess. The plot became nonsensical, the characters were unlikable and inconsistent, and the romance was poorly developed and problematic. While the beginning was intriguing, the rest of the book was a struggle to finish, and the epilogue only made things worse. I cannot recommend this book to anyone.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars (with an extra half star for the intriguing beginning)."

            "The plot follows Estela as she transitions from a mental institution in the US to her enigmatic aunt Beatriz's mysterious Gothic castle in Spain. The eerie castle is rife with secrets, boasting hidden rooms and a vampire that only Estela can see. With its blend of supernatural elements, family secrets, and unexpected twists, the story captivates with both thrills and intrigue.",

Her journey through grief and her encounters with the supernatural are central to the narrative. Aunt Beatriz's eerie and enigmatic presence further enhances the Gothic atmosphere. While the romance embodies a \"love conquers all\" theme that I found less appealing, it remains a subplot that does not overshadow the main story.",

The twists were either underwhelming or they came completely out of left field in a way that was entirely unsatisfying. While a lot of the mysteries Estela had to uncover were set up in an interesting way, the answers were always so‚Ä¶ boring. I had a really hard time staying engaged with the story because of this.  \n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was absolutely terrible. It wasn‚Äôt done tastefully at all, and it became a way bigger part of the story than it needed to be. It honestly felt like the author threw in a romance just because romantasy with a brooding, scary love interest is what‚Äôs popular right now. The love interest was cool on his own (I guess), but he had absolutely no chemistry with Estela, and it led to some incredibly awkward and laughably bad ‚Äúspicy‚Äù scenes. Plus, it was just plain corny.  \n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The whole book was a bit too melodramatic for my tastes, but the romance especially was just so cheesy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I finished this book feeling really unsatisfied and disappointed. While the castle setting and a few atmospheric scenes were highlights, the underwhelming mystery, poorly executed romance, and melodramatic tone made it a letdown.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI‚Äôm probably being a little harsh with this rating, but the ending was so off-putting that I can‚Äôt bring myself to rate this the 2 stars I planned on giving it."

            "This story is incredibly rich and thought-provoking, exploring dark themes with remarkable depth. The plot twists are truly insane, particularly the revelation of the protagonist's evil twin, who remains malevolent throughout. The contrasting childhood experiences in different dimensions‚Äîwhere time stands still and children are sacrificed to a ravenous castle‚Äîadd layers to the narrative. \n\nThe twist of her vampire boyfriend being an evil Iron Prince from another realm is unexpectedly compelling, especially as he begins to experience more than just hatred and violence due to his relationship with her. The ending is fantastic, with Estela giving her boyfriend criminals to hunt within their castle, highlighting a chilling yet fitting resolution. Overall, this story captivates with its intriguing concepts and dark allure.",
            "Estela Br√°laga witnesses the tragic deaths of her parents and everyone around her, leaving her as the sole survivor. Subsequently, she is confined to a mental health institution and falls silent. Felipe is a character I initially loved but ultimately despised due to his assault on Estela. While he expressed regret for his actions, I still questioned whether he deserved to die. \n\nEstela's life takes another turn when her aunt Beatriz invites her to the family castle, La Sombra. There, she encounters a trapped vampire named Sebasti√°n. The plot thickens with Estela's aunt administering suspicious pills, her deceased father‚Äôs lessons in deduction, and the revelation that the aunt runs a clinic while the townsfolk unknowingly donate blood to sustain the castle. This intricate web of intrigue is truly brilliant.",
            "The writing occasionally evoked a Wattpad vibe, particularly with its detailed descriptions of outfits and meals, as well as the use of all-caps for yelling. There were elements I didn't enjoy, such as Estela's interactions with the vampire at just 17, but I recognize this fits within the book's overall creepy atmosphere.",

Despite the dark fantasy elements, these themes added emotional weight to the story. The ending was bold and unexpected, leaving me reeling in the best way possible.  \n\n- **Originality and Depth:**  \n  The rich family history and the tangled webs of secrets went beyond my initial expectations, adding a unique and captivating element to the story. The author's ability to weave together gothic, supernatural, and emotional elements made the novel stand out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Castle of the Curse* delivered a gothic, supernatural adventure that exceeded my expectations at every turn. With its immersive atmosphere, complex characters, and emotionally charged themes, it‚Äôs a book I highly recommend to anyone craving a deeply engaging fantasy experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance in *Castle of the Cursed* is sweet, though some scenes feel unnecessary, and the timeline for the characters' love feels rushed in light of other events. However, the epilogue effectively ties the romance together with a time jump, enhancing its believability. This PG-Gothic Horror novel delves into themes of morbidity, curses, and monsters while maintaining an eerie atmosphere. The story centers on Estela, the sole survivor of a train wreck, as she grapples with the loss of her parents and unravels her family's mysterious past. The engaging plot follows Estela's move to Spain to live with her aunt, as she seeks to understand the reasons behind her parents‚Äô departure from their homeland.",

I was in awe at the creativity of Romina Garber to think of a \"character\" like that.  \n\n- **Ending Impact:**  \n  The last four words of the book left me screaming, yelling, and frantically trying to flip the page to read more. It was a bold and impactful ending that left me wanting more.  \n\n- **Personal Experience:**  \n  I‚Äôm happy I stepped out of my comfort zone to read this one. It was a refreshing and enjoyable experience, and I‚Äôm grateful to NetGalley, Author Romina Garber, and St. Martin‚Äôs Press/Wednesday Books for the ARC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Castle of the Cursed* by Romina Garber was an enjoyable read despite some pacing and organizational issues. The plot‚Äôs originality and the intriguing character of La Sombra kept me hooked, and the ending left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, around the midpoint, the pacing slowed significantly, and it became a struggle to continue reading. The narrative felt disjointed and chaotic, which detracted from the overall experience.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The sudden shift in Sebastian‚Äôs character, where he becomes madly in love, felt abrupt and unconvincing. Additionally, the introduction of a miscellaneous character (the uncle) seemed random and poorly integrated into the story, further disrupting the flow.\n\n- **Plot Consistency:**  \n  The plot lacked consistency, especially in the second half. The story felt all over the place, with events and character actions that didn‚Äôt align well with the established narrative. A more structured and coherent plot progression would have greatly improved the book.\n\n- **Potential and Execution:**  \n  The book had immense potential, as evidenced by the strong start and the intriguing premise. However, the execution fell short due to the lack of a well-defined narrative arc and inconsistent pacing. With more attention to these elements, the story could have been truly remarkable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Castle of the Cursed* began with promise, it ultimately failed to maintain its momentum and coherence. The engaging start was overshadowed by a disjointed second half, abrupt character shifts, and an inconsistent plot. Despite its potential, the book left me feeling disappointed and wishing for a more polished and cohesive narrative.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel opens with an intriguing premise: Estela, the protagonist, loses her parents in a tragic subway accident and soon finds herself in the media spotlight. She is sent to a mental health facility until her estranged aunt invites her to live in the enigmatic village of Oscuro, Spain. The setting, complete with a castle and a shadowy creature, promises an exciting narrative. However, the plot quickly becomes convoluted, introducing bizarre twists like a vampiric house, a vampire prince from another dimension, magical powers linked to twins, and a deadly sibling rivalry. While the first half of the story is engaging, the second half overwhelms the reader and becomes difficult to follow.",
            "Estela's journey is the heart of the story, showcasing her admirable resilience in the face of tragedy. However, the introduction of her twin, Antonella, initially suggested a compelling dynamic that could blossom into a strong bond. Instead, their relationship spirals into a life-or-death struggle, which feels disappointing and emotionally jarring. While other characters, like the aunt and the village boy, contribute to the eerie atmosphere, they ultimately lack depth.",
            "The novel masterfully establishes a gothic, haunting atmosphere, especially through its vivid depictions of Oscuro and the shadow creature. The immersive writing draws readers into its eerie world. However, the pacing falters due to an overabundance of plot twists, which undermine the story's coherence and emotional resonance.",
            "The story delves into profound themes of grief, trauma, and survival, though its execution varies in effectiveness. While certain moments resonate deeply and provoke reflection, others come off as excessively sensational, especially the violent sibling rivalry. This chaotic plot somewhat undermines the emotional depth of Estela's journey."

        "conclusion": "While the novel starts with a strong premise and a captivating gothic atmosphere, it becomes bogged down by an excessive number of outlandish plot twists and underdeveloped character dynamics. Despite its flaws, it offers a chaotic and wild ride that may appeal to fans of niche gothic literature. However, it falls short of its potential due to its lack of coherence and emotional depth.",

She is sent to a mental health facility until her estranged aunt invites her to live in a mysterious village in Spain called Oscuro. The setting, including a castle and a shadowy creature, initially holds great promise. However, the plot becomes increasingly convoluted with numerous outlandish twists, such as a vampiric house, a vampire prince from another dimension, magical powers tied to twins, and a deadly sibling rivalry.

The mystery unfolds as Estela explores the castle and uncovers the town's history, adding to the eerie and off-kilter feeling that permeates the story.  \n\n- **Character Development (Estela):**  \n  Estela is a compelling protagonist whose grief and mental illness are portrayed with depth and emotional impact. Her sense of isolation and the additional losses she experiences make her journey poignant. Her internal conflict about whether it‚Äôs worth fighting or trying to win adds layers to her character.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Development (Bastian):**  \n  The romance and Bastian‚Äôs character arc fell flat for me. His personality and priorities change too abruptly, making his transformation and sudden devotion to Estela feel unconvincing. I struggled to understand what he specifically saw in her, as the buildup to his feelings lacked sufficient development.  \n\n- **Language and Cultural Elements:**  \n  As a Spanish learner at a similar level to Estela, I found the inclusion of Spanish dialogue and Estela‚Äôs thought process while translating to be a delightful and relatable aspect of the book. It added a unique layer of engagement that I appreciated.  \n\n- **Plot and Genre Appeal:**  \n  The book shines in its portrayal of a creepy, gothic castle and a sinister, supernatural plot. Readers who enjoy these elements will find the story particularly captivating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivers a dark, immersive gothic atmosphere and a compelling protagonist in Estela, though the romance and Bastian‚Äôs character development felt underdeveloped. The inclusion of Spanish language elements added a unique and enjoyable touch. Overall, it‚Äôs a strong pick for fans of gothic settings and supernatural mysteries.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75/5"

The early discussions around depression and grief were compelling, and the setup was solid. The setting was intriguing, and I appreciated the playful formatting and alternative reading experiences.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  After the initial setup, the plot fell apart for me. It became convoluted and strange, with every fantasy and mystery trope thrown in and mixed up in ways that didn‚Äôt make sense. This lack of cohesion took all impact out of the narrative. The book felt like many different things at many different moments, with no tangible identity. I believe it would have been more successful if it had focused on one central theme or direction.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The romance annoyed me due to its strange pacing and unresolved issues with consent. While I understand that the characters involved are either very young, very vulnerable, or morally grey, I was unsatisfied with how these complexities were handled.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started strong with an intriguing setup and thoughtful exploration of heavy themes, it ultimately lost its way with a convoluted plot and unsatisfying romance.

            "I found Estela to be a captivating protagonist. Her battles with PTSD, survivor's guilt, and the shortcomings of the mental health system were deeply moving. Her fear of abandonment and feeling of isolation were particularly heartbreaking, making me root for her to discover happiness and inner strength.

However, his world and history felt underdeveloped, leaving me wanting more depth.",

Although the story presents a sprawling universe reminiscent of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it feels hurried, leaving many questions unresolved.

Her fear of abandonment and belief that she‚Äôs alone were heartbreaking, and I rooted for her to find happiness and strength.\n\n- **Character Development (Sebasti√°n):**\n  - Sebasti√°n, the dark, brooding vampire, had a tragic backstory that tugged at my heartstrings, especially the part involving harm to animals.

The story introduces a massive universe (comparable to the Marvel Cinematic Universe), but it felt rushed and left too many questions unanswered. Sebasti√°n‚Äôs world, in particular, was underexplored, including details about his father, their wars, and their discovery of humans.

            "The book starts strong with a captivating premise, featuring a mystery, dark gothic tones, and an eerie castle. Estela, the protagonist and sole survivor of a subway tragedy, grapples with survivor's guilt, depression, and suicidal thoughts as she seeks to uncover the truth about her parents' deaths and the secrets of Castle La Sombra. The early chapters are engaging, particularly highlighting Estela‚Äôs background in mystery-solving and her father's investigative insights. However, the introduction of romance and spice felt forced, disrupting the story's flow. By the time the plot twist emerged, my interest had already waned. Although the book had potential, it failed to sustain its initial momentum. The added spice scenes felt unnecessary, and the plot twist, while intriguing, arrived too late to reignite my engagement.",

The romance between Estela and Sebast√≠an felt hurried and forced, transitioning from hostility to love and a profound bond in just 13 days. This shallow portrayal left me indifferent to their relationship, ultimately diminishing my enjoyment of the story.",

            "The story's unexpected twists kept me thoroughly engaged. Estela's journey to uncover her family's dark past is filled with surprising revelations that are skillfully executed. The exploration of family secrets and her lineage adds significant depth to the narrative. I particularly enjoyed how the plot consistently defied predictability, keeping me guessing throughout.",
            "Initially, Estela comes across as an unreliable narrator due to her traumatic past, which includes the death of her parents and her struggles with PTSD. This uncertainty about her memories deepened my investment in her journey. Her character arc, which explores her growth amid grief and trauma, is compelling. The story features a paranormal romance with Sebasti√°n, a dark presence trapped in the castle who is visible only to Estela. His revelation as a vampire suits the gothic atmosphere, and I typically enjoy paranormal romances; however, I found the chemistry between Estela and Sebasti√°n lacking. Although there were heated moments, their connection felt rushed and flat, especially considering Estela's trauma. I wished for more build-up to their attraction.",
            "This book masterfully captures gothic vibes. Estela relocates to the decaying Spanish castle, La Sombra, to live with her estranged aunt. The castle's dark and crumbling aura breeds a sense of unease, as Estela feels a haunting presence watching her. The surrounding town enriches the castle's lore and hints at the influence of the families who have resided there, almost as though they govern the town. This setting beautifully complements the story's mysterious and eerie tone. "

Estela moves in with her estranged aunt who lives in a Spanish castle called La Sombra. The castle is dark, falling apart, and old, creating a sense of unease as Estela feels like someone is watching her. The town surrounding La Sombra adds to the lore of the castle and the families who have lived there, almost as if they rule the town. The setting perfectly complements the story‚Äôs mysterious and eerie tone.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The story takes unexpected turns, which I found engaging. Estela uncovers her family‚Äôs dark past, and the revelations are both surprising and well-executed. The themes of family secrets and the exploration of her lineage add depth to the narrative. I appreciated how the plot kept me guessing and didn‚Äôt follow predictable paths.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Estela feels like an unreliable narrator at first due to her traumatic past, including the death of her parents and her struggles with PTSD. This uncertainty about her memories made me more invested in her journey. Her growth throughout the story is strong, and I found her character arc compelling as she navigates grief and trauma.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  There is a paranormal romance in the story involving Sebasti√°n, a dark presence trapped in the castle who only Estela can see. The revelation that he‚Äôs a vampire fits well with the gothic atmosphere, and I typically enjoy paranormal romance. However, I didn‚Äôt feel the chemistry between Estela and Sebasti√°n. While there were heated moments, their connection felt flat and too rushed, especially given Estela‚Äôs trauma. I wish there had been more build-up to their attraction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book‚Äôs unexpected, twisty, and mysterious journey, as well as its strong gothic atmosphere and Estela‚Äôs compelling character growth. However, I felt the romance lacked depth and wished it had been more developed rather than feeling like insta-love.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The initial setup is intriguing, and the castle's gloomy atmosphere is vividly portrayed, keeping me fully engaged. However, the plot takes an unexpected and multi-dimensional turn halfway through that feels out of place and disrupts the narrative flow. As a result, the strong atmosphere and spooky elements fade, which is disappointing. The ending, however, shines by tying the story together in a satisfying manner. Yet, this strong conclusion is insufficient to redeem the weaker middle section of the book.",

While Estela‚Äôs quest to uncover the truth about her parents‚Äô deaths is engaging, the supporting cast lacks depth.

Garber excels at creating vivid imagery of the rooms in all their chilling glory. The castle offered just enough shrouded mystery to ensnare family members who ceaselessly hunger for more‚Äîwealth, time, knowledge, etc. It could give them what they‚Äôre looking for, but the cost isn‚Äôt always what they anticipated.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Estela‚Äôs character was well done. Her struggles after the accident that claimed her parents made her feel realistic and relatable. It was a constant battle for her to navigate life, especially when faced with one curveball after another. The supporting cast was also well-developed, though I wish we had more background on them.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship:**  \n  Sebastian and Estela‚Äôs relationship felt slightly shallow, lacking a solid foundation or groundwork.

Sebasti√°n, the hot paranormal love interest, is intense, enigmatic, and striking. His unpredictable nature kept me on my toes, making his character arc one of the highlights of the story.\n\n- **Themes and Genre:**  \n  The book blends mystery, heartbreak, romance, and paranormal elements seamlessly. Fans of gothic and paranormal romance will find it hard to resist. The story‚Äôs themes of loss, bravery, and uncovering hidden truths resonate deeply.\n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  If you enjoyed *Mexican Gothic*, *Stalking Jack the Ripper*, and *What the River Knows*, this book is a must-read. It shares the same dark, mysterious, and romantic vibes that fans of these works will appreciate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Castle of the Cursed* is a gripping gothic paranormal romance filled with secrets, shocking twists, and unforgettable characters. The atmospheric setting, intense romance, and strong FMC make it a page-turner that‚Äôs hard to put down.

The main character quickly shifts from being mute and suicidal due to trauma to falling in love with a shadow beast within two days, even though this creature had threatened her life just a day earlier.

The protagonist's inner thoughts and monologues offered no justification for their rapid transition to love.",

He seemed like a nice guy, but his fixation was very unhealthy.  \n  - **Uncle Teo:** He was a douchebag.  \n  - **Sebastian:** Needed work. His behavior was inconsistent‚Äîone minute threatening to kill Estella, the next catering to her every need.  \n  - **The Sister (Villain):** I‚Äôm confused about her character. Was she a psychopath from the start, or did her experience at the other castle ruin her? It was suggested she was rotten from the beginning.

Set in a gothic fantasy world filled with a mysterious ancestral castle, family secrets, and supernatural elements, the story has great potential. However, the execution ultimately falls short. The plot feels underdeveloped, and many anticipated moments fail to deliver, leading to disappointment. As Estela investigates the castle‚Äôs secrets and unravels deceit in the town, the tension builds. Yet, the pacing is uneven, with numerous mysteries accumulating without satisfying resolutions.

            "The story began with intriguing elements that I typically enjoy‚Äîa mysterious start, a cursed castle, and a vampire. However, as the plot unfolded, I became disengaged. The castle, which had the potential to be a compelling character in its own right, ultimately felt underdeveloped. Although it was initially portrayed as part of the owner's evil scheme, it later assists the main character, creating an inconsistency in its role. Additionally, the romance felt forced; it moves from a desire to kill the protagonist to instant affection without any meaningful development. This abrupt shift undermined the believability of their relationship, leaving the romance unconvincing.",
            "The portrayal of some characters left me unconvinced. For instance, Beatriz, the aunt, initially comes across as villainous but vanishes without explanation, only to return and appear as if she‚Äôs been protecting her niece all along. Her actions lack coherence.",
            "In Spain, we never use \"¬øBueno?\" as a synonym for \"¬øVale?\" or \"¬øDe acuerdo?\" (which translates to ‚ÄúRight?‚Äù in English). The phrase \"tortilla de papas\" was particularly jarring; in Spain, we use \"tortilla de patatas.\" While this may be common in Latin America, it feels out of place in a story set in northern Spain. Additionally, the accent on Beatriz's name is a spelling error that repeatedly pulled me out of the narrative. Lastly, it's worth noting that Spaniards typically wouldn't have paella for dinner‚Äîit's more of a tourist choice."

However, as the story progressed, I lost interest. The castle had so much potential to become another character but ended up being quite weak. Supposedly, the building is part of the owner‚Äôs evil plan, but then it ends up helping the main character, which felt inconsistent.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  There were things about the characters that didn‚Äôt convince me. For example, the aunt, Beatriz (without the accent, please, as it‚Äôs a spelling mistake in Spanish), is portrayed as a very evil character, then she disappears for no reason, only to reappear and suddenly seem like she was protecting her niece all along. Her behavior doesn‚Äôt make much sense.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The love story just happens without much buildup. It starts with him wanting to kill the main character, and she falls for him almost right away. I don‚Äôt see any evolution from the \"I'll kill you\" point to the \"happily ever after,\" which made the romance feel unconvincing.\n\n- **Cultural and Linguistic Accuracy:**  \n  What really pulled me out of the story was the use of Spanish. In Argentina (if I remember correctly, the author is from there), they don‚Äôt speak the same Spanish as in Spain.  \n  - In Spain, we never use \"¬øBueno?\" as a synonym for \"¬øVale?\" or \"¬øDe acuerdo?\" (\"Right?\" in English).  \n  - \"Tortilla de papas\" was painful to read. It‚Äôs a term commonly used in Latin American Spanish, but in Spain, we say \"tortilla de PATATAS.\" They might say it that way in Andalusia, but that‚Äôs in the south, not in the north, where the story takes place.  \n  - Adding an accent to Beatriz is a spelling mistake. Every time I read it, it took me out of the story.  \n  - No Spaniard would have paella for dinner. Tourists might, but not Spaniards.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story had a promising start with intriguing elements like a cursed castle and a vampire, it ultimately fell short due to inconsistent character behavior, an unconvincing romantic subplot, and inaccuracies in cultural and linguistic details.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  The general idea of the story was solid, and the author effectively incorporates Spanish throughout to enhance the authenticity of the setting and create a strong sense of place. However, the ending was disappointing. It felt mismatched with the genre (YA gothic horror) and the foundational plot, which heavily relied on romance to drive the story. Additionally, two parts of the ending seemed to conflict, leaving it unclear whether this was intentional or a result of unclear storytelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters as a whole were fairly flat. The first-person POV led to an imbalanced focus on the main character's inner world, which detracted from the development of other characters and the town itself.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Prose:**  \n  The writing was clunky. While there were no grammatical errors, the prose lacked flow, and the dialogue tended to sound the same for all characters, making it difficult to distinguish their voices.  \n\n- **Pacing and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book was a slog to get through. The first-person POV hindered the town from reaching the rich, concise levels of detail needed to build a compelling gothic atmosphere.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a promising concept and successfully incorporated Spanish to enhance its setting, it fell short in execution. The flat characters, clunky prose, and mismatched ending detracted from the overall experience. The pacing and atmosphere also suffered due to the imbalanced focus on the main character's inner world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This was my oversight, though.  \n\n- **Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  - It‚Äôs a fascinating read that‚Äôs unexpected and quite satisfying.  \n  - Thanks to NetGalley for introducing me to a book I might not have picked up otherwise‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt have known what I was missing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a slow start and some challenges with character connection and language barriers, *The Castle of the Cursed* is a dark, captivating, and unique novel that becomes utterly enthralling as the story unfolds.

The entire story takes place over less than two weeks, and the love interests barely know each other except through some violent/abusive encounters. The sudden declarations of eternal love felt unconvincing and out of nowhere, so I wasn‚Äôt sold on the romance.  \n\n- **Ending and Impact:**  \n  - The ending was a giant WTF moment that left me with a lot of questions. I need to discuss it, especially since I‚Äôm pretty sure this is a standalone novel. It threw me a curveball that kept me up at night.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel offers a fresh and unique take on vampires, its dark and heavy themes, along with the rushed romance, may not appeal to everyone.

            "This story is told from a single point of view‚ÄîEstela's‚Äîand unfolds in a first-person narrative. While the pacing is brisk, the brief descriptions of events often make it feel more like a summary than an immersive experience. The premise is intriguing, but I believe it falls short of its potential. The ending offers a \"Happy For Now\" (HFN) for Sebastian, which feels unsatisfying given Estela's significantly shorter lifespan. Ultimately, he is likely to return to his father's control or his predetermined role. Additionally, the epilogue leaves several loose ends, including the unresolved attempt to revive Nela and the mysterious black smoke.",
            "The emotional connection to the characters fell flat for me. Although I liked Sebastian, I wished he had embodied his \"touch her and die\" persona more fully, as he felt underdeveloped in that respect."

There were a lot of strange, ‚Äúwack-a-doodle‚Äù things happening that I didn‚Äôt care for, which made it hard to fully enjoy.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I had issues with the main character and her storyline. She didn‚Äôt resonate with me, and her arc felt disconnected from the overall plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some intriguing elements, such as the dark castle and the shadow beast, it ultimately fell short for me. The lack of romance, confusing plot, and unrelatable main character made it a less enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars, rounded to 3.  \n\nThank you NetGalley for an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review."

Normally, that's a good thing, but here, I kind of wish it was a bit slower so I could have digested it fully.  \n\n- **Complexity and Depth:**  \n  I had to stop periodically to try to wrap my head around the \"how\" and \"why.\" Maybe it's just one of those books that needs a second read-through in order to pick up on all of the little details.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite that, I did enjoy *Castle of the Cursed*, and the last paragraph left me reeling.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Definitely one to add to your spooky season TBR!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the fast pacing made it a bit challenging to fully absorb all the details, *Castle of the Cursed* was an enjoyable and gripping gothic tale, especially with its impactful ending. It‚Äôs a great choice for spooky season reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

However, fans of gothic mysteries with magical elements and unconventional romance might still find it worth exploring.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

The story was engaging and well-suited for a gothic novel.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The setting was a great one for this type of book. It provided the right backdrop for the gothic atmosphere.  \n\n- **Atmosphere:**  \n  The atmosphere never felt quite right to me. It didn‚Äôt fully capture the eerie, haunting vibe I expected from a gothic story.  \n\n- **Characterization (of the House):**  \n  The house never felt enough of a character itself that I think it should have. In a gothic novel, the setting, especially the house, should feel alive and integral to the story, but it fell short for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Castle of the Cursed* was a good gothic story with an engaging plot and a fitting setting. However, the atmosphere didn‚Äôt fully deliver the haunting tone I anticipated, and the house lacked the depth and presence it needed to truly shine as a character.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (lost a star for the atmosphere and the house‚Äôs lack of character development).  \n\n**Note:** ARC provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."

            "The first 20-30% of the book was engaging, but the second half felt rushed, cramming in too many twists that hindered character development. This pacing issue diminished my investment in the characters and their fates. The introduction of the monster romance also felt forced and unrealistic; Estela's sudden infatuation with Sebastian, despite her earlier terror of him, lacked sufficient buildup and chemistry. While the romance was essential for the ending, it required more development to be convincing. The conclusion was particularly problematic‚ÄîEstela‚Äôs choice to lure criminals to their deaths contradicted her previous stance against becoming a monster, undermining her character arc and leaving a sour impression.",
            "Estela's trauma responses are effectively woven into the narrative, highlighting her internal struggle to differentiate reality from illusion in a world inhabited by monsters. Her reliance on her father's investigative principles as a guiding compass for her actions is a clever touch, although these references are somewhat sporadic.",
            "The vivid and immersive description of the castle and its distinct rooms truly captivated me. Each space had its own unique personality, and one room, in particular, played a pivotal role in the story, showcasing exceptional creativity. The setting seamlessly transported me into the narrative.",
            "The book presents a compelling supernatural mystery with its intriguing elements‚Äîa hidden family secret, a cursed castle in a foreign land, and a town steeped in a dark history. The rules of magic are well-defined, and the exploration of ambiguous folklore adds to the suspense. The twist involving the family brings a unique depth to the narrative, enhancing the overall experience."

        "conclusion": "This book had a strong premise and some creative elements, particularly in its setting and folklore. However, the rushed pacing, underdeveloped romance, and morally ambiguous ending detracted from its potential. While I appreciated certain aspects of the story, this particular book wasn‚Äôt for me. I would still consider trying another work by this author in the future.",

The magic rules were well-defined, and the is-this-real-or-not folklore was intriguing. The family twist later on was unique and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The description of the castle and its various rooms was vivid and immersive. Each room had its own personality, and one particular room, which played a major role in the story, was exceptionally creative. The setting effectively transported me into the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Trauma Representation:**  \n  Estela‚Äôs trauma responses were introduced in a way that made sense within the context of the story. In a world where monsters exist, her struggle to discern what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs in her head was compelling. The use of her father‚Äôs investigative rules as a guide for her actions was clever, though they were only sporadically referenced.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  The first 20-30% of the book was engaging, but the second half felt rushed with too many twists crammed in. There wasn‚Äôt enough time to develop the characters or make the reader care about their fates. The pacing detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The introduction of the monster romance felt forced and unrealistic. Estela‚Äôs sudden infatuation with Sebastian, despite her prior terror of him, lacked sufficient buildup and chemistry. While the romance was necessary for the ending, it needed more development to feel plausible.  \n\n- **Ending and Moral Ambiguity:**  \n  The ending was problematic. Estela‚Äôs decision to lure people to their deaths, even if they were criminals, contradicted her earlier stance against becoming a monster. This moral inconsistency undermined her character arc and left a sour impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a strong premise and some creative elements, particularly in its setting and folklore. However, the rushed pacing, underdeveloped romance, and morally ambiguous ending detracted from its potential. While I appreciated certain aspects of the story, this particular book wasn‚Äôt for me.
