            "While the book includes elements I typically don’t enjoy, like a morally grey male protagonist and forbidden romance, it surprisingly captured my interest. I loved every moment of Evan and Addie’s story. Their chemistry, particularly in the passionate and vivid kisses, enriched the romance, even within the confines of a closed-door, PG-13 narrative.",
            "I picked up the book planning to read just a chapter or two, but I was quickly immersed in a world of intrigue and dangerous secrets. I found it impossible to put down, ultimately devouring the entire story in one sitting and forgetting all about my to-do list. The plot is intricately woven, with secrets unveiled gradually, making for an incredibly enjoyable read."

        "conclusion": "*Hide Away With You* is a captivating and immersive read that blends intrigue, romance, and complex character dynamics. Despite featuring tropes I don’t typically enjoy, the story won me over completely. It’s a strong start to the *Kings of Eden Falls* series, with enough standalone appeal to satisfy new readers while leaving them excited for more.",

            "The storyline was intriguing and engaging, though it often strayed into the realm of the unrealistic. For instance, it was hard to believe the bodyguards would be so lenient with her, and Evan's escape from the mafia seemed overly simplistic. Their ability to communicate freely via email and phone without any repercussions felt implausible, as such interactions would typically be monitored. I also wished for more development of their relationship; it felt rushed toward the end. After their initial meeting, their reunion focused mostly on sharing stories, making out, and plotting Evan's safety, leaving little room for the banter and everyday interactions that would typically characterize a romantic relationship. This lack of depth was disappointing.",
            "I enjoyed seeing the other couples and their current journeys. Their love was palpable and impressive. However, Ian's feelings for her seemed too intense for mere friendship; it clearly came across as flirtation."

For example, there was no way the bodyguards wouldn’t be way more rough with her, and for Evan and them to come back and make a break from the mafia that easily.  \n   - Evan being able to be with her at the hotel that easily and email her freely, as well as tell her things on the phone, felt unrealistic—irl, all that would be monitored.  \n\n- **Pacing and Development:**  \n   - I wish we got more book time of them together as a couple.

While the premise is intriguing, the conclusion ultimately falls flat. The ending feels rushed, resolving key conflicts in just five minutes without adequately addressing the threats or the complexities of the double life.

A major plot hole remains unaddressed: the story fails to clarify why the fiancée needed to maintain a facade in front of the guards.",

            "The chapters featuring Evan's journal entries were the highlights of the book—fun, engaging, and rich with emotional depth that gave me butterflies. I particularly enjoyed seeing Evan's perspective, which offered a unique glimpse into his thoughts from years ago when he and Addison were first getting to know each other. The author's choice to alternate between two timelines—Evan's past and Addie's present—was both innovative and refreshing, setting it apart from the typical chronological storytelling found in many Amazon books. The storyline was deep and captivating, with an intense plot that kept me engaged. However, the pacing slowed significantly in the second half, causing the story to drag, especially during the Italy scenes.",
            "Evan's gradual awareness of his feelings for Addie, alongside his internal struggle to safeguard their well-being, was both compelling and addictive. The first half of the book, which delved deeply into their evolving relationship, stood out as my favorite part.",
            "In the latter half of the book, particularly during Addie's time in Italy, the dialogue felt cringeworthy and immature, often prompting eye rolls. This detracted from the otherwise deep and intense storyline. The stark contrast between the serious plot and the juvenile dialogue was disappointing, leading me to question whether I was reading a YA novel at times."
