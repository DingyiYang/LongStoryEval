            "The story follows lifelong best friends Cole and Laila as they embark on a week-long trip to New York City, where they must confront their evolving feelings for each other. This classic friends-to-lovers romance offers a comforting predictability reminiscent of Hallmark Christmas movies.",
            "While the characters are charming and their friendship is heartwarming, their actions and dialogue occasionally seem inconsistent with their ages. In their late 30s, they often come off as immature and naive, which undermines their believability. For instance, a scene featuring a 40-year-old woman giggling uncontrollably while being rolled around on luggage in an airport feels more cringeworthy than funny or endearing.",
            "The storytelling is both enjoyable and easy to follow, making it a delightful read (or listen). The pacing keeps the narrative engaging, and the tone perfectly captures the essence of lighthearted, clean romance.",

Having always envisioned themselves together, their mutual respect and intuitive understanding made it easy to believe they were in love even before they recognized it themselves. The line, \"She matters more than the rest. It had always been. He'd always known,\" perfectly encapsulates their profound connection.

Laila knows Cole’s quirks well, from his oversized pink Sophia Loren glasses to his culinary experiments, which she supports despite her limited palate. The dual-perspective narrative enriches their relationship, echoing the themes of *Happy Place* with its emphasis on future ambitions and a supportive friend group. The author’s affection for the characters, particularly the supporting couple, drew me in, making me more invested in their relationships than in the main plot.",

The lack of clarity about its genre (Christian fiction or not) also left me with mixed feelings about certain interactions.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story begins slowly, with the author taking time to establish the characters and their relationships. Although the dual POV adds depth, the pacing could have been more engaging from the outset. Centered around lifelong friends Cole and Layla, the plot unfolds as upheaval strikes when the restaurant Cole owns and Layla works at is sold. They move to New York, where Layla initially plans to return to Colorado. The narrative explores their evolving relationship and the possibility of it becoming more than friendship. The dual POV structure is effective, providing unique perspectives and humor that enhance the overall enjoyment of the story.",

Their relationship exists in a gray area, where they are half in love from the beginning, operating like a couple without the physical connection. This dynamic makes their transition to a romantic relationship feel less impactful and defining for their characters."

Laila's chapters are in first person, while Cole's are in third person, which adds depth to understanding their thoughts and motives.\n   - The friendship between Cole and Laila is sweet, with the focus on their current relationship dynamics rather than their history.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**\n   - The audiobook features alternating POV chapters with two narrators. Both narrators performed well, neither enhancing nor detracting from the story.\n   - The audiobook format was enjoyable, but the lack of context for a quote from a previous book at the beginning was confusing.\n\n- **Character Behavior and Age:**\n   - The characters are in their late 30s to early 40s, but their behavior often feels more like they are in their 20s, requiring some suspension of disbelief.\n\n- **Series Context:**\n   - The book includes characters from a previous book by the same author, but it is not clearly marked as part of a series. This led to confusion, especially with references to past events and characters.\n   - The lack of clarity about it being the second book in a series was particularly confusing in the audiobook version.\n\n- **Pop Culture References:**\n   - There are quite a few pop culture references, which some readers might find excessive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this is a cute, heart-warming, and clean romance novel that is easy to read and enjoy. While it didn’t blow me away, I found it engaging and would be interested in reading more from Bethany Turner. The story’s emotional tension, well-developed characters, and sweet friendship-to-romance dynamic make it a pleasant read, though the unclear series context and occasional pacing issues slightly detract from the experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Cole's struggle with feelings of unworthiness after his financial downfall added depth to his character.  \n  - It was interesting to see how Cole and Laila, who had been friends for a long time, only developed romantic feelings for each other in their 40s.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story was engaging as Cole and Laila navigated their adventurous time in New York.  \n  - Their first \"blind-date\" was a particularly enjoyable moment in the book.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The book was a delightful contemporary romance with snarky dialogue, humor, and many pop-culture references.  \n  - The blend of small-town and big-town living added a unique flavor to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The themes of friendship, romance, and self-worth were well-explored.  \n  - The story had a lighthearted and fun atmosphere, making it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a delightful contemporary romance with well-developed characters, engaging plotlines, and a perfect mix of humor and heartfelt moments. The blend of small-town and big-town living, along with the snarky dialogue and pop-culture references, made it a fun and memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book adheres to a familiar Hallmark-style formula: an unfortunate disaster leads to a life-changing opportunity, followed by a transformative conversation, culminating in a tidy conclusion. While the overarching storyline is enjoyable, it ultimately feels flat and lacks depth.",
            "The main characters, Cole and Laila, are in their late 30s to early 40s but communicate as if they’re in their early to mid-20s. Their poor communication skills, despite nearly four decades of knowing each other, feel frustrating and unrealistic. Cole is a likable character who demonstrates growth and adaptability in coping with grief and change. In contrast, Laila comes across as unlikable from the outset, displaying selfish behavior and a lack of empathy for Cole’s feelings and decisions. The supporting characters also fall short, prioritizing their own comfort over Cole's needs.",
            "The writing portrayed the characters as immature and unrealistic for their ages and life experiences. The audiobook version emphasized excessive filler words that contributed little to the story. The narrative often felt forced, suggesting the author was trying to meet a minimum word count. While some pop culture references, like those about Cole and Laila’s younger years, were enjoyable, many others felt excessive and unnecessary, such as random details about Taylor Swift’s home location."

            "The story features unexpected twists that kept me both engaged and pleasantly surprised.",
            "The friendship between Laila and Cole is deep, pure, and charmingly funny, transcending the typical label of \"just friends.\" Their lives are intricately intertwined, and the story skillfully navigates the tension between their lifelong bond and the potential for romance, especially following Cole's dream of a future with Laila. Miscommunication and insecurity add depth to their relationship, though at times, this complexity veers into the realm of disbelief. Cole grapples with the impact of his grandfather's passing, prompting him to reevaluate his life choices and yearn to escape their small town. I found it hard to accept that they were in their 40s; their behavior and emotional maturity seemed more characteristic of those in their late 20s or early 30s. Nevertheless, their endearing awkwardness in navigating new love made them relatable and engaging.",

            "The friendship and romantic tension in the story were engaging, but the characters' age and maturity often felt implausible. While the miscommunication and insecurity contributed to the drama, they occasionally seemed exaggerated and less authentic."

The characters’ bond, unexpected plot twists, and humorous tone made the story memorable. However, the believability of the characters’ age and maturity level slightly detracted from the experience.

            "Cole and Laila share a profound intimacy reminiscent of a married couple, yet their lack of romantic awareness over four decades strains credulity.

This prolonged obliviousness to their feelings becomes less plausible with their age.",

While the concept is intriguing, the idea of two people being best friends for forty years without ever considering a romantic relationship feels unrealistic.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Cole and Laila’s relationship is portrayed as deeply intimate, akin to a married couple without the formal commitment. However, their lack of romantic awareness over four decades strains believability.  \n\n- **Age of Characters:**  \n  The story would have been more believable if the characters were younger, perhaps in their late twenties or early thirties, rather than nearly forty. Their prolonged obliviousness to their feelings feels less plausible with their age.  \n\n- **Plot and Theme:**  \n  The “lost time” trope is central to the story, where the couple realizes their compatibility too late. This theme, while emotionally charged, is frustrating because it highlights the wasted potential of their relationship and the life they could have built together.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  Despite the issues with believability and the frustrating “lost time” theme, the book was enjoyable to read. The story was cute and engaging, even if certain elements felt unrealistic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of lifelong best friends discovering their love too late is heartwarming, the execution feels unrealistic, particularly with the characters’ age and the prolonged lack of romantic awareness.

I particularly liked how their personalities and dynamics were portrayed, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The depiction of New York was vivid and immersive. The way the author described the location made it enjoyable to read and added a charming backdrop to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Structure:**  \n  While the dual POV approach was interesting, the frequent shifts between first and third person within the chapters felt disjointed and disrupted the flow of the story. This made the narrative feel disconnected at times, which was a drawback for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a cozy and enjoyable read with well-developed characters and a charming setting. However, the abrupt shift in Cole's feelings and the inconsistent narrative structure slightly detracted from the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, this story redeemed it!  \n\n- **Connection to Previous Book:**  \n  It helps to read *Brynn and Sebastian Hate Each Other* before starting this novel because some main characters from that book carry over into this one.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Emotional Impact:**  \n  Cole and Laia’s friendship is so sweet and tender that it feels like you’re reading this book wrapped in a snuggie.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and POV:**  \n  I appreciated the dual point of view between Cole and Laia. Their banter and jokes were genuinely funny!  \n\n- **Pacing and Dialogue:**  \n  My one qualm was the lengthy asides and long trains of thought in the dialogue. These made certain scenes drag on, causing me to lose focus and go on a rabbit trail of thoughts. As a busy mom, this wasn’t ideal.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Overall, it was a lovely read that will definitely make you want to book your next visit to New York with your bestie.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues with lengthy dialogue, this novel was a heartwarming and enjoyable read, especially for fans of the author’s previous work.

Their interactions with Cole and Laila as a married couple were delightful, offering glimpses into their New York life.\n   - Meeting Cole and Laila in the first Adelaide Springs book provided context for their relationship, and it was satisfying to see them receive their own fleshed-out story.\n   - Cole and Laila felt realistic and relatable, as they weren’t always on their best behavior and had to apologize to each other. Their struggles with challenging emotions and situations made their relationship feel authentic and easy to root for.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - As a clean romcom, the book didn’t rely heavily on tropes.

Bethany Turner's writing, combined with excellent audiobook narration, made this a standout read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Edison bulbs were strung from side to side and back again across the expanse of the roof, creating the perfect subdued lighting with a gorgeous yellow tint. Not the sort of yellow tint that made you wonder if someone’s kidneys were failing. The kind that created that soft sepia hue that was so much more flattering than jaundice.”* (Loc. 3200)\n     - *“What was the expression? That women’s brains were spaghetti, able to mix everything together and get sauce on everything all at once, while men’s were more like waffles, only able to absorb syrup in one grid at a time? Something like that.”* (Loc. 2029)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I enjoyed this novel, particularly the heartfelt relationship between Cole and Layla and the satisfying ending. While the pacing started slow and the characters’ age-appropriateness felt off, the story hit its sweet spot in the second half.

            "The story follows lifelong friends Laila and Cole, whose lives take a turn after Cole’s grandfather dies. As Cole contemplates moving to New York, Laila hopes he will stay in their small town. While the premise is promising, the portrayal of their romance feels unbalanced. Cole's abrupt realization of his feelings for Laila after nearly 40 years of friendship seems hurried, yet the romantic developments often drag on. Additionally, the pacing is inconsistent, featuring drawn-out passages that hinder the overall reading experience.",
            "Laila and Cole are well-developed characters, but their romantic connection feels underdeveloped and somewhat jarring. Cole's transition from friendship to romance, sparked by a single dream, lacks depth and believability. While their dynamic has its charming moments, it fails to convincingly portray a best-friends-to-lovers story.",
            "The dual perspectives in the narrative—Laila's first-person chapters contrasted with Cole's third-person ones—initially disrupted the flow and took some time to adjust to. Additionally, the writing style leans more towards literary fiction than romance, which may not satisfy readers seeking a more conventional romantic storyline.",

The unusual narrative structure and uneven development of the central relationship made it difficult to fully connect with the story.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story revolves around Laila and Cole, lifelong friends whose lives change after Cole’s grandfather dies. Cole considers moving to New York, while Laila wants him to stay in their small town. While the premise had potential, the romance felt uneven. Cole’s sudden realization of his feelings for Laila after nearly 40 years of friendship felt rushed, yet the romance itself dragged at times. The pacing was inconsistent, with long-winded moments that slowed down the reading experience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Laila and Cole are well-crafted characters individually, but their romantic connection felt strange and underdeveloped. Cole’s shift from friendship to romantic interest, triggered by a single dream, lacked depth and believability. Their dynamic, while charming in some moments, didn’t fully resonate as a convincing best-friends-to-lovers story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The use of dual perspectives was unusual—Laila’s chapters are in first person, while Cole’s are in third person. This inconsistency took some time to get used to and disrupted the flow of the narrative. The writing leaned more toward literary fiction than romance, which might not appeal to readers expecting a more traditional romantic storyline.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  New York as the backdrop for their adventures added a charming and vibrant element to the story. Their “first date” in the city was particularly cute and memorable, showcasing the potential for a stronger romantic arc.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential:**  \n  While the book had moments of charm and potential, it fell short of expectations. The romance lacked structure and emotional depth, and the pacing issues made it harder to stay engaged. I found myself wishing for a more cohesive and compelling narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a promising premise and likable characters, but the execution of the romance and pacing left much to be desired. The unusual narrative structure and uneven development of the central relationship made it difficult to fully connect with the story. While there were enjoyable moments, the overall experience was underwhelming.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This issue, evident in the first installment, is even more pronounced in the sequel. The relationship between Cole and Laila lacks the depth and maturity one would expect, exemplified in a scene where they share a bed non-sexually yet treat it as a trivial event.

The lack of follow-through or genuine romantic feelings makes their dynamic uninteresting and unconvincing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the first book in the series, \"Cole and Laila Are Just Friends\" fell short for me.

The first half focuses on Cole's feelings of betrayal and their move to NYC, with little buildup of romance or attraction until later. While the emotional connection is strong, the lack of physical attraction is notable and may stem from the clean writing style. By the end, when Cole glances at Laila's legs, it feels too late to make a significant impact.",
            "I really enjoyed the relationship between Cole and Laila; their friendship felt genuine, as if they had known each other for years. Their romance was sweet, showcasing their deep care for one another. Cole's cooking for Laila and her enthusiastic praise for him created a lovely dynamic. While the flashbacks added valuable backstory, I wished for deeper characterizations. Cole is consistently competent, and Laila is adorably clumsy, making them both very likable. Cole's kindness and passion for cooking offer a refreshing contrast to the typical smug grump often found in this genre.",
            "This book fits the Clean and Wholesome Romance genre well, but it could benefit from more physical attraction between the characters. The excessive pop-culture references, especially during Laila and Cole's walks in NYC, were distracting and detracted from the main narrative. Additionally, the lengthy retellings of movie scenes overshadowed the story. The narrative structure felt somewhat circular, as characters often revisited their relationship in a way that felt repetitive. While the alternating first-person (Laila) and third-person (Cole) chapters were noticeable, they did not detract significantly from the reading experience.",

I was excited to receive the ARC but ultimately found the book disappointing.\n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**\n   - The opening chapters failed to engage me, and I found the narrative unnecessarily prolonged, as if it was padded to lengthen the book. By the 25% mark, I considered abandoning it but pushed through to finish.\n\n- **Character Perspectives and Writing Style:**\n   - The alternating points of view (Laila in first person, Cole in third person) felt inconsistent and disjointed, making it hard to connect with the characters. This hindered my overall reading experience.\n\n- **Use of Pop Culture References and Anecdotes:**\n   - The excessive use of pop culture references felt like it would date the story quickly. Additionally, many long anecdotes seemed irrelevant to the main plot, coming across as filler content.\n\n- **Believability of the Storyline:**\n   - The idea that Cole and Laila took almost forty years to confess their feelings was hard to believe. Their childhood love lacked substantial evidence, and their present-day interactions lacked chemistry and tension. The lack of communication between them was frustrating.\n\n- **Character Development and Dialogue:**\n   - I struggled to connect with Cole and Laila as characters. Their interactions felt forced, and their dialogue often seemed immature, especially for adults approaching 40. Laila, in particular, came across as insufferable and naive.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - I found it difficult to enjoy the book and cannot recommend it to others who seek depth or believability in a story. However, it might appeal to readers looking for a light, unrealistic read.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I appreciated the emphasis on the importance of friendships in romantic relationships, *Cole and Laila are Just Friends* fell short of my expectations. The inconsistent perspectives, excessive pop culture references, and lack of believable character development made it a challenging read.

The plot takes an intriguing twist when Cole receives a job offer in Brooklyn, sparking a whirlwind adventure in New York alongside Laila and their friends.

Although I appreciate the friends-to-lovers trope, their strong denial of any romantic feelings despite their affectionate interactions felt unrealistic. Actions like calling each other \"hottie,\" holding hands, sharing forehead kisses, and embracing deeply contradicted the idea of a purely platonic friendship. It's hard to believe that neither of them ever considered a romantic relationship, especially given their age and ongoing single status.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - Cole and Laila's relationship is central to the story, but I struggled with how it was written. While I enjoy the friends-to-lovers trope, the way both characters adamantly deny ever considering a relationship, despite their close and affectionate interactions, felt unrealistic. Their behavior—such as calling each other \"a hottie,\" excessive hand-holding, forehead kisses, and deep hugs—seemed inconsistent with a purely platonic friendship. It was hard to believe that neither of them ever thought about being together, especially given their chronic single status and age (almost forty).\n\n- **Representation of Age and Life Stage:**\n   - One of my favorite aspects of the book is that the main characters are almost forty. It’s refreshing to read a story where the protagonists are older and still figuring out their lives, as opposed to the typical early-to-late twenties characters often found in the genre. As someone in a similar age bracket, I appreciated this representation and found it relatable.\n\n- **Humor and Nostalgic References:**\n   - The book includes several specific references aimed at readers in their late thirties to early forties, such as mentioning Mulder & Scully and Dermott Mulroney. These nostalgic nods added a layer of humor and relatability that I enjoyed.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**\n   - The story is set in a small town, Adelaide Springs, Colorado, and revolves around Cole’s family restaurant, which faces uncertainty after his grandfather’s death. The plot takes an interesting turn when Cole gets a job offer in Brooklyn, leading to a touristy adventure in New York with Laila and their friends. The small-town romance vibe and the feel-good nature of the story make it highly recommended for fans of similar genres and shows like *Gilmore Girls*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite some issues with the portrayal of Cole and Laila’s relationship, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The representation of older protagonists, the nostalgic humor, and the small-town romance elements made it a quick, feel-good read. It’s a great choice for fans of the genre and those who appreciate stories about characters navigating life in their late thirties.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Overall Enjoyment: 4/5  \n- Character Development: 3.5/5  \n- Relatability: 4.5/5  \n- Humor and References: 5/5"

            "This charming and wholesome rom-com follows two best friends who discover their romantic feelings for each other after more than thirty years of friendship. While the premise is engaging, it feels somewhat unrealistic that they haven't considered a romantic relationship earlier, especially given their late 30s. The story would have been more believable if they were a decade younger.",
            "In this story, the main characters, Laila and Cole, share a history that enriches their relationship, though the repeated emphasis on their best-friend status becomes tedious. Laila's characterization is inconsistent; she embodies the quirky, whimsical \"pixie dream girl\" archetype, yet her traits—like climber despite her lack of fitness, wearing Barbie-pink shoes with khaki cargo pants, and struggling to cook pancakes—feel disjointed. Additionally, the narrative is disrupted by an odd editorial choice: Cole's perspective is written in third person while Laila's is in first person, affecting the overall flow of the story.",
            "The New York setting is expertly depicted, with the main characters portrayed as intelligent yet naive tourists, bringing a fun and relatable dimension to the story.",
            "The character banter is enjoyable, though its humor varies in consistency. The appearance of characters from a previous rom-com is a delightful nod for readers familiar with the author's other works.",
            "While marketed as Christian Fiction, this book surprisingly lacks any religious elements, such as references to God, church, or moral teachings. Instead, it reads as a PG-rated story, which may mislead readers anticipating a faith-based narrative."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a lighthearted and enjoyable rom-com with some charming elements, such as the New York setting and the characters’ shared history. However, inconsistencies in characterization, an unrealistic premise for the characters’ ages, and the misleading genre label detract from the experience.

This contrast adds a charming dynamic to the plot.",

I appreciated the book's unique structure; instead of the clichéd separation and reunion arc, it explores the characters' challenges as they consider their futures apart while remaining together throughout the story. The friends-to-lovers trope, my personal favorite, is executed brilliantly, highlighting the intimacy and love that develop in a long-standing relationship with established chemistry.

I finished it in a very short time because it kept me wanting to read more and more.  \n   - It was the ideal read for me, and I will definitely look for more books by the author.  \n\n- **Character Relationship (Cole and Laila):**  \n   - The relationship between Cole and Laila is beautiful from the first chapter. Their love feels deep and well-established, built over years.  \n   - They understand each other perfectly and have the maturity to confront problems directly, apologize, and communicate openly.  \n   - Their security in their love and friendship, even when facing the possibility of separation, was heartwarming. They always prioritized each other's well-being.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Structure:**  \n   - The writing, though denser than most romantic comedies, is beautiful. It includes a lot of internal dialogue rather than conversations between characters, which provides deeper insight into their past and the layers of their relationship.  \n   - I enjoyed the structure of the book. It avoided the cliché of separating the protagonists at the beginning and reuniting them at the end. Instead, it showed them navigating the challenges of potentially starting new lives apart while staying together throughout the story.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n   - The \"friends to lovers\" trope is my all-time favorite, and this book executed it perfectly. It showcased the intimacy and love that comes with a long-standing relationship, where the chemistry is already established.  \n   - The book felt mature and well-written, especially for a \"closed doors\" romance. The characters were older, and the story avoided feeling ridiculous or childish, which can sometimes happen in this genre.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal and Recommendation:**  \n   - I loved the book and highly recommend it. It was a perfect blend of romance, maturity, and emotional depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful and emotionally rich read. The mature portrayal of Cole and Laila's relationship, the well-crafted writing style, and the avoidance of overused tropes made it stand out. It’s a highly recommended read for fans of heartfelt and thoughtful romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific numerical rating was mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a very high level of satisfaction.)"

            "The story follows Cole and Laila, lifelong friends of nearly 40 years, as they embark on a trip to New York and start to explore the possibility of a romantic relationship. While I typically don't enjoy the friends-to-lovers trope, this book offers unique elements, such as their blind date, that set it apart. However, the miscommunication trope felt overused, and the characters' back-and-forth interactions sometimes came across as unnecessary and confusing. On a positive note, I appreciated their honesty during difficult conversations.",
            "Cole was a charming and likable male protagonist, and I found Andrew Eiden's narration enjoyable. However, Laila came across as somewhat childish, lacking the depth expected from a 38-year-old woman, which made her character less relatable.",
            "The New York City setting, filled with rom-com and movie references along with specific filming locations, felt overly detailed for my taste. Having lived there for 10 years, I appreciate the joy of visiting the city for the first time, but the heavy emphasis on these elements detracted from the story. While Cole's attempts to take Laila to special places were endearing, the execution felt excessive."

I keep picking up her books in the hope of finding another story that compares to how much I enjoyed that one.  \n\n- **Premise and Expectations:**  \n  I love the friends-to-lovers trope, especially with secret pining and the \"no, of course we don't like each other like that\" storyline. I started this book with high hopes, given the premise.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  A side note: If you haven't read *Brynn and Sebastian* (which I didn't enjoy), you definitely need to read it first, as this book is not a standalone story.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The story itself feels clunky. For two characters who have been best friends for 30 years and are almost 40, it’s hard to believe that feelings never came up or were addressed before now. The plot relies on this lack of communication, which feels unrealistic.  \n\n- **Character Background and Development:**  \n  The reader would have benefited from flashbacks to see their friendship grow. We weren’t given enough background or specific moments to root for their relationship.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The dual POV, with her in first person and him in third, was very awkward. It didn’t flow seamlessly from chapter to chapter, and the characters didn’t fully lean into their own voices.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  A romance without chemistry doesn’t give the reader something to root for. A book without spice can still have butterflies, longing glances, banter, and chemistry without being explicit. I think this would have helped the plot immensely.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The last 20% of the book really started to pick up, but the first 80% felt slow and underwhelming.  \n\n- **Highlights:**  \n  The rom-com tour of NYC and the fake first date were top-notch moments, but they weren’t enough to sway my overall opinion of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI was hopeful for this book, given the premise and my love for the friends-to-lovers trope, but unfortunately, I was disappointed.

I enjoyed watching them awkwardly navigate and evaluate their emotions. Taking the leap from friends to a couple is portrayed as a monumental change, and their journey felt authentic and engaging.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Characters:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and these characters.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Dynamics and Relationship Development:**  \n  Cole and Laila's friendship is the heart of the story, and their journey from \"just friends\" to something more is both compelling and believable. The tension between their deep bond and the fear of ruining it adds emotional depth. Their chemistry is undeniable, and they feel like a couple that \"just works perfectly.\"  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The story is driven by Cole's decision to leave Adelaide Springs after his grandfather's betrayal, and Laila's determination to change his mind. The scouting trip to New York serves as a catalyst for their evolving relationship. The conflicts—geographical distance, family issues, and self-doubt—are well-developed and make their journey to becoming a couple feel earned and satisfying.  \n\n- **Tone and Writing Style:**  \n  The book strikes a great balance between humor and seriousness. The \"in jokes\" and hilarious moments are woven seamlessly with meaningful, inspiring discussions, making it far from a \"fluffy read.\" The humor adds levity, while the serious moments provide depth and emotional resonance.  \n\n- **Character Likability:**  \n  Both Cole and Laila are likable, relatable characters. Their personalities shine through, and they feel like people you'd want to know in real life. Their growth throughout the story is rewarding to witness.  \n\n- **Ending and Satisfaction:**  \n  The ending is very satisfying, as the couple overcomes their obstacles and finally comes together. The rocky road to their relationship makes the resolution feel well-deserved and emotionally fulfilling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful blend of humor, heart, and emotional depth. Cole and Laila's journey from friends to lovers is beautifully crafted, with well-developed conflicts and a satisfying resolution. The balance of lighthearted moments and serious discussions makes it a standout read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to the author's next book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The title and storyline are predictable, particularly for those familiar with Hallmark-style narratives. Following a formulaic structure, the plot unfolds with a conflict or misunderstanding at 80%, a realization of feelings at 90%, a reunion at 95%, and a classic happily-ever-after ending. While this familiar framework offers comfort, its lack of originality ultimately makes the story forgettable.",
            "Cole and Laila's relationship was a pleasure to follow, particularly as they ventured beyond their hometown and routines. However, their behavior often felt inconsistent with their late 30s, resembling that of characters in their 20s, such as their tendency to squeal. Additionally, the portrayal of Sabastien and Brynn was disappointing, as they appeared unlikable in this installment.",
            "The New York City setting brought a refreshing dynamic to the story, yet the characters' hesitance to fully embrace change—such as relocating to NYC—felt like a missed opportunity. The narrative followed a familiar Hallmark-style formula, which restricted its potential for deeper exploration and unexpected twists.",
            "The book offers a fun, lighthearted reading experience that is enjoyable in the moment. While it effectively serves as a source of entertainment, it ultimately lacks lasting impact. The comparison to a dollar store sticker—pleasurable while it lasts but easily forgotten—captures the essence of the experience."

Much of the narrative revolves around their exploration of NYC, particularly as Cole contemplates a chef position in Brooklyn.

The alternating points of view between Laila and Cole give them distinct voices, making the narrative immersive. Their haphazard exploration of New York, drawn to places from their favorite films and TV shows, feels authentic and relatable.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  - While I enjoyed the story, I wish it had been slightly longer and provided more closure. However, I’m hopeful for future returns to Adelaide Springs, where we might see delightful cameos for Laila and Cole, similar to how Brynn and Sebastian appeared in this book.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  - Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher, Thomas Nelson, for providing the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review. These thoughts are entirely my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n‘Cole and Laila are Just Friends’ is a wholesome, character-driven story with well-written tension and authentic interactions. While it could have been slightly longer and offered more closure, it remains an enjoyable read, especially for fans of the Adelaide Springs series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "Cole and Laila, lifelong best friends in their 40s, face a turning point that prompts them to reevaluate their feelings for one another. While I appreciated the exploration of their relationship's evolution later in life, I found the characters' naïveté—especially Laila's—frustrating. At times, she came across as more of a clueless teenager than an adult, which made it difficult to reconcile their ages with their behavior. After decades of friendship, it felt more plausible that they would see each other as siblings rather than suddenly recognizing a romantic spark.",
            "This charming story brims with pop culture references and playful banter. If you appreciate lighthearted romance and don’t mind a loose plot, you'll likely enjoy the experience."

The narrators brought the story to life in a fun and engaging way.  \n\n- **Connection to Previous Book:**  \n  This book follows *Brynn and Sebastian Hate Each Other*, which I didn’t read beforehand. While it would have been helpful for the setup of the characters, I wasn’t terribly lost since Brynn and Sebastian are only side characters in this story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  Cole and Laila are in their 40s and have been best friends their entire lives. They’ve never been more than friends, but when their lives are set to change, they begin to reconsider their feelings. I enjoyed the later-in-life development of their relationship, but I struggled with the naiveté of the characters, especially Laila. At times, she seemed more like a clueless teenager than a full-grown adult. It was hard to buy into their ages based on their behavior—they felt more like they were in their late 20s. After so many years, I expected them to feel more like siblings rather than suddenly noticing a romantic spark.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  This is a cute story filled with pop culture references and fun banter. If you enjoy lighthearted romance and don’t overthink the plot, you’ll likely enjoy the journey.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a charming friends-to-lovers romance with engaging narration and plenty of witty dialogue.

            "The plot feels somewhat underdeveloped, relying heavily on character-driven elements. The small-town friends-to-lovers romance set against the vibrant backdrop of NYC is a delightful touch. While there are hints of family drama and angst, I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of these themes.",
            "The characters are endearing, quirky, and swoon-worthy, but they often behave like late teens or early twenties, which can be disorienting given their age of forty. The miscommunication between them feels more characteristic of teenagers than adults. Their dynamic leans more towards lovers-to-lovers rather than the typical friends-to-lovers progression. I would have preferred a greater focus on Laila and Cole, with less influence from Brynn and Sebastian, who already have their own story."

While the friends-to-more trope isn't usually my favorite, the author executed it flawlessly here. The small gestures Cole and Laila share are incredibly endearing. Contrary to some reviews, I found the characters to be quite mature for their age. As someone in my mid-thirties, I believe their thoughts and actions are realistic—who truly feels completely grown up? Laila stands out as one of the most relatable female main characters I've encountered recently. I appreciate that she isn't pursuing a high-powered career or intense ambitions; instead, she finds joy in her simple life as a waitress, sewing, and spending time with Cole and the community of Adelaide Springs. Cole is fiercely loyal, hardworking, and sports a great beard. His journey to recognizing his feelings for Laila is beautifully written and reminded me of Luke from *Loyally, Luke* by Pepper Basham.",

            "The shift from first-person (Laila) to third-person (Cole) was confusing, and I believe maintaining a single perspective would have enhanced the story's cohesion. Additionally, the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. For most of the book, I anticipated a significant decision from Cole, but everything resolved too conveniently, allowing them to stay together without consequence. This abrupt resolution left me feeling unsettled.",
            "I enjoyed Cole and Laila as main characters; they were funny, quirky, and had undeniable chemistry. However, the premise that they are nearly 40 and only now recognizing their love after over 30 years of friendship felt unrealistic. Cole never considered Laila as more than a friend until one revealing dream, while Laila appeared to be passively waiting for him to notice her feelings, which didn't resonate with me.",

However, the story didn’t fully meet my expectations.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I liked Cole and Laila as main characters. They were funny, quirky, and had clear chemistry. However, the idea that they are almost 40 and only just realizing they’re in love after 30+ years of friendship felt unrealistic. Cole never thought of Laila as more than a friend until one saucy dream, and Laila seemed to be waiting for him without realizing it, which didn’t sit well with me.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The shift in point of view from first-person (Laila) to third-person (Cole) was confusing. I think sticking to one perspective would have made the story feel more cohesive.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution:**  \n  The ending felt rushed and a bit unsatisfying. For 75% of the book, I thought Cole was going to make a certain decision, but then everything suddenly worked out, and they didn’t have to leave each other. It felt too convenient and bugged me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite these issues, this was NOT A BAD BOOK. I enjoyed it as an easy-to-follow romcom with very likable characters.

When his grandfather passed away, leaving him only the house, Cole was devastated. In contrast, Laila is deeply rooted in the town she loves and is unwilling to leave. Their relationship is complicated; while Laila sees potential for romance, Cole views them as strictly best friends.

            "What I loved most about Brynn and Sebastian's book was the vibrant cast of townspeople, including Cole and Laila. The author deftly conveys the deep bond between the two main characters; their familiarity and connection make it abundantly clear that they are destined for love. They are so in tune with each other that they instinctively know how to comfort one another, elicit smiles, and almost read each other’s thoughts—except when it comes to their emerging romantic feelings.",
            "Cole and Laila's escapade through NYC is a heartfelt tribute to the city, offering an enjoyable experience for fans of classic New York TV shows and movies. It reminded me of my own adventures with my best friend, as we explored our favorite filming locations with unbridled excitement.",
            "As a fan of the friends-to-lovers trope, I was immediately drawn to this story on NetGalley. Cole and Laila, lifelong best friends, navigate their deep bond while hesitating to explore anything beyond friendship. This classic premise is engaging, though readers should be aware that the book contains no spice—kissing is the extent of the romance. Knowing this in advance can enhance the reading experience.",
            "Cole and Laila's story masterfully blends slow burn tension with heart-wrenching moments, culminating in a satisfying conclusion."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Cole and Laila's story is a delightful friends-to-lovers romance that perfectly balances slow-burn tension, heartfelt moments, and a satisfying payoff. The New York City setting adds a vibrant and nostalgic layer to the narrative, making it a joy for fans of the city and the trope alike. While it can be enjoyed as a standalone, reading the first book provides additional context and enhances the experience.",

            "Lucy Score skillfully reintroduces characters from previous books in a seamless and engaging manner. However, after listening to the audiobook months after reading the first installment, I found myself wishing for clearer reminders of how some characters connected to the story. Cole and Laila, both nearing forty, take an unexpectedly long time to recognize their love for each other. Their relationship begins as a close, sibling-like bond, characterized by affection and openness. However, Cole's sudden shift in feelings—sparked by a dream—felt unrealistic, and his jealousy over Laila's dinner with a fictionalized Milo Ventimiglia didn't resonate with me. Despite this, I enjoyed revisiting Brynn and Sebastian from the first book and exploring New York City through Cole and Laila’s adventures."

However, it’s not marketed as part of a series, so I recommend reading the first book before diving into this one.  \n\n- **Character Continuity and Recall:**  \n  Lucy Score excels at bringing back characters from previous books in a natural, non-redundant way. I listened to the audiobook months after reading the first book and wished some characters were reintroduced more clearly, as I had forgotten how they tied into the story.  \n\n- **Main Characters and Their Relationship:**  \n  Cole and Laila, both almost forty, take an unusually long time to realize they love each other. Their relationship starts as a close, brother-sister-like bond, with them being affectionate and sharing everything. However, the sudden shift in Cole’s feelings—triggered by a dream—felt unrealistic. His sudden jealousy over Laila going on a dinner with Milo Ventimiglia (a fictionalized version) didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Pop Culture References:**  \n  The book is packed with pop culture references, including *Gilmore Girls*, *FRIENDS*, cooking shows, *When Harry Met Sally*, and Taylor Swift.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n   - The book features the \"Friends to More\" trope, which is executed beautifully.  \n   - It is set in New York and includes pop culture references, adding depth and relatability to the story.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n   - Cole and Laila’s friendship is beautifully portrayed. Their bond is so strong that, at times, I thought I’d be fine if they remained just friends.  \n   - Cole’s actions, like taking videos and pictures of Laila to let her shine, show his deep care for her.  \n   - Laila’s patience with Cole, even when he’s being a bit of a jerk (as he admits), highlights her understanding and love for him.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The story evoked strong emotions, making me cry happy tears multiple times. Even after finishing the book, I found myself tearing up when it randomly popped into my head.  \n   - The emotional depth of the story is exceptional and left a lasting impression.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n   - The book is hilarious, with laugh-out-loud moments that balance the emotional weight of the story.  \n\n- **Content and Warnings:**  \n   - The book is closed-door, with only kisses on the page. These are not very detailed, apart from hand placement.  \n   - There is a dream sequence involving Cole and Laila that is important to the story but not detailed on the page.  \n   - Content warnings include the loss of a parental figure (current) and parental abandonment (past).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is my favorite friends-to-more story and one of my top five books of all time. The relationship between Cole and Laila is beautifully written, and the emotional impact of the story is profound. It’s a sweet, hilarious, and deeply moving novel that I highly recommend. Preorder it or add it to your TBR—it’s a must-read!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Characters and Chemistry:**  \n  Cole and Laila are an adorable duo with great chemistry. The author effectively incorporates funny anecdotes about their antics growing up, which adds depth and charm to their relationship.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The book includes several laugh-out-loud moments and plenty of smile-inducing scenes, making it a lighthearted and enjoyable read.  \n\n- **Relatability and Representation:**  \n  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the characters are around my own age (36). The author captures the \"grown-up-but-honestly-am-I?\" feeling of this age group, which is refreshing compared to most rom-coms that focus on younger characters.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  While I enjoyed the book overall, I found the ending a bit anti-climactic. I was rooting for the couple but felt the story left readers hanging. An epilogue showing where Cole and Laila are a few years later would have provided a more satisfying conclusion.  \n\n- **Content and Genre Expectations:**  \n  The book is wholesome and lacks any \"spice,\" which aligns with its Christian publishing background. If you're looking for steamy romance, this isn't the book for you. However, it’s a great feel-good story perfect for readers seeking a light, uplifting read.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  This is an awesome feel-good book that I would recommend to anyone in need of a pick-me-up. It’s an ideal summer beach read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nCole and Laila Are Just Friends is a super cute, wholesome rom-com with charming characters, relatable humor, and a refreshing focus on an older age group. While the ending felt a bit incomplete, the book is an enjoyable, lighthearted read perfect for lifting your spirits.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

If we met in real life, I think we would be best friends.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  I just didn't quite believe how they could have been friends and nothing else for so long.

However, this did not impact my enjoyment of the book so much.\n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Structure:**  \n  One thing I did find a little disorienting was how Laila's POV was in first person but Cole's was in third person. I didn't necessarily hate it, but it pulled me out of the story from time to time.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, I really liked this story. I enjoyed the author's first book, and Cole and Laila appeared in that one.

Familiar characters from the first book do appear, but it’s not necessary to have read the previous installment to appreciate this story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Style:**  \n  The story got off to a slower start for me, partly due to the alternating POVs—first-person for her and third-person for him.

The friends-to-lovers dynamic between Cole and Laila was heartwarming, and I look forward to reading more from this author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I love the quirky things the characters say and the situations they find themselves in.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I love those Irish accents in the audiobooks.  \n\n- **Engaging Moments:**  \n  The section of banter you reread over and over because it makes you smile. Sadly, the only part I reread was the prologue about grandma Hazel.  \n\n- **Pop Culture References:**  \n  The pop culture references liberally scattered through the book turned me off. Sure, I knew some, but the amount was a bit too much. I guess I'm not someone who memorizes every TV/movie factoid. To me, a really good book will be just as well received decades/centuries later.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I concentrated on the characters' growth and development. I wondered if they would stay in one place or be traveling like Sebastian and Brynn. I admired how they put each other's needs before themselves. I also wondered how they could be 40 and clueless. Ah, well. Love does that.  \n\n- **Series Appeal:**  \n  While I'll recommend most of Bethany's books, I can't see this series being something I'll keep reading.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed Bethany Turner's signature quirky style and engaging character dynamics, but the excessive pop culture references detracted from my enjoyment.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n   - The book features my favorite tropes: friends to lovers, soulmates, forced proximity, and secretly pining for someone.  \n   - I am a devoted fan of the friends-to-lovers trope and generally enjoy stories with this theme.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The book made me cry, which is a sign of a good book for me.  \n\n- **Character Believability:**  \n   - Laila's behavior felt unrealistic for a woman in her late 30s to nearly 40. If she were in her 20s, her actions would have been more understandable, but her age made her behavior unconvincing.  \n   - Cole's delayed realization about his feelings for Laila was frustrating. After following her for decades, it felt unrealistic that a few dreams and one night of sleeping together suddenly changed everything, especially since they had slept together in the past without any major revelations.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n   - The miscommunication between Cole and his grandfather was upsetting and added unnecessary tension to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the book's tropes and emotional moments, the believability of the characters' actions and the frustrating miscommunication detracted from my overall experience. Despite its strengths, these issues led me to give it a 3.5-star rating.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

This is a clean romance that I thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend to others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nCole and Laila Are Just Friends is a refreshing and realistic take on the friends-to-more trope, with well-developed characters, a charming small-town setting, and a compelling audiobook narration.

However, I found the execution unrealistic. For two people who had been best friends for almost 40 years, it seemed implausible that they never discussed anything romantic before. The transition from friendship to romance felt rushed, with the catalyst being a sexy dream Cole had, leading to \"instalove.\" I expected more gradual realization and emotional buildup, but instead, it went from \"hey let's kiss\" to \"I cannot live without you.\" I wanted more longing, passion, and tension—more of a \"will they, won't they\" dynamic.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, despite being almost 40 years old, came across as immature and directionless in various aspects of their lives. This made it harder for me to fully connect with them or believe in their emotional depth.  \n\n- **Use of Pop Culture References:**  \n  The book included a lot of pop culture references, which I found cute at first. However, I worry that these references might feel dated very quickly, potentially affecting the book's longevity and relatability.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite these critiques, I thought the story was cute and enjoyable overall. I appreciated the lightheartedness and the premise, even if it didn’t fully meet my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the book and its premise, the rushed romance, lack of emotional depth, and immature character portrayals detracted from my overall experience.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Dialogue and Banter:**  \n   - The banter between the characters was great and added charm to the story.  \n   - However, the dialogue relied heavily on movie pop culture references, which I often didn’t understand, making it less relatable.  \n\n- **Character Age and Representation:**  \n   - I appreciated that the main characters, Cole and Laila, were in their late 30s (38-39 years old), which felt refreshing and relatable.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n   - Despite their age, their relationship felt more like a YA teenager first-love romance rather than an adult romance.  \n   - The lack of intimacy was disappointing—there were no closed-door scenes, sexual tension, or even references to it.  \n   - Their relationship never fully evolved beyond kissing, and by the end, there was no 100% established relationship, only hints that it might develop in the future.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n   - As someone who reads adult romance for mature relationships and intimacy, the lack of these elements left me disappointed.  \n   - While Cole and Laila were cute together, their dynamic felt more suited to a friendship than a romantic relationship.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The bulk of the book was enjoyable, and I found the characters endearing.  \n   - However, the ending and the lack of romantic progression detracted from my overall satisfaction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the banter and age representation were highlights, the lack of intimacy and mature romantic development made the story feel more like a YA romance than an adult one. Cole and Laila were charming, but their relationship didn’t meet my expectations for an adult romance novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The setting added a nice touch to the story, even though I couldn’t relate to the pop culture references.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  Despite my issues with the book, I liked the characters enough to want what was best for them. I particularly loved their first date, which stood out as a highlight.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this friends-to-lovers story, the meandering writing style, lack of character maturity, and excessive miscommunication left me disappointed.

I also enjoyed their trip to NYC to visit Brynn and Sebastian, and it was a treat to have those characters pop up in this story.  \n\n- **Pop Culture References:**  \n  The book is filled with delightful pop culture references, including nods to the movie *You've Got Mail*, Taylor Swift songs (and mentions of Taylor herself), and even a discussion about Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' living arrangements. These references added a fun and relatable layer to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  This book has everything you’d want in a rom-com—moments that make you shed a few tears and laugh-out-loud scenes. It strikes a perfect balance between heartfelt and humorous, making it an engaging read.  \n\n- **Appropriateness and Accessibility:**  \n  It’s a clean read, making it suitable for anyone from late high school onward. The story is wholesome and enjoyable for a wide audience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Cole and Laila Are Just Friends* is a wonderful rom-com that delivers on all fronts—emotional depth, humor, and a strong connection to its predecessor. With its clever pop culture references and clean, accessible storytelling, it’s a book that can be enjoyed by a broad audience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The romantic connection between the main characters was believable, but the lack of depth in their individual personalities made the story feel incomplete.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Instead of focusing on superficial elements like looks or initial chemistry, it emphasized the genuine love between two people for who they truly are.

While some of these themes were present, they were not drawn out over 100 pages, which I found refreshing.",

While there was some of that, it wasn’t dragged out over 100 pages.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, Cole and Laila, felt genuine and well-developed. Their relationship was built on a deep understanding and appreciation of each other’s personalities, which made their connection feel authentic and meaningful.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  I didn’t read the first book, *Brynn and Sebastian Hate Each Other*, which might have provided more context about their friends who play significant roles in this story. However, this didn’t detract too much from my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  It was a good, solid read that I enjoyed a lot.

The imbalance in perspective was a significant drawback, though it didn't completely overshadow the book's strengths.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars with a one-star penalty for the narrative style issue."

I found myself not fully buying into the main characters' romantic relationship.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  The book had a charming and entertaining quality, but I personally dislike miscommunication as a plot device, and there was too much of it for my taste.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The NYC setting added a nice backdrop to the story and contributed to its overall charm.  \n\n- **Audience Appeal:**  \n  While it wasn’t a total winner for me, I can see how many readers would find it an enjoyable and entertaining read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a light and cute rom-com with a charming NYC setting. Although the plot and romantic relationship didn’t fully resonate with me, and the overuse of miscommunication was a drawback, I can appreciate its appeal and believe it will entertain many readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The emotional shift felt forced and didn’t align with the depth of their established friendship.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of Cole and Lila's evolving relationship had potential, the sudden and unrealistic shift in their feelings made it difficult to connect with the story. The exploration of their friendship and personal struggles was intriguing, but the romantic development lacked credibility.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The premise is a classic friends-to-lovers trope, which is cute and engaging, especially since the characters are in their 30s.

Some scenes, like the PG-13 moments (e.g., sharing a bed), felt unnecessary and detracted from the overall tone of the story.  \n\n- **Faith Elements:**  \n  As a Christian fiction book, the faith elements were disappointingly light. It read more like a mainstream clean romance rather than a story with strong spiritual themes. I was left wanting more exploration of faith in the characters’ lives and decisions.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  This is the second book in the series, and while it can be read as a standalone, I would recommend starting with the first book to better understand the supporting characters and their dynamics. Without prior context, it might be challenging to keep up with the other characters in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a cute friends-to-lovers story with a charming premise, but it falls short in terms of character maturity, romantic depth, and faith integration.

The two friends embark on a trip to New York, leaving their tiny Colorado town behind to stay with some rather famous acquaintances. Will they be captivated by the city's dazzling lights and glamour?",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the character development of Cole and Laila. I found myself rooting for both of them while simultaneously urging them to just communicate. Having been best friends for nearly four decades, they know everything about each other, yet their inability to talk adds an intriguing tension to their relationship.",

            "\"Small Town\" offers a refreshing take with its older characters in their 30s, a delightful change from the usual youth-centric narratives. The story features a charming forced proximity scenario that leads to the most entertaining fake first date I've ever read. Additionally, the clever pop culture references add a fun layer to the narrative. Overall, it's a delightful read that balances humor and heart."

I found myself cheering for both of these characters, all the while screaming at them to finally just TALK to each other. Cole and Laila have been best friends for almost four decades and know absolutely everything about each other.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  Laila's grandmother always told her that things happen in threes, so it's no surprise to them when some major events happen that send Cole's life in a tailspin. Things end up happening where the two take a trip to New York (away from their *very* small Colorado town), and stay with their quite famous friends. Will they both be ensnared by the lights and glamour of the city?  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  Some tropes that might interest you in reading this one:  \n  - Small Town (albeit not the whole time!)  \n  - Slowest of the slow burn  \n  - Older characters (so glad to see characters in their 30s!)  \n  - Forced Proximity  \n  - Fake Date (the most fun fake first date ever)  \n  - Banter  \n  - Pop culture references  \n\n- **Favorite Quote:**  \n  \"Thank you, Birdjosh Groban, for the inspiration to cut off the crust of the bread. I honor you on this day.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a delightful read with well-developed characters, an engaging plot, and a mix of tropes that kept me hooked. The slow-burn romance, witty banter, and relatable older characters made it a standout story for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

It felt unrealistic that two platonic best friends had never considered the possibility of one dating someone else.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance had some fun and sweet moments, but there was zero spice, which might be a pro or con depending on the reader's preference.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  I enjoyed the dual POV format, though I felt the male narrator far outshined the other in terms of depth and engagement.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had its charming moments, particularly in its setting and narrative style, but the characters' lack of maturity and the absence of romantic tension left me with mixed feelings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
