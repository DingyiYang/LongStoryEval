            "I wish this book had been written from multiple perspectives, as it would have deepened my connection to the story. Charlotte, a burned-out millennial, is facing her 5-year college reunion with dread. With little to show for her success, she fears reconnecting with friends who seem to have their lives together. As she revisits her past, Charlotte gains a fresh perspective on her future and the people around her. Expect Buzzfeed vibes, millennial lingo, a bisexual heroine, second-chance romance, and themes of burned-out millennials and chosen family.",
            "Charlotte's character development was exceptional. Initially, her 'woe is me' attitude was off-putting, but by the end, I felt a sense of pride in her growth. The other characters were also beautifully crafted, making you feel like a true member of their group. Their camaraderie was heartwarming, and it's the kind of friendship you would want in your own life.",
            "The writing was decent, though I occasionally found it boring and had to push through some sections due to repetition. However, I appreciated the way characters communicated; there was no reliance on the miscommunication trope.",
            "I would recommend this book to the right audience. It was my first experience with this author, and I look forward to exploring more of her work in the future."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a solid 3-star read with a relatable millennial protagonist and a heartwarming portrayal of chosen family. While the plot had potential, it fell short in execution, and the writing occasionally felt repetitive. However, the character development, especially Charlotte's, was exceptional, and the absence of miscommunication tropes was refreshing. The book is recommended for the right audience, and the author's future works are worth exploring.",

            "I appreciated the characters' communication, especially when one expressed hurt feelings, allowing for apologies and understanding. Their clear intentions and realistic interactions made them feel like real people, which is often lacking in literature. I particularly enjoyed Reece, who came across as a genuine, decent guy. While there was potential for melodrama, he remained rational and attentive. The representation of queer characters was refreshing; I saw myself in them in a way I never have before. Although I didn't experience the same homophobia as Charlotte, I deeply resonated with her struggles. The book felt distinctly millennial, with references and themes that mirrored my own experiences, particularly the burnout that many in my generation face.",

I saw myself in the characters of this book in a way I never have before.  \n  - Although I thankfully did not have homophobic parents like Charlotte does, I really felt like I understood her.  \n  - This book felt very millennial, which I appreciated. The characters' references were my references, and the burnout they experienced is all too common in my generation.  \n  - I could feel the disappointment in not achieving your dreams yet when everyone around you seems to be doing well. I felt like this book was very much written for me.  \n\n- **Handling of Difficult Topics:**  \n  - This book handled a lot of difficult topics, including homophobia, grief, alcoholism, abusive relationships, anxiety/panic disorder, and sexual harassment.  \n  - These topics were handled so impressively. I felt the character’s panic without ever feeling unsafe.  \n  - I applaud the author for not shying away from these topics while also giving the book lighter moments. It was an emotional book, but I would not call it particularly dark.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - I appreciated that the characters communicated with each other, at least eventually. When a character's feelings were hurt, they communicated that so the other could apologize.  \n  - Characters were clear in their intentions and interacted like actual people. This does not always happen in books.  \n  - I also enjoyed the character of Reece, who felt like a normal, decent guy. There could have been some melodramatic moments if he reacted the wrong way, but he listened and was a rational person.  \n\n- **Setting and Timeline:**  \n  - The book takes place in 2018, which takes a second to adjust to, but it makes sense for where the characters are in their lives based on their references.  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  - This book was such a breath of fresh air. It watered my crops and cleared my acne. It gave me hope when I had none. I’m being a bit dramatic, but that is how much I loved this book.  \n  - Overall, I’m just so glad that this book exists.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt, relatable, and emotionally resonant story that tackles difficult topics with care and authenticity. Its millennial perspective, strong character dynamics, and thoughtful handling of sensitive issues make it a standout read. I highly recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed Reece's character portrayal. Jackie, who joined the story later, was a scene-stealer and significantly enhanced the narrative. I also appreciated how Charlotte's bisexuality was presented unapologetically and naturally—there were no dramatic twists, big reveals, or lengthy discussions on biphobia. She simply *was* bisexual, which felt both refreshing and authentic.",

            "This contemporary fiction novel humorously and romantically delves into the quarterlife crisis. It follows Charlotte Thorne as she returns to her college for alumni weekend, where she is tasked with live-tweeting her boss’s commencement speech for a job she dislikes. The narrative centers on Charlotte’s struggle to navigate her career, friendships, and romantic entanglements while seeking clarity about her desires in life. Key themes include self-discovery, self-advocacy, self-love, and the importance of leaning on friends for support. Set over a single weekend, the story creates a sense of urgency and focus. The pacing is well-executed, as Charlotte juggles work pressures, exes, and friendships in a way that feels both realistic and immersive.",
            "Charlotte is a relatable protagonist, and I found myself rooting for her throughout her introspective journey. Her interactions with friends from the LGBTQIA+ program house enrich the narrative, as they challenge her denial and encourage her to confront her struggles. The romantic tension with \"the one that got away\" is compelling, featuring genuine chemistry and witty banter that adds emotional depth.",

However, I found the relationship between the protagonist and her best friend underdeveloped, especially given their history. It was frustrating that the protagonist confided more in a male character than in her best friend, which felt inconsistent with their supposed closeness.
