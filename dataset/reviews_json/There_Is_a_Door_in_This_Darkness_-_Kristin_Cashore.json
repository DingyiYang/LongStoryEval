            "Wilhelmina is a relatable and well-crafted protagonist, grappling with anxiety about the election and the turbulent political landscape. Her intense focus on the election underscores the emotional toll it takes on her. The three aunts stand out as the heart of the story. Though not related by blood, they embody familial support, offering wisdom and grounding to Wilhelmina. Their recurring advice to seek out “a door” when overwhelmed serves as a poignant motif throughout the narrative. Additionally, their worries about mail ballots not arriving in time due to COVID add depth to both their characters and the plot.",
            "Set against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, this story captures a timely and relevant atmosphere. The aunts’ displacement from their home state—a pivotal swing state—adds both tension and realism to the plot."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While *There is a Door in this Darkness* is a well-written novel with strong character development and intriguing supernatural elements, its heavy focus on politics and the 2020 election may not appeal to everyone. The aunts are the standout characters, offering wisdom and emotional depth. However, the political themes dominate the narrative, potentially overshadowing other aspects of the story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Political Themes:**  \n  The novel is deeply political, focusing on the 2020 election and the impact of Trump's presidency. While I’m not typically into politics, I understand that this aspect will resonate with some readers and alienate others. The main character, Wilhelmina, is intensely stressed about the election, which affects every part of her life. The aunts, who are also politically opposed to Trump, add another layer to this theme.  \n\n- **Character Development (Wilhelmina):**  \n  Wilhelmina is a relatable and well-developed protagonist. Her anxiety about the election and her struggles with the political climate make her a compelling character. Her hyper-focus on the election reflects the emotional toll it takes on her.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters (The Aunts):**  \n  The three aunts are the highlight of the book. Though not related by blood, they are family to Wilhelmina and serve as wise, grounding figures. Their advice to look for “a door” when things feel overwhelming is a recurring and meaningful motif. Their concerns about their mail ballots not arriving in time due to COVID add depth to their characters and the story.  \n\n- **Supernatural Elements:**  \n  The book includes some supernatural elements, which are intriguing and fun. However, these aspects feel overshadowed by the strong political themes and the characters’ disdain for Trump.  \n\n- **Setting and Context:**  \n  The story is set during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, which provides a timely and relevant backdrop. The aunts’ displacement from their home state (a swing state) due to COVID adds tension and realism to the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *There is a Door in this Darkness* is a well-written novel with strong character development and intriguing supernatural elements, its heavy focus on politics and the 2020 election may not appeal to everyone. The aunts are the standout characters, offering wisdom and emotional depth. However, the political themes dominate the narrative, potentially overshadowing other aspects of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the resolution, where she embraces the \"magic of the world\" to move forward, feels forced and unsatisfactory. The portrayal of grief and mental health through magical elements appears dismissive of genuine struggles, undermining the weight of these themes.",
            "Wilhelmina battles depression, yet her struggles go unnoticed by those around her, including her therapist mother. As she grapples with the grief of her aunt's death, she feels trapped in a bleak situation that exacerbates her mental health issues. Unfortunately, the depiction of her grief and mental health feels superficial, relying on hallucinations and magic rather than exploring the underlying causes of her pain. Her friends and family fail to provide the support she desperately needs, deepening her sense of isolation. While her frustration with their lack of understanding is relatable, the narrative unfairly positions her as the one at fault. The resolution, which hinges on forgiveness due to her being in a \"bad place,\" diminishes the complexity of her struggles.",

While the pandemic is a challenging topic, the book's 2020 setting, viewed through the lens of 2023, feels relevant yet lacks effective execution."

The portrayal of grief and mental health feels superficial, relying on magical elements rather than addressing the real issues.

The portrayal of grief and mental health feels superficial, relying on magical elements rather than addressing the real issues. The character dynamics and resolution are unsatisfying, and the writing style is weighed down by unnecessary tangents. Overall, the story fails to deliver a meaningful or relatable narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5 stars (DNF @20%)  \n\n*Thanks to PENGUIN GROUP Penguin Young Readers Group and NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest opinion.*"

Her struggle to cope reflects a reality many experienced during this challenging time. Readers will either resonate deeply with Wilhelmina's journey or find her unlikable. I appreciate the author's intention to address the stress, grief, and trauma we all faced, and I suspect younger readers may connect with Wilhelmina more than I did.",

However, this book is nothing like *Graceling*.  \n   - Overall, I do think this was well-written, but this one wasn’t my favorite by the author.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n   - This is a magical realism book set during the COVID pandemic and the 2020 election.  \n   - The book is very heavily politicized, and I prefer to keep real-life politics out of my fiction.  \n   - The book focuses on a time I’d rather forget, and it put me right back into the center of several very hard years.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - I thought the author did a good job expressing Wilhelmina’s emotions through the pandemic regarding anger, jealousy, grief, chronic pain, and loss.  \n   - She wasn’t coping well with any of her feelings, and I think that was pretty true for many of us as we navigated the pandemic.  \n   - Readers are either really going to connect with the main character and the journey she is going on, or they aren’t going to like her at all.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n   - The book is told in alternating timelines that eventually bring her story together with all of the strange things that have been happening to her and make her face that she isn’t OK.  \n   - The timeline jumps are either going to be to your preference or not.  \n\n- **Relatability and Target Audience:**  \n   - I can understand and appreciate why the author wrote this book as a way of coping with what we all went through, especially the stress, grief, and trauma many experienced.  \n   - Perhaps younger readers will relate to Wilhelmina a bit better than I did.  \n\n- **Personal Reading Preferences:**  \n   - I didn’t even read the synopsis, which I should have. I don’t think I would have picked this book up had I known how politically focused it was.  \n   - Part of the reason I read is to escape real life, and this book didn’t provide that escape for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book is well-written and effectively portrays the emotional struggles of its protagonist during a challenging period, its heavy political focus and setting during the COVID pandemic and 2020 election made it a less enjoyable read for me.

It’s funny—I think this book will be much more palatable in 10-20 years, when COVID and Trump (and Biden) can be looked at historically. In 2024, I didn’t really find reliving Election Day/Week 2020 enjoyable.  \n\n- **Political Themes:**  \n  While I agree with the book’s politics more or less, they felt raw and unrefined compared to the magical things happening.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I liked the aunts a lot.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The book does deal very sensitively and meaningfully with grief on multiple fronts.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Relevance:**  \n  I’ve certainly read plenty of World War II historical fiction that uses devastating world events as a backdrop for characters’ personal stories. But right now, I can’t successfully treat COVID, Trump, etc., as a backdrop. It’s still happening.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book handles grief and character relationships well, its reliance on recent, still-unfolding events like COVID and the 2020 election made it difficult to fully enjoy.

The descriptions of tarot cards and everyday magical practices are authentic, enhancing the story's credibility.

This novel marks a significant shift from the author's previous works, transitioning from high fantasy to a contemporary setting. Set against the backdrop of the COVID pandemic and the 2020 elections, it offers a poignant reflection for readers who experienced those events. Additionally, the Massachusetts setting, close to my own roots, adds a personal touch to the narrative.",

It poignantly examines grief, loss, and the journey of coming of age amid turmoil, resulting in a challenging yet essential reading experience. The interplay between national and personal grief weaves a powerful narrative about resilience and growth."

        "conclusion": "*There is a Door in This Darkness* is not an easy or escapist read, but it is an important and deeply resonant one. The author’s departure from high fantasy to a realistic, politically charged setting is bold and impactful. The themes of grief, loss, and resilience are handled with care, and the character development, particularly Wilhelmina’s journey, is masterfully done. The depiction of magic and witchcraft is authentic and enchanting, adding a layer of personal connection for readers familiar with the craft.

While I didn’t expect to like it as much, it stood out in its own unique way.  \n\n- **Companion Read:**  \n  This book felt like a great companion read to *The House in the Cerulean Sea* by TJ Klune. I could imagine the aunts in this story being fans of Linus from Klune’s book.  \n\n- **Personal Preference:**  \n  While I enjoyed this book, it’s worth noting that *Jane Unlimited*, Cashore’s other non-Graceling book, remains my least favorite.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was the third fabulous book I’ve read in a row, and it left a lasting emotional impact. Though different from Cashore’s Graceling series, it stood out as a unique and beautiful story, with strong character connections and a vibe that complemented *The House in the Cerulean Sea*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The flashbacks and the way things started to tie together, as well as the exploration of grief, were exactly what I expect from a Cashore novel.  \n\n- **Setting and Personal Sensitivity:**  \n   - I'm not ready to read fiction set during the pandemic. This is the second time I've read a book dealing with it, and it's too traumatic for me. This setting put me on edge the entire time.  \n\n- **Political Themes and Nuance:**  \n   - I didn't have an issue with the characters or Cashore coming from a different political perspective than mine. However, I was troubled by the lack of nuance in portraying people who support opposing political views. The book grouped half of the United States with the same horrible motives and beliefs, without acknowledging that people might have many reasons for their choices.  \n   - One scene particularly bothered me: while waiting in line to vote, a woman supporting the opposing candidate generously offers to help Wilhelmina's aunt, but her kindness is met with skepticism and hostility. Instead of recognizing shared humanity, the book framed her as an idiot for being nice while supporting a \"terrible\" candidate.  \n\n- **Tone and Impact of Political Vitriol:**  \n   - The political vitriol in the book was highly upsetting. It read like the internet rants I try to avoid. While authors are entitled to their opinions, I believe they also have a responsibility not to add to the hate and division that polarizes our country.  \n   - The book's portrayal of the \"other side\" felt prejudiced and hateful, contributing to the polarization where young people refuse to engage with those who hold different views. This was disappointing, disheartening, and frustrating.  \n\n- **Overall Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The book weighed me down emotionally, both in ways I think were intended and unintended. I pushed through to get a full picture before reviewing it, but it was a draining experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated Wilhelmina's internal journey and the exploration of grief, the book's handling of political themes and its lack of nuance were deeply disappointing. The pandemic setting was personally triggering, and the political vitriol added to the polarization I try to avoid.

            "The author demonstrates their signature attention to detail but opts to forgo traditional fantasy magic in favor of a grounded narrative. Set against the backdrop of the pandemic and the 2020 election, which I found off-putting due to my own anxieties associated with that time, the story introduces a mix of tarot card readings, energy magic, and whispers from the dead. I felt the prolonged focus on the mundane aspects of reality detracted from the magical elements. However, the clever choice to refer to the former president without using his name—avoiding lending him any Voldemort-like power—was a notable highlight.",

The handling of grief and medical issues was well-done, but the lack of focus on magic and the inclusion of pandemic themes left me feeling disconnected. Overall, it’s a well-crafted story, just not one that fully resonated with me.",
