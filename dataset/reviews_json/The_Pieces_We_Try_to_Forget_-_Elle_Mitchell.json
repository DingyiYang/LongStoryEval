            "Amelia's character is heartbreakingly complex. Initially depicted as the town's princess, she matures too quickly, sacrificing her dreams to assume a maternal role for her younger sister. Her smiles feel hollow, and her transformation into a cold, indifferent figure—mirroring her mother—is both striking and tragic. I found myself questioning whether this change was for the better, as her once-vibrant spirit is completely extinguished.",
