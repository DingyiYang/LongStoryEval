            "The plot felt tedious, dominated by trivial conversations and clichéd tropes like age gaps, fake dating, and toxic exes. These overused elements, including dysfunctional families and abusive relationships, contributed little to the narrative. The pacing was sluggish, with minimal significant developments occurring until the final quarter of the book.",
            "The characters in the story were flat and lacked depth, coming across as kind but ultimately forgettable. Despite being in their 30s and 40s, the main characters behaved like hormonal teenagers, which felt both disappointing and unrealistic. The inclusion of LGBTQ characters seemed tokenistic, as they lacked meaningful development or relevance to the plot. The romance primarily revolved around lust rather than a genuine emotional connection, relying heavily on the overused insta-lust trope. Characters experienced intense attraction after just two meetings, which felt shallow and unconvincing. Furthermore, the romance only gained significance in the final 20-30% of the book, making it feel like too little, too late.",
            "The writing style was abrupt and disjointed, characterized by frequent POV changes and hasty time jumps. POV shifts often interrupted conversations and chapters, leading to a confusing reading experience. Transitions between scenes were rigid and lacked fluidity, making the narrative feel poorly organized and jarring.",
            "This book leans heavily on generic tropes such as insta-lust, age gaps, fake dating, and toxic families, failing to introduce any unique or meaningful elements. The depiction of toxic family dynamics and abusive exes feels clichéd and uninspired. Additionally, while LGBTQ characters and themes are present, they come across as superficial, lacking depth and development.",
            "The book was largely dull and unentertaining, with few moments that captured the reader's interest. The absence of significant events turned the story into a slog. Attempts at humor fell flat, with witty dialogue seeming forced and unamusing. Character conversations were trivial and lacked depth, rendering them unimportant and disengaging."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Fake Flame* by the author was a disappointing read. The characters were dull, the romance lacked depth, and the plot was filled with overused tropes and trivial conversations. The writing style was abrupt and poorly organized, making it difficult to stay engaged. While the FMC’s stance on not wanting children was a positive aspect, it wasn’t enough to salvage the book. The story felt generic, unoriginal, and largely unentertaining.",

Their solution? A fake dating arrangement to deter the ex. However, they unexpectedly fall for each other. The premise is engaging, with a mix of sweetness and spice, and the older age of the characters (late 30s and early 40s) adds a refreshing twist, especially with the woman being older than the man.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both Eva and Sean are well-established in their careers, which adds depth to their characters. Their journey from fake dating to real love feels authentic and relatable. The conflict arising from Eva's reluctance to have children, while Sean potentially wants them, adds emotional complexity and drives the narrative forward.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The romance is sweet and spicy, with a satisfying balance. I particularly enjoyed how Sean falls first and wholeheartedly loves Eva, while she takes time to trust and accept his love. This dynamic adds a layer of emotional depth and makes their relationship feel genuine.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The story is a quick and easy read, making it perfect for fans of light-hearted yet emotionally engaging romance. The pacing is well-balanced, with enough tension and resolution to keep the reader invested.\n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  This book is highly recommended for readers who enjoy Abby Jimenez's works or anyone looking for a sweet and spicy fake-dating-to-lovers romance. It’s a delightful addition to the genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartwarming and refreshing take on the fake-dating trope, with well-developed characters, a compelling conflict, and a satisfying romantic arc. The older age of the protagonists and the woman being older than the man add a unique and enjoyable twist. It’s a quick, easy, and emotionally engaging read that I would highly recommend.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars."

            "The book presents complex real-life conflicts, yet the resolutions come across as overly neat and idealized. While I appreciate the avoidance of drawn-out parental disputes or dangerous exes, the treatment of these issues feels overly simplistic. The story kicks off with Eva and Sean's meeting, sparked by her ex's grand gesture to win her back, which leads to her threatening to set a baby grand piano on fire. Sean, a firefighter, is instantly smitten with Eva, a literature and pop culture professor, and proposes a fake dating arrangement to help her navigate her persistent ex. The premise is engaging, and the chemistry between Sean and Eva, along with their shared love of books, propels the narrative forward.",

Sean's thoughtfulness and care for Eva are truly endearing, and she values his attentiveness. However, their relationship faces challenges from family expectations and personal insecurities, adding complexity and depth to their bond.",

This novel is a delightful, steamy romcom that features beloved tropes such as fake dating, an age gap, an older couple, and dual POV.

The pacing is engaging, combining humor, romance, and tension to keep readers invested.",

However, the inconsistent handling of certain plotlines prevents it from achieving a higher rating.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- The reviewer implies a rating slightly lower than their potential maximum due to unresolved or underdeveloped plotlines.

            "The story suffers from a lack of character development. Sean's constant reference to his four older sisters becomes excessive and off-putting. Eva, who initially appears to be a smart and independent woman, quickly regresses into immature behavior, which is disappointing. The chemistry between the characters is lacking; Eva's instant physical attraction to Sean feels unrealistic and juvenile for a woman in her 40s. Their relationship is superficial, lacking meaningful growth or depth. Additionally, a line where Sean remarks that it's good the police weren't called because Eva would be fine as a \"pretty white woman\" feels unnecessary and insensitive, detracting from the overall narrative.",
            "The book lacks a dual point of view, resulting in rapid and confusing shifts between characters' perspectives. This inconsistency, coupled with contradictions between characters' words and actions, creates a messy narrative. Random insertions further contribute to the disorganization. The dialogue feels immature, reminiscent of 13-year-olds, with little to no banter. Conversations come across as rushed and incomplete, offering only fragments rather than cohesive exchanges.",
            "The premise of the story was promising: a woman in her 40s—refreshingly not a teenager—who doesn't want kids, paired with a sweet firefighter. The fake dating trope to navigate a crazy ex also held potential. Unfortunately, the execution fell flat, causing my interest to wane quickly."

The poor dialogue, lack of character development, and messy writing style made it difficult to enjoy.

I loved it and found it visually appealing.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  - The storyline and plot seemed promising: a woman in her 40s (refreshingly not a teenager) who doesn’t want kids, paired with a cinnamon roll firefighter. The fake dating trope to deal with a crazy ex also sounded intriguing. However, the execution was poor, and the story lost my interest quickly.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Banter:**  \n  - The banter was non-existent. The characters spoke like they were 13 years old, and the dialogue felt rushed and incomplete, as if only snippets of conversations were provided.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - There was little to no character development. Sean’s repeated mention of having four older sisters became excessive and annoying. Eva, who initially seemed like a smart, independent woman, quickly devolved into acting like a child, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Chemistry and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  - The chemistry between the characters was lacking. Eva’s immediate physical attraction to Sean felt unrealistic and juvenile for a woman in her 40s. The relationship felt shallow, with no meaningful development or depth.  \n\n- **Writing Style and POV:**  \n  - The book is not a dual POV, and the rapid switching between characters’ perspectives within sentences was confusing and hard to follow. The storytelling felt messy, with contradictions between what characters said and did. Random sentences inserted throughout added to the disorganization.  \n\n- **Representation and Sensitivity:**  \n  - A line about Sean saying it’s good the police weren’t called because Eva would be fine as a “pretty white woman” felt unnecessary and rubbed me the wrong way. It added nothing to the story and came across as insensitive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had potential with its premise and cover design, but it fell short in execution. The poor dialogue, lack of character development, and messy writing style made it difficult to enjoy. The chemistry between the characters felt forced, and the repetitive mentions of Sean’s four sisters became grating. Overall, I was disappointed and ultimately chose not to finish the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- ✨ Overall: 1/5 (for the cover alone)  \n- 🌶️ Spice: N/A (didn’t read far enough to judge)  \n- 🔥 Story: 3/5 (promising premise but poorly executed)  \n- 🎭 Banter: 0/5  \n- ❤️‍🔥 Relationship: 1/5  \n- 🧪 Chemistry: 0/5  \n- 🧑🏻‍🚒 Character Development: 0/5"

            "The romance between Eva and Sean begins with an instant attraction that feels somewhat rushed. I would have preferred more chance encounters and gradual development before Sean proposed the idea of fake dating. However, despite the quick spark, I appreciated the natural expression of desire between the characters, which felt appropriate given their ages. Eva, a 41-year-old professor, navigates her toxic ex with strength and clarity, and I was glad the author avoided escalating the situation into a sexual assault or kidnapping. Sean, a likable 35-36-year-old firefighter, could have had a clearer stance on family, considering his age. The supporting characters, like Sean’s sister Caitlin and Eva’s friend Kristy, were well-developed and enriched the story. I would have enjoyed more scenes featuring Felix, Thea, and Kristy.",
            "This book grounded itself in reality, a quality I truly appreciated. The author tackled challenging subjects such as toxic relationships and family dynamics without glossing over their complexities. While the quick pacing and frequent shifts in point of view might be disorienting for some, I found them manageable and engaging.",
            "The book effectively addresses realistic themes, including toxic family dynamics and the challenges of dating later in life. Eva's choice to forgo having children due to her age is a refreshing and often overlooked topic. The depiction of toxic relationships, both romantic and familial, is authentic and well-executed.",

            "The characters frequently express one set of values while behaving in ways that contradict them. The female protagonist, Eva, is particularly shallow and inconsistent—she professes feminist beliefs yet is taken aback when other women support her, highlighting her internalized biases. Moreover, the characters lack depth, with their traits conveyed through narrative exposition instead of demonstrated through their actions or development.",
            "The book suffers from excessive repetition, with the male protagonist redundantly mentioning details like roach spray and his four sisters within the same sentences. By page 29, this repetition nearly drove me to abandon the book. Reducing these repeated lines would greatly enhance the reading experience, making it lighter and more enjoyable. Additionally, the dialogue feels clunky and awkward, often requiring re-reading for clarity. The romance comes across as forced and unrealistic, with characters expressing lust for each other mere minutes after their first encounter, despite minimal conversation. The story rushes their relationship, prioritizing lust over the development of genuine love and connection.",
            "The story's premise is compelling but ultimately falls short in execution. While there are standout moments, such as the impactful role reversal between Dean Treadwell and her male assistant, Eva's narrative on feminism often comes across as bland and uninspired, undermining the story's potential."

            "The story boasts a fast pace, skillfully blending humor and drama around its central romance. While entertaining, it occasionally veers into cheesy and predictable territory. The plot revolves around a delightful fake-dating scenario featuring Eva, a 40-something English professor, and Sean, a 30-something firefighter, who meet in a quirky on-the-job situation. The meet-cute opening scene is one of the best I've encountered in a long time. However, the abundance of plot elements can sometimes distract from the core romance.",

Eva’s sassy personality and Sean’s kind, thoughtful nature make them endearing protagonists. However, the secondary characters lack depth and often come off as stereotypical, particularly the stalker ex-boyfriend antagonist. The romance between Eva and Sean is sweet, featuring sizzling chemistry and steamy bedroom scenes. The fake-dating trope adds an intriguing layer, blurring the lines between reality and their evolving feelings. It’s refreshing to see an older, successful career woman paired with a younger man who is secure in her success and higher earnings.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The novel features a fun fake-dating plot centered around Eva, an English professor in her 40s, and Sean, a firefighter in his 30s, who meet in a quirky circumstance on the job.\n   - The meet-cute opening scene is one of the best I’ve read in a long time.\n   - The plot is packed with a lot of elements, which can be slightly distracting from the core romance at times.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**\n   - Adele Buck’s writing style is enjoyable, easy to read, and fast-paced.\n   - The storytelling combines humor and heartfelt moments effectively.\n   - The tone reminded me of Colleen Hoover’s voice and Olivia Dade’s complex story beats.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Eva and Sean are relatable, likable, and well-developed as emotionally mature characters who communicate openly about their problems.\n   - Eva’s sassy nature and Sean’s kind, thoughtful demeanor make them endearing protagonists.\n   - Secondary characters, however, lack depth and come across as stereotypical, such as the stalker ex-boyfriend antagonist.\n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**\n   - The romance between Eva and Sean is sweet, with sizzling chemistry and smoldering bedroom scenes.\n   - The fake-dating trope spirals out of control, blurring the lines between reality and their growing feelings for each other.\n   - It’s refreshing to see an older, successful career woman paired with a younger man who is unthreatened by her success and higher earnings.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**\n   - The story highlights themes of emotional maturity, communication, and breaking traditional gender norms in relationships.\n   - Eva’s character as a strong, independent woman is a standout feature.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - The pacing is fast, with a good balance of humor and drama woven around the central romance.\n   - While entertaining, the story can feel a bit cheesy and predictable at times.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Fake Flame* is an entertaining, heartwarming contemporary romance with a fun fake-dating premise, strong character dynamics, and a blend of humor and heartfelt moments. While the secondary characters lack depth and the plot can feel slightly overstuffed, the chemistry between Eva and Sean, along with the refreshing representation of an older female lead, makes this a delightful and light read. Perfect for a summer day, it’s a cute, fluffy romance with just the right amount of spice and drama.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The central conflict centers on Eva's pragmatic view of her age and her choice not to have children, contrasted with Sean's uncertainty about parenthood. This is a relatable and significant issue, and I appreciated how the author approached it. However, the conflict was introduced too late in the narrative, resulting in a rushed resolution. Furthermore, the subplot involving Eva's ex-boyfriend had the potential for greater drama but ultimately fell flat, leaving me anticipating a more impactful confrontation that never materialized.",
            "In this engaging story, Eva, a tenured professor, is a relatable protagonist simply seeking peace from her ex. Enter Sean, the charming firefighter, who offers a fake dating scheme to help her out. Their chemistry is delightful, and the swift development of their feelings feels authentic. I appreciated how the reverse age gap—Eva at 41 and Sean at 35—was handled seamlessly, making it a non-issue in their relationship.",
            "This book offers a quick, enjoyable read filled with humor, romance, and intriguing moments. It skillfully balances lightheartedness with deeper themes such as relationships, age, and life choices.",
            "The novel opened with a captivating scene that drew me in right away, especially the infuriating ex and the dramatic meet-cute with the firefighters. Unfortunately, the story lost some momentum when the fake dating trope was introduced, which was disappointing since I typically enjoy this trope."

The initial scene with the infuriating ex and the dramatic meet-cute with the firefighters was fantastic. However, the story lost some of its momentum once the fake dating trope began, which was disappointing since I usually love this trope.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n  Eva, the tenured professor, is a relatable protagonist who just wants her ex to leave her alone. Sean, the hot firefighter, is a sweet and caring character who proposes a fake dating scheme to help her. Their chemistry was enjoyable, and their quick development of feelings felt natural. The reverse age gap (Eva is 41, Sean is 35) was handled well and didn’t feel like a significant issue, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  The main conflict revolves around Eva’s practicality regarding her age and her decision not to have children, while Sean is unsure about his stance on kids. This is a realistic and valid concern, and I liked how the author addressed it. However, this conflict felt like it was introduced too late in the story, making its resolution feel rushed. Additionally, the ex-boyfriend subplot had potential for more drama, but it never fully materialized, leaving me waiting for a more impactful confrontation that never came.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The book was a quick, enjoyable read with moments of humor, swoon, and spice. It balanced lightheartedness with more serious themes like relationships, age, and life choices.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and entertaining read with a strong start and likable characters.

            "The story outlines its main events early, setting clear expectations. However, the midpoint serves as a more fitting conclusion, and the narrative feels drawn out as it continues toward the predetermined plot, ultimately lacking a satisfying payoff. There are significant deviations from reality for the sake of convenience; for instance, a clueless new girlfriend is chosen to demonstrate self-defense techniques instead of a qualified individual. Additionally, the portrayal of a non-medical girlfriend managing a post-surgery patient is unrealistic, especially considering the character’s background as a firefighter who likely has insurance for proper care. Lastly, an illogical decision is made when a character leaves a house unlocked with a love interest alone inside, compromising safety.",
            "The romance is skillfully balanced with the influences of friends, family, and work. The characters possess distinct and well-developed personalities, featuring mild surprises and moderate tensions. While the romantic outcome is predictable, it comes across as less polished than other parts of the narrative. The characters engage in intriguing conversations that raise significant points, yet many remain unresolved or unexplored. The proposal scene feels overly cutesy and inconsistent with the characters' development throughout the story. Additionally, the introduction of the topic of children serves as a potential turning point but is ultimately abandoned without meaningful follow-up.",
            "The story relies on tired clichés, such as featuring a redheaded protagonist, which feels overdone in romance novels. Additionally, the cover art misrepresents a scene—specifically, her head hitting his shoulder—an inconsistency that, while minor, is still noticeable.",

            "Eva and Sean embody #couplegoals as their initial attraction evolves into a genuine friendship, even amidst their fake dating. Their flirty banter is delightful, featuring memorable lines like, \"I made an English teacher stop thinking about books. I consider that a major accomplishment,\" and \"I can let myself in and out of vehicles, you know.\" To which Sean replies, \"I know. But I like taking care of you.\" A poignant moment occurs when Sean realizes how small and flat Eva's voice sounds, a change he deeply dislikes.

Refreshingly, the story avoids the surprise pregnancy trope, instead highlighting the importance of respecting boundaries and showcasing a couple's happiness with a dog and no children.",

Sean, the firefighter, is a great character—it's refreshing that he enjoys reading romance—but like Eva, he also lacks sufficient backstory and development. Unfortunately, the side characters fail to stand out and leave a lasting impression.",

            "While I appreciate the contribution of Sean's family subplot to the overarching theme of parenthood, I found it somewhat contrived. The brief introduction of his parents left their role feeling underdeveloped. Sean's personal journey and feelings about having children could have been compelling on their own, without the need for parental involvement. Although this aspect didn't significantly detract from the book, it did weaken that part of the story for me.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed Eva and Sean's story. It was sweet, sexy, and met many of my expectations for the fake dating trope. What impressed me most was Sean's protective nature towards Eva, balanced by his encouragement for her to stand up for herself. This dynamic added a unique depth to their relationship.",
            "I appreciated how the story addressed Eva's age and her feelings about motherhood. It felt authentic, particularly Sean's initial impulse to propose solutions before understanding that Eva's feelings were valid and didn’t require fixing. This mature approach to such a sensitive topic was refreshing."

It was sweet and sexy, and it checked off a lot of my expectations for the fake dating trope. What stood out to me was how Sean was protective of Eva but also empowered her to defend herself rather than relying solely on him. This added a unique layer to their relationship.  \n\n- **Themes and Realism:**  \n  I appreciated the way the story handled Eva's age and her feelings about having children. It felt very realistic, especially Sean's initial reaction of proposing \"fixes\" before realizing that Eva's feelings were valid and didn't need to be \"fixed.\" This maturity in handling such a sensitive topic was refreshing.  \n\n- **Plot and Subplots:**  \n  While I recognize the benefit of Sean's family subplot in adding to the overall story, particularly the theme of having/not having children, I felt it was a bit contrived. The introduction of his parents was so brief that their role felt underdeveloped. I think Sean's personal journey and feelings about having kids could have stood alone without the involvement of his parents. This didn't detract significantly from the book, but it weakened this particular part of the story for me.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would definitely recommend this book to fans of contemporary romance, especially if you enjoy the fake dating trope.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Fake Flame* was an enjoyable read with a unique take on the fake dating trope.

She not only met every single one of them but also blew me out of the water.  \n\n- **Opening and Humor:**  \n  The beginning of this book had me cracking up and pumping my fist as Eva threatens to set a piano on fire at the college quad. Her cheating ex attempts to woo her back in a big, showy gesture no woman actually appreciates, and Eva’s reaction is both hilarious and empowering.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Romance:**  \n  Sean, part of the fire department team dispatched to handle the situation, experiences instant attraction to Eva. He finds himself seeking ways to be around her, including a plan straight out of a romance novel to convince Eva’s ex that she’s moved on. The couple embodies the “opposites attract” trope with a side of age gap, as Eva is older than Sean.  \n\n- **Tropes and Plot Devices:**  \n  The book hits all my favorite tropes in one go, including fake dating. Their constant “this is fake, this is fake, this is fake” self-reminders, even as they fall for each other, amused me and had me screaming at them to just freaking talk about it already.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  *Fake Flame* will have you laughing out loud and maybe (if you’re a giant sap like me) crying. The emotional depth and humor are perfectly balanced, making it a memorable read.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Work:**  \n  I am already chomping at the bit to get my hands on Adele’s next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAdele Buck’s *Fake Flame* is a delightful, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy that delivers on all fronts—humor, heart, and irresistible tropes.

            "The escalating abuse from Eva’s ex-boyfriend adds tension to the story, though it often feels more like a plot device than a genuine threat. While the conflicts are unsettling, they are resolved too quickly and easily, diminishing the overall sense of danger. On a positive note, the portrayal of law enforcement as supportive of domestic violence victims is commendable. The story opens with a dramatic and humorous encounter between firefighter Sean and Professor Eva, sparked by Sean being called to a campus fire. The fire turns out to be Eva threatening to burn a piano with an improvised flamethrower in response to her cheating ex-boyfriend publicly playing their song to pressure her into reconciliation. This incident effectively sets the stage for their connection and the ensuing fake dating trope.",

This immediately grabs attention and sets the tone for the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The relationship between the main characters develops predictably, with the requisite miscommunications about their status and feelings toward procreation. While the dynamics are engaging, the exploration of their emotional growth feels surface-level.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel touches on themes of family expectations and classicism, but these are handled with a heavy hand and lack depth. For instance, the main character's tendency to \"coast\" through life is highlighted, but the story never delves into how he navigates this with his family. Similarly, the FMC's decision to go no-contact with her abusive family is mentioned, but the emotional complexities and repercussions of this choice are not fully explored.  \n\n- **Subplots and Resolution:**  \n  The subplot involving the FMC's ex-boyfriend resolves too conveniently, with everyone receiving their comeuppance in a way that feels unrealistic. This lack of depth in addressing the lingering effects of past abuse and family dynamics leaves the resolution feeling unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its shortcomings, the novel is a serviceable contemporary \"beach read.\" It’s engaging enough to make me interested in reading the next installment in the series, though it doesn’t stand out as particularly groundbreaking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers an entertaining and quirky premise with a memorable opening scene, but it falls short in exploring its themes and character development with the depth they deserve. While it’s a decent light read, it leaves room for more nuanced storytelling in future installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

It was refreshing to read about more mature characters, as we often see much younger characters who can come across as immature or childish.  \n\n- **Romantic and Emotional Dynamics:**  \n  The characters had great chemistry from the start, and it only became more obvious as they developed a fake dating relationship. The book is steamy, but it also includes great banter and laugh-out-loud moments, which added to the enjoyment.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution:**  \n  I do wish there was more resolution with the stalker ex. While the book deals with heavy topics like stalking and an abusive ex, I felt the storyline involving the ex didn’t fully conclude, which left me wanting more closure.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  I personally wish the book wasn’t written in third person and instead had a dual POV. This is just a preference, but I think it could have added more depth to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics:**  \n  The author handled the heavy topics of stalking and an abusive ex really well. It added depth to the story without overshadowing the lighter, more enjoyable moments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun, cute, and engaging book with mature characters, great chemistry, and a mix of steamy and humorous moments. While I had some minor critiques about the narrative style and plot resolution, it was still a great read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It used dual POV but not in first person, which led to excessive use of “he said” and “she said.”  \n   - The internalized thoughts and feelings of the characters didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel wasn’t a bad read, it fell short in several areas, including the ending and writing style. The rushed conclusion and lack of emotional connection with the characters left me feeling unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned."

While this technique added depth to the characters, I found it a bit dizzying and occasionally disruptive to the flow of the story.  \n\n- **Repetition:**  \n  The main characters repeatedly had to explain their fake dating arrangement to their friends. This felt excessive and somewhat redundant, detracting from the overall pacing and enjoyment of the novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was a pleasant read with an entertaining premise. However, the frequent POV switches and repetitive explanations of the fake dating scenario slightly hindered my enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Eva, in my opinion, would have called him out on this.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  - The dual POV was a bit disorienting. While I typically enjoy dual POVs, the frequent shifts within chapters disrupted the flow. It would have worked better if the perspectives were separated by chapters.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - This was a better romance novel compared to others I’ve read this year, but it didn’t fully resonate with me, possibly because I’m not a fan of overly twee romance stories.  \n  - Despite its flaws, it was a short and sweet read, and I’d recommend it to fans of contemporary romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had several strong points, such as its exploration of mature themes and refreshing character dynamics, certain elements like the inconsistent portrayal of Sean and the disjointed dual POV structure detracted from my overall enjoyment.

            "This book offers a charming and swift read with a delightful rom-com vibe. However, the fake dating trope felt underutilized, which was somewhat disappointing. While the toxic ex storyline was intriguing, it could have benefited from further development.",
            "The meeting between Eva and Sean was delightful, and their romance was charming. However, the six-year age gap between the 35-year-old and 41-year-old felt overstated and unnecessary. Additionally, the relationship had an insta-love quality that may not resonate with all readers.",
