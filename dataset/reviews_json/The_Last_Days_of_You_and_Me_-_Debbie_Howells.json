        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel revolves around four individuals struggling in their lives and finding their way to each other by fate. It beautifully explores the comparison and impact they have on each other's lives, making it relatable to readers, as I’m sure everyone can connect with at least one of the characters.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book was incredibly soothing yet emotionally powerful. It perfectly portrayed my emotions, and I rarely cry while reading, but I teared up at the end. It’s both relaxing and heartbreaking, which is a rare and compelling combination.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story slowed down in the middle due to the repetitive routines of the characters, with nothing particularly new happening except for Forrest’s flashbacks. While I enjoyed his chapters and felt immersed, I anticipated a plot twist that never came, leaving me with a broken heart instead.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  If I had a physical copy, I could have finished it in no more than two days. It was that engaging and captivating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Last Days of You and Me* is a beautifully written, emotionally resonant novel that balances relaxation and heartbreak. While the pacing slows in the middle, the relatable characters and their interconnected journeys make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

However, I was hesitant because I wasn’t a fan of Debbie Howell’s first book, *It All Started With You* (originally published as *Wildflowers*). While this one was much better than her previous work, it still fell a little flat for me.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  - The story revolves around four strangers—Marnie, Forrest, Rae, and Jack—whose lives unexpectedly intersect. Marnie is a loner managing her friend’s hotel, Forrest is a lawyer dealing with a client’s mess, Rae is a bookstore owner afraid to live outside of work, and Jack is a hospice nurse raising goats. Their lives crisscross, and they help each other learn to live, love, and trust.  \n  - One of my favorite aspects of *Love, Actually* is how the characters’ lives intersect, and I greatly enjoyed that element in this book. Each character has their own chapter, and I loved how each chapter generally started where the previous one ended.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  - I found this to be a very quick read, finishing it in less than 24 hours.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - While I was drawn to the story, I didn’t find it mesmerizing. The characters didn’t jump off the page, and I felt there was something missing, though I can’t quite pinpoint what it was.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  - Thank you to NetGalley and Boldwood Books for providing an advanced copy of this book. *The Last Days of You and Me* hits the shelves on January 29th.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was an improvement over the author’s previous work, and I appreciated the interconnected lives of the characters, reminiscent of *Love, Actually*.

I liked the characters, though I wasn’t overly attached to them. It was the story itself that truly pulled me in.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story is heartbreaking and thought-provoking, exploring themes of grief, death, and the unpredictability of life. It made me reflect on how certain events or people can completely shift our perspectives on what truly matters. Despite the heavy themes, it is also a heartwarming tale about the power of love and friendship.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story is told from alternating perspectives, which provides great insight into how different characters are affected by the same events, both directly and through their loved ones.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  While the novel deals with heavy topics, it ultimately leaves a warm and uplifting impression. It’s a wonderful story, though not a light or easy read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply moving exploration of life, loss, and the enduring power of love and friendship. While it took some time to fully engage with the characters, the story’s emotional depth and thought-provoking themes made it a compelling and memorable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
