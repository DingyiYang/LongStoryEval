This could have been presented more thoughtfully, focusing solely on the act itself to convey the intended emotional impact without the grossness. Additionally, the choice of a conference room as a setting feels inappropriate and unromantic, especially given the hero's obsession with the heroine.",

He claims to only want the heroine but engages in questionable behavior, such as dating other women under false pretenses.  \n   - The heroine’s lack of jealousy and immediate arousal in degrading situations undermines her character and makes the relationship feel unhealthy and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Writing and Authorial Choices:**  \n   - The author’s decision to include graphic and distasteful scenes detracts from the story’s potential.

Damon's obsession with Misty drives the narrative, which is rich with power struggles and threats from those seeking his position. The story is dark and twisty, filled with unexpected elements that I thoroughly enjoyed, signaling a bold new direction for the author's writing. While familiar characters make appearances, the book can easily be enjoyed as a standalone, with only minor spoilers from related works.",

Despite her reservations, she agrees to a marriage of convenience. Their chemistry is palpable, underscored by memorable quotes like Damon’s, “Fuck, I love it when you’re all stabby. Feel free to try,” and Misty’s witty remark, “Every ounce of feminism evaporates from my mind. I’ll be a feminist tomorrow.”",

Damon goes to extreme lengths to possess Misty, such as installing a camera in her home and manipulating her visa status. Although Misty initially questions his intentions, she ultimately embraces both his dark side and his ties to a secret society.

The inclusion of brothers and past couples enriches the narrative, with their friendships and dynamics standing out as a highlight. The spice level is high and skillfully executed, featuring elements such as praise kink, somnophilia, and cockwarming.

The MMC’s supposed love for the FMC didn’t feel convincing or well-developed.  \n\n- **Character Building:**  \n  The MMC is described as a “broken man” and a feared lord of an underworld secret society, but his character lacked depth and believability. The attempts to portray him as villainous and alpha fell flat, as he and his brothers came across as more sweet than intimidating. The sporadic reminders of their supposed villainy felt forced and unconvincing.  \n\n- **World-Building and Plot:**  \n  The concept of the underworld secret society and the MMC’s backstory (“We’d been raised for this…”) had potential, but it wasn’t fully explored or executed effectively. The plot felt underdeveloped, and the stakes didn’t feel compelling enough to engage me fully.  \n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  While the book was entertaining enough to finish, it didn’t leave a lasting impression. The lack of believable character dynamics and underdeveloped plot made it difficult to feel invested in the story or the series as a whole.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had an intriguing premise but fell short in execution. The romantic relationship felt forced and cringeworthy, the character building lacked depth, and the attempts to portray the MMC as a feared villain were unconvincing. While I finished the book, I don’t feel compelled to continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Misty stands out as a fiery character, and her unique trait of making her own clothes adds depth to her personality. Damon is nothing short of perfect; his vibrant energy is something I wish I had in my life. He is instantly captivated by Misty, proclaiming her his future wife, and embodies everything she needs, even when she struggles to accept it. His inner monologue about her is truly touching—I long for someone to feel about me the way he feels about Misty.",

I can't wait for them to get their own books.  \n  - Misty is a fiery character, and I enjoyed how she made her own clothes, which was a cool and unique trait.  \n  - Damon is portrayed as perfect in my eyes. His energy is something I want in my life. He was immediately drawn to Misty, declaring her his future wife, and he was everything she needed, even when she didn’t want him. His inner monologue about her was perfect, and I need someone to think about me the way he did about Misty.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamic:**  \n  - Damon’s devotion to Misty was adorable. He was so into everything she did, including dyeing her hair, which was the sweetest thing ever.  \n  - Their relationship dynamic is summed up well by the quote: “You know, you’re basically a walking red flag.” He smirks. “You love that about me.” Fuck it. “I really do.” This explains their dynamic and every other dark romance relationship.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  - While the book has elements of dark romance, such as stalking, I wouldn’t classify it as a full dark romance. It might just be that I’ve read too many dark romances, so my perspective is skewed.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I went into this book with zero expectations, only knowing a quote from TikTok, but it turned out to be such a good, unexpected ride.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful surprise, with likable characters, a fiery protagonist, and a romantic dynamic that was both sweet and intense.

            "The story evokes high school musical vibes, with Misty often fleeing from Damon for various reasons. The frequent introduction of side characters and their complex relationships can be overwhelming, as many come with intricate backstories that are difficult to remember. Additionally, the plot bears too many similarities to *Haunting Adeline* by H.D. Carlton, resulting in a narrative that feels like a less compelling retelling of that story.",
            "I found Misty to be quite immature, which made it difficult to connect with her. Her irresponsible behavior, particularly in stringing along two guys while clearly wanting Damon, was frustrating. Although Damon is portrayed as unhinged, he didn't seem as extreme as the other characters suggested. Additionally, the way Damon’s brothers referred to Misty as their sister felt cringeworthy and awkward.",

As someone who dislikes reverse harem tropes, I found the constant focus on side characters dating each other particularly frustrating. I don't intend to read more in this series if it continues in the same vein."

            "I initially struggled to engage with the book, as it felt like the story had begun prior to the first chapter, almost like a continuation from previous installments I hadn’t read. Characters were introduced abruptly, leaving me feeling as though I should already know them, which hindered my connection to the story's world. Although the book is a standalone, I believe the introduction to the setting and characters could have been more effective. Damon is a morally grey hero and undeniably a walking red flag, which I found intriguing and well-executed. Misty’s willingness to engage with Damon reflects her character, and their dynamic felt authentic. The sizzling banter, push-and-pull tension, and chemistry between Damon and Misty drew me in, and once I delved deeper into their story, I couldn’t put the book down.",

            "The secret society subplot was intriguing and kept me engaged enough to finish the book, but it felt underdeveloped and only appeared sporadically, leaving me wanting more focus on this element. The marriage of convenience trope offered a compelling starting point; however, the story lost momentum afterward, shifting excessively toward intimate scenes instead of advancing the plot. The pacing felt uneven, as repetitive intimate moments post-marriage detracted from the overall narrative. Additionally, the execution of tropes such as the obsessed MMC, one-bed scenario, stalker, and workplace romance felt over-the-top and unbalanced.",
            "Damon, the male protagonist, is portrayed as overly obsessive and stalkerish, which detracts from the story. His actions—installing cameras in Misty's home, assigning her a driver, altering her job, and involving his brothers in her surveillance—feel excessive, even for a dark mafia romance. Meanwhile, Misty, the female protagonist, lacks assertiveness. Although she establishes rules before marriage, she quickly compromises them, and her perception of Damon's intrusive behavior as endearing or charming is frustrating.",
            "I picked up the book for its marriage of convenience trope and an obsessed male lead, but unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. While there were some redeeming elements, overall, it was just okay, and I probably wouldn't read it again."

I have a lot of questions about it, which left me curious for more.\n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**\n  - The book was hilarious in the best way possible, and I thoroughly enjoyed the humor throughout.\n\n- **Series Potential:**\n  - This is Book 1 of the Twisted Vows series, and it was my first Jesse book.

The secret society trope adds an intriguing and unsettling element that I hope will be explored further in future installments. At 530 pages, the book is lengthy, allowing for rich interactions between Damon and Misty that lend authenticity to their relationship. However, it occasionally feels about 100 pages too long, as the narrative tends to drag at certain points.",

His intense feelings evolve into a dark yet authentic love, making him a compelling figure to root for. Misty stands out as my favorite character, embodying sarcasm and strength while grappling with her traumatic past. Her resilience and complexity add depth to the narrative. The Everette brothers are also intriguing, with their mysterious personas and tight-knit bond enriching the story's layers.",

            "This fast-paced novel plunges readers into Damon’s world and his obsession with Misty. It skillfully weaves together multiple tropes—marriage of convenience, secret society, and billionaire intrigue—resulting in an exhilarating read.",
            "Damon's obsession with Misty is both unsettling and captivating. As a billionaire and Lord of a Secret Society, he uses his privilege to manipulate circumstances in his favor, revealing a possessive and protective side drawn to Misty’s unconventional traits, such as her vibrant hair. His relentless pursuit of her, despite her initial resistance, adds depth to his character. Misty begins as a bratty individual in denial, but her behavior stems from trauma and a deep sense of unworthiness. As the story progresses, she transforms into a strong, resilient, and sassy woman who confronts her demons and begins to lower her defenses.\n\nDamon's brothers are well-developed characters who enrich the narrative. They take Misty under their wing and serve as a balanced voice of reason for Damon, hinting at potential storylines for each of them that I look forward to exploring in future books. The romance evolves from an enemies-to-lovers dynamic, with Misty's insecurities initially fueling her resistance to Damon’s advances. Their complicated emotions create palpable tension, but ultimately, they discover a mutual attraction that leads to a loyal and supportive relationship.\n\nThe story addresses Damon’s use of escorts and Misty’s flirtations with other men as tactics to provoke jealousy.

I thoroughly enjoyed this decadently dark and vivid romance.  \n\n- **Characterization (Damon):**  \n   - Damon is vicious and charming—a perfect juxtaposition. I loved him from the moment we meet him. He’s intense, knows exactly what he wants, and does everything in his power to achieve it.  \n   - Damon has a symbiotic duality: he’s violent and ruthless, yet deeply caring and loving toward Misty. If you get in his way, he won’t hesitate to cut you down, but he’s also protective and devoted to her.  \n   - His obsession with Misty is swoon-worthy, especially the way he constantly refers to her as “wife.”  \n\n- **Characterization (Misty):**  \n   - Misty is a strong female main character (FMC) with a heartbreaking backstory. Her resilience in pulling herself up and refusing to settle for her family’s expectations is inspiring.  \n   - She has moments of self-doubt, feeling out of place with Damon due to his wealth, but Damon reassures her every step of the way.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n   - The relationship between Damon and Misty is intense and captivating. Damon’s unwavering determination to make Misty his and his ability to balance his ruthless nature with deep love for her is heart-fluttering.  \n   - The way Damon puts his mother in her place to protect Misty adds another layer to his character and their relationship.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - From the moment I opened the book, I was engrossed. J. Wilder starts with a bang and maintains the momentum until the end.  \n\n- **Areas for Improvement:**  \n   - I wish there was more closure regarding Misty’s parents and her past. While it was mentioned, it felt unresolved. I would have liked to see Misty confront them and leave that part of her life behind.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n   - I’m excited for Damon’s brothers to get their own books. Each brother is diverse, with their own traumas and secrets. I can’t wait to see them fall for their respective FMCs, especially after giving Damon so much grief about his obsession.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a captivating and darkly romantic read with well-developed characters and intense dynamics. While I wished for more closure regarding Misty’s past, the story kept me hooked from start to finish. I’m eagerly looking forward to the next books in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Misty, haunted by a dark past of fleeing a family that ignored her sexual assault, becomes a pawn in Damon’s marriage arrangement.

It can be read as a stand-alone novel but features characters from her *Rule Breakers* series, providing a nice tie-in for readers familiar with those books.\n\n- **Trigger Warnings and Genre:**\n   - The author includes a precise and detailed trigger warning page, which I appreciated as it clearly outlines what to expect. The book is a dark romance, though it leans more toward the 'lite' side of the genre, but the trigger warnings are still necessary.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The story revolves around the Everett brothers and their journey to secure their inheritance and maintain their positions as heads of a secret society called the Saints. This book focuses on the eldest brother, Damon, who must marry to fulfill the requirements for his inheritance and status.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - Damon is a billionaire by day and the head of the Saints by night. He is portrayed as a walking red flag, with an intense obsession for Misty, a PR representative in his firm. Despite his flaws, his love for Misty and their found family dynamic add depth to his character.\n   - Misty has a dark past, having fled from a family that ignored her sexual assault and sided with the perpetrator. Her past provides the leverage Damon uses to force her into a marriage arrangement. Both characters share a darkness that connects them, but they also bring out the light in each other.\n   - The supporting characters are well-written, and I’m excited to read more about the other Everett brothers and their interactions with their sisters.\n\n- **Writing and Themes:**\n   - The author’s writing is engaging, and the themes of darkness, love, and found family are compelling.

            "The story begins abruptly in the middle, with Damon already obsessed with Misty, leaving little context for their relationship. The pacing is slow, making it hard to stay engaged, and I ultimately DNF'd at 70% due to waning interest. The narrative felt unnecessarily long, with several scenes that could have been trimmed to create a tighter plot. The conflict with Misty's ex was introduced but resolved too quickly, rendering it forgettable. I also anticipated a more significant role for her family, but they were largely absent. The story seemed to have multiple potential endings, which contributed to its dragging pace. Additionally, a subplot appeared to belong to another book by the same author, creating confusion and failing to enhance the main narrative.",
            "Damon's obsession with Misty comes across as excessive and lacking explanation; a strong attraction would have been more believable. The author's attempt to portray Damon as a dark and dangerous figure due to his family name, Everett, feels forced and unconvincing. While Misty's backstory, including her sexual assault and family betrayal, is compelling, it deserves a deeper exploration."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While *A Tempting Arrangement* had some redeeming qualities, such as Damon's tender moments with Misty and the potential for a deeper exploration of Misty's past, the slow pacing, unexplained character motivations, and lack of intensity in the romance made it a disappointing read for me. I would recommend it with caution, but I suggest reading other reviews before diving in.",

            "The central conflict revolves around her being coerced into marriage due to his manipulation of her visa. It feels excessive that, as a wealthy billionaire CEO, he wouldn’t simply ask her out like a normal person. There's a kidnapping scene that momentarily makes it seem like she might die, but of course, main characters rarely meet such fates. His profound sadness and desire to die alongside her struck me as surprisingly romantic.",
            "The main character is unsettling, and the female lead seems to embrace his stalker-like behavior and toxic traits. I appreciate toxic relationships when portrayed thoughtfully, and this one nearly hits the mark. While he is fiercely loyal and in love, his extreme actions—like stalking and installing security cameras—push the boundaries for me. The central conflict revolves around her being pressured into marriage, but he counteracts this by seeking revenge on her rapist, adding complexity to their dynamic.",
            "This book is an adventurous romp filled with explicit content. If you're picking it up, it's primarily for the smut rather than any deeper narrative. While there are some enjoyable fluffy moments, I found it puzzling that the protagonist is so trusting of a man who coerced her into marriage by threatening her visa. Despite this, I still found it engaging—I've certainly read worse.",
            "I was surprised to find that this book is a dark romance, as I had previously read another of the author's works, a college romance. I initially expected a lighthearted billionaire story, but I was mistaken. This book is wild and not for those seeking depth; it's meant for readers looking for an entertaining escape."

I thought this would be a cutesy billionaire romance, but I was wrong.  \n   - This book is insane and not for people who want substance but for those who want a good time.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - The main guy is too freaky, and the main girl matches him because she’s into having a stalker and a toxic boyfriend.  \n   - I enjoy toxic relationships when they’re done tastefully, and this one was almost there. He’s insane but loyal and in love with the main girl.  \n   - He’s toxic in a good way but a little too extreme for my taste with the stalking and security cameras.  \n   - The conflict was mainly her being coerced into marriage, but he balanced it out by getting revenge for her with her rapist.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n   - The main conflict was her being coerced into marriage by him messing with her visa. I found it extreme that he didn’t just ask her out like a normal person, given he’s a rich billionaire CEO.  \n   - There’s a kidnapping scene where I genuinely thought she died for a moment, but of course, main characters never die. He got super sad and wanted to die too, which was oddly romantic.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Content:**  \n   - The book is an adventure with a lot of smut. You’re only reading this for the smut, not for anything else.  \n   - There were some good fluff scenes, but I was confused why she’s so trusting of a man who coerced her into marriage by threatening her visa. Still, I’m into it because I’ve read worse.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a wild ride, perfect for readers who enjoy dark romance and don’t mind extreme, toxic relationships.

            "The story skillfully weaves together familiar tropes such as marriage of convenience, billionaire romance, workplace dynamics, one bed, light stalking, possessive declarations of “my wife,” intense obsession, a secret society, and elements of hurt/comfort. Each trope is executed in a way that keeps me thoroughly engaged and invested in the narrative.",
            "Damon is delightfully unhinged and morally ambiguous, traits I find incredibly appealing. He is obsessive, rude, and arrogant, fully aware that he deserves to be disliked. Yet, beneath his tough exterior lies a softer side reserved exclusively for Misty. His questionable methods for winning and keeping her may raise eyebrows, but by the end of the book, you'll be utterly enamored with him. \n\nMisty has faced numerous challenges in her life, yet she remains upbeat, radiant, and irresistibly lovable. She brings light to Damon’s darker nature, making them a perfect match. Their chemistry is electric, and the contrast of their grumpy/sunshine dynamic works beautifully.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development (Hero and Heroine):**  \n   - The hero (H) had a lot of red flags, but I liked his over-the-top (OTT) personality and how he took care of the heroine (h).  \n   - The heroine (h) was extremely annoying. Her constant self-doubt, running away, and repetitive internal monologue (\"It can't be! It just can't be!\") became tiresome.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The first chapter was jarring and didn’t set the right mood. The hero receiving a blow job from an escort while the heroine walked in felt unnecessary and off-putting.  \n   - The blackmail plot (hero forcing the heroine into marriage due to her expiring Canadian work visa) was intriguing and added some tension.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n   - The excessive use of repetitive phrases like \"my core is heating up\" and \"rivers of wetness and heat\" became overwhelming and detracted from the story.  \n   - The writing felt overly dramatic and lacked subtlety, which made certain scenes feel ridiculous rather than engaging.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n   - The hero’s possessiveness and the chase dynamic (heroine constantly running away, hero pursuing her) grew repetitive and frustrating.  \n   - The inclusion of the heroine’s ex-boyfriend (who cuts her back with a butterfly) felt unnecessary and didn’t add much to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite its flaws, I finished the book, which suggests some level of engagement.  \n   - The book was disappointing compared to recommendations from Facebook book groups, which occasionally offer rare gems.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the hero’s over-the-top personality and the blackmail plot had potential, the heroine’s annoying behavior, repetitive writing, and poorly executed first chapter made the book frustrating to read. The story had moments of intrigue but was ultimately overshadowed by its flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (based on the review)."

The brother dynamics were well-executed and healing, illustrating how complex blood ties can be.

The narrative delves into Misty’s painful past, including her struggles with her ex and the loss of her baby, with Damon playing a crucial role in her healing journey. However, I would have appreciated more depth regarding Misty’s background and additional flashbacks of her former life to enrich the story.

Haunted by a traumatic past involving a brutal assault by her ex-boyfriend, Misty has fled Canada, making her vulnerable yet resilient. \n\nDamon manipulates her into marriage under the guise of needing her to claim his grandfather's empire.

In a twisted turn of events, Damon aids Misty in her quest for revenge by orchestrating her ex-boyfriend's murder, with the help of his brothers. \n\nThis act of vengeance unleashes a violent response from Damon’s family, who abduct Misty and put their lives at risk, only for Damon and his brothers to rescue her. The narrative hints at future turmoil, possibly with a new couple at the forefront, while leaving some threads unresolved—particularly Misty’s strained relationship with her parents. \n\nThe story builds anticipation for the next book, balancing fast-paced action with dramatic twists and well-integrated spicy scenes.

He assigns her a daily chauffeur, stands up to his toxic mother on her behalf, dyes his hair for her, and even gives her his black card.

Misty, despite her traumatic past, is a strong and independent woman. Her unique name and vibrant personality, highlighted by her love for colorful clothing, make her unforgettable.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Impressions and Hesitations:**  \n  Before reading the book, I came across Goodreads reviews where many readers mentioned that the MMC (male main character) was with an escort in the first chapter, receiving a BJ, which led them to DNF (did not finish) the book. I found this detail a bit off-putting but decided to give the book a chance anyway. I’m glad I didn’t let one scene deter me from reading the entire story.  \n\n- **Character Development (MMC - Damon):**  \n  Damon, the MMC, is a hot billionaire who becomes obsessed with the FMC (female main character). His actions, though intense, are captivating. He stalks her, signs a fake marriage contract with her, and is deeply in love with her. His obsession is both thrilling and endearing, and I found myself eagerly reading to get to his POV (point of view).  \n\n- **Character Development (FMC - Misty):**  \n  Misty, the FMC, has a traumatic past but is portrayed as a strong and independent woman. Her unique name and vibrant personality, reflected in her love for colorful clothing, make her a memorable character. She looks stunning in her vibrant outfits, and her resilience adds depth to her character.  \n\n- **Chemistry Between Characters:**  \n  The chemistry between Damon and Misty is electric. Damon’s obsession with Misty is intense, and their dynamic kept me hooked. I particularly enjoyed how Damon’s actions showcased his love and devotion to Misty.  \n\n- **Plot and Romantic Gestures:**  \n  Damon’s gestures toward Misty are grand and thoughtful, which I found incredibly romantic. Some of these include:  \n  - Assigning her a chauffeur to pick her up daily.  \n  - Standing up for her against his toxic mother.  \n  - Dyeing her hair for her.  \n  - Giving her his black card.  \n  - Buying her entire apartment building so they could live there alone.  \n  - Getting jealous when his brothers are near her.  \n  These actions highlight his green flags, outweighing the initial red flag from the first chapter.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the initial hesitation due to the controversial scene in the first chapter, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Damon and Misty’s chemistry, combined with Damon’s grand romantic gestures and Misty’s strength, made for a compelling read. The story is intense, romantic, and full of memorable moments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

He exists in a morally gray area, fiercely adores the female main character (FMC), and skillfully manipulates her into marriage. His dedication is unwavering; he confronts all of the FMC's demons, knowing that her pain would destroy him. He exemplifies a boy obsessed—buying an airline so she could remain close to him and dying her hair the color she's always desired. Misty, the FMC, is equally compelling. I was pleasantly surprised by her own turn toward moral complexity, showcasing her strength. Damon’s brothers also shine as the perfect brothers-in-law any girl could wish for.",

These elements are appealing but didn’t fully deliver for me.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Damon checks most of the red flags dark romance readers look for, and Misty is fiery, putting him in his place while also surrendering when she feels safe. However, their dynamic felt incomplete.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The book felt rushed and missing something. The plot and storyline had potential to be \"chef’s kiss,\" but they fell short for me.  \n\n- **Cameos and World-Building:**  \n  I loved seeing favorite characters from Jessa’s other books and appreciated the glimpses of Damon’s brothers. I hope they get their own books, as I’d love to know them better and see more interactions between them.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the book is good, it didn’t have that special something I needed to fall in love with it.

The FMC (Female Main Character) walks in, gasps, and freezes, but the MMC stops the escort and uses his hand to finish while staring at the FMC. He then wipes his hand on her lips, making it clear he desires her. While this scene might not be for everyone, it sets the tone for the MMC's intense attraction to the FMC.  \n\n- **Jealousy/Cheating Concerns:**  \n  Despite the initial scene, there’s no jealousy or cheating to worry about. The FMC isn’t upset or jealous; she understands the MMC’s actions as a clear sign of his desire for her.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The book features a possessive MMC, stalking billionaire vibes, and a forced marriage trope. These elements were executed well and added to the overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The MMC is deeply possessive but also incredibly soft and devoted to the FMC. Their relationship development was compelling and heartwarming, leaving me smiling by the end.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite initial hesitations due to others’ opinions about the opening, I found the book to be incredibly engaging and well-written. It exceeded my expectations, and I’m eagerly looking forward to Matthias’s book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a bold, intense, and captivating read with a possessive yet tender MMC and a strong FMC.

While these elements are present, they didn’t resonate strongly with me.  \n\n- **Plot and Scenes:**  \n  Certain scenes left a negative impression, such as the first chapter where the male protagonist visits the female protagonist’s house and engages in explicit behavior in front of someone else. Additionally, the revelation about the cameras at the end of the book felt poorly executed and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I appreciated the male protagonist’s protective nature and his willingness to let the female protagonist be her true self. The shared darkness between the two characters and their mutual understanding were compelling. The affection between the male protagonist and his brothers, as well as the brothers’ acceptance of the female protagonist, were highlights for me.  \n\n- **Favorite Characters and Moments:**  \n  My favorite characters were undoubtedly the brothers. One of my favorite moments was when Bash brought the food Misty wanted in the early hours of the morning—it felt like a small but meaningful gesture.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some positive elements, this book was one of my least favorites lately.

            "While the story has its merits, certain plot points come across as unrealistic or inconsistent. For instance, it seems implausible that other hockey players would be willing to date the female main character (FMC) after the balcony incident, especially considering how quickly such news would circulate. Additionally, the FMC's rapid career progression—becoming the PR person for the Boston Bruins by age 25 while attempting to stay incognito—stretches credibility.",
            "The male main character (MMC) is a striking mix of alarming red flags and a soft-hearted marshmallow. His actions, including stalking and installing cameras, introduce a dark tone to the narrative, yet there is no consensual non-consent (CNC) or coercion involved. His possessiveness and extreme behaviors—such as nearly throwing a player off a balcony and forcing him to witness intimate moments—are both shocking and at odds with his gentler side.",

            "Misty is a relatable and well-developed character. Her trauma and longing for love and validation make her motivations understandable. Her willingness to overlook the male lead's red flags, due to his efforts to win her over, adds depth to her personality. Conversely, the male lead's obsession and possessiveness are romanticized; actions like stalking, installing cameras, and creating a family tradition to marry her are framed as endearing rather than alarming. His fierce loyalty, demonstrated by defending Misty against disrespect from others, highlights his love for her.\n\nThe relationship between Misty and the male lead is intense and passionate. His jealousy and obsession are tempered by genuine affection, exemplified when he dyes her hair lavender in defiance of his mother's demands. This act symbolizes his acceptance of her true self, rather than trying to change her.\n\nThe male lead's brothers provide humor and support, enhancing the narrative with their camaraderie and constant defense of Misty, which fosters a sense of family unity.",

            "I found Damon’s immediate obsession with Misty to be a major flaw in the story. Their connection felt shallow, as we didn’t get to know the characters as individuals before they became infatuated with each other. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the stalker-ish and morally gray aspects of Damon more than I expected. However, he ultimately came across as too tame for a character meant to be dark and dangerous; he didn’t take many risks. As for Misty, I struggled to connect with her. She didn’t seem relatable, funny, or interesting, and much of her perspective revolved around Damon and her past, leaving little room for her current goals or interests. Overall, I just didn’t find her compelling.",

This was probably my biggest gripe in the book—I felt like their connection was shallow because you didn’t get to know or like the characters as individuals before they were already all over each other.  \n\n- **Character Likability and Relatability:**  \n  I didn’t love Misty as a character. I didn’t find her particularly relatable, funny, or interesting. Much of her POV is about Damon and her past, with not much focus on her current goals or interests. I just didn’t really care for her.  \n\n- **Moral Ambiguity and Character Depth:**  \n  I kinda liked the stalker-ish and morally gray vibes of Damon more than I thought I would! However, I thought Damon was pretty tame for a morally gray character. He was supposed to be all big and bad but didn’t actually do much.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, I thought it was a good read!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its flaws, particularly in character development and relatability, I found it enjoyable despite my usual genre preferences. Damon’s morally gray persona was intriguing, though underdeveloped, and Misty’s character fell flat for me. Still, it was a decent read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, this particular book didn’t work for me.  \n\n- **Use of Real Teams in Fiction:**  \n  One of my pet peeves in sports romance is when authors write about real teams instead of creating fictional ones. In this book, the male lead (H) is portrayed as the “owner of the Boston Bruins,” which felt off to me. As someone who has interned for the Bruins, I found it hard to reconcile the fictional portrayal with the reality of the organization.  \n\n- **Authenticity and Realism:**  \n  The opening scene, where the H receives a blowjob from an escort in the boardroom, was particularly jarring.

It felt disrespectful to the real people who hold those positions and work for the team.  \n\n- **Personal Discomfort:**  \n  The combination of using a real team and the unrealistic, over-the-top scenarios made it impossible for me to continue reading.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Trope Combination:**  \n  The book combines elements of enemies-to-lovers, Mafia fake marriage, and grumpy billionaire/personal assistant fake marriage tropes. While this combination was interesting and made for an engaging read, it felt a bit like a mashup rather than a seamless integration.  \n\n- **Character Chemistry and Relationship Development:**  \n  The chemistry between the characters and the development of their relationship didn’t feel entirely believable. While the premise was intriguing, the execution left me questioning whether the emotional connection and progression were convincing.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Themes (SA):**  \n  The main female character’s experience with SA was addressed, and the author made an effort to handle it sensitively. However, the portrayal didn’t feel entirely believable, particularly in terms of her recovery and emotional journey. The dialogue and overall treatment of this theme could have been more nuanced and impactful.  \n\n- **Writing and Dialogue:**  \n  The dialogue and writing style had room for improvement. Certain aspects of the story, including character interactions and emotional depth, felt underdeveloped or lacking in authenticity.  \n\n- **Author Potential:**  \n  Despite my reservations about this book, I’m open to trying other titles by this author. I believe there’s potential for growth and improvement in her future works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had an interesting premise with its unique combination of tropes, but it fell short in terms of character chemistry, relationship development, and the handling of sensitive themes. While the author showed effort in addressing complex issues, the execution lacked believability and depth. That said, I’m willing to give the author another chance with her future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

What makes him even more compelling is his possessive, protective nature—he’s the \"she's mine, claim her in every way, and no one hurts her or else\" kind of guy.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Misty):**  \n  Misty is a broken girl trying to find her strength, and Dam plays a crucial role in helping her discover it. Their dynamic is both intense and heartwarming.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The spice in this book is a solid level five, which adds to the intensity and appeal of the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Writing Quality:**  \n  The story is so well thought out and written that it’s hard to imagine anyone not enjoying it. The author, Jessa, has truly gifted readers with a great narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a perfect blend of spice, strong character dynamics, and a well-crafted plot. It’s an engaging and satisfying read from start to finish, and I highly recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific numerical rating was mentioned in the review, but the overall tone is highly positive.)"

There was minimal buildup to the romance between the female main character (FMC) and the male main character (MMC). Additionally, the bond between the FMC and the MMC's brothers felt underdeveloped, as there wasn't enough time to establish the depth of connection suggested by their interactions.",

It feels like a disjointed mix of ideas, resembling a \"Looney Toons cartoon with sex.\" The story appears to be a \"Green Pilled Patriarchal Parable of Toxicity,\" catering to those who thrive on creating their own conflicts and reveling in moral ambiguity.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The characters, particularly the male protagonist, lack emotional accountability. The ending, which quotes, \"Whatever I did, Whatever I said, I Didn't Mean It, I Just Want You Back For Good,\" reinforces this lack of growth or responsibility. It seems to cater to an audience that prioritizes being \"seen\" over meaningful emotional connections.  \n\n- **Tone and Content:**  \n  The tone of the novel comes across as overly sensational and gratuitous, bordering on \"pornography for the Unseen, Unloved, and utterly Unfucked.\" The content feels exploitative and lacks substance, focusing more on shock value than storytelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel fails to deliver a coherent theme or meaningful character development. Instead, it leans heavily into sensationalism and moral ambiguity, leaving the reader questioning its purpose and value. The lack of emotional accountability and the gratuitous tone make it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the story, but I believe it could have benefited from more twists and unexpected elements to enhance the suspense and keep me guessing. The novel features familiar tropes, including billionaire romance, secret societies, workplace dynamics, dark romance, the grumpy-sunshine dynamic, and marriage of convenience. The protagonist, a PR professional, is unexpectedly assigned as the personal PR manager for her boss’s superior. This change is not just a career move; her boss is determined to marry her immediately, driven by his inability to stay away from her. Complicating matters further, his grandfather has mandated that he must marry to inherit his fortune.",
            "The relationship between the two main characters is at the heart of the story. He falls for her first, and their dynamic embodies a classic grumpy-sunshine trope, with her optimism contrasting his brooding nature. The workplace setting further intensifies their interactions, adding layers of tension and intrigue.",

It felt corny and boring, and I was expecting something completely different.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Flow:**  \n  The story was very choppy, with every chapter feeling like a new scene. The storyline did not flow well, making it hard to stay engaged. It reminded me of watching (but reading) a school play.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There wasn’t much character build-up, and I didn’t connect with or love either of the main characters. If you’re looking for a billionaire hot alpha male, this isn’t the book for you.  \n\n- **Storyline and Themes:**  \n  The secret society storyline felt pointless and underdeveloped. I also felt we needed more background on her past to make the story more compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book didn’t meet my expectations. The choppy plot, lack of character development, and underdeveloped storyline made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I know this is a \"dark romance,\" but it got to the point where it just seemed like filler with no real necessity to the plot.  \n\n- **Character Reactions and Scenes:**  \n  When they captured Thomas and the poly torture group came in, it was fine. But when Misty was like, \"omg you have to meet my poly friend!\" as her ex is getting violently tortured, I thought, \"seriously?\" That scene was so cringe and seemed so forced.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The rest was good, though. I burned through this book so fast.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the romance was engaging and the story kept me hooked, the excessive and seemingly unnecessary violence, along with some forced and cringe-worthy scenes, detracted from the overall experience. Despite these flaws, the book was a quick and compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Jessa has once again delivered a compelling story that kept me hooked.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is another great book by Jessa, offering a darker, more intense narrative compared to her previous works. The marriage-of-convenience trope, combined with the male lead’s obsession, creates a captivating and emotional read. I highly recommend it to fans of Jessa and those who enjoy complex, character-driven stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The hair-dying scene was particularly swoon-worthy.  \n\n- **Character Development (Misty):**  \n  - Misty is fearless, feisty, and independent, yet she desires the love of a strong man.  \n  - She is strong in front of her friends but reveals her vulnerabilities to Damon, showing all parts of herself, even the ones she wants to hide.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Cameos:**  \n  - It was enjoyable to see the Gentlemen and Reagan in their element.  \n  - I hope Misty and Reagan become besties, as their dynamic was fun to read.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  - I’m excited for the rest of the Everette brothers’ books, especially Bash’s story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is another 10/10 from Jessa! It’s darker than her other works but equally captivating. The characters, especially Damon and Misty, are well-developed and compelling, with a perfect balance of strength and vulnerability. The cameos from familiar characters added depth, and the setup for future books in the series has me eagerly anticipating more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n10/10"

Her potential wasn’t fully realized, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Cameos and Crossovers:**  \n  I didn’t expect characters from Jessa Wilder’s hockey series to appear, but I was pleasantly surprised and glad to see them.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The spice in the book was well-done and enjoyable, earning a solid 4⭐️ rating from me.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  Despite the good spice, the book as a whole fell short for me, earning only 1.5⭐️.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some enjoyable elements, such as the spice and unexpected cameos, the underdeveloped FMC and the MMC’s problematic behavior made the overall experience disappointing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice: 4⭐️  \n- Overall Book: 1.5⭐️"

It seemed as though the author added them without considering how they fit into the overall narrative or character development.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential with its use of tropes, the execution fell short. The lack of character chemistry, disjointed plot, and poorly integrated smut scenes made the story feel amateurish and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The premise didn't feel compelling enough to keep me engaged, leading me to stop reading early on.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel didn't work for me due to its lack of believable character motivations and emotional depth. The opening chapter failed to draw me in, and I ultimately decided not to continue reading.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (No specific rating score was mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Opening Scene and Initial Impressions:**  \n  I knew from reading reviews that the book would start with the hero receiving oral sex from an escort. While this might be off-putting to some readers, I wasn’t deterred. The hero had already met the heroine, but they weren’t together at this point. Despite being with someone else, he was thinking about her during the act, which hinted at his growing obsession.  \n\n- **Character Development and Obsession:**  \n  The hero’s obsession with the heroine becomes undeniable when she shows up during the encounter. From that moment, he fully gives in to his fixation on her. This obsession drives the story forward, leading to extreme actions like coercion, murder, and torture. While some readers might find this unsettling, I appreciated how it showcased the intensity of his feelings and the dark turn his character takes.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I found it surprising that many readers gave up on the book early on. Some of the best romance novels, like *Consider Me* and *The Way I Hate Him*, also start with the heroes being involved with other women. This trope often serves to highlight how the heroine transforms the hero from a carefree playboy into someone deeply committed.  \n\n- **Plot Progression and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The hero and heroine had only interacted twice before he decided to make her his wife. Their relationship is far from conventional, and the hero’s actions are extreme, to say the least. Once he commits to his obsession, he becomes entirely consumed by it, which shapes the rest of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s opening scene and the hero’s dark, obsessive behavior might not appeal to everyone, I found it compelling and well-executed. The story effectively portrays the hero’s transformation and the intensity of his feelings, even if it takes a darker, more unconventional path than typical romance novels.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The beginning felt a little slow, likely because I hadn’t read the series this book is a spin-off from. However, this didn’t hinder my enjoyment once I got past the first two or three chapters. The book can easily be read as a standalone.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  The story read smoothly, and I was able to get through a significant portion of it in one day. The pacing picked up after the initial chapters, making it an engaging and fast-paced read.  \n\n- **Characters and Dynamics:**  \n  Damon, the unhinged billionaire, is determined to make Misty his at any cost. Misty, on the other hand, just wants to keep her head down and focus on her job. Damon’s relentless pursuit of Misty and his willingness to do whatever it takes to get her to agree to a marriage of convenience made him a fascinating, albeit problematic, character. Despite his red flags, I found myself rooting for him.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book explores dark themes, features a dirty-talking billionaire, and includes a touch of suspense. These elements added depth and intrigue to the story, making it more than just a typical romance novel.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I’m hoping the rest of the Everett brothers get their own books, as this story left me eager to explore more of this world and its characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable and engaging read, despite the slow start. The dynamic between Damon and Misty, combined with the dark themes and suspenseful elements, made for a compelling story. I’m excited to see if the author expands on this world with future books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
