            "The story had its share of genuine surprises, but some elements felt overly predictable. If the author continues to write, I hope to see more unexpected developments with the characters in future works.",
            "The characters are unforgettable and will linger in my mind. I especially appreciated the bond that developed between the younger and older characters, who began as strangers. Additionally, the lovable dog character won me over, even as a devoted cat person.",
            "I appreciated the author's writing style and would definitely explore more of her work when I'm in the mood for a comforting read. I previously enjoyed *The Last Chance Library*, and while I initially sought comfort in this book, I was surprised by its dark turn early on. Nevertheless, the story maintains a good balance of humor, making it an overall enjoyable read. It explores themes of grief, loss, marriage, family, friendship, community, mental health, aging, and addiction, among others.",
            "I may have set my expectations too high due to the long waitlists at my local library and the time it took to access the Libby e-audiobook. While I found it to be a solid four-star read, it ultimately fell short of earning five stars."

While it was a solid four-star read for me, it didn’t quite reach five stars.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  I was looking for a comfort read and was surprised when the story took a dark turn early on. However, the book isn’t entirely dark or scary—it balances humor well, making it an enjoyable read overall. The themes include grief and loss, marriage, family, friendship, community, mental health, aging, and addiction, among others.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are memorable and will stay with me. I particularly enjoyed the bond formed between younger and older characters who didn’t know each other at the start. There’s also a lovable dog character that even I, a cat person, found delightful.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  Some parts of the story genuinely surprised me, while others felt too predictable. If the author turns this into a series, I’d like to see the characters surprise me more in future installments.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook was very well done by Sarah Lambie. Her performance was so engaging that I found myself looking for other audiobooks narrated by her.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Potential:**  \n  I enjoyed the author’s writing and would consider reading more of her work when I’m in the mood for a book like this. I also enjoyed *The Last Chance Library* by her.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a good read that didn’t quite meet my high expectations, but I loved the characters, the humor, and the audiobook narration. The story’s mix of dark and light elements, along with its exploration of deep themes, made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars."

            "The pacing of the story occasionally felt slow, with some revelations taking longer to unfold than I would have liked, causing me to lose momentum. At times, the narrative dragged, and certain character actions felt exaggerated. Centered around the residents of Shelley House, the story explores their unlikely bonds as they strive to save their historic home from demolition. Themes of community, connection, and friendship are at the heart of the narrative, complemented by a hint of mystery and a touch of romance, but the primary focus remains on the relationships between the characters.",
            "In this story, 77-year-old Dorothy Darling embodies a curmudgeonly, rule-abiding spirit reminiscent of Ove, yet her tough exterior conceals a hidden sweetness. Joseph, a delightful character, along with his charming dog Reggie, adds warmth to the narrative. The introduction of Kat, a young woman with pink hair who illegally sublets Joseph’s spare room, injects a dynamic twist into the group. As the story unfolds, other residents are introduced, enriching the sense of community.",
            "This book features moments of humor that had me laughing out loud, alongside deeply emotional scenes that nearly brought me to tears. Some revelations were gut-wrenching, steering the story into a more somber direction than I anticipated for a feel-good novel. A heads-up about Chapter 25: while Princess (the dog) is fine, a distressing event occurs involving another dog, which may be upsetting for some readers."

While it didn’t quite meet my expectations as a feel-good novel, it’s still worth reading, especially for fans of the author. However, *The Lost Ticket* remains my top recommendation.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n  The novel is not a mystery, cozy or otherwise, which felt like a strange marketing choice. While there is some intrigue and deception related to Shelley House, it serves more as a plot device rather than the central focus.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The story heavily emphasizes the \"found family\" trope, featuring a group of residents, some of whom are quite curmudgeonly. It also explores themes of forgiveness and learning to move on at any age. The tone is very British, heartwarming, quirky, and charming.  \n\n- **Pacing and Satisfaction:**  \n  For me, the novel was a bit less satisfying and somewhat slower compared to the author’s two previous works.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I truly adored Reggie, the smart Jack Russell, and his spry owner, Joseph, even more than the two main characters. Their presence added a lot of charm to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation:**  \n  Despite its slower pace, I still enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the author’s next release.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel didn’t fully meet my expectations in terms of pacing and satisfaction, its heartwarming themes, quirky charm, and delightful characters like Reggie and Joseph made it an enjoyable read.

            "The pacing of the story occasionally felt slow, with some revelations taking longer to unfold than I would have liked, causing me to lose momentum. At times, the narrative dragged, and the characters seemed to overreact in certain situations. The plot centers on the residents of Shelley House, who forge unexpected bonds as they strive to save their historic home from demolition. Themes of community, connection, and friendship are central to the narrative, which includes a hint of mystery and a touch of romance, but ultimately focuses on the relationships between the characters.",

Joseph is a delightful character, and his dog Reggie adds an extra layer of charm. Kat, a young woman with pink hair, brings a quirky twist by illegally subletting Joseph’s spare room, enhancing the group's dynamic. As the narrative unfolds, other residents are introduced, enriching the sense of community.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n   - The book was not what I expected. I thought it would focus more on finding the criminal who injured Joseph, resembling a murder mystery without an actual murder. Instead, it leaned more into Fredrik Backman-style storytelling, centering on interpersonal relationships and the quest to save Shelley House. Themes of forgiveness and letting go of the past were prominent.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I adored the characters, especially Dorothy and her notebook, Kat, Joseph, and Reggie the Jack Russell (who is the best character because he’s a dog). Dorothy and Kat’s backstories were well-fleshed out and intriguing, adding depth to their characters.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot was well-written and entertaining, though somewhat predictable. Dorothy and Kat’s awkward yet endearing relationship was a highlight, and I found myself rooting for them as they worked to save Shelley House and learn to forgive themselves and others.  \n\n- **Resolution and Ending:**  \n   - I was slightly disappointed by how the mystery of Joseph’s attacker was resolved, but every other loose end was tied up satisfactorily. The epilogue was perfect and added a satisfying conclusion to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Appeal:**  \n   - The book is a delightful and heartwarming read, perfect for fans of feel-good stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNosy Neighbors is a charming and emotionally resonant novel that focuses on relationships, forgiveness, and community. While it deviated from my initial expectations, it delivered a heartwarming and satisfying story with well-developed characters and a feel-good tone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars.  \n\nMany thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review."

However, the storytelling approach felt more like a mix of various tropes and subplots, including an unlikeable curmudgeon, a new resident with a mysterious past, a neighbor who was attacked, and a community coming together to stop redevelopment.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The characters include a curmudgeonly woman who observes her neighbors from her window, a new resident with a hidden history tied to the area, and a neighbor who becomes a victim of an attack. The story also explores potential love interests and long-held secrets among the residents.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  While the book wasn’t bad, it felt overly long and could have been improved by cutting 50-60 pages or eliminating some tropes. The pacing made it feel like a slog at times, and I found myself struggling to get through it over the past two days.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  The story includes multiple subplots, such as the mystery of the attack, the fight against redevelopment, and the gradual revelation of the new resident’s history. While these elements added depth, they also contributed to the feeling of the book being overly dense.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Nosy Neighbors* is a cozy mystery with a unique \"save the neighborhood\" twist, but its storytelling approach and excessive length detracted from my enjoyment. The book could have been more engaging with tighter editing and fewer tropes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It was fun to see them interact, especially not knowing if their encounters would be calm or combustible!  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  It seems every tenant in the building has a secret to hide. When a crime is committed, Dorothy Darling’s picky personality is pushed over the edge. Who committed the crime? Are they safe at Shelley House? The story is filled with many shocking reveals and suspenseful situations.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  Despite the suspense, the story warmed my heart. It spotlights the truth that everyone has their own struggles and could use some understanding and acceptance from others.  \n\n- **Humor and Lighthearted Elements:**  \n  There’s a sweet dog who helps keep the tenants entertained, adding a touch of warmth and humor to the narrative.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  Shelley House, with its messy mail area, anonymous garbage in the corridor, and loud music, feels alive and adds to the story’s charm.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Nosy Neighbors* is a delightful blend of mystery, humor, and heartwarming moments. Freya Sampson has once again crafted a story with vivid characters, a compelling plot, and meaningful themes that resonate deeply.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I recommend it, I found it more somber than expected and didn’t enjoy it as much as *The Lost Ticket*. I wish I had waited for the audiobook version.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  The residents of Shelley House are initially perceived as \"neighbors from hell,\" but as their backstories unfold, they become more relatable and even lovable. Characters like Dorothy (the elderly \"Karen\") and Kat (the pink-haired drifter) are particularly engaging, and their alternating perspectives add depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The story revolves around two central elements: a mystery (who attacked one of the residents?) and a shared mission (can they unite against a common foe?). The plot is well-paced, with a subtle twist that I didn’t see coming, making it a satisfying read for fans of cozy mysteries.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The novel explores the idea that \"everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.\" It emphasizes empathy and understanding, showing how people are often doing the best they can despite their flaws.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book has a quirky, ensemble-cast vibe that feels cozy yet intriguing. The alternating perspectives of Dorothy and Kat keep the narrative fresh and engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a solid 4 ⭐️+ read that combines quirky characters, a well-crafted mystery, and a heartwarming exploration of empathy and human connection. It’s perfect for fans of ensemble casts and cozy mysteries with a twist.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 ⭐️+"

            "The pacing occasionally felt slow, with some revelations taking longer to unfold than I would have liked, which caused me to lose momentum. The story centers on the residents of Shelley House, who forge unexpected bonds as they strive to save their historic home from demolition. Themes of community, connection, and friendship are at the heart of the narrative. While there are elements of mystery and a hint of romance, the primary focus remains on the characters' relationships.",
            "In this story, 77-year-old Dorothy Darling embodies a curmudgeonly, rule-abiding persona reminiscent of Ove, yet her tough exterior conceals a hidden sweetness. Joseph is a delightful character, and his dog Reggie adds an extra layer of charm. The introduction of Kat, a young woman with pink hair who illegally sublets Joseph’s spare room, injects a dynamic twist into the narrative. As the story unfolds, other residents are introduced, enriching the sense of community.",
            "The book is well-written and rich in depth and emotion, but it didn't resonate with me as strongly as *The Lost Ticket*.",
            "This book offers a delightful mix of humor that had me laughing out loud, alongside deeply emotional moments that truly tugged at my heartstrings. However, some sections were more depressing than I anticipated for a feel-good story, and a few character actions felt excessive. Chapter 25 features a poignant moment involving a dog, though I’m relieved to say that Princess, another dog in the story, is okay."

There’s also a lovable dog character (even as a cat person, I enjoyed all the scenes with this dog).  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  Some parts of the story genuinely surprised me, while others felt too predictable.
