            "This book covers a broad range of topics while remaining cohesive. The protagonist's life is filled with conflict and setbacks, yet the author expertly manages this chaos, ensuring the story retains its logical flow and steady pace.",
            "The protagonist's life is filled with conflict, and chaos seems to follow her at every turn. The author skillfully balances this turmoil, ensuring the story maintains its logical flow and pace. Initially, the main character comes off as quite obnoxious; the opening scene features her reciting data figures in a high-pitched stutter while receiving oral sex from her boss, which certainly raises the stakes. However, I found her irritating at first. Fortunately, her character development is a key subplot, and she undergoes significant changes quickly and frequently. \n\nI appreciate when a romance is intertwined with a non-romantic plot, and here, the romance deepens as part of the characters' growth. This approach makes the love story feel natural and authentic, and I was thoroughly engaged. I enjoy romances that explore themes beyond just love, and in this case, the protagonist's professional upheaval creates substantial tension early in the narrative.",
            "This book offers compelling stories that are refreshingly unique. One standout lesson revolves around the protagonist's ex, emphasizing that a jerk is often a jerk for life. This powerful message resonated with me more than I expected, highlighting the importance of recognizing toxic behavior.",
            "I highly recommend this book to fans of women's fiction, sisterly tales, enemies-to-lovers romances, and stories of redemption. If you enjoy fast-paced narratives centered around workplace dynamics and complex relationships, this is a must-read."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Romance and Plot Integration:**\n   - I'm always delighted when I find a romance with a non-romantic plot. The romance gains complexity as part of the individual character's developmental arcs. When romance unfolds this way in a book, I think it feels so natural and authentic. I was hooked on the love story here!\n   - I really like it when my romances are about something besides romance, like almost more significant than the romance. In this one, the fmc is going through professional upheaval, which provides significant story tension in the early part of the book.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The fmc's life is rife with conflict, and things are always going wrong for her. The author is skilled at balancing all this conflict and activity so the book maintains its logical integrity and pace.\n   - This fmc starts out to be pretty obnoxious. The opening scene reveals her reciting data figures in a high-pitched stutter while she is receiving oral sex from her boss! Definitely introduces major stakes right away, but I found the fmc annoying at first. Thankfully, her character trajectory is one of the primary subplots, so she changes quickly, often, and by great leaps.\n\n- **Sibling Relationships:**\n   - I really appreciate and relate to how important these adult sisters are to each other. Their dynamics and choices regarding their relationship feel authentic to me.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**\n   - This book tells good stories, ones I don't encounter very often. One of these that I really appreciate here is the lesson about the fmc's ex. Once a jerk, always a jerk, this book tells us. It's such a good message and I had no idea how much I needed to hear it until I read this book.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Specific):**\n   - The narrator, Josie Charles, gives a good reading, but she doesn't have much variation in her voice for performing different characters.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - This book takes on a wide span of material, but it never devolves into chaos. At the same time, the fmc's life is rife with conflict, and things are always going wrong for her. The author is skilled at balancing all this conflict and activity so the book maintains its logical integrity and pace.\n\n- **Genre and Recommendations:**\n   - I recommend this to fans of women's fiction, sister stories, enemies to lovers romance, and redemption stories.\n   - Read this book if you like: ‚öîÔ∏è enemies to lovers romance, üë©üèº‚Äçü¶∞ women's fiction, üì† workplace stories, üë≠üèΩ sister stories, üêá fast-paced.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI enjoyed this book so much, it was certainly a pleasant surprise. The romance felt natural and authentic, and the character development was compelling. The themes and messages resonated deeply with me, and the pacing kept me engaged throughout. Despite a few minor criticisms, this book is a standout in its genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- üèôüèôüèôüèô (4 out of 5 stars for corporate jobs theme)\n- Audiobook Narration: Good but lacks character variation.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Format: Audiobook, Libby\n- Finished: Dec 3 '24\n- Thank you to the author Luci Adams and publishers St. Martin's Press, and NetGalley for an advance digital copy. All views are mine."

            "The novel utilizes a backward storytelling technique, incorporating flashbacks to unveil crucial information. Initially, I needed some time to adapt to this style, but I soon found myself deeply engaged in the narrative.",
            "Daisy Peterson is a charmingly chaotic character, and her journey resonated deeply with me. Following the loss of her job of thirteen years, a breakup, and a strained relationship with her sister, Daisy is determined to rise from rock bottom. Her growth is both hilariously entertaining and genuinely touching. The romance in the novel is utterly delightful, encapsulated by a poignant line: *I have been so, incredibly lonely, and in this vast pit of loneliness that is life, I find myself a lot less lonely with you.* The heat level is low, featuring a closed-door approach with just one mild scene in the prologue.",

Archie, on the other hand, embodies the perfect book boyfriend‚Äîunderstanding, charming, and emotionally insightful. In contrast, Daisy is frustratingly aloof and stubborn, lacking the empathy her intelligence suggests she should possess. Her insincere apologies and contradictory choices detract from her character, leaving readers feeling exasperated.",

While I appreciate the author's intention to delve into family trauma, it seemed like a misguided plot choice.

            "Daisy's journey of self-discovery is at the heart of the story as she grapples with her values, interests, desires, and self-worth. While I appreciated her character, her stubbornness and tendency to judge others often led to unnecessary conflicts. Betzy, Daisy's best friend, and Mia, her sister, are vibrant and sensible figures who offer essential support without enabling Daisy's self-destructive behaviors. The young girls Daisy nannies, Bailey and Cara, add a charming touch to the narrative. Archie, the male lead, stands out with his kindness, emotional depth, and humor. His honest and supportive relationship with Daisy is well-crafted, and their communication, though sometimes strained, feels genuine. The romance is heartwarming and beautifully developed, though it remains minimal and closed-door in terms of spice.",

She bravely embraced change, learned to compromise, and reevaluated her previously held beliefs, all while remaining true to her core values. The supporting characters were equally compelling. Each girl brought a unique vibrancy to the narrative, making them fully realized individuals rather than mere plot devices in Daisy's journey.",
            "Initially slow, this story blossoms into a heartwarming tale of growth and love. It serves as a poignant reminder that we often only see what others choose to show us, both on social media and in real life.

She‚Äôs lost her job of 13 years, lost her boyfriend, and is in the midst of a long fight with her sister.\n   - I loved the growth Daisy experienced. I was proud of her opening up to change, compromise, and rethinking things she thought she was certain of, but she also stayed true to the core perspectives that were important to her.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - Things started off very chaotic with the pacing and storytelling. There were a lot of flashbacks woven in with Daisy‚Äôs present struggles to explain how she got to the point that she was at, and they threw me off a bit at times.\n   - By the end, the flashbacks had filtered out, and in a way, I ultimately felt like the writing reflected Daisy‚Äôs character as she settled more into herself.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**\n   - The book was what I would classify as ‚Äúromance-lite‚Äù as Daisy and Archie spend most of their time together building a friendship before they allow their feelings to possibly venture from the friend zone.\n   - The moments between Daisy and Archie, and their moments with Archie‚Äôs daughters, Bailey and Cara, were some of my favorite parts of the book.\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**\n   - I loved the girls.

They weren‚Äôt just a plot point but fully formed characters who were just as important to Daisy‚Äôs story - maybe even more than Archie‚Äôs role.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**\n   - After a bit of a slow start, this really grew into a heartwarming story of growth and love.\n   - There‚Äôs a good reminder that oftentimes we only see what people want us to see, both on social media and in real life, and that finding the people you can truly be your most authentic self with is a gift and something to be cherished and celebrated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite a slow and chaotic start, the book evolved into a heartwarming tale of personal growth, love, and the importance of authentic relationships.

While the interactions between Daisy, the children, and their father are heartwarming, the plot feels disjointed, and the pacing is inconsistent. The book has potential but falls short of being a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

The romantic plot felt more like a side story to Daisy's character development journey, which I didn‚Äôt mind at all.  \n\n- **Character Development (Daisy):**  \n  I really liked Daisy as a character. She felt very real‚Äîkind of a mess, and her tendency to rant and ramble when nervous was something I strongly related to.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure (Split Timeline):**  \n  The split timeline threw me off at times, making the story feel choppy. There were moments when it cut into the middle of a scene, which disrupted the flow. However, by the end, I appreciated the insights the flashbacks provided, as they allowed the story to unfold more slowly and reveal things gradually.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters (Archie and the Girls):**  \n  I wished we had more time with Archie and the girls. They were such a joy to spend time with throughout the story. Bailey, in particular, reminded me of myself at that age, and the girls were written in a very realistic way. It was refreshing to see children in a book behave like normal kids.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The book was a quick read‚Äîlighthearted and fun, yet it still managed to stir deeper emotions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable and unexpected read. While the split timeline had its flaws, the character development, realistic portrayal of children, and the balance of lightheartedness with emotional depth made it a book I‚Äôd definitely recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her ongoing issues with her sister feel repetitive, and her choice in partners is questionable. Additionally, her job loss can be traced back to her own actions.

She did a great job with it, even including some of the shrieking of the youngest child. However, I‚Äôm not a fan of shrieking in my earbuds, especially when I‚Äôm trying to nap.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The first half or so of the book seemed overly long and slow. I really felt like it was going to take me over a week to finish. However, the story did pick up after the first half, and the last twenty-five percent was actually very good.  \n\n- **Character Development (Daisy):**  \n  The main character, Daisy, is a little hard to feel compassion for. Yes, she has had some really bad and unfortunate things happen all at once, but she brings so much of it on herself. Her problems with her sister are clearly repetitive, and she‚Äôs feeding into it. Her man problems stem from picking a really lousy guy, and losing her job was due to her own actions. It‚Äôs hard to sympathize with her.  \n\n- **Character Development (Supporting Characters):**  \n  I loved Archie and his children. The youngest was an incredible character. I don‚Äôt remember exactly how old she was, but she was definitely going on thirty and totally called things the way she saw them.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I had very mixed feelings about how to rate this book. The overly long first half knocked it down some for me, but the latter part of the story was engaging and enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a slow and overly long first half, it improved significantly in the latter part, making it a worthwhile read. The narration was well done, though the shrieking was a bit much at times. Daisy‚Äôs character was hard to sympathize with, but the supporting characters, especially Archie and his children, were delightful.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars.  \n\nThanks to Macmillan Audio for the copy. All thoughts are my own."

Through a series of flashbacks, she begins to understand how her past has negatively influenced her and realizes the need to change her perception of the world.  \n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The use of flashbacks is a key element in the story. While they are effective in revealing the MC's past and her growth, they are described as long-winded and occasionally cringey.  \n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  Despite the flaws in the flashbacks, the reader appreciates the MC's eventual growth and transformation, finding the journey heartwarming and satisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents a touching and relatable journey of self-discovery, with a focus on the MC's realization of how her past has shaped her. While the flashbacks could have been more concise, the overall emotional payoff of her growth makes the story worthwhile.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Whether it's trying to get someone's attention, looking back at a job or relationship with rose-tinted glasses, feeling undeserving of someone's attention, having a family fight that wasn't really about them, or being in a slump that needed drastic measures to overcome, we've all been like Daisy. This made her a charming character despite her flaws, and I rooted for her to do better and find better.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n   - I loved Archie, Cara, and Bailey and the relationships Daisy built with each of them. The way she repaired other relationships along the way added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Feel:**  \n   - The story was very feel-good and redeeming, leaving me with a sense of warmth and satisfaction.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n   - The pacing was very slow at times, and I felt we got lost in small details. I was particularly excited about the budding relationship with Archie, but since the book wasn't solely focused on romance, I wished some other story points would move along faster.  \n\n- **Accuracy of the Book Description:**  \n   - The description was misleading. It stated that Daisy becomes a nanny for Archie's kids, but she never actually becomes their nanny‚Äîshe only attempts to get the job.

Daisy, the protagonist, is flawed, particularly in her unwillingness to see things from others' perspectives. Despite this, I found myself rooting for her to find her happily-ever-after (HEA).  \n   - Daisy's tendency to ignore warning signs and interpret situations to suit her desires is a notable flaw, but it adds depth to her character.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The book's description was misleading, leading me to expect a \"Hallmark-esque nanny to hunky dad\" scenario.

As she navigates this challenging period, she applies for positions at cafes and coffee shops. During her journey, she meets Archie, a single father and artist, and their friendship gradually deepens into a romantic relationship. The narrative explores themes of self-discovery, slow-burn romance, and the struggle to balance personal aspirations with life‚Äôs responsibilities.",

            "The story centers on Daisy, a British girl, and Archie, a Scottish guy, enriching the narrative with their cultural backgrounds.",
            "The book started off slowly for me, taking about three weeks to fully engage, partly due to my reading slump. However, once Archie and his girls were introduced, I was completely hooked. The humor throughout made it an enjoyable read.",

Daisy's internal struggle with her feelings for Archie is relatable; she constantly reassures herself that their relationship is impractical due to his status as a single dad with two kids and her own reluctance to have children. Key tropes include Friends to Lovers, Single Dad x Nanny, Slow Burn, Fluffy Romance, and Self-Discovery. Genre: Romance (16+)."
