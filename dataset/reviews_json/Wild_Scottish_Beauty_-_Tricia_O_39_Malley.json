She accepts a job in Loren Brae, Scotland, only to find out she'll be working for Ramsay McMillan, a friend of her brother's, which initially disappoints her.

            "The story was enjoyable, but the plot felt slow at times. There was significant buildup, with the main characters not truly connecting until about 75% into the book. While the magical elements were introduced, they didn’t fully develop, likely due to the series format. The slow-burn romance ultimately delivered a satisfying payoff, though the pacing, particularly in the first half, was sluggish. The magical powers seemed underutilized, suggesting potential for deeper exploration in future installments.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the brother’s best friend trope, which is one of my favorites. The grumpy x sunshine dynamic was skillfully executed and made for an entertaining experience. The banter and chemistry between Willow and Ramsey were captivating, and Ramsey’s transformation from grumpy to soft was particularly satisfying.",

        "conclusion": "This was a solid 3.5-star read for me. While I enjoyed the story, characters, and setting, the slow pacing and underdeveloped magical elements held it back from being a full 4 stars. The grumpy x sunshine trope and the brother’s best friend dynamic were highlights, and the Scottish setting added charm. Despite some pacing issues, the slow-burn romance had a satisfying payoff, and I’m intrigued enough to explore more of the author's work.",

            "The grumpy/sunshine trope feels overused, leaving the characters exaggerated and unrealistic. Willow's passivity and excessive forgiveness, even in the face of abuse, are frustrating. She often comes across as blissfully oblivious, failing to take meaningful action to change her circumstances. Miles, who is abusive, controlling, and hateful, faces no real consequences for his actions by the story's end. His behavior, particularly when he sabotages Willow's job offer, is infuriating and lacks resolution. Ramsay, while sympathetic due to his own issues, also mistreats Willow, reinforcing the damaging messages Miles has instilled in her.

            "Ramsay McMillian has quickly become my favorite male protagonist since Lachlan in the first book. This grumpy Scotsman may be terse, but his words carry weight. Willow Barlowe, a plus-sized heroine, is determined, self-aware, and fearless in pursuing her dreams despite the challenges she faces. She is a refreshing and relatable character. The dynamic between Ramsay and Willow is captivating; their initially awkward partnership deepens as they both grow and lower their defenses.

            "I admire how the heroines are portrayed as strong magical warriors rather than traditional damsels in distress. The men, depicted as hunky alpha males in kilts, serve as protective partners. This story cleverly flips gender roles, showcasing women wielding magical power and engaging in battle, while men take on the role of guardians and lovers. Sophia, the Knight, even humorously proposes making t-shirts that read, “I AM NOT YOUR DAMSEL IN DISTRESS!”—a sentiment I fully endorse.",

Set in a Scottish castle, the story features a delightful cast, including Clyde the ghost coo, Sir Buster the chihuahua, Brice the kitchen Brownie, and the comical garden gnome duo, Gnorman and Gnora. The latest addition, Calvin the kitten, is another memorable character that enhances the charm of this enchanting tale.",

            "The romance is enjoyable but heavily relies on clichés, including the \"friend's little sister\" and \"off-limits coworker\" tropes, along with the village dance scenario.

Willow, the likable heroine, is an underdog worth rooting for, though her brother's harsh treatment of her feels underplayed in her reaction."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Context and Standalone Enjoyment:**  \n   - This is the fifth novel in Tricia O’Malley’s *The Enchanted Highlands* series, a magical romantic comedy set in the small Scottish village of Loren Brae, home to likable humans and mythological creatures.  \n   - While it can be enjoyed on its own, I didn’t enjoy this story as much as previous entries in the series, though it was still fun.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story starts slowly, focusing on Willow, a sweet-natured plus-sized fashion designer, who is apprenticed to Ramsey, a surly kilt-maker and her brother’s best friend.  \n   - Their relationship evolves into a grumpy/sunshine workplace romance, which I found enjoyable despite some frustrations.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Conflict:**  \n   - The sources of conflict in the story were frustrating at times, and Ramsey’s behavior could be awful. However, he does make it right by the end, which was satisfying.  \n\n- **Magic and World-Building:**  \n   - My favorite aspects of the story were the animals and the magic, which added charm and depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Audiobook Production and Narration:**  \n   - The audiobook production was excellent, featuring dual narration by Amy Landon (Willow’s point of view) and Will Watt (Ramsey’s point of view).  \n   - Both narrators have pleasant voices, good pacing, great accents, and effectively convey humor and emotion.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Audience Consideration:**  \n   - I recommend the audiobook for fans of humorous magical romances, though it’s worth noting that the content is not safe for work or children at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this installment didn’t resonate with me as strongly as previous books in the series, it was still an enjoyable read with charming magical elements and a satisfying romance. The audiobook narration was a standout feature, making it a great choice for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "Willow's chemistry with the characters is a key reason for her presence in Loren Brae; Sophie and the Order need her to embrace her true potential. The story wouldn't feel complete without appearances from my favorite coo, and the author delivers several humorous encounters. Readers are treated to quality time with beloved characters like Sophie, Agnes, and Graham, as well as a host of quirky supernaturals, including our cherished Broomie. With the addition of an adorable kitten named Calvin, a whirlwind of a thieving brother, and the ever-present threat of screeching kelpies, this book is impossible to put down until the very last page.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this grumpy sunshine romantasy. The contrast between Willow's edgy, humorous design talent and Ramsay's stoic, traditional approach creates a compelling dynamic. Initially, it seems unlikely that they will find common ground. Willow's boundless optimism shines through, even as she grapples with trusting her brother's close friend. However, she ultimately immerses herself in the design process. The chemistry between Ramsay and Willow is electric, practically leaping off the page whenever they share a scene. Though uncertain, Willow embraces the challenge, revealing her fierce determination. As a weaver, her unique abilities not only elevate her but also save others, solidifying her place as a formidable heroine.",
            "With each new installment of the Enchanted Highlands Series, I find myself yearning to buy a ticket to Scotland in search of my own magic—though I’d prefer to avoid the kelpies! The ever-present threat of these screeching creatures adds a thrilling layer of tension to the story."

The dynamic between Willow and Ramsay is compelling, and Willow's journey of self-discovery and empowerment is inspiring.

The setting feels alive and immersive, making it easy to get lost in the world O'Malley has created.\n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  I love it when books in a series feature returning characters from previous installments. This continuity adds depth and familiarity, making the series feel cohesive and rewarding for long-time readers.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  In this 5th installment of *The Enchanted Highlands* series, the story follows Ramsay and Willow as they navigate a working partnership. Willow is learning about kiltmaking to help design a line for McAlpine Castle, while Ramsay is her boss and her brother's best friend. Their forbidden attraction creates tension and raises the question: what could possibly go wrong... or right?\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a delightful addition to *The Enchanted Highlands* series, with its engaging characters, charming setting, and a plot that balances romance and conflict beautifully. Tricia O'Malley continues to deliver stories that captivate and entertain.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Ramsay's character pleasantly surprised me; he's now affectionately dubbed “Daddy Ramsay”—a devoted king who cherishes Willow and her body. His unwavering love for her warmed my heart and kept me smiling. Willow, a fierce and independent fashion designer, lives life on her own terms, and I loved witnessing her growth and the tender bond she forms with her cat, Calvin. Her fierce love and determination were truly inspiring. The friendship between Brice and Calvin added an adorable touch to the story. However, Miles remains on my “shit list.” His frustrating actions and attitude made it difficult for me to like him.",

Lines such as, “It was like I’d been living in black and white, and you were this explosion of color in my life,” and “That’s love, isn’t it? Something intangible woven into the fabric of our souls,” perfectly encapsulate the essence of love and connection. A particularly powerful takeaway is the theme of making space for love, emphasized by the quote, “There’s never a perfect time to find love, dear. You either make space in your life for it or you don’t.”",

The dedication to Blue was especially moving, serving as a poignant reminder of the precious moments we share with our beloved pets and the deep love we hold for them."

The tone is more mature and steamy, which adds a layer of complexity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Romantic Focus:**  \n  The primary focus of the stories is romance, typically between an unbelievably handsome Scottish man and a self-conscious, low self-esteem (but not push-over) woman. This dynamic is central to the series and drives much of the character development.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The main group consists of three women from America and one Scottish woman, creating an interesting mix of personalities and backgrounds. Their interactions and relationships are a key part of the story.  \n\n- **Paranormal/Magical Elements:**  \n  There is an underlying paranormal/magical theme throughout the series, centered around rebuilding the Order to protect the Tablet.
