Although there is a brief moment of surprising development late in the book, it comes too late to make a meaningful impact.",

However, the characters—who are meant to be in their late 20s—often behave immaturely, resembling hormonal teenagers. This disconnect hinders readers' ability to connect with them as adults. Additionally, the central romantic relationship between Billie and Cleo feels weak and underdeveloped, which is problematic for a book marketed as a romance.",

            "After an intriguing setup, the plot quickly stagnates, as characters become preoccupied with mundane activities like watching rom-coms and reading poetry instead of confronting their dire situation. The frequent references to past culture—such as 80s movies, Shakespeare, and JFK—feel out of place in a futuristic sci-fi context. The characters’ lack of urgency and proactive problem-solving is both frustrating and unrealistic. Furthermore, the romance between Cleo and the hologram, Billy, comes off as unconvincing; despite the AI's realistic programming, their relationship lacks authenticity and resembles a person falling in love with an inanimate object. Ultimately, the romantic subplot fails to evoke genuine emotional engagement or believability.",
            "The characters, aged 27 and older, often behaved in ways more typical of teenagers, undermining their believability. Immature dialogue—like saying \"LOL\" out loud—and frequent petty disputes eroded their credibility. Their emotional instability and repetitive conflicts rendered them both unrelatable and unlikable.",
            "The writing was a major disappointment, feeling disjointed and poorly crafted, reminiscent of a first draft. Sentences often jumped between unrelated ideas, creating confusion and disrupting the flow. For instance, the line “He was Chinese American, tall enough to rest his chin on the top of Cleo’s head, and bouncing on the balls of his feet so rapidly that his floppy black hair was getting in his eyes” highlights this lack of cohesion. Additionally, the third-person perspective from Cleo’s viewpoint led to inconsistencies, as she improbably noted details she couldn’t possibly see. Overall, the book suffered from insufficient editing, filled with minor yet significant inconsistencies that should have been corrected.",
            "The world-building felt underdeveloped, with concepts like the \"Other Place\" coming across as convenient and poorly explained. The science and magic system lacked a solid foundation, making it difficult to fully suspend disbelief. Additionally, the ending relied on a deus ex machina resolution, which undermined its impact and left the conclusion feeling unsatisfying.",
            "The title and cover instantly captivated me, evoking a sense of wonder tied to the quote, “I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.” The blend of a space odyssey and sapphic rom-com in the synopsis, combined with its release date coinciding with my birthday in Pride Month, heightened my anticipation. Discovering the beloved quote in the epigraph only intensified my excitement."

While the sci-fi elements, including the propulsion drive and conflict with the alien species, show potential, they are underdeveloped and lack logical consistency. The story introduces intriguing themes like humanity's future, the climate crisis, and space exploration, but fails to delve into them, choosing instead to maintain a cozy, romantic tone. The resolution feels rushed and unsatisfying, with characters teleporting home without grappling with the broader consequences of their journey.",
            "While the marketing promotes the book as a found family story, it ultimately falls short due to its heavy emphasis on Cleo and Billie. Supporting characters like Kaleisha, Abe, and Ros come across more as background figures than well-rounded individuals. Additionally, the characters’ actions often seem inconsistent with their ages, making them feel more like teenagers or college students rather than adults with established careers. \n\nCleo's immature communication style—such as sticking out her tongue and making fart noises—could be interpreted as a developmental flaw, but this potential is never fully explored. Similarly, Billie, in both her holographic and living forms, lacks depth; her background as a skilled commander isn't reflected in her interactions, which resemble those of a typical teenager trying to fit in. The real Billie from another dimension is nearly identical to the hologram, with little emphasis on her growth or the nuances of her experiences.\n\nThe romance between Cleo and Billie is underdeveloped, missing opportunities for meaningful conversations about love, touch, and intimacy, particularly regarding Ros, an aroace character. The transition from hologram-Billie to real Billie is presented too simply, neglecting the emotional complexities of Cleo’s feelings and the differences between the two versions.

It kept me wondering how it would work, and when it did, it delivered a double whammy of feels.  \n   - The sapphic romance between Cleo and Billie was lovely, though the pacing of their love declarations felt a bit fast. However, it fit well within the overall plot. This was a perfect Pride Month pick for me.  \n\n- **Plot and Genre Elements (Space Adventure and Mystery):**  \n   - The space adventure was thrilling, with a clever mystery that unfolded as the heroes journeyed through space. It kept me engaged and eager to see how everything would resolve.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Found Family):**  \n   - The found family dynamic among the quartet of explorers was heartwarming. They bickered, called out “BS” when necessary, and supported each other 112 percent. Each character had their moment to shine, making the story feel well-rounded and cohesive.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Author Potential:**  \n   - For a debut novel, this was impressive. While some parts of the prose felt a bit clunky, I believe the author, Hamilton, has room to grow and will likely improve with future works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful read, combining improbable romance, sapphic love, a thrilling space adventure, and a heartwarming found family dynamic. Despite some minor flaws in the prose, the story was engaging and emotionally resonant. I’ve already read it twice in five days and know I’ll revisit it again and again.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance between Cleo and Billie, a hologram, is poorly developed and lacks believability, failing to explore the ethical and scientific implications of such a relationship. Their connection feels superficial, driven more by physical attraction than emotional depth, with time jumps that undermine the authenticity of their bond. The narrative relies heavily on these time jumps and character dialogue, resulting in a disjointed and confusing experience. Key events, like a 7-year journey to a distant planet, are unrealistically condensed into a mere 3-week timeframe. The story's convenience undermines its stakes, as characters quickly acquire new abilities and resolve conflicts without adequate buildup or explanation. The transition from the beginning of the story to the climax, centered around saving the galaxy, feels abrupt and unjustified. Additionally, the villain lacks depth, presenting one-dimensional motives that come off as cliché.",
            "The characters, despite being PhD-level scientists, often behave immaturely and emotionally, resembling teenagers rather than adults. The story would have been more enjoyable if it had been marketed as young adult fiction, aligning better with the characters' actions.",
            "The story straddles the line between science fiction and fantasy, although it leans more toward the latter. Set in 2061, the use of contemporary pop culture references—such as JFK, Molly Ringwald, and TikTok—seems incongruous with the advanced technology depicted, like hyperjumps and intergalactic travel. To enhance credibility, the timeline would benefit from being pushed further into the future, perhaps to 2161, where the technological advancements would feel more plausible."

            "The found family dynamic among the main characters is enjoyable, but they often come across as younger and more immature than their late twenties would suggest. Despite being depicted as brilliant and engaged in advanced studies, their behavior occasionally feels inconsistent. Additionally, the characters, including Billie, have similar voices, which makes it difficult to distinguish their individual personalities. At the heart of the story is a romance between Cleo and Billie, the hologram of the ship’s captain, which raises intriguing questions about AI, sentience, and the essence of personhood. Meanwhile, the mystery of the spaceship crew’s disappearance adds significant depth to the plot.",
            "The novel relies heavily on exposition rather than showcasing its narrative, and the frequent shifts in perspective are surprising for a traditionally published work. Additionally, the pop culture references are firmly anchored in our current era, missing the chance to fully explore the potential of its futuristic setting. Consequently, the story feels more like a reflection of the present, aside from the presence of an advanced space program.",
            "While the science in this book may not be entirely plausible, as someone who enjoys stars and space operas without a deep scientific background, I found the story both fun and engaging. The author’s upbringing as the child of a Trekkie and a Star Wars fan is reflected in the vibrant atmosphere of the narrative. Additionally, the theme of disappearances and the unknown resonates with me, evoking memories of *The Leftovers*, one of my favorite TV shows.",
            "The title *The Stars Too Fondly* immediately caught my attention; it references a quote from Sarah Williams’ poem *The Old Astronomer*, which I was unfamiliar with. This title perfectly captures the cozy vibe of the space opera. The story follows four friends—Cleo, Kaleisha, Abe, and Ros—who, in their late twenties, decide to break into a spaceship that was meant to save humanity two decades earlier but never launched. When they reach the dark matter engine, the ship unexpectedly takes off. I love the premise of space enthusiasts accidentally commandeering a vessel, which adds a comedic touch. Essentially, the book is a romcom set in space, complete with superpowers and a supervillain for added fun."

The story feels very much like the present, except for the advanced space program.\n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**\n   - The pacing is uneven, with the story feeling both too long and rushed at times. However, the ending is mostly satisfying.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**\n   - The narration by queer non-binary actor Vico Ortiz is a highlight. Their tone, pacing, and attention to detail make the audiobook a joy to listen to, even though the character voices aren’t as distinct as they could be.\n   - This was my first experience with Ortiz’s narration, and I loved it so much that I listened for hours.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I really enjoyed *The Stars Too Fondly* despite its flaws.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n   - The plot had potential but suffered from unclear world-building, particularly around the science.  \n   - It was difficult to piece together what happened twenty years ago or predict future events because the rules of the world were not well-defined.  \n   - The story felt unpredictable in a way that made it hard to engage with or follow logically.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The side characters were unremarkable and didn’t stand out.  \n   - Cleo, the protagonist, was hard to connect with. The book tried too hard to make her seem “special” and “different” due to her obsession with the Providence, which felt forced.  \n   - The romance between Cleo and the hologram version of Billie didn’t feel believable. The concept of equating the hologram to the real person didn’t translate well, making it hard to invest in their relationship.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Perspective:**  \n   - The book could have benefited from a dual perspective, which might have helped round out the plot and world-building.  \n   - A clearer structure would have improved the overall reading experience, as the current narrative felt chaotic and unstructured.  \n\n- **Premise and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The premise of a group of friends stranded in space was intriguing and had a sense of magic and chaos.  \n   - The “vibes” of the story were enjoyable, even if the execution lacked structure.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Stars Too Fondly* had an engaging premise and a sense of magical chaos, it fell short in execution due to unclear world-building, underdeveloped characters, and an unconvincing romance. The lack of structure and predictability made it difficult to fully connect with the story, though it may still appeal to fans of science fantasy who prioritize atmosphere over logic.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nActual Rating: 2/5"

            "The plot takes unexpected turns, diverging significantly from the official synopsis. The narrative shifts through a close third-person perspective of Cleo, old Providence I reports, private messages, and a [REDACTED FOR SPOILERS] viewpoint, which can be jarring due to insufficient separation. The incorporation of multimedia elements, like scientific article abstracts, enriches the story and provides surprising insights.",
            "The characters are diverse and well-defined, each with unique motivations shaped by their backgrounds. The found family dynamics and romance are both solid and well-developed. The themes of love, power corruption, and personal growth are explored effectively throughout the story.",
            "The story occasionally lacks dialogue tags, leading to potential confusion. Additionally, the bright and youthful cadence of the writing may not resonate with all readers.",
            "The book is set in 2061 but includes numerous contemporary pop culture references and lacks major scientific advancements, which may be jarring for detail-oriented readers. The blend of science, magic, and futuristic elements, such as the food extruder, might also disappoint those who value logical consistency.",
            "The marketing left out a significant plot point that I find unappealing, resulting in disappointment. I felt the book wasn't accurately represented, which impacted my enjoyment. Advertised as a queer space odyssey rom-com, it leans more toward science fantasy than hard sci-fi. While it has a lot of heart and an intentional silliness that demands a considerable suspension of disbelief, the bright and youthful tone often feels more suited for a YA audience despite featuring a group of 20-somethings."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While *The Stars Too Fondly* has many strengths, including solid romance, beautiful found family dynamics, and engaging action sequences, it didn’t fully resonate with me due to its genre, tone, and some structural choices. The book requires a significant suspension of disbelief and leans heavily into science fantasy, which may not appeal to readers expecting hard sci-fi. Additionally, the marketing misalignment and certain narrative elements made it difficult for me to fully enjoy the story. However, I can see this book being a hit with the right audience, particularly those who appreciate its themes and diverse characters.",

            "The plot had notable flaws, with several elements remaining unexplained and introducing new plot holes. However, despite these issues, the story was engaging and enjoyable, featuring moments of genuine delight.",
            "The cast often portrayed characters who felt perpetually stuck in their late teens, which clashed with their intended late-twenties age. Cleo and Billie’s relationship oscillated abruptly between conflict and vulnerability, resulting in jarring moments. The grumpy-sunshine dynamic was overly apparent, and the found family trope came across as clichéd. However, Cleo's friend group was a highlight, showcasing a genuine bond, particularly in how they navigated their prolonged confinement in a spaceship for over seven months. Ros, a standout side character, captivated with their superpowers, mental health struggles, and intriguing self-experimentation logs. Cleo and Billie’s sapphic romance was both melodramatic and sweet, featuring a dynamic that was fun yet occasionally overly saccharine. Unfortunately, certain romantic elements, such as the absence of hologram sex, lacked creativity and fell short of expectations.",
            "The writing often felt outdated, despite its futuristic setting, and the meta aspects of the narrative didn't enhance the experience. While the dialogue included some genuinely funny and intentionally melodramatic moments, especially in Cleo and Billie’s sapphic romance, certain lines—particularly Billie's internal monologue—came across as angsty and juvenile, reminiscent of a teenager's writing. The narrative embraced familiar tropes but failed to engage with them in a clever or self-aware manner, making their presence overly apparent.",
            "The book's explanations of sci-fi phenomena often come across as fantasy dressed in scientific jargon rather than authentic science. While the inter-dimensional travel and warp mechanics were undeniably intriguing, the visual descriptions became repetitive. Additionally, the rationale behind the Other Place was confusing and resulted in several plot holes."

        "conclusion": "While “The Stars Too Fondly” has numerous flaws, including inconsistent scientific explanations, dated writing, and immature character portrayals, it still managed to be an enjoyable and engaging read. The sapphic romance, despite its melodrama, was a highlight, and the dynamics within Cleo’s friend group added depth to the story. However, the plot holes and overly obvious tropes detract from the overall experience. It’s a book that might appeal to those looking for a “cozy rom-com in space,” but it falls short in many areas.",

            "The plot may venture into silliness, but this tone aligns well with the overall spirit of the novel. The fantastical science leans away from hard sci-fi, instead creating a whimsical adventure. The resolution resembles a wizard's duel more than a scientific challenge, which might frustrate hardcore sci-fi enthusiasts. However, this aspect did not detract from the enjoyment of the romance.",
            "The characters, while in their late 20s and early 30s, often behave like teenagers, which is disappointing. Their fondness for 90s movies feels out of place in a 2060s setting. However, the dialogue, though colloquial and somewhat twee, effectively establishes the friendship dynamics. The romance unfolds as a slow-burn, almost like a \"enemies to lovers\" trope. The tension builds gradually, especially since one character is a hologram, but by the one-third mark, the relationship becomes engaging. This subtle development of romance is preferable to more abrupt narratives.",
            "The writing was somewhat clunky, featuring a few basic errors that may be corrected in the final edition. The point-of-view shifts were crucial for grasping the hologram's perspective and posed no problem. Although the dialogue took some time to adjust to, it ultimately complemented the book's tone.",
            "The idea of a romance with a hologram resonates in today’s world, where AI programs for romantic connections are on the rise. The novel effectively delves into themes of forbidden love and found family, adding significant depth to the narrative.",
            "This novel offers a charming and entertaining sci-fi romance with a light sapphic love story set in space. It exudes a cozy atmosphere filled with found family friendships and features a queer, diverse cast of characters. The overall tone feels like a ray of sunshine, making for a delightful and enjoyable read."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Stars Too Fondly* is a delightful and fun read, blending a sweet, sapphic romance with a light sci-fi backdrop. While it has some issues with characterization, dialogue, and scientific plausibility, these elements fit the tone of the novel and didn’t detract from the enjoyment. The slow-burn romance, diverse cast, and cozy atmosphere make it a charming and entertaining story.",

As they unravel the mystery behind the sabotaged launch of the Providence, they must also navigate survival with guidance from a hologram of the missing captain, Billie Lucas. The pacing is brisk, demanding a significant suspension of disbelief, especially regarding the characters' unpreparedness for interstellar travel and their nonchalant attitude toward alien environments.",

            "I appreciated the three perspectives—Cleo, Archive Texts, and a “Mystery” Narrator. The story started off strong, but as it progressed, it lost some of its momentum. Nevertheless, I consider it a highlight. The premise of accidentally stealing a spaceship feels unrealistic, especially since there are no significant consequences from NASA or the US government, diminishing the stakes. The absence of repercussions for such a monumental act feels implausible. Additionally, the romance between Billie and Cleo seems forced and appears abruptly; Cleo suddenly declares her love for Billie, yet their relationship lacks development. This romance adds little to the plot and perhaps should have been omitted in favor of a greater focus on the space mystery.",
            "The characters, despite being PhD holders in their late 20s to early 30s, behave more like hormonal, whiny teenagers than mature adults. Their actions are more fitting for social media interns than respected scientists or doctors, reflecting a lack of the maturity one would expect at their age. Additionally, the frequent switching between first and last names—Reid, Cleo, Billie, Wilhelmina, and Lucas—proved confusing and disrupted the reading experience.",
            "The book's tone frequently leans towards immaturity, as characters obsess over crushes and minor conflicts instead of exploring the more profound themes of science and humanity. This shift detracts from the potential for a serious and engaging narrative.",

It was fun at the start when the story was stronger, but as it progressed, it weakened. Still, I consider it a highlight.\n\n- **Character Development and Maturity:**\n   - The characters, despite being late 20s-early 30s PhDs, read like hormonal, whiny teenagers. Their behavior feels more fitting for social media interns than respected scientists or doctors. They lack the maturity expected of adults, let alone teenagers.\n\n- **Plot Realism and Consequences:**\n   - The premise of stealing a spaceship, even accidentally, feels unrealistic. There’s no significant consequence from NASA or the US government, which undermines the stakes. The lack of repercussions for such a monumental act feels implausible.\n\n- **Scientific and Logical Consistency:**\n   - Several elements of the space-related science don’t make logical sense. For example, taking decades-old hormone medication, the existence of a perfect food synthesizer on the Providence, and the abandonment of interstellar travel advancements feel inconsistent and poorly explained.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**\n   - The planet they’re heading to is described as hellish on one side and deadly icy on the other, with only a small strip of habitable land. It’s hard to believe this is a better option than Earth’s current state, making the premise feel weak.\n\n- **Romance Subplot:**\n   - The romance between Billie and Cleo feels forced and comes out of nowhere. Cleo suddenly realizes she’s in love with Billie, but their relationship lacks development. The romance adds little to the plot and would have been better omitted in favor of focusing on the space mystery.\n\n- **Character Naming and Confusion:**\n   - The frequent switching between first and last names for characters (Reid, Cleo, Billie, Whilemnia, Lucas) was confusing and disrupted the reading experience.\n\n- **Tone and Themes:**\n   - The book’s tone often veers into immature territory, with characters focusing on crushes and petty grievances rather than the high-stakes science and humanity themes. This detracts from what could have been a more serious and engaging story.\n\n- **Personal Critiques (Pop Culture References):**\n    - The mention of Voyager as the worst Trek series felt off, as it’s a favorite for many. The similarity to Discovery, a divisive Trek series, might explain this choice. Additionally, the inclusion of TikTok felt unnecessary and out of place.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel had a strong initial concept and some enjoyable narrative elements, but it fell short in execution. The characters lacked maturity, the plot suffered from unrealistic consequences and scientific inconsistencies, and the romance subplot felt forced. While the multiple perspectives were a highlight, the overall tone and focus on immature themes detracted from what could have been a compelling space mystery.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

This relationship had the potential to make the story far more engaging and interesting, but it fell short of expectations.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Impact:**  \n  Initially, I rated the book a 3, but after reflecting on it for a month, I realized it didn’t leave a lasting impression. My final rating is closer to a 2, or perhaps a 2.25 or 2.5 if those options were available.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential, particularly in exploring the love story with the hologram, it ultimately failed to deliver a compelling narrative. The lack of depth in the relationship and the overall impact of the story led to a lower rating.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 (or 2.25/2.5 if possible)."

            "The initial chapters, featuring the characters' plans to sneak into an abandoned spacecraft, were engaging and enjoyable. However, the narrative lost its appeal when the characters were unexpectedly launched into space, enduring minimal challenges during their seven years of isolation.",
            "In this story, the protagonist Cleo is a talented computer whiz and mechanic, yet her abilities feel underutilized. The supporting characters, although diverse in gender, sexuality, and race, lack the depth and distinctive traits needed to make them memorable. I found it challenging to grasp the reasons behind their friendships and struggled to differentiate between them.",

It was hard to believe that such skilled professionals would choose to spend their time watching cheesy romance movies and eating 3D-printed popcorn instead of actively working to resolve their predicament.",

            "The ending serves as a deus ex machina, which feels unsatisfying and diminishes the overall experience. Additionally, the exploration of trauma and emotional complexities lacks depth.",
            "The characters, despite being post-Ph.D. and around 27 years old, exhibit the maturity of 16- to 17-year-olds. This disconnect may stem from the author's age—22 when she began writing and 27 when she completed the work. The relationships among the characters feel superficial, undermining the promised theme of found family. While the cast is diverse, their individual experiences are largely overlooked, reducing them to background figures in Cleo's narrative, with only a single mention of a dispute over HRT supplies on the spaceship. Additionally, the hologram romance presents issues; the concept of a hologram, created from a person's memories, developing genuine emotions—like blushing or sexual desire—lacks credibility and adequate justification. The support from the friend group for this romance feels unrealistic and awkward, especially considering their scientific and medical expertise.",

This immaturity is attributed to the author's age (22 when she started writing and 27 when she finished).\n   - The interactions and relationships among the characters feel shallow, making the advertised \"found family\" theme a stretch.\n\n- **Diversity and Representation:**\n   - The characters are diverse, but their experiences are largely unexplored. They remain background characters to Cleo, with only one throwaway argument about HRT supplies on the spaceship.\n\n- **Romance and Hologram Concept:**\n   - The hologram romance is problematic. The idea of a hologram based on a human's memories developing feelings (blushing, sexual desire, worry) is unconvincing and not well-justified.\n   - The friend group's encouragement of this romance feels unrealistic and weird, especially given their scientific and medical backgrounds.\n\n- **Plot and Ending:**\n   - The ending is a deux ex machina, which is unsatisfying and detracts from the overall experience.\n   - There is a lack of depth in exploring feelings about surviving trauma or other emotional complexities.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**\n   - The book feels more like a YA novel than an adult science fiction book, with surface-level science and immature character dynamics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel falls short of expectations, particularly in character development, emotional depth, and the plausibility of its central romance.

The story follows Cleo and her friends as they seek to uncover the truth behind this event and the secrets of a derelict spaceship. With a fast-paced plot that plunges straight into the adventure, the narrative gradually unveils the characters' backgrounds and richly develops the world. Filled with unexpected twists, the story kept me engaged and eager to discover its outcome.",
            "The characters in the story are well-developed and relatable, each possessing unique expertise in space exploration. Their adult, professional backgrounds lend credibility to their actions and decisions. The relationships among the characters are portrayed genuinely, emphasizing their bonds rather than romantic entanglements. Additionally, the diverse representation of ethnicities and sexual orientations is handled with respect and authenticity.",
            "The writing is engaging and immersive, drawing readers into the adventure. The author skillfully weaves character development and world-building into the main plot, resulting in a seamless narrative. Well-researched technical and scientific elements add depth, making it particularly appealing to fans of hard science fiction.",
            "**Climate Change:** The novel highlights the pressing need for technological and scientific innovations to address Earth's worsening conditions. **LGBTQ+ Representation:** Homosexuality and bisexuality are depicted in a way that feels organic and normalized within the narrative. **Diversity and Inclusion:** The diverse backgrounds and orientations of the characters are celebrated, underscoring their shared humanity and common objectives.",
            "The novel is incredibly immersive, allowing me to feel as though I'm aboard the spaceship alongside the characters, navigating the vastness of space and confronting their challenges. The narrative encourages me to develop my own theories, which are often validated or challenged as the story unfolds. Its emotional resonance is powerful, filled with moments of fear, curiosity, and hope that linger long after reading."

While the technical aspects may not appeal to everyone, those with an interest in astronomy and science will find this book deeply satisfying.

            "In this story, the heroine's love interest is a holographic copy of the former ship captain, who disappeared two decades ago. Rather than delving into themes of artificial intelligence and the complexities of human-machine relationships, the romance primarily highlights the poignant barrier of physical touch. The presence of an explicitly aro/ace friend aboard serves as a counterpoint to the limited conception of love depicted in the main romance. Additionally, the revelation that the first-person narrator is the original captain adds an unexpected twist, as she effortlessly integrates into the relationship initiated by her digital duplicate, which feels like an unusual narrative choice.",
            "The novel's 2061 setting suffers from inadequate cultural worldbuilding. Characters frequently reference 20th-century figures and media, such as Jackie Robinson, Jack Kerouac, and Jack Skellington, which disrupts immersion. Additionally, the ship's media library is filled with outdated films like *While You Were Sleeping* (1995) and *Independence Day* (1996), raising questions about the inexplicable fixation on 90s culture.",
            "The novel provides much-appreciated #ownvoices sapphic representation. However, its exploration of artificial intelligence and relationships with machines lacks the nuance found in other works within the genre.",

The dynamics between them, particularly the charming banter and evolving romance between Cleo and Billy, are both heartwarming and enjoyable to witness.",

As a regular YA reader, I found this enjoyable, but it may be a point of consideration for others. The narrative leans more toward mystery and space adventure than rom-com, which was a delightful surprise."

Nonetheless, I enjoyed spending time with the crew and witnessing how they adapted to unexpected challenges. I was particularly engaged in unraveling the Providence I mystery and watching the relationship between Cleo and holographic Billie evolve.",

            "I highly recommend *The Stars Too Fondly* to fantasy readers who enjoy space media like *Star Trek*, *Star Wars*, or *Interstellar*, particularly those who appreciate romance. While young adults and teenagers may find it easier to relate to the characters, older readers can still enjoy the story—just be prepared for characters that may not quite fit their age. This sapphic science fiction romantic comedy starts off feeling outside my comfort zone, featuring a slow-burn romance instead of instant love. However, I eventually became fully engaged in the interstellar journey. Although the story falls into the YA/teen category, which can make it difficult to believe that the characters are in their late twenties and early thirties, the conclusion introduces more adult scenarios that add depth."

            "The romance between Cleo and Billie, the hologram, held promise, but ultimately felt rushed. While their compatibility became clear by the end, the lack of early interactions made their relationship resemble insta-love. More emotional development between them would have added depth to their connection. The novel follows four friends who unintentionally launch into space while unraveling a 20-year-old mystery. Despite the high stakes, the story maintains a cozy vibe, and I appreciated the depth of the plot. The author's clear descriptions effectively guide the reader through the complex events.",

            "I picked up this book primarily for its queer romance, but I found the relationship to be mostly insta-lust. I struggled to believe in a genuine love story, particularly due to the impracticality of a romance between a hologram and a human. Additionally, the introduction of magical space powers and the quest to save the universe felt rushed and inadequately developed. Despite being around 300 pages, the story felt overly long.",
            "The queer representation in this book is impressive and greatly appreciated. However, while the characters are meant to be in their late 20s to early 30s, their dialogue often resembles that of teenagers, leading to moments that feel off-putting.",

Despite being firmly in the sci-fi genre, which is outside my comfort zone, I found it to be an overall enjoyable reading experience.  \n\n- **Mystery Elements:**  \n  I appreciated the mystery elements in the story, though I predicted the reveals relatively early on. I’m not sure if this is a sign of a well-crafted story or not in this case.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Found Family:**  \n  I really loved the found family theme and the dynamics between the characters—Cleo, Kalisha, Abe, Ross, and Billie. Their interactions added depth and warmth to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Execution:**  \n  The pacing was well-executed, keeping the story moving quickly without feeling rushed. It would have been easy to either drag out the journey on the ship or skip too much, making it hard to stay connected to the characters, but the balance was just right.  \n\n- **Romance Arc:**  \n  I enjoyed the romance arc, which added an extra layer of engagement to the story.  \n\n- **Author’s Future Works:**  \n  I’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for Emily Hamilton’s future works because I had fun with this book and found it to be a satisfying read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite not being a sci-fi enthusiast, I found *The Stars too Fondly* to be an enjoyable and well-paced novel with strong character dynamics, a satisfying romance arc, and intriguing mystery elements. While I predicted some of the reveals early on, the overall execution and balance of the story kept me engaged. I look forward to reading more from Emily Hamilton in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the main characters—despite being in their late 20s to early 30s with PhDs—speak and behave like teenagers, giving the narrative a YA feel. Additionally, the dialogue is peppered with outdated cultural references, even though the story is set 16 to 37 years in the future.",

For instance, a character discovers 20-year-old HRT without any consideration of its effectiveness, and 3D-printed food components inexplicably remain unspoiled. Additionally, significant plot points are introduced only to be resolved hastily, making it feel like the narrative is rushed.",

This makes the story feel more suited to a YA audience.  \n   - The dialogue is filled with dated cultural references, even though the story is set 16-37 years in the future.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n   - The humor is specific and reminiscent of Joss Whedon’s quippy, self-aware, sarcastic millennial banter. This may appeal to fans of that style but didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Genre and Comparisons:**  \n   - The book is described as a science fantasy rom-com but draws unavoidable comparisons to *Fantastic Four*, *Doctor Strange*, *Guardians of the Galaxy*, and *The Avengers*. These comparisons aren’t mentioned in the promotional material, which might have influenced my expectations.  \n\n- **World-Building and Science:**  \n   - There’s a lot of handwaving of science and survival mechanics, which can be frustrating. For example, a character finds 20-year-old HRT with no concern for its efficacy, and 3D-printable food components remain unspoiled. Larger plot points are often introduced and quickly resolved to move the story forward.  \n\n- **Found Family Trope:**  \n   - The “found family” trope feels misapplied here, as the main friend group has been together since childhood. The hologram love interest might be the only character who could see them as found family.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has some appealing elements, such as the gorgeous cover art, diverse characters, and engaging audiobook narration, it ultimately falls short due to juvenile dialogue, dated cultural references, and inconsistent world-building.

            "The story centers on a diverse team of four idealistic yet jaded twenty-somethings who inadvertently find themselves in outer space, acquire superpowers, and save the galaxy. It’s an entertaining and light-hearted space adventure that feels more aligned with YA fiction, which enhanced my enjoyment of it. While the characters are a bit older than typical teens, there is a hint of maturity at the end that adds a touch of spice.",
            "The science in this book leans more towards science fantasy, which I appreciated as I'm not a hard sci-fi reader. The dialogue is abundant, and while I enjoyed the interactions between Cleo and Billie, the other crewmates felt somewhat interchangeable. Cleo and Billie have distinct personalities, and I particularly liked Billie as the love interest. The tone is very Gen Z, featuring language and references that may feel dated in the future, which seems counterintuitive for science fiction. Nevertheless, it's currently cute and relatable, appealing more to a younger audience.",
            "This book offers insightful commentary on capitalism and the pursuit of progress for its own sake. At its heart, however, it is a light-hearted space adventure that celebrates love and the triumph of community, where everyone emerges victorious.",
            "This book shines when approached with a light heart. It's an enjoyable, feel-good read that doesn’t take itself too seriously."

        "conclusion": "*The Stars Too Fondly* is a light-hearted, dialogue-heavy space adventure with a Gen Z vibe and a diverse cast of characters. While it might feel dated in the future and leans more toward science fantasy than hard sci-fi, it’s a fun, relatable read with important themes about capitalism and progress. It’s best enjoyed as a feel-good story where love triumphs and everyone lives.",

            "The romance element, particularly the relationship with the AI/hologram, felt uncomfortable and detracted from the overall story. Although there was a twist, it did little to alleviate this discomfort. The narrative would have benefited from omitting the romance subplot, which came across as unnecessary and poorly executed. Additionally, while the characters are meant to be in their late twenties or early thirties, they often behave, speak, and think like teenagers, undermining their credibility in roles such as a doctor or space expert. Furthermore, the shocking sex scene towards the end seemed forced and misaligned with the otherwise juvenile tone of the characters.",
            "The story takes place in 2060, yet constant references to TikTok, nostalgia for the 2020s, and mentions of old movies feel jarring in a sci-fi context. The absence of a genuine futuristic vision renders the setting unconvincing, particularly since 2060 is just around the corner from today."

It felt like the narrative kept insisting, \"Oh no, they really love each other, they're found family, really!\" without showing enough genuine connection or development to make it convincing.  \n\n- **Dialogue Quality:**  \n   - The dialogue often felt juvenile and off, which made it difficult for me to fully engage with the characters and their interactions.  \n\n- **Genre Execution (Science Fantasy):**  \n   - The book leaned heavily into Science Fantasy, but it wasn't executed in a way I found compelling. It didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Main Relationship Development:**  \n   - The main relationship felt sudden and lacked the depth or gradual buildup I was looking for.

            "The first half of the book centers on the heist of the Providence I spaceship, which vanished twenty years ago during its launch. In 2061, Cleo and her friends break into the facility housing the ship, inadvertently activating its dark matter engine and setting off on a journey to an exoplanet. The narrative alternates between Cleo's perspective and archived documents that shed light on the ship's past, but these flashbacks disrupt the overall flow. While the premise is intriguing, the pacing falters due to abrupt shifts, particularly in the ending, which features a rushed battle, an awkwardly inserted sex scene, and a sudden return to Earth. Furthermore, the story struggles with inconsistencies, especially in presenting the horrors of the failed launch while simultaneously igniting excitement for space exploration among a new generation of STEM graduates. Ultimately, while it offers an interesting premise, the execution leaves much to be desired.",
            "The story suffers from insufficient character development, relying heavily on dialogue which results in underdeveloped characters that are difficult to connect with. In the first half, Cleo takes center stage, while the latter half shifts to include more of Billie's perspective, leaving secondary characters like Abe and Ros underexplored. Additionally, the characters are in their late twenties, which clashes with the Young Adult tone of the book, making their behavior and dialogue feel misaligned. The romance between Cleo and the holographic Billie is notably underdeveloped; their relationship shifts from snarky banter to love far too abruptly, lacking emotional depth. Although the concept of a sentient hologram representing an uploaded brain raises intriguing questions about love and consciousness, these themes remain largely unexamined.",
            "Set in a desolate 2061, the story portrays a world on the brink of environmental collapse. However, the unchanged vernacular and cultural references create anachronisms that undermine the futuristic setting. Phrases like “dude, slow your roll” and allusions to '80s movie montages feel jarring, disrupting the immersion experience.",
            "This story delves into themes of love, progress, and the repercussions of unchecked ambition. However, these ideas remain underdeveloped, resulting in a disjointed narrative. Although the notion of love as a powerful force is introduced, it is insufficiently explored, especially concerning Cleo and Billie's relationship."

            "The story presents simplistic resolutions for a perfect happily-ever-after, which suits its sci-fi elements but falls short in terms of relational depth. By shying away from complex themes and genuine tragedy, the narrative opts for a safe, upbeat ending that ultimately feels unfulfilling.",
            "The interpersonal drama in the story feels overly simplistic, often resolved with apologies or reassurances of care. The central romance between Cleo and Billie begins with immature bickering, making it hard to accept them as mature adults, especially given Cleo's role as a spaceship captain. Their relationship lacks genuine tension and comes across as forced, particularly as it escalates to a love that supposedly transcends dimensions. Although Billie's connection with the hologram avatar is intriguing, the narrative glosses over deeper exploration and difficult choices. Additionally, the sex scenes are awkwardly positioned, neither fully erotic nor fade-to-black.",
            "The narrative voice carries a quippy, cinematic quality reminiscent of a Marvel movie, which may resonate with some readers but felt off-putting to me. The frequent pop culture references, like TikTok, disrupt immersion and contribute to a dated feel, detracting from the sci-fi atmosphere. Overall, the youthful tone seems better suited for a teenage or young adult audience.",
            "This story effectively blends accessible and enjoyable sci-fi concepts, striking a balance between intrigue and simplicity. The inciting incident is compelling, featuring an unguarded ship and the characters' passionate scientific curiosity that launches the narrative. The spaceship’s awakening and the cast's journey into space elevate the stakes and excitement. The central theme—what we are willing to sacrifice for humanity and progress—is thoughtfully explored through parallels to real-world issues like colonization and capitalism. Additionally, the almost-magical abilities exhibited by certain characters add a creative and engaging layer to the tale."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I enjoyed the book for its accessible and fun sci-fi concepts, but I found the characters and relationships less compelling. The narrative voice and tone felt young, and the story's tendency to simplify complex setups into easy resolutions was disappointing, especially in the context of the relationships. This book would be a good fit for readers who enjoy light, cinematic sci-fi with a happy ending, but those looking for deeper science or complex relationships may find it lacking.",

The narrative voice and tone felt young, and the story's tendency to simplify complex setups into easy resolutions was disappointing, especially in the context of the relationships. This book would be a good fit for readers who enjoy light, cinematic sci-fi with a happy ending, but those looking for deeper science or complex relationships may find it lacking.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Science Fiction Concepts: 8/10\n- Characters and Relationships: 5/10\n- Narrative Voice and Tone: 6/10\n- Ending and Resolution: 6/10\n- Overall Enjoyment: 7/10"

Additionally, the resolution of the romance felt hurried and unsatisfactory, leaving crucial questions about identity and love unanswered.",
            "The characters frequently responded to significant events with jokes and superficial solutions, missing emotional depth. The romance between Cleo and hologram Billie had promise but was ultimately mishandled, especially in its conclusion. The ending diminished hologram Billie’s individuality as she was replaced by the original, lacking a meaningful exploration of the ethical and emotional implications of this shift.",

The narrative rarely takes a moment to delve into the deeper meanings of events, ultimately diminishing its potential for thought-provoking storytelling.",

While the worldbuilding introduces fascinating concepts like sentient holograms and advanced spacecraft, these ideas are merely superficial and lack deeper exploration. Furthermore, key aspects, such as the unguarded spaceship and the absence of scientific curiosity regarding groundbreaking technology, undermine the story's believability.",

            "The beginning was somewhat challenging, as the audiobook reader's portrayal made it hard to keep track of characters, particularly with the frequent use of both first and last names. However, the foreshadowing was masterfully executed, revealing just enough information to maintain my engagement. The final section beautifully captures grief and fear, striking a perfect balance between family conflict and healing.",
            "This story excels in its diversity, providing meaningful representations of individuals who are often overlooked in media. However, the depiction of the trans woman's experience with HRT, especially regarding spironolactone, felt somewhat unrealistic and under-researched for long-term use. On the other hand, the portrayal of the hunger for touch and the awkwardness of navigating emotions was superb, evoking a profound sense of empathy.",
            "The destination planet's tidal locking and biome were beautifully woven into the narrative, complemented by vivid and captivating descriptions of the weather and landscape. However, the food printer concept would have benefited from a bit more elaboration regarding its processes and materials, as the notion of no-assembly-required food synthesis came across as implausible. The ship's preparation, especially the absence of a compounding station in the med bay, seemed to serve as a critique of the profit-driven company, yet it still fit well within the universe.",
            "This story offers a deep exploration of obsession, highlighting both its positive and negative facets. The subplot involving the other Billy is skillfully woven throughout, evoking a powerful sense of empathy. Overall, the narrative is comforting, enriching, and refreshing, with a satisfying resolution following the climactic battle.",

            "The rapid pacing of the story makes it difficult to connect with the characters or fully immerse oneself in the narrative. While this brisk pace lends the book a light, easily digestible quality, it ultimately sacrifices depth and memorability. The narrative evokes the charm of early 2000s teen rom-coms, enhanced by a refreshing level of diversity. It seems better suited for a Netflix adaptation than for a blockbuster sci-fi extravaganza.",
            "The characters come across as superficial and one-dimensional, each confined to a specific role with little room for growth. Emotional and romantic scenes often miss the mark, as I am told about the feelings rather than truly experiencing them. The most impactful character moments arise from logs, journal entries, and communicator messages, which, while limited, offer valuable insights into their personalities.",
            "This story radiates optimism, celebrating themes of found family and unbreakable friendships. Its light, feel-good tone makes it an excellent choice for readers who appreciate sci-fi with uplifting endings.",
            "The novel leans more towards the YA genre than adult sci-fi, despite its grad student characters. The tone, pacing, and character dynamics align more closely with a younger audience, suggesting that the roles and plot could easily accommodate late teens or early twenties characters. This misalignment may lead to mismatched expectations for readers anticipating adult sci-fi. The premise is fun and engaging, following four grad students who accidentally launch an abandoned spaceship and embark on a journey to the nearest star system. The plot weaves together several elements: solving the mystery of the failed mission, understanding why the ship launched, discovering their newfound superpowers, and exploring a romance between Cleo and Billie. While the fast pace makes for a quick read, it ultimately limits character development and emotional depth."

        "conclusion": "*The Stars Too Fondly* is a fun, fast-paced, and light sci-fi read with an optimistic tone and a focus on friendship and found-family themes. While it may be mis-marketed as adult sci-fi and suffers from superficial character development, it offers an enjoyable, if not particularly deep, experience. The story’s strengths lie in its engaging premise and moments of character insight through logs and messages. It’s a great choice for readers looking for a quick, feel-good summer read, especially those who enjoy YA-style stories with a sci-fi twist.",

The chat logs, in particular, suffer from uniformity; characters exhibit similar voices and humor, making it challenging to differentiate them without relying on pronouns. \n\nWhile the romance between Cleo and Billie is central to the plot, it falls short of the \"rom-com\" label, focusing more on their shipboard circumstances and Billie’s existence as a computer hologram.

            "The eerie mystery of the vanished crew from twenty years ago is skillfully woven into the narrative, with news articles and communications adding a sinister undertone. The tension between the \"disappeared\" Billie and her hologram counterpart creates a captivating dynamic. Although the ambitious plot occasionally feels drawn out, particularly towards the ending, it ultimately delivers a satisfying conclusion.",

Their relationships feel authentic and filled with care. Billie's grief over her lost fiancé, Neil, is a crucial facet of her character; her love for Cleo enhances—not diminishes—her past. \n\nThe romance is central, beautifully developed, and rich in emotional depth, emphasizing healing. Although Billie is a hologram and unable to physically touch Cleo, their chemistry is striking, creating palpable tension. The novel includes a well-written sex scene that is both satisfying and meaningful. \n\nOverall, the book excels in representation and thoughtfully incorporates LGBTQ+ identities. Small touches, like Kaleisha’s hormone provisions on the ship, add authenticity and demonstrate a commitment to detail within the narrative.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n   - The novel blends multiple genres: sci-fi with hard science elements, a touch of magic, romcom, and a deep exploration of loss and love.  \n   - It’s ultimately a romance, but with a strong emotional core about grief and moving forward.  \n   - The story also includes a mystery that’s eerie and unsettling, adding a layer of suspense.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - Cleo and Billie embody the grumpy/sunshine trope. Billie is a tough, no-nonsense hologram with a hard exterior, while Cleo is bright, curious, and uses humor as a coping mechanism.  \n   - Their love story is touching, with Cleo softening Billie and Billie pushing Cleo to face her fears.  \n   - The cast is diverse and well-represented, with characters like Abe (Asian), Kaleisha (Black trans woman), Rose (non-binary), Cleo (Black lesbian), and Billie (bi woman). Their relationships feel natural and full of care.  \n   - Billie’s grief over her lost fiancé, Neil, is a significant part of her character arc, and her love for Cleo doesn’t invalidate her past.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n   - The mystery of the vanished crew from twenty years ago is eerie and well-integrated, with news articles and comms adding a sinister tone.  \n   - The tension between the “disappeared” Billie and the hologram version creates a compelling dynamic.  \n   - The plot is ambitious and occasionally feels a bit long, especially in the ending, but it’s still satisfying.  \n\n- **Romance and Intimacy:**  \n   - The romance is central and beautifully developed, with emotional depth and a focus on healing.  \n   - Despite Billie being a hologram and unable to physically touch Cleo, their chemistry is intense and the tension is palpable.  \n   - There’s one full sex scene that’s well-written and satisfying.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n   - The novel excels in representation, with a diverse cast and thoughtful inclusion of LGBTQ+ identities.  \n   - Small details, like ensuring the ship has Kaleisha’s hormones, add authenticity and care to the narrative.  \n\n- **Writing and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The emotional themes of grief, love, and moving on are deeply moving and resonate strongly.  \n   - The balance between humor, romance, and heavier themes is well-executed, making the story both heartwarming and heartbreaking.  \n   - The science elements are accessible and serve the characters and plot without overwhelming the reader.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a bold, ambitious blend of sci-fi, romance, and mystery, with a deeply emotional core. The grumpy/sunshine dynamic between Cleo and Billie is beautifully written, and the diverse cast adds richness to the story. While the plot occasionally feels a bit long, the emotional payoff and the exploration of grief, love, and healing make it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Heat Index: 5/10  \n- Overall Rating: Highly recommended for fans of emotional, character-driven sci-fi romance."

            "The mystery plotline is a central focus of the story. However, the frequent time jumps leave me feeling as if I'm missing the character development that presumably occurred off-page.",
            "I really enjoyed the characters and found their development, including that of the antagonist, to be quite natural. While the romance was decent, I felt there weren't enough direct interactions between Cleo and Billie to justify their strong feelings for each other. The dialogue, while witty, often felt forced, and since it was the sole contributor to the comedic aspect of the rom-com, I found that part lacking.",
            "The inclusion of transcripts and text conversations added an engaging layer to the mystery, revealing key aspects in subtle ways. However, the writing can occasionally feel juvenile, particularly with repetitive sentence beginnings like \"And\" or \"But.\" That said, the book contains some truly beautiful lines, many of which I highlighted. It’s a highly readable work—both entertaining and concise. I typically read quickly, but I breezed through this one, making it a perfect companion during exam week.",

Two decades later, Cleo and her friends infiltrate the Providence to investigate, inadvertently activating the engine and embarking on their own journey to Proxima Centauri. The mystery unfolds gradually, revealing insights into the disappearance, the dark matter engine's implications, and broader themes of humanity. Any potential plot holes are effectively addressed, resulting in a satisfying narrative.",

It offers everything this book attempted but does it far more effectively.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some intriguing elements, such as the premise and the found family dynamic, it ultimately fell short for me.

            "The pacing is uneven, particularly at the beginning, where the transition from the mission to space and past Jupiter occurs too abruptly. This rapid progression feels unrealistic and disrupts the story's immersion.",
            "The romance in this story feels underdeveloped, primarily due to its heavy reliance on dialogue and a lack of internal character perspectives. The transition from dreaming about a character to falling in love seems abrupt and unearned. One of the love interests' lack of visible affection contributes to a one-sided relationship for much of the narrative. Additionally, the resolution of the love triangle is unsatisfying, especially Cleo's sudden shift of affection from the hologram of Billie to the real one. Billie's initial rudeness and snarkiness make her a largely unlikable character, as her humor comes off as more mean-spirited than entertaining.",
            "The book features a substantial amount of dialogue—approximately one-third of the text—making it challenging to follow the action due to insufficient prose. The conversations tend to be repetitive, mainly involving just five characters, which leads to a sense of monotony. Constant bickering among the group overshadows important tonal shifts during key moments. Additionally, the absence of internal monologue or insight into the characters' thoughts hampers emotional connection. The recurring reference to the antagonist's voice as \"rainbow voice\" appears unnecessary and could have been simplified for clarity.",

Her humor comes across as mean-spirited rather than fun.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The repeated use of \"rainbow voice\" to refer to the antagonist feels unnecessary and could have been simplified to \"the voice\" for clarity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a strong opening and intriguing world-building, it struggles with excessive dialogue, uneven pacing, and underdeveloped romance. The scientific elements feel inconsistent, and some characters, like Billie, are initially unlikable. The story has potential but is hindered by its execution in these areas.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance often felt unrealistic and faltered at times, especially upon Billie's return. However, it ultimately concluded on a satisfying note. Characters in their late 20s and early 30s came across as newly-minted teenagers, exhibiting amateurish dialogue and emotions. I had hoped the captain would offer a mature perspective, but instead, he joined in the unconvincing snarky banter. Overall, character introductions and dialogue seemed like mere information dumps from a character sheet, resulting in unlikable and immature portrayals.",
            "The writing style is accessible, but the plot lacks depth. The use of technical jargon often feels abrupt, unnecessary, and at times incorrect, which detracts from the sci-fi atmosphere. The story becomes more engaging when dark matter is approached as a new magic system rather than a scientific concept. While the writing shows improvement in the middle, it falters toward the end, particularly during the final fight, which is marred by cartoonish dialogue.",
            "The book would have benefited from being marketed as a YA sci-fantasy rather than an adult sci-fi novel. Its juvenile tone left me disappointed and failed to meet my expectations for a mature sci-fi story."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Stars Too Fondly* had a simplistic plot, unlikable and immature characters, and a juvenile tone that did not meet my expectations for an adult sci-fi novel. While the romance had a satisfying conclusion and the writing improved in the middle, the book was marred by poor narration, amateurish dialogue, and a lack of depth. It might be a tolerable read between more stimulating books, but it fell short of being a compelling or mature story.",

            "The resolution left me feeling unsatisfied. Given Earth's dire circumstances, I was left wondering about humanity's next steps. Could one conscious universe and a group of twenty-somethings realistically prevent a greedy, capitalistic society from colonizing other planets and harming that universe, especially when they hadn't even made an effort to save their own planet?",
            "The writing was lacking, relying heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly in Billie's flashbacks. The 27-year-old characters often felt more like college students, especially early on. At times, the narration came across as condescending, which was frustrating; for instance, when Billie states, \"I'm going to choose my words carefully,\" only to ramble for two paragraphs.",
            "I found this book utterly engrossing from start to finish. The allure of space exploration and its breathtaking beauty captivated me, particularly the intriguing exploration of the ship. While the book is a mixed bag, it consistently held my attention with its fascinating concepts. I hope the author continues to share such beautiful ideas in future works, as I’ll be eagerly awaiting them!",
            "Romance involving characters based on code isn’t likely to resonate with me. I constantly questioned the authenticity of holo-Billie’s feelings, especially with the real Billie still alive. The resolution between holo-Cleo and holo-Billie felt strange and undermined the relationship between real Cleo and holo-Billie. The romantic premise was awkward—falling in love with a copy before dating the real person seemed off. Although some moments of found family and romance felt a bit cliché, I still appreciated the bond among the characters."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a captivating yet flawed read, with a mix of fascinating ideas and uneven execution. While the romantic and character dynamics didn’t fully resonate with me, the exploration of space and futuristic concepts kept me engaged. The writing style and resolution left room for improvement, but the novel’s creativity and thought-provoking themes made it a memorable experience. I look forward to more from the author.",

            "The novel leans toward softer Sci-Fi, which may leave readers seeking detailed scientific explanations unsatisfied. The ending has a somewhat deus ex machina feel, as the concept of the Other Place lacks sufficient explanation. Set in the near future of 2061, the story unfolds after the tragic loss of the Providence I crew in 2041, which has made the world obsessive about STEM and wary of space exploration.

Fast forward to 2061, where a grown and highly intelligent Cleo plots to infiltrate Erebus Industries and investigate the spaceship.

            "The narrative style begins with a jarring mix of prose and mixed-media elements, reflecting one protagonist's holographic nature. This approach feels clunky at first, but becomes more enjoyable as the story unfolds. Initially, the use of multiple names for one character—ranging from formal to informal—can be overwhelming, but it becomes manageable over time. The book adeptly balances the central romance, sci-fi elements, and the mystery of the missing crew. Despite early prose issues, the fast-paced yet cozy storyline keeps me engaged with all plot threads. The conclusion successfully ties everything together in a satisfying manner.",
            "Cleo, the human protagonist, is a well-developed character driven by her obsession with space and the mystery of a missing crew. Her curiosity, fueled by a desire to escape the apocalyptic state of the world, often leads her into unforeseen trouble, adding depth to her motivations. Billie, the hologram of the missing ship's captain, serves as a fascinating counterpart, skillfully balancing Cleo's idealism with a dose of realism. Their dynamic is compelling; Cleo helps Billie let loose while Billie keeps Cleo grounded. Although the romance between them occasionally feels like instalove, they share many charming moments that make their relationship's development engaging. I found myself wholeheartedly rooting for their success.",
            "The world-building is subtle, set in a near-future space environment with details introduced only as necessary to the narrative.

The light world-building, well-developed characters, and balanced blend of romance, sci-fi, and mystery made for a fast-paced yet cozy experience. The satisfying conclusion and charming moments between Cleo and Billie left me thoroughly entertained. I highly recommend this book to fans of sapphic sci-fi romance.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**\n   - The narrative style was initially jarring due to its mix of prose and mixed-media elements, reflective of one protagonist being a hologram.\n   - The inclusion of mixed-media made for a clunky read at first, but it became more enjoyable as the story progressed.\n   - The use of multiple names for one character (from formal full name to nickname) was initially overwhelming but manageable over time.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**\n   - The world-building is light, set in a near-future space environment, with details conveyed only as relevant to the narrative.\n   - The story involves astrophysics but avoids being bogged down by technicalities, especially as the plot becomes more complex in deep space.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Cleo, the human protagonist, is well-developed, with her obsession with space and motivation to uncover the mystery of a missing crew serving as a driving force.\n   - Her curiosity leads to unforeseen trouble, and her psychological reasoning for her obsession (using it as a coping mechanism for the apocalyptic state of the world) adds depth to her character.\n   - Billie, the hologram of the missing ship’s captain, is an interesting counterpart to Cleo, balancing realism with Cleo’s idealism.\n   - Their dynamic is compelling, with Cleo helping Billie loosen up and Billie grounding Cleo.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The romance between Cleo and Billie felt slightly instalove-y at times, but they shared many cute moments.\n   - Their relationship development was engaging, and I found myself rooting for them to succeed.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The book balances the central romance, sci-fi elements, and the mystery of the missing crew effectively.\n   - Despite initial prose issues, the story is fast-paced yet cozy, keeping me invested in all plot threads.\n   - The conclusion ties everything together in a satisfying way.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - The book was a delightful and fun read, blending sapphic romance with sci-fi elements in a lighthearted way.\n   - I would recommend it to readers looking for a cozy, fast-paced sapphic sci-fi romance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite some initial challenges with the narrative style and structure, *The Stars Too Fondly* proved to be a delightful and engaging read. The light world-building, well-developed characters, and balanced blend of romance, sci-fi, and mystery made for a fast-paced yet cozy experience. The satisfying conclusion and charming moments between Cleo and Billie left me thoroughly entertained. I highly recommend this book to fans of sapphic sci-fi romance.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot reads more like a middle-grade adventure than an adult romance, with characters in their late twenties possessing PhDs behaving more like passive teenagers than mature adults. Their acceptance of a 14-year hiatus in their lives comes across as unrealistic and frustrating. The introduction of fantasy elements, including superpowers, feels random and poorly integrated into the narrative. Moreover, the characters never confront significant challenges or tough decisions; everything resolves too easily, making them seem like chosen ones without having to earn their outcomes.",

Additionally, the AI subplot featuring Billie and Cleo felt confusing and emotionally flat, leading to an absurd resolution involving the creation of a digital girlfriend for the AI.",

            "This story follows a group of queer young scientists on a quest to find a missing spaceship crew, seamlessly merging mystery and adventure. While the pacing may occasionally feel slow, it adds to the cozy atmosphere and is balanced by moments of tension and emotional depth. Although some plot twists are predictable, they do not significantly diminish the overall experience.",

While the main character Cleo and her romance with Billie, the ship's holographic captain, were initially difficult to connect with, their bond became more engaging by the story's conclusion. The side characters, Kal and Abe, are likable and evoke the charm of Elle and Tao from *Heartstopper*. Ros, with their mysterious and angsty demeanor, emerges as a favorite. Although the villain is well-crafted and effectively unlikable, their defeat feels somewhat anticlimactic, which is disappointing.",
            "The book beautifully examines found family, the perils of progress, and the resilience of queer relationships. It expertly balances lighthearted, cozy moments with deeper emotional currents, resulting in a satisfying and enriching read.",
            "This book is marketed as a sapphic rom-com and cozy sci-fi, but it offers more depth than these labels imply. Its slower pacing and single-setting focus bring a cozy vibe, yet the story is infused with significant angst and concludes in a way that transcends typical rom-com conventions. Additionally, some sci-fi elements venture into the realm of science fantasy, which may not resonate with readers looking for hard sci-fi."

            "The story opens with Cleo and her friends sneaking onto an abandoned spaceship, inadvertently awakening Billie, a holographic replica of the ship's captain, and launching into space. The combination of sci-fi adventure, interdimensional elements, and romance weaves together a captivating narrative.",

Their love story feels genuine and believable, even amidst the unique dynamic of Billie being a hologram while Cleo is more physically expressive. \n\nThe novel also thoughtfully addresses biphobia through Billie, who was previously engaged to a man but has primarily been in Sapphic relationships.

The earnestness and bombastic energy of 80’s sci-fi are present, making it a nostalgic yet fresh read.  \n\n- **Representation and Social Commentary:**  \n  - The novel addresses Biphobia through Billie’s character, who was previously engaged to a man but had mostly been in Sapphic relationships before.

Their connection grows as they learn more about each other, with Billie’s love for romcoms surprising Cleo, given her stern exterior. Cleo, in turn, helps Billie rediscover emotions she hadn’t felt since her fiancé’s death.

Hologram Billie deserves a more fitting conclusion. On a positive note, the length of the story is well-managed; it could have felt drawn out, but thankfully, it wasn't.",
            "The characters lack depth, primarily exuding “found family vibes.” I particularly struggled with Billie’s character, as her feelings for Cleo never come across authentically. It felt akin to placing two Barbies in a room and saying, “Now kiss!”—only to have one of them be a hologram. The side characters are forgettable, defined only by their powers (or lack thereof). The author excels more in establishing character chemistry than in developing the Sci-Fi elements. The romance feels like low-stakes insta-love.",

It’s really weird how Cleo just swaps one out for the other. Hologram Billie deserves better than whatever that was.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing style is very loose, lacking a true style.

It felt like someone putting two Barbies in a room and saying, “Now kiss!” … Or not kiss because one of you is a hologram?  \n   - None of the side characters are notable beyond their powers (or lack thereof).  \n\n- **Character Chemistry:**  \n   - The author seems to succeed most with character chemistry rather than the Sci-Fi elements.  \n\n- **Sci-Fi Elements:**  \n   - The Sci-Fi elements weren’t the major theme I wanted, and they felt barebones.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - The romance is low-stakes and feels like insta-love.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n   - The other place is a unique take, and I haven’t seen a more benevolent-leaning alien force since “Beyond the Aquila Rift.”  \n\n- **Villain and Morality:**  \n   - Even the villain had some okay ideas, just horrific execution. I appreciate that all the characters are genuinely doing what they think is right.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n   - The length is good; it could’ve easily been dragged out, but it wasn’t.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n    - I love the cover so much; it’s entirely the reason I picked this up. Good job to whoever designed it.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre Expectations:**  \n    - This is not a rom-com; nothing is funny in it, and it was depressing as hell at parts.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book has its strengths, particularly in character chemistry and a unique take on benevolent alien forces.

As the ship hurtles toward Proxima Centauri, the crew finds themselves unable to return.

Along the way, the story introduces unsettling new powers while delving into themes of dark matter and alternate dimensions.",

            "The insta-love between Billie and Cleo was hard to accept, even with the humorous nod to the galaxy's fastest U-Haul. The relationship felt unconvincing, particularly given that one character is an AI.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  I was initially intrigued by the plot: a group of friends trying to uncover the mystery of what happened to an entire crew of 200 people who disappeared during the launch to a new planet. It seemed like an easy queer Sci-Fi book to get into, and the characters appeared fun and approachable.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  I liked the spooky vibes of The Other Place at the start. It felt strange, ethereal, and frightening... at first.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I appreciated how the main characters were genuinely friends. They had conflicts and fought, but the love between them was palpable.  \n\n- **Characterization and Age Appropriateness:**  \n  The characters are supposed to be in their mid-to-late 20s, but they read as teenagers. Despite being portrayed as doctors, physicists, and incredibly intelligent scientists, they acted like high schoolers. Cleo, in particular, was the worst in this regard.  \n\n- **Cultural References and World-Building:**  \n  The characters' obsession with 2024 culture felt out of place for a book set in 2061. Additionally, the idea that we could develop the technology to send 200 people to a new solar system in just 20-40 years was hard to believe and took away from the immersion.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The insta-love between Billie and Cleo was hard to swallow. While the joke about \"the galaxy's fastest U-Haul\" made it slightly better, it still wasn't believable, especially with one of them being an AI.  \n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n  I want to forgive the faults because this is the author's debut novel. I look forward to future books by Hamilton and hope she takes the feedback from reviewers into consideration.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise and initial atmosphere were promising, the book fell short due to unrealistic character behavior, misplaced cultural references, and an unconvincing romance subplot. Despite these issues, I remain hopeful for the author's future work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars."

Twenty years ago, when its experimental drive was activated, the crew vanished, leaving the ship adrift. By accident, the friends reactivate the drive, setting the stage for adventure. The novel effectively combines space opera, survival thriller, and the \"hyperspace is full of monsters\" genre, creating a captivating narrative. A standout element is the sapphic romance between the heroine and the AI, aligning with the 2024 trend in sapphic sci-fi. However, the resolution of this romance feels lacking, slightly diminishing its overall impact.",

Long-standing friendships turn hostile, while the romance between the heroine and the ship's AI—embodying the personality of the previous captain—unfolds rapidly and passionately.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Suspension of Disbelief:**  \n  I’ve always enjoyed accidental adventure stories, and while I could easily suspend my disbelief for *We Didn’t Mean To Go To Sea*, the premise of *The Stars Too Fondly*—accidentally stealing a haunted spaceship—pushed my credibility. However, this setup serves as the foundation for a YA-adjacent space adventure.  \n\n- **Plot and Genre Blending:**  \n  The story revolves around four friends who break into the abandoned *Providence*, a ship meant to be humanity’s first voyage to another star. When its experimental drive was activated twenty years ago, the entire crew vanished, and the ship went nowhere. Now, the friends accidentally turn it on again. The novel skillfully blends elements of space opera, survival thriller, and the \"hyperspace is full of monsters\" genre, creating a winning combination.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Emotional Tone:**  \n  The characters, though in their mid-twenties, exhibit the emotional intensity typical of YA fiction. Long-term friendships become hostile, and the romance between the heroine and the ship’s AI (which has the personality of the previous captain) develops quickly and passionately. The antagonist’s actions are delightfully over-the-top, adding to the story’s dramatic flair.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The book maintains a breathless, gung-ho tone from the first page to the last. While it’s hard to take the story too seriously, it’s equally hard to resist getting swept up in its adventurous and romantic energy.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The sapphic romance between the heroine and the AI is a highlight, reflecting the 2024 trend of sapphic sci-fi. However, the resolution of this romance feels unsatisfactory, which detracts slightly from its impact.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Stars Too Fondly* is a fast-paced, genre-blending space adventure with a strong emotional core and a touch of romance. While its premise stretches believability and its tone leans into the absurd, it’s an enjoyable romp that’s hard to put down once you’re swept into its whirlwind of adventure and passion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The author utilizes an unconventional narrative structure that shifts between Cleo's perspective, archival documents, and an omniscient third-person point of view. This approach can be confusing at first, particularly since the third-person perspective often refers to characters by their last names, which complicates character recognition. However, as the story unfolds, these varying viewpoints enrich the narrative and deepen its development. The revelation of the omniscient perspective's identity is particularly well-executed, and the archival documents add an intriguing layer to the backstory. The central mystery is captivating, keeping me engaged as I sought to unravel it. While the romance leans slightly towards insta-love, it aligns well with the story's overall tone and purpose. Ultimately, the book is an enjoyable sci-fi space adventure that combines elements of mystery and romance.",
            "Cleo, the protagonist, initially comes off as annoying and immature, mirroring the theme of youthful folly since the story begins at age 22. However, as the narrative unfolds, I found myself growing fond of her character. Kaleisha and Ros also stood out, particularly in their journey to master their new powers. Additionally, Billie the hologram quickly became a favorite from her very first appearance.",

Initially, this was confusing, especially since the third-person perspective refers to characters by their last names, making it hard to keep track of the cast. However, as the story progresses, the different perspectives enhance the narrative development. The reveal of the omniscient perspective's identity is excellent, and the archival documents serve as an intriguing way to convey backstory.  \n\n- **Character Development and Authenticity:**  \n   - Cleo, the protagonist, comes across as annoying and immature at times, particularly in the early parts of the book. The interactions between the friends also feel immature, which aligns with the author's note about starting the story at age 22. However, I grew to like Cleo as the story progressed. Kaleisha and Ros, especially their journey to learn their new powers, were standout characters. Billie the hologram was an instant favorite from her first appearance.  \n\n- **Tone and Writing Style:**  \n   - The book initially reads as if it’s targeted at a younger audience, with heavy-handed exposition and a tone that feels more early-20s than late-20s. However, the writing style evolves, and the story becomes more engaging as it progresses.  \n\n- **Plot and Genre Elements:**  \n   - The central mystery is compelling and kept me invested in figuring it out. The romance leans slightly toward insta-love, but this fits the tone and purpose of the story. At its core, the book is a fun sci-fi space adventure with a mix of mystery and romance, making it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a fun and engaging sci-fi novel with a unique narrative structure that takes some getting used to but ultimately enhances the story.

The romance between Cleo and Billie, a computer-generated hologram of a real person, didn't resonate with me. While I understood why Cleo might fall for the hologram, I found it hard to accept that the hologram could genuinely have feelings for her. A significant plot development later made the romance feel even more uncomfortable. The ending, though a bit too convenient, still brought a smile to my face, so I wasn't overly bothered by it.",

It felt a bit too easy and perfect, with the other dimension taking them home, but I don’t completely hate it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some minor issues with dialogue clarity, scientific explanations, and the ending, I found this book to be a fun and enjoyable read.

            "The rom-com elements of the story didn’t resonate with me. Cleo and Billie’s relationship seems underdeveloped, relying too heavily on exposition rather than showing their connection. Additionally, the humor often feels forced, disrupting the narrative and lending an inauthentic, irreverent tone that falls flat.",
            "The characters are well-developed and enjoyable to read about, but their ages (27-30) feel inconsistent with their behavior. They often come across as more like 19-year-olds, which diminishes the overall narrative voice.",

The space odyssey elements were both intriguing and entertaining, enriched by compelling science and mystery components. I particularly enjoyed the multimedia narration, featuring chat logs and news articles, which added depth and dimension to the story."

I also appreciated the multi-media narration style, including chat logs and news articles, which added depth to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are well-developed and fun to read about.

Cleo and Billie's relationship feels underdeveloped, relying too much on \"tell\" rather than \"show\" moments. The humor feels forced and disrupts the plot, giving the narration an inauthentic and irreverent tone that doesn’t work well.  \n\n- **Narrative Voice and POVs:**  \n  Both points of view (POVs) are weak and rely too heavily on the suspense and mystery to stay engaging. The attempt at humor detracts from the overall quality of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the space odyssey elements of *In The Stars Too Fondly* were intriguing and well-executed, the rom-com aspect fell short due to underdeveloped relationships, forced humor, and a narrative voice that didn’t align with the characters' ages.

It took me some time to warm up to Cleo and her friends, but their supportive yet candid friendships truly formed the heart of the story. The diverse cast added a refreshing touch. The romance was charming, and the banter between Billie and Cleo was enjoyable. However, the comedic aspect of the \"rom-com\" fell flat for me, as it often takes a lot to make me laugh while reading.",

I feel like the characters acted fairly young throughout the book.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The rag-tag group of four gets stranded on a ship headed for another solar system with an AI hologram from the deceased former Captain.

            "The time setting was a significant issue for me. Set in the 2040s and 2060s, the story was marred by references from the '90s and contemporary times, which constantly pulled me out of the narrative. If the story is science fiction, there’s no reason it couldn’t have unfolded in the '90s with a spaceship taking off then, allowing for a more seamless integration of the historical context. The contrast between outdated references—such as Rubik’s Cubes, *Star Trek: Voyager*, and Sandra Bullock rom-coms—and modern ones like TikTok and LOLs within a futuristic timeline felt jarring and inconsistent.",
            "The characters seemed younger than their ages, which was jarring given that they were nearing the end of their postdocs and in their late twenties. Their behavior and interactions resembled those of high school or early college students. Additionally, the notion that they had maintained a relationship since high school through postgraduate studies felt unrealistic, as I don’t know anyone with such a lengthy relationship history.",

I don’t know how it was classified or marketed, so I can’t pinpoint the exact issue.  \n\n- **Time Setting and Consistency:**  \n   - The time setting was a major issue for me. The story is set in the 2040s and 2060s, but all the media references are from the '90s and contemporary times. This inconsistency was incredibly distracting and took me out of the story repeatedly.  \n   - If the story is science fiction, there was no reason it couldn’t have been set in the '90s with a spaceship taking off then.

Their dynamic is sweet, adorable, and easy to care for, making it believable that they could fall for each other.  \n\n- **Character Development (Supporting Characters):**  \n  The group of friends lacked distinct personalities, making them feel like the same character. Their behavior seemed indistinguishable, and they didn’t receive enough individual introduction or development, which made them feel more like plot devices than fully realized characters.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing aimed for a snappy and sarcastic tone but felt overdone. This stylistic choice detracted from the story and contributed to the lack of distinctiveness among the characters.  \n\n- **Potential for Improvement:**  \n  With stronger character building, particularly for the supporting cast, this book could easily become one of my favorite reads of the year.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story itself is compelling and emotionally resonant, the lack of distinct character development for the supporting cast and the overdone writing style held it back from reaching its full potential. Despite these flaws, the relationship between Cleo and Billie and the engaging plot make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The theme of found family was central to the story, emphasizing the importance of connection and belonging.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book leaned more toward a cozy rom-com in tone and content rather than a sci-fi romance. While the story had sci-fi elements, the science was sometimes confusing, and the introduction of unique character abilities shifted the narrative toward science fantasy.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was uneven due to the alternation between unfolding action, electronic messages, backstory passages in various formats, and a separate point of view that wasn’t clearly identified until partway through the story. This made it challenging to get into a consistent reading rhythm.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  The story was light and quirky, offering a unique blend of mystery, romance, and found family themes. While it had its flaws, it was an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a lighthearted, quirky blend of mystery, romance, and found family, with a tone that leans more toward cozy rom-com than sci-fi. While the pacing and structure could be improved, the intriguing mystery and heartfelt character dynamics make it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The emotional stakes were undermined by the abrupt replacement of HoloBillie with real Billie, diminishing the impact of HoloBillie’s loss. Additionally, the inclusion of a sex scene felt forced and unnecessary, seemingly included just because the author had been teasing the unfulfilled connection between HoloBillie and Cleo throughout the book. A fade-to-black approach would have been more satisfying, especially in light of Cleo’s dreams revealing that her visions of HoloBillie were actually glimpses of a future with real Billie.",

I saw my friends and our dynamic reflected in the characters—how we speak to each other, our endless looping references, and inside jokes. It was thoroughly charming, and I felt utterly charmed by it.  \n\n- **Use of Pop Culture References:**  \n  - I had a small frustration with the pop culture references, which is a common issue I have with futuristic media (like Star Trek). The references were heavily skewed toward media from 60-80 years before the story’s setting, with very few from closer to its timeline. This gently detracts from the sense of realism and can be a sticking point for some readers. For me, it’s mostly something I notice but doesn’t overly bother me. I understand the challenge of inventing future cultural references that carry the same weight and meaning for readers.  \n\n- **Expectations for Sci-Fantasy:**  \n  - Perfect realism isn’t what I seek in a sci-fantasy novel. What I look for includes:  \n    - Characters I like and connect with.  \n    - An interesting setting that teaches me something new.  \n    - Mild peril to keep the stakes engaging.  \n    - A satisfying ending.  \n    - A diverse, rainbow cast of characters.  \n    - Amusement and entertainment.  \n  - This book delivered on all these fronts and more.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  - I inhaled this book in a day, which speaks to how much I enjoyed it. It was highly engaging and entertaining, leaving me eager for more.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  - I hope Emily writes more books, as I thoroughly enjoyed her storytelling and would love to see more from her.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis queer sci-fantasy novel was a delightful, escapist read that charmed me with its relatable characters, engaging setting, and satisfying ending.

The story felt surface-level, and my high expectations for a deeper, more impactful narrative weren’t met.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Stars Too Fondly* had its moments of fun and inclusivity, it fell short in delivering the emotional depth and character development I had hoped for. The plot and character behavior felt unrealistic, and the story didn’t live up to the expectations set by its comparison to Becky Chambers' work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I recognize its potential appeal to other readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded up to 4 stars for the rating system)."

It sounded like something I’d enjoy, so I decided to give it a try.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The first third of the book was a slog. It felt overly info-dumpy, and the 3rd person narrator kept breaking up the story, which was extremely disruptive. The pacing was off, and I honestly didn’t have a clue what was going on.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were completely flat at the beginning and had no chemistry. However, as the story progressed, they started to feel a little more formed, though they still weren’t fully three-dimensional. The relationships between the characters were sweet and added some depth.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery was intriguing, but I saw most of the plot twists coming from early on. Despite this, the story picked up nicely in the latter parts, making it easy and quick to read.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the rocky start, the book improved significantly. It’s a fun debut novel, and I can see potential for the author. I’m interested in reading more of their work in the future.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a rough beginning with poor pacing and flat characters, but it improved as the story progressed.

Readers who approach it with the right expectations will likely find it enjoyable, though it's not a typical adult space opera.

However, it feels more like a Young Adult (YA) work than an adult one; the characters, their dialogue, and interactions come across as youthful.

While it leans more toward YA in tone and character dynamics, it’s a fun read as long as you adjust your expectations for an adult space opera.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They weren’t trying to steal a spaceship; it just sort of happened. The four friends were an incredibly diverse group of characters—one trans, one ace, one lesbian, and most (if not all) people of color. It was a study in what diversity can and should look like in literature.  \n\n- **Plot and Sci-Fi Elements:**  \n  The sci-fi story was well-executed. The premise revolves around a brand-new ship running on a new dark matter engine. Twenty years ago, all the people on the ship disappeared at the time of launch, and nobody knows what happened to them. This group of highly skilled twenty-somethings decides to figure it out. When they break into the closed facility, the dark matter engine suddenly starts up, launching them into space. They are joined by a holo of the captain of the original ship, Billie. However, she’s not just a holo—she had uploaded her consciousness to the ship in the days before the launch. But why?  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  Told in a dual timeline, this book is an exploration of identity, what we are willing to do to help others and ourselves, an examination of the complexity of interpersonal relationships, and learning to trust yourself when it matters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of diverse characters, a gripping sci-fi plot, and profound themes that explore identity, relationships, and self-trust.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  I love love love the premise of this book. The idea of a dark space energy source and its ramifications, including the larger commentary on \"haves\" and \"have nots,\" was fascinating. I also really enjoyed the concept of qualified civilians being part of the Providence I crew—it felt like the kind of space mission I would end up on.  \n\n- **Characterization and Diversity:**  \n  The diversity of the main characters was a highlight for me. I appreciated how much they loved their respective fields, which added depth and relatability to their personalities.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre:**  \n  I would describe this as cozy sci-fi. The stakes are not super high, and it’s mostly just a great adventure. If you enjoy the cozy fantasy/sci-fi genre, this would be a fun read for you.  \n\n- **Pacing and Conflict:**  \n  The book felt a bit \"wish fulfillment\"-y, especially in the middle. I would have liked a little more conflict and a little less quick resolution of issues. While I enjoyed the adventure, I’m not sure the story delivered to the extent of what I hoped it would.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a cozy and enjoyable sci-fi read with a strong premise, diverse characters, and an engaging adventure. While it leans into wish fulfillment and lacks high stakes, it’s a fun choice for fans of the cozy sci-fi genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

However, the execution falls short of its potential.  \n\n- **Genre and World-Building:**  \n  The novel struggles to fit into the science fiction genre. The SF elements lack coherence and are poorly explained, making it difficult to take them seriously.  \n\n- **Character Development and Behavior:**  \n  The characters behave in a way that feels inconsistent with their age and qualifications.

The novel offers great representation and introduces some intriguing ideas about dark matter, which I found particularly cool.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its whimsical tone and the need to suspend disbelief for certain elements, the novel is a charming and enjoyable read.

            "The plot was convoluted, straddling the line between science fiction and fantasy without fully committing to either, and it relied too much on convenient plot devices. As the story unfolded, it lost its entertainment value, particularly near the climax, where the stakes felt minimal. Both the main plot and the final subplot were resolved in an unsatisfyingly superficial and unoriginal way. The numerous inter-dimensional conveniences, including the resolution of the romance, felt forced and left much to be desired.",

While the rest of the crew was engaging, Abe lacked character development and came across as one-dimensional, defined only by his \"caring\" nature. In contrast, Elijah felt more vibrant and fully realized. I initially enjoyed the romance, as the connection, mature communication, and growth felt authentic. However, it ultimately unraveled in a way that left me unsatisfied, particularly due to the unconventional resolution.",

This shift happened too quickly, without sufficient reflection or exploration of her complicated feelings.  \n\n- **Romance and Representation:**  \n  - The LGBTQ+ romance was a highlight, with a nicely slow-burning development that added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - The book was great fun to read, despite its flaws.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has some shortcomings in character development and conflict resolution, it remains an enjoyable read with a strong found-family dynamic and a well-paced LGBTQ+ romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

The narrator’s use of child-like voices for multiple characters didn’t align well with the story for me.  \n   - Despite this, I still appreciated the story and characters overall and would consider rereading the book in physical format in the future.\n\n- **Romance Subgenre and Plot:**  \n   - I love the niche subgenre of romance where the main characters cannot touch each other but deeply desire to, especially when one character isn’t physically present in the same moment.  \n   - The romance between Cleo and Billie was adorable, and I enjoyed watching their connection develop. The story was more than just romance, but the romantic elements were a highlight.\n\n- **Sci-Fi Elements:**  \n   - I enjoy books set in space, even though I don’t always understand the technical details. For me, it’s not necessary to grasp every detail; I’m more interested in the characters and their adventures.  \n   - The sci-fi aspects added a fun layer to the story, and I loved following the group of best friends as they embarked on their escapades.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n   - The found family aspect was executed perfectly, and the exploration of actual family dynamics was touching.  \n   - The book addressed serious topics like parental abandonment and grief with care, and the diverse cast of characters was a joy to see.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - This was a lovely read, and I’m glad I picked it up. I plan to buy a physical copy for my shelves and can’t wait to recommend it to others.  \n   - Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review an advanced copy. All thoughts and opinions are my own.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the audiobook narration didn’t fully work for me, the story itself was a delightful blend of romance, sci-fi, and heartfelt themes.

However, many plot points felt underdeveloped and more like a backdrop for a quirky friend group and a hologram-centric romance than a genuine, high-stakes mystery and survival narrative.",

The Stars Too Fondly is a very light space adventure, which is great if you, like me, can't focus long enough to get through the technobabble of space operas but still enjoy spaceships.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The primary plot point throughout, beyond the powers and the romance, is really the mystery, and I enjoyed following that thread. However, a lot of the plot simply doesn't pan out or feel like it was thought out. It feels more like a backdrop to a meme-tastic friend group and a hologram-based romance than a true, high-stakes mystery and survival plot.  \n\n- **Narration and Tone:**  \n  I loved the fourth-wall-breaking narration that sort of leads you through the story while giving it an unworldly, yet tonally consistent, snarky vibe. The tone is not always taken seriously, which aligns with the overall light and fluffy feel of the book.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was way too quick to start for me to have even begun caring about it. It felt like too much of the focus, leaving little attention for the quest at hand, which wasn’t enough to keep me hooked.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**  \n  While I appreciated the light space adventure vibes, it was just too light and fluffy. Nothing feels like a real obstacle, and the tension is very firmly temporary and not to be worried about.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Stars Too Fondly is a light, fun space adventure with a cute concept involving holograms and superpowers.

While it may lack the high-stakes action some readers crave, its slow-burn romance, pop culture references, and themes of family make it a compelling read for YA and NA audiences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
