            "The story centers on Shelley Woodhouse, who awakens from a coma convinced that her husband attempted to kill her. The narrative unfolds in a dual timeline, exploring her life from childhood to the incident that resulted in her hospitalization. While I anticipated the plot twists early on, I found it engaging to watch Shelley uncover the truth and come to terms with the possibility of a happy future.",
            "The characters are exceptionally well-developed, including the side characters. Granny Rose particularly stood out to me—feisty, strong, and loving, she reminded me of my own grandmother. Dee, Shelley's best friend, was another highlight; always supportive and helpful, she embodied the ideal best friend everyone should have.",
            "The author's works, particularly *The Day Shelley Woodhouse Woke Up*, consistently resonate with me. She addresses significant and challenging topics with realism and sensitivity. This novel delves into domestic abuse and its generational effects, illustrating how Shelley's life reflects her mother's struggles.",
            "Reading about a character who shares my name, spelling, and nickname was a surreal experience that added a unique, if slightly eerie, dimension to the story.",
            "The story captivated me, and I appreciated Shelley's journey of self-discovery and empowerment."

She tackles important, tough topics in a realistic and sensitive manner.\n   - The novel explores themes of domestic abuse and its generational impact, showing how Shelley's life mirrors her mother's experiences.\n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**\n   - The story follows Shelley Woodhouse, who wakes from a coma believing her husband tried to kill her. The dual timeline traces her life from childhood to the event that led to her hospitalization.\n   - I figured out the plot twists early on, but I didn’t mind because I enjoyed watching Shelley piece together the truth and realize her life could still be happy.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters are exceptionally well-drawn, including the side characters. Granny Rose, in particular, stood out to me—she was feisty, helpful, strong, and loving, reminding me of my own grandmother.\n   - Dee, Shelley's best friend, was another standout character. She was always supportive, helpful, and in Shelley's corner, embodying the kind of best friend everyone should have.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**\n   - The story kept me engaged, and I found satisfaction in Shelley's journey of self-discovery and empowerment.\n\n- **Inconsistencies and Criticisms:**\n   - Two minor issues affected my reading experience. First, there was a timeline inconsistency regarding Dee moving out of the flat when she got pregnant but later being described as just having had the baby before taking over the pub.\n   - Second, the hospital not knowing Shelley was pregnant seemed unrealistic. According to the National Institutes of Health, routine pregnancy tests are standard for women of childbearing age upon hospital admission.\n\n- **Personal Connection:**\n   - It was surreal reading about a character with the same name, spelling, and nickname as me. It added a unique, albeit slightly eerie, layer to my reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *The Day Shelley Woodhouse Woke Up* is a heartfelt and engaging novel that tackles difficult themes with sensitivity. While I noticed a couple of inconsistencies, they didn’t overshadow my enjoyment of the story or my appreciation for the well-developed characters. Laura Pearson’s ability to craft emotionally resonant narratives continues to impress me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- The review implies a high rating, likely 4 or 4.5 stars, with minor deductions for the noted inconsistencies."

            "The story follows Shelley, a woman awakening from a coma to find inconsistencies in her memories. It alternates between past and present timelines, providing a dual perspective on her life. While the plot is predictable and adheres closely to the women’s fiction formula, it does offer some thought-provoking moments as it explores how Shelley’s past shapes her present. The ending, though hopeful, feels somewhat unrealistic, and while it includes minor surprises, one key reveal stretches credibility. Overall, the twists are easily anticipated, but the dual timelines effectively enhance the narrative.",
            "Shelley serves as an unreliable narrator due to her memory loss from a coma, which restricts the reader's understanding of the story. However, the writing cleverly offers clues about the missing information. The female characters, including Shelley, her best friend Dee, and her mother, are well-developed and complex. In contrast, the male characters lack depth, often depicted as either wholly good or bad. Additionally, Shelley's role as a pub landlady adds a unique and refreshing dimension to her character.",

The tone strikes a balance between despair and hope, steering clear of a forced happily-ever-after ending. While the cover may suggest a light read, the content is emotionally profound and impactful.",

The storytelling felt disjointed and lacked the emotional depth and clarity I had hoped for.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a significant disappointment, failing to deliver a compelling or coherent narrative. The lack of pivotal moments, poorly integrated themes, and confusing structure made it difficult to engage with the story. While I may be in the minority with my opinion, I found it hard to connect with or appreciate this book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars."

It was frustrating to see the story contort itself to keep her from seeking answers. Her insistence that the hospital staff remain silent felt implausible and became a significant distraction. I couldn't help but wonder why they didn't speak up or why she didn't directly inquire about her situation.",

            "This book explores the theme of abusive relationships, a subject I usually find unappealing. While I recognize that these situations are real, they are foreign to my own experiences. Although I have faced challenges, I have never been in a vulnerable position like the protagonist, Shelley. The depiction of abuse is nuanced, addressing controlling behavior, financial manipulation, and gaslighting before culminating in physical violence. Shelley is portrayed as a strong yet vulnerable woman, making her somewhat relatable, though I couldn't fully identify with her.",
            "I found the book engaging, though I hesitate to say I \"enjoyed\" it in the traditional sense due to its heavy subject matter. Domestic violence is a difficult topic, and while I don't typically seek it out in my reading, I'm glad I read this book. It tells an important story, and the author's skillful storytelling made the experience worthwhile.",
            "I picked this book based on its captivating cover, and Amazon's recommendation did not disappoint. The story follows a young woman awakening from a coma as she navigates her memories and uncovers how she ended up in that state. The writing is excellent, and I was quickly engrossed, finishing it in no time. Although I hadn't read any of the author's previous works, I'm now eager to explore more of their writing in the future."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Impression and Engagement:**  \n  I chose the book because of its cover, and Amazon’s recommendation was spot-on. The story revolves around a young woman who wakes up from a coma and explores her memories and how she ended up in that state. It was very well-written, and I found myself quickly engrossed, finishing it in no time. I hadn’t read any of the author’s books before, but I’m likely to pick up another one in the future.  \n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n  The book delves into the topic of abusive relationships, which is not a theme I typically enjoy. While I understand that such situations are a reality, they are alien to my personal experiences. I’ve faced tough times but never found myself in a position of vulnerability like the protagonist, Shelley. The portrayal of abuse in the book is nuanced, highlighting controlling behavior, financial abuse, and gaslighting before escalating to physical violence. Shelley, despite being a strong woman, is also vulnerable, which made her relatable in some ways, though I couldn’t fully identify with her.  \n\n- **Character Development and Empathy:**  \n  Shelley is a well-crafted character—strong yet vulnerable. I empathized with her struggles and rooted for her throughout the story. Her journey from staying in an abusive relationship to finally breaking free was compelling, even if the subject matter was difficult to digest.  \n\n- **Author’s Handling of Sensitive Topics:**  \n  The author handled the topic of domestic violence with sensitivity and care. It’s clear that she did thorough research into the subject, which added depth and authenticity to the narrative. While the theme is heavy, the book maintains a positive outlook, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I liked the book and found it engaging, though I wouldn’t say I “enjoyed” it in the traditional sense due to the heavy subject matter. Domestic violence is a challenging topic, and while I don’t seek it out in my reading, I’m glad I read this book. It’s an important story, and the author’s skillful storytelling made it worthwhile.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book is a well-written exploration of a difficult but important topic. While the theme of abusive relationships isn’t something I typically gravitate toward, the author’s sensitive and thoughtful handling of the subject, combined with a strong and relatable protagonist, made it a compelling read.

It is sensitively written but doesn’t shy away from the ugliness of these topics. The story is a mix of contrasts—beautiful yet tragic, warm-hearted yet chilling, showcasing both the best and worst of people.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Shelley, the protagonist, is introduced as she wakes from a coma, disoriented and gradually piecing together her memories. Through disjointed fragments of her past, we see how her early life shaped her as an adult. Her experiences with domestic abuse and coercive control are portrayed with depth and realism.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story unfolds through snapshots of Shelley’s life, blending her present struggles with her past trauma. This fragmented approach mirrors her memory loss and adds to the emotional impact of the narrative.  \n\n- **Message and Impact:**  \n  Ultimately, the book is about love, courage, hope, and recognizing one’s self-worth. It highlights the cyclical nature of abuse while offering a message of resilience and empowerment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLaura Pearson’s *The Day Shelley Woodhouse Woke Up* is a powerful and emotionally charged novel that tackles difficult themes with sensitivity and honesty. It is a story of contrasts—both heartbreaking and uplifting—that leaves a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

            "The story centers on Shelley, who awakens from a coma with fragmented memories. Convinced that her abusive husband pushed her down the stairs, she believes he should be arrested, but the hospital staff dismisses her claims. The narrative unfolds in two timelines: the present, where Shelley is in recovery, and the past, which uncovers the events leading to her coma.",

During her hospital stay, she encounters a visitor—a man she instinctively trusts. The narrative delves into Shelley's painful history of domestic abuse, first from her mother's boyfriend and later from her own husband, prompting the critical question: can she break the cycle and confront the truth of her past?",
            "This book delves into the weighty themes of domestic abuse and trauma, crafting a tense and emotionally charged narrative. The dual timelines enhance suspense and add depth to Shelley’s character and her challenges.",

It felt like a reach for the main character to make those disparaging comments. Authors should leave their political agendas out of their stories unless the book’s purpose is centered around politics.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book contains some profanity, spousal and child abuse, attempted murder, and amnesia. If you are or were a victim of domestic abuse, this can be a hard read. My own experience with domestic abuse ended 36 years ago, and I’ve built a completely different life since then. However, this book brought me right back to the chaos and pain of that time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the challenging subject matter and the inclusion of a personal pet peeve regarding political commentary, the author’s compelling writing made this a worthwhile read.

            "I absolutely loved how this book was written, finding out things at the same time as Shelley, although most of the time I did catch on to things before they were revealed. I have a feeling this might have been the intention of the author, but it was still a great read. My one little niggle (and I know this is supposed to be a feel-good story, and I’m glad it had a happy ending) is that realistically, the hospital would have found out she was pregnant or it was likely she would miscarry in a car accident. However, I’m trying to overlook this because the story as a whole was wonderful. ",

This didn't disappoint: a carefully written, slowly-discovered story of friendship that endures and marriages that don't.  \n\n- **Character Development (Shelley's Story):**  \n  Shelley's tale of domestic abuse and her recovery (and triumph over) from it was particularly effective. I was invested in the allies, friends, and loves she made along the way.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel beautifully underlines the fact that we're not alone, we don't have to become who and what our parents are, and that we're much stronger than we think.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Impact:**  \n  The story is uplifting and positive, making it a really affirming read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a carefully crafted, emotionally resonant story that explores enduring friendships, the challenges of marriage, and the strength to overcome adversity. It delivers powerful messages of hope and self-discovery, leaving the reader feeling uplifted and affirmed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

My only criticism is that Shelley bounced back to her previous life much faster than would be realistic for someone recovering from a coma.

            "The book had numerous continuity errors that made the story hard to believe. For example, Shelley suffers two bouts of being in a coma, which felt unrealistic and unnecessary. Additionally, the situation with Shelley’s mom being gagged and tied up for three days, then escaping to a neighbor’s house without anyone noticing her condition, was implausible. The hospital staff’s lack of awareness of her injuries (no marks on her wrists or mouth, no signs of dehydration or starvation) was frustrating and unrealistic. The story felt rushed and overly complicated with its back-and-forth timelines. I would have preferred a more streamlined narrative, focusing on the present timeline and ensuring the story’s plausibility. The constant shifting detracted from the overall enjoyment and made the plot feel disjointed. "

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Continuity and Plot Consistency:**  \n  The book had numerous continuity errors that made the story hard to believe. For example, Shelley suffers two bouts of being in a coma, which felt unrealistic and unnecessary. Additionally, the situation with Shelley’s mom being gagged and tied up for three days, then escaping to a neighbor’s house without anyone noticing her condition, was implausible. The hospital staff’s lack of awareness of her injuries (no marks on her wrists or mouth, no signs of dehydration or starvation) was frustrating and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Medical Plausibility:**  \n  The medical aspects of the story were poorly researched or executed. Shelley’s severe car crash, which resulted in a brain bleed, should have led to the discovery of her pregnancy during her hospital stay. The fact that this was overlooked by medical professionals was another glaring inconsistency.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story felt rushed and overly complicated with its back-and-forth timelines. I would have preferred a more streamlined narrative, focusing on the present timeline and ensuring the story’s plausibility. The constant shifting detracted from the overall enjoyment and made the plot feel disjointed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I loved *The Last List of Mabel Beaumont*, this book fell short of my expectations. The numerous continuity errors, unrealistic scenarios, and lack of medical plausibility made it hard to stay engaged. The story would have benefited from a more focused and believable narrative structure.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
