        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - The book is very fast-paced, with the progression from Charlotte and Wes’ first meeting to their first kiss happening too quickly.  \n   - The lack of tension or angst between the characters made their connection feel unnatural and predictable.  \n   - The plot felt rushed and repetitive, with a \"telling rather than showing\" approach that hindered believability.  \n\n- **Character Development and Consistency:**  \n   - The personalities of the characters were explicitly stated but not reflected through their actions or behaviors.  \n   - Wes is described as a player who sleeps around a lot, but his actions in the story portray him as kind and down-to-earth, creating a disconnect.  \n   - Charlotte is said to be quick-witted and observant, but these traits are not demonstrated in her behavior, making her character feel inconsistent.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n   - The dialogue felt stereotypical and included cringy lines, which detracted from the overall reading experience.  \n   - The writing style relied heavily on exposition, which made the story feel less immersive and engaging.  \n\n- **Believability and Coherence:**  \n   - The lack of believable character development and inconsistent traits made it difficult to form a connection with the story.  \n   - The plot felt incoherent due to the gaps and flaws in character portrayal, making it hard to stay invested.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Written In Ice* had potential, its fast-paced and predictable plot, inconsistent character development, and reliance on exposition rather than action made it difficult to enjoy. The disconnect between the characters' described traits and their actual behaviors further hindered my ability to connect with the story. Despite my efforts to push through, I ultimately decided not to finish the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n🌶️🌶️ (2/5 for spice level, though the overall experience was disappointing)."

She relocates to Orchid City with her grandmother and meets Weston Cole, a hockey player who becomes her muse.

            "Wes and Charlotte share excellent chemistry as a couple, and the grandmothers bring delightful humor—I would have loved to see more of them, as their dynamic added charm to the story. The representation of neurodiversity and authentic inclusion of hockey superstitions were both commendable. It was a fun surprise to have Ballsy from Nico's book appear. Additionally, I appreciated the unique twist of having the man take on the role of the muse instead of the traditional setup.",

The overuse of \"as\" and the repetitive \"and\" made reading tedious. Additionally, the dialogue often felt too formal, reminiscent of regency romance. While there are some brilliant lines, such as “the sound of my name rolling off his tongue like it was exactly where it belonged” and “I hated love, but I loved the thought of it,” they are overshadowed by awkward phrasing, like “Wes turned to me as he held his hand out to me” and “her hair that was wet from the saltwater.” Simplifying sentences (e.g., \"Her wet hair made me anxious\" or just \"said\") would greatly enhance the flow. Incorporating a few more commas would also be beneficial.",

Weston Cole is incredibly attractive and charming but avoids relationships and commitments. I appreciated the character development of both Charlotte and Wes, particularly Charlotte. Wes not only exudes charm and good looks but also possesses a big heart that he openly shares with those he cares about. The chemistry between Charlotte and Wes is palpable. I enjoyed how supportive Wes is of Charlotte, regardless of the circumstances surrounding their initial agreement.

The rushed pacing, underdeveloped characters, and unresolved plot points made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the story. While it had its moments, it didn’t live up to my expectations, especially after enjoying *The Tides Between Us*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice Level: 2 peppers out of 5."

Single Wes. 5th wheel Wes. Where is Charlie? If this story takes place *before* *TTBU*, then Charlie should have been there.  \n\n- **Character Development and Story Arcs:**  \n  I’m also wondering about Adrian's and the bartender's story. It’s been hinted at in these three books, but we’re still waiting for it to unfold. If the next book is about Mac, then we’ll still be waiting. Why? Mac is not a main character, but Adrian has a thread that runs through all three books so far.  \n\n- **Author Engagement:**  \n  Maybe the author will see this and comment on these points.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the book and its connection to *MMITPB*, the timeline inconsistencies and unresolved character arcs, particularly Adrian's, left me with questions.

            "I struggled to believe in the romance between Charlotte and Wes. While the narrative claims they share a comfortable relationship, we rarely witness their conversations, and when they do speak, it's mostly small talk rather than meaningful exchanges that foster a deeper connection. The epilogue, which focuses solely on a sex scene, felt jarring and left me viewing their relationship as purely physical, lacking the emotional depth of a loving partnership. Trust-building seems absent, rendering their bond underdeveloped, and I found myself lacking any real feelings for the characters. \n\nWes appears to be genuinely in love, while Charlotte's feelings seem superficial; she likes him, but it doesn't come across as true love. Her character feels one-dimensional, largely defined by her past trauma of being cheated on. The strong-woman trope becomes exhausting, suggesting she can't possess a happy romantic relationship without being perceived as weak. In contrast, Wes has more depth and complexity. Although he fits the cliché of the male main character, his clarity about his feelings and intentions keeps him engaging.",

It’s tiring to see the \"strong-woman\" trope where she can’t have a happy romantic relationship without being perceived as weak.  \n   - Wes, on the other hand, has more depth and color as a character. He’s a cliché male main character (MMC), but he doesn’t tire me because he’s clear about his feelings and intentions.  \n\n- **Romantic Development and Relationship Building:**  \n   - I didn’t see Charlotte and Wes falling in love. The narrative often mentions that they \"talk comfortably about everything,\" but we rarely see these conversations. When they do talk, it’s more small talk than meaningful dialogue, so they don’t truly get to know each other.  \n   - The epilogue focuses solely on a sex scene, which felt jarring. I couldn’t see them as a couple, only as having a sexual connection. A loving relationship involves more than just physical intimacy.  \n   - There’s a lack of trust-building between them, which makes their relationship feel underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - The writing is simple, which made it an easy read, but it lacked emotional depth and complexity.  \n   - Despite its simplicity, I still liked the story and the characters overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was a simple and enjoyable read, it fell short in developing the characters and their romantic relationship.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Chemistry:** The characters have that “can’t stay away” chemistry. They’re cute, they’re steamy, and the best part? There’s no third act breakup.  \n- **Genre and Series Appeal:** I would recommend the Orchard City series if you are interested in the sports romance genre. While the MMC of the first and third book was a hockey player, the second book centered around a professional surfer.  \n- **Female Leads:** Every female lead that Cali Melle writes is strong and has her own thing going on, aka, she's not waiting to be rescued.  \n- **Plot and Setting:** Without giving any spoilers, *Written in Ice* is a story of an author who’s been requested to switch up her genres and lean into romance writing, leaving her with writer's block. A hockey player who’s sole focus is on the game and what it takes to win, even if people might find his superstitions silly. And two meddling grandmas. This all takes place in the picturesque backdrop of Orchid City, a beachside town in Florida.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Orchard City series, particularly *Written in Ice*, offers a delightful mix of strong characters, engaging chemistry, and a charming setting. The absence of a third act breakup and the focus on independent female leads make it a standout in the sports romance genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"
