Devlin, her older love interest, carries a complicated history with Eriu—he’s 17 years her senior and wants to protect her from his troubled past.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  - *Ruthless Savage* is the first book in Lilian Harris' new Irish mafia series, featuring an angsty romance between a mafia princess, Eriu, and her bodyguard, Devlin.  \n  - The story revolves around Eriu's love for Devlin, who struggles with guilt over his brother's death and fears putting her in danger due to his dangerous past.  \n  - Eriu faces an arranged marriage to a creepy man, leading her to make risky decisions with major consequences.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Devlin is portrayed as a super alpha male with a protective, \"touch her and die\" attitude, yet he shows sweet and tender moments with Eriu.  \n  - Eriu is sweet and innocent but makes reckless decisions, often coming off as TSTL (too stupid to live), which can be frustrating.  \n  - The mutual pining and intense connection between the two characters are well-developed and engaging.  \n\n- **Romantic and Emotional Dynamics:**  \n  - The romance is filled with angst, mutual longing, and a strong emotional connection.  \n  - The intimate scenes are described as hot and passionate, adding to the intensity of their relationship.  \n\n- **World-Building and Supporting Characters:**  \n  - The introduction of a Russian mafia character is intriguing, and I hope he gets his own series.  \n  - The Irish mafia setting provides a compelling backdrop for the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  - This is my first book by Lilian Harris, and I found the writing engaging and the pacing well-balanced.  \n  - The story kept me hooked, and I’m eager to continue with the series and explore more of the author’s backlist.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Ruthless Savage* is a captivating bodyguard romance with a perfect blend of angst, passion, and danger. While Eriu’s reckless decisions were frustrating at times, her sweetness and Devlin’s protective yet tender nature made the characters likable. The intense connection between the leads and the intriguing mafia world-building left me eager for more. This is one of the best bodyguard romances I’ve read in a long time.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 Stars 🌶🌶🌶🌶"

            "I was pleasantly surprised by this arc. Typically, I don't have high expectations, but this one exceeded them! I'm eager to continue, which speaks volumes. The reveal of the main villain was unexpected, and I genuinely hope that character plays a role in the upcoming books.",
            "From the very first chapter, both the main male character (MMC) and the main female character (MFC) are clearly infatuated with each other, which I found refreshing in a romance story. There's no unnecessary game-playing, and while the mob setting includes violence, the relationship between the characters is impressively healthy, earning a solid five stars for communication. I particularly enjoyed Eriu's father; it was a pleasant surprise to see a decent dad in a mafia context. The side characters are well-developed, and I’m eager to download the book featuring Eriu's sister and delve into her brother's story next.",
            "The excessive use of the word 'feck' was overwhelming. I understand that the main character is Irish, but it felt excessive.",
            "Let's address the key tropes: Irish Mob, Forbidden Romance (with him as her bodyguard), age gap, and Grumpy/Sunshine dynamics. The age gap often felt uncomfortable, especially when Devlin remarked that he had known Eriu since she was a child. "

There are no instances of cheating or sharing; however, the heroine finds herself in an arranged marriage, which the hero ultimately helps resolve.",

The FMC’s constant trouble-making also put Devlin, her bodyguard, in a position where he was always forced to protect her.",

After his release, the story picks up with themes of betrayal, violence, and a life-altering event that deeply affects Erui. Despite the challenges, the couple achieves a happy ending (HEA).  \n\n- **Themes and Genre Elements:**  \n  The novel is an Irish mafia bodyguard romance, which includes typical genre elements such as betrayal, violence, and a significant age gap. These elements are well-integrated into the story, adding depth and tension to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The relationship between Devlin and Erui evolves over time, starting with a protective dynamic that shifts into a romantic one. Their connection is tested by external events, including Devlin’s imprisonment and the traumatic incident that impacts Erui’s life.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story’s pacing is uneven at times, with a slow buildup in the beginning and a more intense focus on events after Devlin’s release from prison. The structure works well to build tension but could have been more balanced.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the book was engaging and had its moments, it fell short of being exceptional. It was better than average but not quite deserving of a higher rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Irish mafia bodyguard romance offers a mix of tension, drama, and a satisfying happy ending. While it has its strengths, including well-integrated genre elements and evolving character dynamics, the pacing and overall execution prevent it from reaching a higher rating.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️ (Better than a 3 but not quite a 4)."

            "Eriu stands out as a compelling character, serving as a beacon of light amidst Devlin’s darkness. Although she is raised in an Irish mob family, her depth of experience and resilience shape her character in intriguing ways. I find the irony in her family's attempt to protect her through an arranged marriage particularly enriching; it adds layers to her identity. Devlin, on the other hand, is both protective and self-critical. While the age gap between him and Eriu is acknowledged, it ultimately feels irrelevant to the narrative. I empathize with Devlin's internal conflicts and hope he will confront his feelings for Eriu more openly. The introduction of a new character and their family adds an exciting dimension, leaving me eager to see how their story unfolds in the future.",

However, the beginning felt slow, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Character Development and Backstory:**  \n  I wish there had been more exploration of Eriu’s kidnapping. It felt like an important aspect of the story that wasn’t given enough attention, leaving me wanting more depth.  \n\n- **Language and Style:**  \n  The use of Irish lingo was a significant drawback for me. While I understand it fits the Irish mafia romance theme, I found it distracting and hard to enjoy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a solid read with an engaging plot and a satisfying twist, though the slow start, lack of backstory development, and heavy use of Irish lingo held it back from being a favorite.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the characters of Eriu and Devlin, as well as their story. Their pasts and the challenges they faced were compelling. Devlin's extreme moment of vulnerability that led him to admit his feelings felt necessary, given his struggle to let people in. However, I felt for Eriu, especially considering what happened immediately after—no girl deserves that as her first experience. Patrick played a sneaky role in bringing Devlin and Eriu together, but his meddling ultimately paid off, preventing a much bloodier outcome. I was surprised by Karen's true identity; I had initially suspected she was Camara, but I was mistaken. Professor Montgomery's reveal was another unexpected twist. Mason got what he deserved, particularly with the fate of his hand, though I would have preferred a longer, more painful demise for him."

However, characters from previous books do make appearances.  \n   - *Ruthless Savage* was the first book I read by Lillian Harris, and I was slightly confused when past events from other books were mentioned. It didn’t take away from my reading experience, but I plan to go back and read her other books before the next one in the *Savage Kings* series is released.  \n\n- **Book Features and Extras:**  \n   - I appreciated the pronunciation/translation guide at the beginning of the book. It saved me from butchering the names in my mind and helped me understand what the characters were saying when they spoke in other languages without needing Google Translate.  \n   - There’s a playlist at the back of the book, which I didn’t find until I was done reading. It was a bit of a bummer because I love listening to music while I read—it helps me focus better. There’s a link to Spotify, but the songs are also written out for people to add to their own playlists, which I might do for future reads as an Apple Music subscriber.  \n\n- **Characters and Storyline:**  \n   - I enjoyed Eriu and Devlin’s characters and their story. Their pasts and the obstacles they both had to overcome were compelling.  \n   - What pushed Devlin to finally admit his feelings was extreme, but I feel it was necessary for his character, given his difficulty letting people in. I do feel bad for Eriu for what happened immediately after—no girl deserves that to be her first.  \n   - Patrick was a sneaky sucker for his part in finally getting Devlin and Eriu together, but at least it paid off, or things would’ve gotten a lot bloodier.  \n   - Karen’s true identity was a surprise—I had predicted she was Camara (I think that’s the girl’s name), but I was wrong.  \n   - Professor Montgomery’s reveal was a shock I didn’t see coming.  \n   - Mason got what was coming to him, especially with what happened to his hand, though I would’ve made his death longer and much more painful.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Overall, I had a really good time reading this book.  \n   - I definitely recommend it to readers who love a good bodyguard romance with mafia ties and a not-so-little dash of spice.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Ruthless Savage* by Lillian Harris is a captivating read with well-developed characters, surprising twists, and a satisfying blend of romance, suspense, and spice. While reading the previous books in the series isn’t necessary, it enhances the experience. The additional features, like the pronunciation guide and playlist, add a nice touch.

The plot centers on the characters' tumultuous dynamic as they grapple with their feelings for each other. While the mafia elements introduce intriguing complications, their resolutions often feel contrived and lack authenticity.

The forbidden romance and chemistry between the characters are compelling and intense, particularly in the early stages. Their intimate scenes are both convincing and enjoyable; however, as the story progresses, these moments shift to a more closed-door approach, which is disappointing.

It definitely made me want to read the other books in this world. There are lots of moving parts in this story (some smaller bits that reference other books but not to the detriment of this story).\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Eriu is the youngest daughter of an Irish Mafia family, and Devlin is her bodyguard. I am such a sucker for a bodyguard romance! There's an age gap, and Devlin can't let them be together because he has demons in his past, but they PINE for each other. I really enjoyed the push and pull of their relationship; giving in to their desires, backing off, not being able to stay apart, and ultimately starting the cycle over again. They complement each other so well.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Eriu has a college friend talk her into sneaking out to an exclusive masked kink club (run by Russian Mafia) where they have virginity auctions among the offerings, but Devlin tracks them there. The scenes with both of them masked are so delicious, I'm glad we got more than one. She signs up to sell her virginity to escape a terrible arranged marriage, and all hell breaks loose. Devlin's past catches up with him, and he has to decide if he will go all in. I love when I can't guess the ending and get to be surprised.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The spice in this book is fantastic! The story is mostly experienced through the naivety of Eriu, who has been sheltered from the worst of her family's lifestyle. Her world tilts on its axis when truths come out, but Devlin is there to keep her safe and help her find a new normal.\n\n- **Anticipation for Future Books:**  \n  I can't wait till *Brutal Savage* comes out; it sounds so good! In the meantime, I need to read up on the Messina Family books.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a thrilling and spicy read with well-developed characters and a captivating plot.

The pacing was slow, and the repetitive back-and-forth between Devlin and Eriu made it challenging to stay engaged.",
            "In *Twisted Promises*, 17-year-old Eriu Quinn begins the story unaware of her family's criminal activities, which is surprising given her previous kidnapping. However, her journey in this book fosters significant growth. Devlin McHale, her brooding and possessive bodyguard, has swoon-worthy moments, though their dynamic occasionally feels repetitive.",

While I’m used to a more gripping emotional rollercoaster from her previous series like *The Cavaleri Brothers* and *Messina Crime Family*, this one didn’t quite hit the same mark.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Eriu Quinn, the 17-year-old protagonist, starts off naive about her family’s criminal activities, which was a bit surprising given her kidnapping in *Twisted Promises*. However, her experiences in this book do contribute to her growth. Devlin McHale, her broody and possessive bodyguard, had moments that made me swoon, but his dynamic with Eriu felt repetitive at times.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The story took a while to grab my attention. It wasn’t until the last 20% of the book that I felt truly invested. The pacing felt slow, and the back-and-forth between Devlin and Eriu became somewhat monotonous, making it harder to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The twist near the end was unexpected and well-executed, which I appreciated. It added a layer of excitement that the earlier parts of the book lacked.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  While this was a good story, it didn’t rank as high as other books by Lilian Harris for me. I still enjoyed it, but it didn’t have the same drive or intensity as her previous works.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Books:**  \n  I’m excited for the next installment, particularly Tynan and Elara’s story. I’m curious to see how Brody’s character develops and what new twists the series will introduce.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a decent read, but it didn’t quite meet my expectations compared to Lilian Harris’s other works.

This undermined the authenticity of their love, making it feel unrealistic given the many variables at play.",
            "Eriu and Devlin's story is a captivating age-gap, bodyguard, mafia romance. Eriu has long harbored feelings for Devlin, who initially resists them until she takes charge of her life in a chaotic way. Their relationship features a compelling push-and-pull dynamic in the first half, keeping me engaged and preventing Eriu’s pursuit from feeling futile. Once they finally come together, their bond solidifies, with Devlin fully committed to Eriu—refreshingly, there's no third-act breakup. While their journey to romance takes time, their connection becomes unbreakable. The supporting characters enrich the narrative, especially Karen, who, despite moments as a mean girl, plays a crucial role with her betrayal at the climax. Eriu's father is a “good” bad guy, genuinely protective of his daughter, while Mason, a thoroughly unlikeable character, meets a satisfying end.",

            "Devlin is a standout character—protective, intense, and the epitome of a brooding alpha that keeps readers captivated. He’s undeniably swoon-worthy and deserves a solid 5 out of 5 stars. His timely interventions, especially when he saves Eriu during a crucial scene, enhance the story's excitement. However, Eriu as a heroine left much to be desired. She often comes across as a typical damsel in distress, constantly needing rescuing, which became repetitive. I wish authors would craft female characters who embody both strength and independence while still allowing for moments of vulnerability that invite their partners to step in.",

            "This book is an age-gap mafia romance rather than a dark romance. It embraces a 'classic' romantic style with high stakes, steering clear of the gritty, morally ambiguous elements typical of dark romance. While it may be lighter in intensity, it remains action-packed, making it ideal for readers who appreciate protective heroes and dramatic plotlines."

It leans more toward a 'classic' romance with high stakes rather than delving into the gritty, morally gray areas of dark romance. It’s lighter on intensity but still action-packed, making it perfect for readers who enjoy protective heroes and high-stakes drama.  \n\n- **Characterization (Devlin):**  \n  Devlin is an absolute standout character—protective, intense, and the kind of brooding alpha that keeps you hooked.

His intervention in key moments, like when he saves Eriu during a pivotal scene, adds to his appeal and makes the book enjoyable.  \n\n- **Characterization (Eriu):**  \n  Eriu, unfortunately, fell a little flat for me as a heroine. She’s portrayed as a typical damsel in distress, constantly needing to be saved, which felt repetitive. I wish authors would create female characters who strike a better balance—strong and independent, yet with moments of vulnerability that allow their partner to step in.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book is a fast and entertaining read with good pacing. The tension and payoff in key scenes, like the one where Devlin saves Eriu, are well-executed and add to the overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  Despite my frustrations with Eriu’s character, the book kept me entertained from start to finish.

His love for her was genuine, yet he was aware of the risks posed by his past and their significant age gap. However, I found the FMC difficult to connect with. While her behavior may accurately reflect that of an actual 18-year-old, it felt off-putting. Unlike other age-gap stories where the FMC exhibits maturity beyond her years, this character did not, making it hard to understand why a man in his 30s would be drawn to her for reasons beyond physical attraction.",

            "In this story, Devin grapples with his self-worth, feeling unworthy as Eriu's protector, despite being her bodyguard, hired by her Irish mob father. Eriu, the innocent sweetheart of the Quinn family, is naive yet fiercely determined. I admired her character for her strength and refusal to be coerced into anything against her will. The forbidden romance between Eriu and Devin is both intense and captivating, heightened by Devin's possessiveness and their age difference. Eriu's impending arranged marriage to the slimy, misogynistic Mason Reynolds raises the stakes, and her daring attempts to escape kept me on the edge of my seat.",

It’s the first book in the Savage Kings series, and it follows FMC Eriu and MMC Devin. The constant push and pull between these two is almost too much to handle, and I was ready to go bonkers at times. The ending was absolutely perfect and so worth the wait.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Devin struggles with his self-worth and doesn’t see himself as a good match or protector for Eriu, even though he is literally her bodyguard hired by her Irish mob father. Eriu is the virgin sweetheart of the Quinn family, and while she’s naive, I still loved her character. She’s a fighter and knows exactly what she wants, refusing to be pushed into anything she doesn’t want to do.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The forbidden romance between Eriu and Devin is intense and captivating. Devin is possessive, and their age gap adds another layer of tension.

            "Delvin and Eriu truly brought the story to life! Their unique blend of innocence and possessiveness, along with their deep love for each other, was captivating. And Mason—what a character! I relished every moment of Delvin's confrontations with him, culminating in Eriu's sister taking him down. Father Patrick's deceptions were over the top, but they ultimately pushed Delvin to wake up. I wish Eriu could have confronted the professor for her betrayal and her willingness to harm an innocent person. I felt sympathy for Karen, despite her betrayal; she was caught in a tough situation. It's tragic that she was killed—if only she had confided in Eriu, she might have survived and salvaged their friendship.",

His life revolves around protecting Eriu, Patrick’s 18-year-old daughter, whom he has guarded since she was just 13. After his release, Devlin resumes his role as Eriu’s bodyguard, navigating the complexities of her impending arranged marriage and confronting rising threats from their enemies.",

            "The story centers on a forbidden romance between Eriu Quinn, the daughter of an Irish mob boss, and her bodyguard, assigned to protect her. Their slow-burning, taboo relationship is complicated by a significant 17-year age gap. Themes of unrequited love, jealousy, and possessiveness permeate the narrative, alongside a hint of the \"her and die\" trope. Tension escalates dramatically when Eriu auctions her virginity, introducing high stakes. The plot also features action, notably when the hero shoots a man linked to the Russian mafia to safeguard Eriu.",
            "Initially, the hero views Eriu merely as a duty—someone he is sworn to protect. However, as the story unfolds, he finds himself falling in love with her. Despite his feelings, he resists her advances, particularly after his imprisonment, during which he refuses to see her or respond to her letters. Eriu, innocent and deeply in love, expresses her feelings through heartfelt letters and visits. The hero's possessiveness and protective instincts come to the forefront when he takes extreme actions to ensure her safety, including severing a man's hand and making dark jokes about it.",
            "This standalone novel weaves together romance, action, and dark themes, creating an intense and emotional narrative. It explores the forbidden nature of the relationship and the hero's internal struggles. The writing is punctuated by moments of humor, especially through the hero's dark and possessive remarks."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a gripping tale of forbidden love, filled with tension, action, and emotional depth. The slow-burn romance between Eriu and her bodyguard is both captivating and heart-wrenching, with a significant age gap and taboo elements adding to the complexity. The hero’s possessiveness and protective instincts are central to the story, making it a compelling read for fans of dark, intense romances.",

The characters were compelling, and the narrative structure, though initially jarring, grew on me. The plot twists, especially the second one, were a highlight.

            "I struggled to engage with the story due to the writing style, and I found it difficult to connect with Eriu.",
            "I was eager for a new mafia romance, so I was thrilled to read *Ruthless Savage*. If you're seeking tension, drama, and a touch of spice, this book might be for you. The story centers on Eriu and her bodyguard, Quinn, effectively highlighting the forbidden romance trope. Eriu's feelings for Quinn are complicated by their circumstances—he's older and works for her father, the head of the Irish mob, making their relationship impossible. As she heads off to college, she continues to tempt him, escalating the tension until it reaches a breaking point. The premise held great promise for me."

            "The author presents intriguing twists and plot points, though some may come across as a bit far-fetched. However, the execution leaves room for improvement.

Their relationship is complicated by external dangers and Devlin's reluctance to cross professional boundaries.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot centers on Devlin's sacrifice to protect Eriu, her desire for a romantic relationship, and the looming threats from both her father's mafia business and Devlin's mysterious past. The tension between their roles and feelings drives much of the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Character Dynamics:**  \n  Devlin's reluctance to fully commit to Eriu felt slightly overdone at times. He would get close to giving in to his feelings but then pull back, which could be frustrating. Eriu's patience with this dynamic was admirable, though it might have driven others to frustration.  \n\n- **Scenes and Themes:**  \n  The public sex scene at the club was a bit excessive and felt out of place. Additionally, Eriu's father was portrayed as unnecessarily manipulative, which added to the tension but could have been handled more subtly.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some minor issues, the story was engaging and well-written, making it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivers a compelling mix of mafia intrigue and forbidden romance, with strong character dynamics and a plot filled with tension and danger. While some elements, like Devlin's hesitation and certain scenes, could have been refined, the story remains enjoyable and sets the stage for the next book in the series, *Brutal Savage*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The storyline had me hooked from the very beginning. It wasn’t as intense as I thought it might be, but it kept me engaged throughout. The plot had twists that surprised me, especially the unexpected turn that left me questioning and then completely shocked.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are honestly elite. Devlin, the male main character (MMC), has a complex past, but he doesn’t realize the beautiful future that lies ahead of him. Eriu, the female main character (FMC), was someone I loved from the very beginning. From her first scene of sneaking out, I knew she was going to be a force to reckon with.  \n\n- **Romance and Tropes:**  \n  The romance in this book is exceptional. It’s a bodyguard romance with a grumpy MMC, which I absolutely adore. The forbidden aspect of the boss’s daughter trope added an extra layer of tension. The age gap, virgin heroine, and the jealous/possessive hero tropes were executed perfectly. The “touch her and die” vibe was everything I wanted and more.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The book balances dark themes with a compelling love story. It’s not overly intense, but it has enough edge to keep you invested. The Irish mob setting added a unique and captivating backdrop to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a must-read for fans of Irish mob romances, bodyguard tropes, and grumpy, possessive heroes. The engaging plot, well-developed characters, and perfect execution of tropes make it a standout read. I loved every moment of it, especially the romance and the surprising twists.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🖤 (4.5/5)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - I’m not usually a fan of age gaps, especially with Devlin being twice Eriu’s age. However, their stubbornness and the undeniable chemistry between them kept me hooked. I was curious to see how long their push-and-pull dynamic would last.  \n  - Devlin frustrated me at times, but I also admired his maturity and how he considered the impact of his background and secrets on Eriu.  \n  - Eriu’s unwavering devotion to Devlin was endearing, as she refused to let anything—even Devlin’s stubbornness—keep her away from him.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  - The push-and-pull between the characters went on for too long, which made me want to strangle them at times.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  - Despite the prolonged tension, the story ultimately delivered a sweet and satisfying happily-ever-after (HEA).  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I’m glad I read it. The story was engaging, and the HEA made it worth the journey.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the age gap and prolonged tension between the characters were initially off-putting, the chemistry, character growth, and satisfying ending made this a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She is aware of the danger she is in and knows the bodyguard is watching her for a reason, yet she still goes off on her own, which felt unrealistic and frustrating.  \n\n- **Plot Clarity and Coherence:**  \n  - The beginning of the story, particularly the jail scene, was confusing. I didn’t understand why the character was locked up, and I might have missed the explanation due to skipping some parts.  \n\n- **Use of Shock Value:**  \n  - The author seemed to rely heavily on shock value, which felt excessive. For example, the brother’s death wasn’t just tragic—it was brutally graphic. Similarly, the main character’s mother didn’t just die—she was buried alive. These elements felt forced and unnecessary.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  - Overall, I didn’t enjoy the book. While I can’t say it was completely terrible, it just wasn’t my cup of tea.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell short of my expectations.

Additionally, there’s a touch of the masked men/stranger trope, which adds an intriguing layer to the plot.  \n\n- **Reader Preference and Suitability:**  \n  If the idea of a significant age gap or a bodyguard/forbidden love dynamic doesn’t appeal to you, this book might not be your cup of tea. However, if you enjoy these tropes, it’s worth giving it a try.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the age gap and the history of the characters’ relationship were somewhat off-putting for me, the inclusion of popular tropes like bodyguard/forbidden love and masked men/stranger dynamics makes the story engaging for readers who enjoy these themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "I initially paused my reading of the novel at 90% but eventually returned to finish it. The story centers on the male main character (MMC), who serves as the bodyguard for the female main character (FMC), tasked with protecting her from various threats. The pacing felt uneven, causing me to lose interest at times. However, the plot took a dramatic turn when the FMC was kidnapped, revealing that her professor and her best friend’s daughter were behind the threats, linked to the MMC. This twist added significant depth to the conflict and ultimately drew me back into the story.",

Their push-and-pull dynamic is enthralling, especially given their forbidden age-gap romance, with him as her bodyguard and over a decade older. This captivating relationship adds significant depth to the story."

The FMC's prolonged struggle with her past and the lackluster plot progression detracted from my overall enjoyment, leading to disengagement towards the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice: 🔥🔥🔥  \n- Plot: ⭐⭐  \n- Emotional Engagement: ⭐⭐⭐  \n- Overall Enjoyment: ⭐⭐½"

            "The FMC, Eriu, embodies innocence and meekness, often bordering on being Too Stupid To Live (TSTL). Her character largely revolves around her infatuation with the MMC, making her feel one-dimensional as she spends most of her time pining for him. In contrast, the MMC is a classic jealous and possessive hero. Despite his repeated rejections of Eriu, his internal conflict reveals depth and vulnerability, particularly in the line, *“One kiss and I’d be done for. That’s all it’d take. And I’ve never been a man who cared much for kissing. But Eriu? I’d kiss her until my soul gave out. She owns me.”* This juxtaposition adds complexity to his character.",

It had a compelling premise with elements like forbidden love, jealousy, and possessiveness that kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Characterization (FMC):**  \n  The FMC (Eriu) was the definition of innocent, meek, and TSTL (Too Stupid To Live). Her entire personality revolved around being in love with the MMC. She spent most of her time drooling over him, which made her feel one-dimensional.  \n\n- **Characterization (MMC):**  \n  The MMC was a classic jealous and possessive hero. Despite constantly rejecting the FMC, his internal conflict and the line, *“One kiss and I’d be done for. That’s all it’d take. And I’ve never been a man who cared much for kissing. But Eriu? I’d kiss her until my soul gave out. She owns me,”* showcased his depth and vulnerability.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamic:**  \n  The forbidden/unrequited love trope was executed well, and I found myself desperately rooting for the couple despite the FMC’s lack of agency. The tension between them was palpable, and the age gap (18/35) added an intriguing layer to their relationship.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The novel incorporated several tropes I enjoy, such as Irish mafia, bodyguard, boss’ daughter, and virgin heroine. The inclusion of a s3x club added an edgy element to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the FMC’s lack of depth and agency was a drawback, the MMC’s complexity and the overall plot kept me invested. The forbidden love and tension between the characters were well-executed, making it a worthwhile read despite its flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: 3.25⭐️  \n- Spice Level: 2.5🌶️  \n- Emotional Depth: 🖤"

My only critique is that the resolution felt a bit rushed, but this did not significantly diminish my overall enjoyment of the story.",

Eriu's unwavering determination, exemplified by her letters to Devlin during his imprisonment, highlights her resilience. The twist of an arranged marriage introduces an intriguing dynamic to their relationship. While I appreciated Eriu's tenacity, I occasionally found her a bit naive; reminding myself that she is only 18 helped me better understand her perspective. Devlin's protective and conflicted nature makes him a compelling lead.",

            "While the forbidden romance trope was present, its execution left much to be desired. The hot-and-cold dynamic between Eriu and Devlin grew tiresome, and the resolution felt rushed and unconvincing. Devlin’s secret and his eventual choice to prioritize Eriu lacked the depth and emotional resonance needed to make their relationship compelling.",
            "Eriu, the female protagonist, was insufferable. She came across as a desperate virgin, overly fixated on Devlin despite their age gap and his questionable past. Eriu's complete ignorance of the mafia world and her role in it was frustrating. While her naivety isn't entirely her fault, as an adult, she should have acted with more maturity and realism once she learned the truth. Devlin, the male protagonist, was equally disappointing.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Eriu, the female protagonist, was insufferable to me. She came across as a desperate virgin who was overly fixated on Devlin, despite their age gap and his shady history.  \n  - Socially, Eriu was completely unaware of the mafia world and her role within it. While this lack of awareness isn’t entirely her fault, as a grown adult, she should have been more mature and realistic in her actions once she learned the truth.  \n  - Devlin, the male protagonist, wasn’t much better. His loyalty to Eriu’s father overshadowed his feelings for her, which made his character frustrating. His eventual confession of love felt inconsistent, especially since Eriu’s father responded with relief and happiness, which didn’t align with the tension built throughout the story.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  - The forbidden romance trope was present, but the execution fell flat for me. The hot-and-cold dynamic between Eriu and Devlin became tiresome, and the resolution felt rushed and unconvincing.  \n  - The revelation of Devlin’s secret and his eventual decision to prioritize Eriu lacked depth and emotional impact.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - Lilian Harris is known for writing excellent mafia romances, but this one didn’t live up to her usual standard. The story had potential, but the characters and their development didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  - Out of all the female main characters Harris has written, Eriu was my least favorite.  \n  - If you’re looking for a forbidden romance, I would recommend the first book in the Messina series by Lilian Harris instead.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“Ruthless Savage” by Lilian Harris was a disappointment for me. While the premise had potential, the execution of the forbidden romance trope and the character development fell short. Eriu and Devlin’s relationship felt frustrating and lacked the emotional depth I expected.
