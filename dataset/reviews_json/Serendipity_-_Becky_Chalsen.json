However, I ended up being terribly disappointed because I didn’t read the synopsis beforehand.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story takes place over a summer of three weekends on Fire Island, following eight friends seven years after their high school graduation. It’s not a reunion, as seven of the friends live in NYC, but it’s their first time back on Fire Island, staying in the same house they used after prom.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The main characters are Cam and Liz (who are engaged), Maggie (Liz’s former best friend and Mac’s ex-girlfriend), and Mac (Cam’s twin). The other four friends are side characters who mostly serve to move the story along or remain in the background.  \n   - I didn’t find any of the main characters likable, especially due to their constant secret-keeping. I also wish the side characters had been given more depth instead of just brief glimpses into their lives.  \n\n- **Relatability:**  \n   - As someone in my mid-forties, I can sometimes connect with characters in their mid-twenties, but that wasn’t the case here. I don’t think I would have connected with these characters even when I was in my mid-twenties.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing style felt very choppy. While there are poems written by Maggie interspersed throughout the narrative, some parts have a lyrical vibe, while others are composed of short, clunky sentences. This inconsistency made the reading experience uneven.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Previous Work:**  \n   - I haven’t read the author’s first book, so I can’t compare this one to their earlier work.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n   - Thank you to NetGalley and Penguin Group Dutton for providing an advanced copy of this book. *Serendipity* was published on June 4th.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I was disappointed with this book.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting:**  \n   - I loved the author’s debut novel set on Fire Island, and while I liked the idea of this book being set there as well, it didn’t quite hit the mark for me. The nostalgic, sun-kissed setting of Fire Island was appealing, but the execution felt lacking compared to the first book.  \n\n- **Group of Friends:**  \n   - The concept of a group of friends gathering for multiple weekends in the summer at a beach house was delightful and felt like a dream. I enjoyed the idea of their shared experiences and the potential for deep connections.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - I noticed a distinct shift in the author’s writing style from her first novel to this one. Unfortunately, I didn’t connect with the style in this book as much as I did with her debut.  \n\n- **Point of View (POV):**  \n   - The use of switching third-person POVs made it difficult for me to get to know the characters I wanted to spend more time with. The constant shifts felt impersonal, especially for stories that were meant to feel personal and intimate.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I felt like I couldn’t get to know the characters in the way I expected, based on the author’s first book. There were too many characters, and the POV changes made it hard to form a deeper connection with any of them.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n   - There was too much going on in the story, which made it feel overwhelming at times. The multiple storylines and characters detracted from the overall cohesion and charm of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had all the ingredients for a story I’d love—a nostalgic setting, a group of friends, and a summer beach house—it ultimately missed the mark for me. The writing style, POV shifts, and lack of character depth made it difficult to connect with the story in the way I had hoped. Despite its potential, it didn’t capture the personal charm of the author’s debut novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Character Authenticity: 3/5  \n- Spice Rating: 0/5  \n- Overall Rating: 2.75/5"

I wasn’t sure if the focus was on romance or growing friendships, but both aspects felt underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  I didn’t really connect with any of the characters. While the story is full of secrets, heartbreaks, and regrets, I found myself wanting the characters to communicate more openly with one another.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  If you’re looking for a light beach read, this might be worth a try when it’s released on June 4.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the Fire Island setting and nostalgic themes resonated with me, the slow pacing, lack of character connection, and unclear focus on romance versus friendship made this an okay read for me.
