The main character lacks agency, often being propelled by external circumstances rather than her own choices.

While Dross is important, the constant repetition feels unnecessary and underestimates the reader’s intelligence.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The Shadows are the best part of the book, adding intrigue and depth to the world-building. The university, however, feels less compelling, and I found myself not siding with its perspective.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws, the book shows promise and could improve as the series progresses. The strong characters and intriguing elements like the Shadows make it worth reading, though the heavy-handed exposition and uneven pacing hold it back.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 Stars"

The concept of dross and its dangers creates an intriguing backdrop for the story.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Petra Grady is a compelling heroine with untapped potential, and her unresolved tension with Benedict Strom, her childhood crush, adds emotional depth to the narrative.

While she is content in her position, she isn't afraid to confront arrogant mages. Although Petra shares some similarities with Rachel Morgan from The Hollows, she remains a distinct character.

The magic system is straightforward: mages harness the power of sun-charged lodestones, but must manage the dross produced, which brings misfortune if not properly disposed of. Within this society, mages remain concealed from the general public, and characters like Petra Grady, who are seen as sweepers, are often regarded as little more than glorified garbage collectors."

It explores the aftermath of magic, particularly the waste (dross) generated by its use, which is a unique and intriguing concept. The relentless pacing follows Petra and Benny as they evade their pursuers. However, the final hundred pages feel somewhat drawn out, making the story seem longer than necessary.

The lingering intrigue and unanswered questions about the characters and magical system leave readers eagerly anticipating the next book.",

Her character arc is engaging, though she does exhibit a bit of a \"special snowflake\" quality by the end. In contrast, Benedict Strom, the potential love interest, falls short; his stubbornness and dismissive attitude toward Petra's insights make him less appealing. The supporting characters, such as Darrell the Spinner and Petra’s dog Pluck, are well-crafted and enrich the narrative. Pluck’s fate may concern dog lovers, but there is a glimmer of hope for his survival. Additionally, Herm Ivaros, Petra’s enigmatic benefactor, presents an intriguing character with potential for further exploration in future installments.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The novel is a fast-paced series opener with a great hook, keeping readers engaged throughout.\n   - The story deals with the aftermath of magic, focusing on the waste (dross) created from using magic, which is a unique and fascinating concept.\n   - The pacing is fast and furious, with Petra and Benny constantly trying to stay ahead of the bad guys.\n   - The last hundred pages felt a bit drawn out, making the story seem longer than necessary.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building is intricate and well-developed, with a unique take on magic and its consequences.\n   - The concept of dross as a form of \"bad luck\" that only sweepers can see and dispose of is intriguing and well-explained.\n   - The story hints at a complex magic system involving mages, sweepers, spinners, and weavers, though the magic itself isn’t deeply explored in this book.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - Petra Grady is a lovable and hardworking heroine, content with her life as a sweeper despite her desire to be a mage. Her character arc is compelling, though she has a bit of a \"special snowflake\" vibe by the end.\n   - Benedict Strom, the potential love interest, is less impressive. He’s stubborn and dismissive of Petra’s insights, making him a less likable character.\n   - The side characters, like Darrell the Spinner and Petra’s dog Pluck, are well-done and add depth to the story. Pluck’s fate is a point of concern for dog lovers, though there’s a glimmer of hope for his survival.\n   - Herm Ivaros, Petra’s mysterious benefactor, is an intriguing character with potential for further development in future books.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**\n   - The story subtly addresses environmental waste, drawing parallels between dross and real-world pollution caused by unchecked human activity.\n   - The novel explores themes of identity, guilt, and redemption, particularly through Petra’s journey and Herm’s mysterious role in her life.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**\n   - Kim Harrison’s writing is engaging and fun, with a clear sense of enjoyment in crafting this world and its rules.\n   - The tone is light and entertaining, making it an enjoyable read for urban fantasy fans.\n\n- **Ending and Sequel Setup:**\n   - The story wraps up nicely while setting the stage for the sequel, leaving readers eager for the next installment.\n   - The intrigue and unanswered questions about the characters and the magical system create anticipation for future books.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Three Kinds of Lucky* is a highly enjoyable urban fantasy novel with a unique premise, strong world-building, and a lovable heroine. While the pacing slows in the latter part of the book and some characters could be more compelling, the story is engaging and sets up an exciting series. Fans of urban fantasy will find much to love here, and I’m eagerly looking forward to the next book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."
