There were moments where my interest waned slightly, but the story always managed to recapture my attention.  \n\n- **Narrative Style (POV):**  \n  I am not a fan of multiple or dual POVs, as I find them confusing. In this book, while there weren’t many chapters from a different POV, the transitions weren’t clearly indicated. This left me confused at times, as I wasn’t sure whose perspective I was reading from.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the confusion with the POV shifts, I still enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had moments where my interest dipped and the unclear POV transitions caused some confusion, I found it engaging overall and would recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4✨"
