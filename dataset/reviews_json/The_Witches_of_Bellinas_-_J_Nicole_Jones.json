            "The book's premise was captivating, particularly with its parallels to *Midsommar* and the idea of a woman joining a cult to salvage her marriage. Unfortunately, the execution missed the mark. The narrative devolved into a portrayal of new-age misogyny, featuring a cult of wealthy, blonde yoga instructors and women enduring abuse in pursuit of magic. This shift felt absurd and disconnected from the story's initial promise. Despite attempts to create mystery, the author relied on obvious clues that made every twist predictable. This lack of subtlety diminished the potential for intrigue, leaving the overall story feeling flat.",

It needed more action, thrill, or something to keep me engaged.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - Tansy and Guy’s relationship felt off from the start. Guy was never the right fit for Tansy, and his decision to move to Bellinas felt forced.  \n   - Tansy’s intuition told her something was wrong with the town, but she ignored it, which was frustrating.  \n   - The characters lacked complexity, except for Manny and Tansy. The rest felt underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The town of Bellinas had eerie vibes from the beginning, which I appreciated. However, the community’s portrayal as a spiritual group was misleading—they were anything but that.  \n   - The woods held the truth about Bellinas, and Tansy’s discovery there was a pivotal moment, but it came too late in the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing itself wasn’t bad, but the way the story was told and delivered felt strange and disjointed.  \n   - The book had potential but was overly detailed in the wrong places, missing opportunities to build tension or excitement.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I’m conflicted about this book.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Descriptive Nature:**  \n  The novel is incredibly descriptive, far more so than any nature program. While this initially felt mesmerizing, it eventually became tedious.  \n\n- **Character Development (Tansy):**  \n  I found myself deeply invested in Tansy’s journey, constantly hoping she would escape her circumstances.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was disappointing, primarily because there was no protection for the children. It felt unresolved and left me wanting more.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The story highlights the cyclical nature of oppression, particularly for women. Unless the women in the community become stronger, their daughters are doomed to repeat the same patterns. I don’t believe the author, Anna Kovanova, offers a clear solution to this issue.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was painfully slow, which made the reading experience feel drawn out. This was especially frustrating given the small but ultimately disappointing payoff at the end.  \n\n- **Coping Mechanism (Counting):**  \n  The recurring motif of counting (one, two, three, four) as a coping mechanism was intriguing. However, if I had to engage with it as much as the characters did, I would have tried to escape the community too.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s vivid descriptions and initial intrigue were captivating, the slow pacing and unsatisfying ending left me disappointed. The lack of resolution for the characters, particularly the children, and the absence of a clear solution to the cyclical oppression of women were significant drawbacks.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her complex relationship with her husband, Guy, unfolds as Tansy becomes increasingly introspective, while Guy succumbs to the seductive pull of Bellinas. The introduction of Guy’s cousin, Mia, adds depth to the narrative, hinting at the characters' unique qualities and enriching their motivations.",

I craved a deeper exploration of cult dynamics rather than the excessive focus on the wealthy women’s antics. The story felt slow-paced and lacking in significant events, failing to maintain my interest. Although it hints at themes such as emotional isolation and reclusive communities, it ultimately falls short of its potential.",

I wanted more focus on cult dynamics and less on the obnoxiousness of wealthy women. The story lacked significant events, and I found it slow-paced with very little happening. While it touches on themes like reclusive communities, emotional isolation, and New Age-ish ideas, it didn’t fully deliver on its potential.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I didn’t connect with or particularly like any of the characters. They felt underdeveloped, and their personalities didn’t resonate with me.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is flowery, with extensive descriptions of flora, fauna, and even the wind. While some might appreciate this, I found it tedious and pretentious at times.\n\n- **Feminist Undertones:**  \n  The book attempts to explore feminist ideas, but I’m still unsure if it succeeds in being genuinely feminist. The execution felt ambiguous and unconvincing.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  The novel has a witchy vibe, but it wasn’t the kind of witchcraft I enjoy. The setting, which includes California and reclusive communities, is described in detail, but it didn’t fully engage me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel didn’t meet my expectations.

These themes added depth and relevance to the story.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was surprisingly satisfying and left a positive impression on me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The pacing and point of view felt jumpy and repetitive at times, which detracted from my overall enjoyment of the novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s writing style and thematic commentary were commendable, the lack of a strong plot and the uneven pacing made it less enjoyable for me. The ending, however, was a pleasant surprise.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It wasn’t on my radar initially, and I started it as a spur-of-the-moment commute audiobook. While it wasn’t terrible, it also wasn’t my favorite.  \n\n- **Narration and Storytelling Style:**  \n   - I wasn’t a fan of the narrator (she annoyed me), but I loved the way the story was told as a written history/confession.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n   - The book has a lot to say about the dynamics between men and women, and I loved some of the points it drove home:  \n     1. Women run the world and only appease men so they think they are in control. Tell them what they need to hear.  \n     2. All women are witches who weave magic and power into everything they do.  \n   - I enjoyed how these ideas played out in the book for the most part.  \n\n- **Plot and Subplots:**  \n   - I wasn’t a fan of the r*pe subplot, but by the end, I understood why the women did what they did and what it ultimately gave them.  \n   - By the end, I was ready for all the men to be dead and the women to do their own thing, but of course, it couldn’t happen that fast.  \n\n- **Representation and Queer Themes:**  \n   - There’s a very vague queer flair to some of the women, which I loved. I think it’s meant to be read as there, and I hope that’s the case.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal and Recommendation:**  \n   - If you’re into witches, female empowerment, or cults, this could be a good summer read for you.  \n   - It isn’t a super dense book, and there isn’t much thrilling action, but it’s an interesting story told in a neat way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book wasn’t my favorite, I appreciated its unique storytelling style and the powerful themes it explored, particularly around female empowerment and gender dynamics. The vague queer representation and witchy elements added depth, though the r*pe subplot was difficult to stomach.

This added a layer of authenticity to the setting.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The book lacked a coherent plot and structure. It felt like wordy nonsense with no clear direction, making it difficult to follow.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There was no meaningful character development. The characters felt underdeveloped and lacked depth.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was overly verbose and repetitive, going in circles without making much sense. It resembled the style of a true guru or new-age religion, which might work for conversion but not as a fiction story.  \n\n- **Potential and Improvement:**  \n  The book had potential, but it felt like a rough draft that needed significant editing and refinement. I would like the author to try again, as there is promise in the concept.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started strong and had moments of authenticity in its setting, it ultimately fell short due to its lack of plot, character development, and overly verbose writing style. It felt more like a rough draft than a polished novel, but the potential for improvement is evident.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "This story evokes Ira Levin's works, particularly *The Stepford Wives*, and hints at *Rosemary’s Baby*, featuring a young couple named Guy who relocates from NYC and encounters a cult. It skillfully explores themes of feminism while incorporating folk horror elements, reminiscent of *Midsommar*.",
