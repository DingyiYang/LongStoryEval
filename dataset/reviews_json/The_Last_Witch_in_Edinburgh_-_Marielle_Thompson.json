The villain’s motivations are unclear, and some of his actions feel far-fetched within the story’s context.  \n\n- **Emotional Tone and Balance:**  \n  - The story is heavy on trauma and danger, with very little levity or humor to provide balance. This makes the narrative feel relentless at times.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  - The magic system is vague but interesting, avoiding unnecessary complexity while maintaining a sense of mystery.  \n  - The deity-worship aspect adds a unique layer to the supernatural elements.  \n\n- **Feminist Themes:**  \n  - The novel strongly emphasizes feminist themes, focusing on the struggles and empowerment of women in a patriarchal society.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a good read for fans of Edinburgh, witchcraft, and feminist-heavy stories.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  The book is presented as a feminist fantasy story but comes across as promoting misandry. It uses a made-up religion of witches fighting an immortal god who spreads sexism, which feels heavy-handed and less engaging than a supernatural conflict. While sexism is a valid issue, the approach feels more like online activism than a compelling fantasy narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are interesting and well-developed, which adds depth to the story. The book also acknowledges that not all men are bad, providing some balance to its messaging.  \n\n- **World-Building and Plot:**  \n  The world-building is lacking, as the story relies on a contrived conflict involving sexism rather than leveraging the potential of its fantasy setting. The plot could have been more engaging if it focused on supernatural battles rather than overt political messaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has interesting characters and attempts to address important issues, its heavy-handed political messaging and lack of compelling fantasy elements detract from the overall experience. The story feels more like a platform for activism than a well-crafted fantasy novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars"

            "The novel starts slowly, which is surprising given its intriguing premise. However, it gains momentum around the 100-page mark. The narrative alternates between 1824 and 2022, following Nellie Duncan, a witch who escapes Edinburgh in 1824 and returns in 2022 to discover that while societal attitudes toward women have evolved, deep-seated hatred still endures.",
            "Nellie Duncan is a compelling protagonist whose extensive life as a witch seamlessly connects historical and modern timelines.",
            "The novel is skillfully crafted, seamlessly weaving Celtic mythology into its examination of both contemporary and historical themes.",
            "The portrayal of 1824 Edinburgh, where women live in constant fear of being branded as witches, is both vivid and immersive. The shift to 2022 underscores the progress in societal attitudes toward women, yet reveals that oppression still lingers.",
            "The book delves into themes of misogyny, patriarchy, and women's control, framed by historical witch hunts and contemporary societal challenges. It introduces the Cailleach, a Celtic winter goddess, and her son Angus, who represents the suppression of women's power in order to stave off winter. This mythological backdrop serves as a metaphor for the persistent fight against patriarchal domination. While the themes are thought-provoking, the narrative sometimes reads like a lecture; however, this approach may be essential to effectively address the gravity of the issues at hand.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre Preference:**  \n  I struggled to complete *The Last Witch in Edinburgh* because historical fiction, particularly set in the 17th and 18th centuries, is not a genre I typically enjoy. While I appreciate real-life stories about witchcraft and the injustices faced by accused women, I find it difficult to connect with fictionalized versions of these themes.  \n\n- **Character Connection:**  \n  I was unable to connect with Nellie or any of the other characters, which made the first half of the book less engaging for me. However, I did find myself more invested in the second half, which suggests that the characters and their development might resonate more with readers who enjoy this genre.  \n\n- **Writing and Engagement:**  \n  The writing itself was not an issue; in fact, I found the second half of the book much more engaging. Had I connected with the first half as well, I believe I would have been equally engrossed throughout.  \n\n- **Themes and Appeal:**  \n  The book incorporates a mix of politics, magic, injustice, and justice, which I think would appeal to readers who enjoy historical fiction with these elements. While it wasn’t the right fit for me, I can see how it would be a great read for others.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  Despite my struggles with this book, I look forward to reading the author’s other works in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Last Witch in Edinburgh* didn’t align with my personal preferences for historical fiction, it has strong elements of storytelling, particularly in the second half. Readers who enjoy this genre and themes of witchcraft, politics, and justice will likely find it engaging and worthwhile.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The characters lacked depth, functioning mainly as vehicles for the plot and the author's message. They often resembled simplistic archetypes, such as the beautiful coward and the angry antagonist, without any real complexity. Additionally, the chemistry between them felt forced and unnatural.",
            "The writing alternates between poetic attempts and repetitive, overt statements, often appearing multiple times per chapter. The dialogue is overly explicit, lacking subtext and leaving little room for nuance.",

The portrayal of a physical villain representing the patriarchy and the protagonist's fear of all men—except her brother—are only critically examined in the final 80 pages, which undermines the narrative."

However, I found it distracting that the witch trials, which claimed over 4,000 lives in Scotland, primarily occurred a couple of centuries earlier. This historical inaccuracy detracted from the overall experience."

Her performance was impeccable, with distinct voices for all the characters, making the listening experience truly mesmerizing.  \n\n- **Historical Setting and Accuracy:**  \n  The story begins in early 1800s Edinburgh, a time when women were accused of witchcraft for reasons like being left-handed or too pretty. However, I noted that the witch trials primarily occurred a couple of centuries earlier, with over 4,000 people killed in Scotland during that period. This discrepancy in historical accuracy was a bit distracting.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The novel focuses on Nellie and the misfortunes she faces. At the midpoint, the story abruptly fast-forwards 200 years, which felt unnecessary and disjointed. While I typically enjoy dual timelines, they are usually interspersed throughout the narrative rather than introduced so abruptly. This sudden shift disrupted the flow of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nellie, the protagonist, didn’t seem to grow or learn much over the 200-year span. Her lack of development over such a long period felt underwhelming and left me wanting more depth in her character arc.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the narration by Siobhan Waring was exceptional and the historical setting intriguing, the abrupt timeline shift and lack of character development detracted from the overall experience. The story had potential but fell short in execution due to its disjointed structure and historical inaccuracies.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book features a unique dual timeline structure, transitioning from a distant past to contemporary times rather than alternating between two periods. While there is a middle period, the author only briefly references it, which adds a refreshing twist to the narrative. The historical plot is compelling, focusing on the struggles and injustices faced by witches. In contrast, the contemporary storyline follows the protagonist and a teenage girl she raises as they return to Scotland to confront unresolved issues from the past. Although the characters are well-developed and engaging, some sections of the historical timeline experience slow pacing, causing parts of the story to feel dull.",
            "The novel delves into powerful themes of feminism, particularly through its historical setting in Edinburgh, where numerous women were accused of witchcraft and subjected to ostracism and mistreatment. This tension culminates in a pivotal event that fractures the group of witches. Furthermore, the narrative intricately weaves in the theme of same-sex relationships, contrasting societal acceptance in both the past and present.",
            "This book offers a captivating and unique experience. The portrayal of witches living long lives, along with the exploration of their dual existences, adds significant depth to the narrative. Despite some pacing issues, the novel remains engaging and provides a refreshing take on familiar themes."

This approach felt unique and refreshing, though it took some getting used to.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The novel explores strong themes of feminism, particularly through the historical storyline in Edinburgh, where many women were accused of being witches and faced ostracization and mistreatment. This culminates in a pivotal event that splits the group of witches. Additionally, the theme of same-sex relationships is woven into the narrative, highlighting the contrast between societal acceptance in the past and present.  \n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  The plot in the original time period was compelling, with a focus on the struggles of witches and the injustices they faced. The contemporary storyline follows the protagonist and a teenage girl she raises as they return to Scotland to address unresolved issues from the past. While the characters were well-developed and engaging, there were moments in the historical timeline where the pacing slowed, making parts of the story feel dull.  \n\n- **Originality and Enjoyment:**  \n  The book stands out as an interesting and different read.

I could not figure out at first if her name was Johnnie or Charlie or something altogether different, and it just bugged me for the rest of the book.  \n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The fight against the patriarchy became a little too political and preachy for me.  \n- **Writing Quality and Creativity:**  \n  That being said, it was reasonably well-written with an interesting take on witchcraft.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, my reaction to the novel was mixed. While I appreciated the narrator's engaging voice and the creative exploration of witchcraft, I found the plot confusing at times, particularly during the timeline shift. Additionally, the heavy-handed political tone detracted from my enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The ending was anticlimactic for all that the witches went through throughout the book, and it was left more open-ended than expected.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing itself was beautiful. Marielle Thompson made me feel like I could picture Edinburgh as if I was there.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  I enjoyed the apothecary aspect of the book. It reminded me a lot of *The Lost Apothecary*, where the women were so empowering.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I did not hate this book, nor did I love it. Overall, it was a decent read for the spooky season.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its strengths, such as beautiful writing and vivid descriptions of Edinburgh, the repetitive pacing and anticlimactic ending left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied. However, the empowering themes and apothecary elements made it a decent choice for a spooky season read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75/5"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel is set in 1824 Edinburgh, a dangerous time for women, as they are frequently accused of witchcraft and executed. The gallows remain a constant, grim reminder of this oppression.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story follows Nellie, who witnesses a woman being hanged and later sees her rise from the grave. This event leads Nellie to discover a group of real witches. The novel explores themes of self-discovery, as Nellie learns about her strengths, weaknesses, and her true identity. It also delves into love, coming of age, and a powerful critique of misogyny and the patriarchy, which seeks to suppress anyone who isn’t a heterosexual cisgender male.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Nellie undergoes significant growth throughout the story. With the help of the witches, she evolves from a passive observer to someone who understands her own power and purpose.  \n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel serves as a cry against the systemic oppression of women and non-conforming individuals, highlighting the injustices of the time and drawing parallels to contemporary struggles.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of historical fiction, fantasy, and social critique. It masterfully weaves together a love story, a coming-of-age journey, and a powerful message against misogyny and patriarchal oppression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story sounded amazing, and the cover was gorgeous.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The time jump was too abrupt and disrupted the flow of the story.  \n  - The story felt both too long and not long enough, which created an uneven reading experience.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - I liked Jean and Nell together, and their relationship dynamics were great.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  - The book ended up falling flat for me, but I didn’t hate it.
