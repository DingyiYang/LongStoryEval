            "The book opens on Freya's wedding day, which is abruptly interrupted when Iris and Ruby crash the ceremony to reveal that the vicar—who happens to be Ruby's husband—is having an affair. This revelation leads to the wedding being called off. Throughout the story, Freya struggles to encourage her fiancé to fall for someone else, as she feels obligated to marry him despite her lack of desire to do so. This dynamic struck me as peculiar and highlighted a significant communication gap between the characters. Overall, the plot felt unrealistic and reminiscent of a soap opera, leaving me with a sense of silliness and emptiness that I hadn't anticipated.",

While I appreciated Lottie's character, I struggled to invest in her romance with Max, which felt disappointing. I liked Ruby but found it challenging to visualize her due to the writing style. Unfortunately, I couldn't connect with Iris at all.",

While the descriptions of what women in their 20s wore were amusing, they often strayed into the realm of the unrealistic—one character dons yellow capris with a kaftan top, while another chooses a tiara for a date night. These humorous moments made me laugh but also undermined the story's believability."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The book felt dated, and I had to check the copyright page to confirm its publication year. The descriptions of what women in their 20s wore were humorous but unrealistic, such as a character wearing yellow capris with a kaftan top or another wearing a tiara for a date night. This made me laugh out loud but also detracted from the story's believability.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Every character in the book fell instantly in love after a one-night stand. The men, portrayed as players, would suddenly declare their undying love after a single encounter, which felt cringe-worthy and unrealistic. The relationships lacked depth and authenticity.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Cohesion:**  \n  There was no clear plot; instead, the story felt like a series of one-night stands and instances of cheating. The narrative was all over the place, with too many characters to follow, making it difficult to stay engaged or invested in the story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I wouldn’t pick up another Jill Mansell book after this experience. While I was able to finish the book, it didn’t leave a positive impression. The lack of a coherent plot and the unrealistic character dynamics made it hard to enjoy.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell short in terms of writing style, character development, and plot structure. The dated tone, unrealistic relationships, and lack of a cohesive narrative made it difficult to connect with the story. While I managed to finish it, I wouldn’t recommend it or read another book by this author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars (because I was at least able to read it to the end)."

It weaves together three main plotlines, with the primary focus on Lottie and Max, whose relationship is complicated by their families' history. However, the pacing rushes towards the end, with loose ends hastily resolved, likely due to the author needing to meet a word count.",
            "Lottie and Max's relationship is engaging, but their families' feud comes across as overly dramatic, particularly with Lottie's mother's affair and her abrupt change in behavior. I appreciated Ruby, the vicar's wife, whose love story is well-developed and enjoyable. In contrast, Iris's romance feels underdeveloped and serves more as a means to connect characters than to enhance the narrative. Cameron is portrayed as a villain with few redeeming qualities, his kidney donation feeling like a token gesture rather than a genuine redeeming trait.",
