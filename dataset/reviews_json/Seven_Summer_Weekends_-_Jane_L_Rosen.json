            "*Seven Summer Weekends* may not be officially part of a series, but it continues the narrative of the author’s previous novel, *On Fire Island*. A central character from the first book returns, along with several secondary characters, enriching the experience for readers familiar with the earlier story. However, the novel stands on its own, and while reading both books in order enhances the connection to the characters, it is not necessary. The plot follows Addison Irwin, who, after a decade in advertising, finds herself unemployed and inheriting her late aunt’s estate on Fire Island. The inheritance comes with stipulations requiring her to spend the summer there before deciding whether to sell. As Addison immerses herself in the island’s close-knit community, she finds her neighbor Ben to be a source of frustration.",

A central character from the first book returns, along with some secondary characters, which adds depth for readers familiar with the earlier story. However, the novel can still be enjoyed as a standalone, though reading both books in order provides a richer connection to the characters.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows Addison Irwin, who finds herself unemployed after a decade in advertising.

While both novels are set on the same charming island with eccentric characters, *Seven Summer Weekends* lacks the supernatural narrator that made the first book unique. This absence was somewhat missed, but the focus on a straightforward contemporary romance allowed for deeper investment in the main characters, Addison and Ben, which I ultimately enjoyed more.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  The novel excels in developing its central characters, Addison and Ben, making them relatable and engaging. Their evolving relationship and personal growth kept me invested throughout the story.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Future Interest:**  \n  Jane L. Rosen’s writing style remains consistent, blending charm and emotional depth. After finishing this book, I am intrigued enough to explore more of her work in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Seven Summer Weekends* is a delightful contemporary romance that builds on the charm of its predecessor while standing strong on its own.

The descriptions made it easy to picture the setting.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  - The story follows Addison, who inherits a Fire Island house from her estranged aunt. Over seven weekends, she hosts various visitors and gets to know her neighbors, particularly one who helps her connect with her aunt and figure out her path forward. It’s a story about how much can change over a summer and how relationships—both new and familiar—can profoundly impact your life.  \n\n- **Tropes and Writing Style:**  \n  - There’s a miscommunication trope between Addison and Ben, which I normally don’t enjoy, but it was executed so well here that I didn’t mind it. Jane Rosen kept me in suspense throughout much of the book, waiting to find out what caused the falling out between Addison’s aunt and her father. The reveal was genuinely surprising and well-crafted.  \n\n- **Emotional Resonance and Personal Connection:**  \n  - I felt deeply for Addison, having to learn about her fabulous aunt from others after their estrangement. I loved how Addison connected with her aunt through their shared passion for art, which helped her rediscover important parts of herself she thought she had lost.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  - The cover is stunning, and after reading the book, its significance becomes even more apparent. The publishers did an incredible job with it (and if you know, you know about the baseball reference in the book).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Seven Summer Weekends* is a beautifully written, emotionally resonant novel that explores themes of family, self-discovery, and the transformative power of relationships. Jane L. Rosen’s storytelling kept me engaged from start to finish, and I highly recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The lack of detail keeps me at a surface level, preventing a deeper connection to the story.

            "The ending felt overly perfect and rushed, lacking a sense of finality. It wrapped up too quickly and anticlimactically. Although it's a rom-com with a happy ending, their relationship didn't resonate with me emotionally as I had hoped when they first met.",
            "The side characters, including Addison’s friends, parents, and those who assisted her at the beach house, felt somewhat superficial. I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of Gicky’s friends and their genuine influence on Addison. A few additional chapters showcasing their time together could have added emotional depth to the story.",
            "The author’s eloquence captivated me, and I found myself eagerly absorbing many passages. However, I struggled with the frequent shifts in perspective. Characters would often take over as narrators for a chapter before returning to Addison’s point of view, and their sections lacked distinctiveness, making it difficult to recognize the changes in perspective.",
            "I enjoyed the setting and atmosphere of Fire Island. After my recent trip to New York, I found myself longing for that vibe. While it wasn't exactly the same, it offered a pleasant and relaxing beach read.",
            "I appreciated the exploration of grief, both in terms of losing a loved one and the challenge of moving forward. This added significant depth to the narrative. Ben, as the love interest, intrigued me; it's rare to see such a loving husband depicted in this genre, especially beyond the leads' relationship.",
            "While reading this book, I experienced a mix of enjoyment and frustration. There were moments that captivated me, but others that pulled me out of the narrative. I struggled to connect with the characters, particularly Addison and Ben. At 35, Addison felt surprisingly immature, and Ben's tendency to miscommunicate and avoid confronting issues was equally off-putting."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book had moments of enjoyment and beautiful writing, but it was hindered by inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped characters, and a rushed ending. While the themes of grief and the unique portrayal of Ben as a love interest added depth, I didn’t fully connect with the main characters or their relationship. It’s a decent beach read, but it fell short of being truly heartfelt or memorable.",

There were times when I really enjoyed it and couldn’t wait to read more, but others where it brought me out of the story.  \n   - I didn’t connect with the character of Addison (or Ben, really). For a 35-year-old, Addison was remarkably childish, as was Ben (miscommunication and running away from problems and feelings… please no).  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Structure:**  \n   - Rosen has a way with words, and I found myself inhaling parts of her writing.  \n   - I struggled with the constant shifting of viewpoints. Characters would often appear as narrators for a chapter before the book returned to Addison’s POV. Their chapters weren’t distinct enough for me to automatically recognize the shift in perspective.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Many of the side characters (Addison’s friends, parents, and those who helped her at the beach house) felt very surface-level.  \n   - I would have loved to see more of Gicky’s friends and their true impact on Addison. It would have been nice to see her make deeper connections with them—having a couple more chapters of them spending time together would have made it more heartfelt.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n   - The ending seemed a little too perfect and was extremely fast-paced, even rushed. It didn’t give me a feeling of finality, as it was wrapped up so quickly and anti-climactically.  \n   - While it’s a rom-com with a happy ending, their relationship didn’t tug at my heartstrings the way I thought it would when they first met.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - I appreciated the exploration of grief, both the loss of a loved one and the struggle of moving on. It added depth to the narrative.  \n   - Ben as the love interest intrigued me because it’s not often you see such a loving husband portrayed in these kinds of books (aside from their relationship with the leads).  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - I really liked the setting and the vibes of Fire Island. Having been to New York recently, I’ve been craving that feeling, and while this wasn’t exactly the same, it was a nice, relaxing beach read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book had moments of enjoyment and beautiful writing, but it was hindered by inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped characters, and a rushed ending. While the themes of grief and the unique portrayal of Ben as a love interest added depth, I didn’t fully connect with the main characters or their relationship. It’s a decent beach read, but it fell short of being truly heartfelt or memorable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley, Jane L. Rosen, and Berkeley Publishing Group for providing me with an ARC in exchange for an honest review."

            "\"Seven Summer Weekends\" follows Addison, who finds herself adrift after being fired from her advertising job due to a Zoom mishap. When she inherits her aunt's cottage on Fire Island, she encounters her neighbor Ben on a ferry, sparking an initial flirtation. However, Addison soon decides she can't stand him. As she discovers Ben is a famous writer grappling with profound loss, their relationship transforms into a heartfelt love story. Over the course of seven weeks, the novel weaves together moments of joy and sorrow, showcasing the complexities of love and friendship. Addison's best friends arrive just when she needs them most, emphasizing the importance of camaraderie and adding layers of romance to the narrative.",
            "As a long-time fan of this author, I found *Seven Summer Weekends* enjoyable, though it doesn't quite surpass my favorite, *Eliza Starts a Rumor*. The novel cleverly references last year's hit, *On Fire Island*, where Ben, a central character in *Seven Summer Weekends*, was introduced. In *On Fire Island*, we learn about Ben's journey through his wife's illness and death. In this new installment, Ben is portrayed as the author of *On Fire Island*, creating an intriguing connection between his fictional readers and the author's audience, both reflecting on his grief. While *Seven Summer Weekends* can stand alone, I recommend reading *On Fire Island* first for a deeper understanding of Ben's character.",
            "In the Afterword, the author reveals her intention to write a romcom; however, I found it lacking in humor. This absence of comedy didn't bother me, as I generally prefer more serious narratives."

        "conclusion": "Seven Summer Weekends is a well-written, engaging novel that blends romance, friendship, and personal growth. While it didn't meet my expectations as a romcom, its serious tone and emotional depth made it an enjoyable read. Fans of the author will appreciate the connections to the previous work, *On Fire Island*, though this book stands well on its own.",

Rosen's writing for many years.  \n   - \"Seven Summer Weekends\" was not my favorite of her books (that spot goes to \"Eliza Starts a Rumor\"), but I did enjoy this one.  \n   - Throughout its pages, \"Seven Summer Weekends\" refers to last year's hit, \"On Fire Island.\"  \n   - Ben, a main character in \"Seven Summer Weekends,\" was also featured in \"On Fire Island,\" which told the story of his wife's illness and death.  \n   - In the new novel, Ben is the writer of \"On Fire Island,\" which was actually written by Ms. Rosen. This made it interesting, as both Ben's fictional readers and Rosen's readers were reminded of his story and his grief.  \n   - \"Seven Summer Weekends\" can be read without reading \"On Fire Island,\" but I suggest reading the earlier book first to get the full background of Ben's character.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n   - \"Seven Summer Weekends\" is Addison's story, beginning when she is fired from her job in advertising after a Zoom mishap.  \n   - Adrift and unemployed, Addison inherits her aunt's cottage on Fire Island, next door to Ben's cottage.  \n   - Addison first meets Ben on a ferry, and a flirtation ensues. Later, she decides he is awful and cannot stand him.  \n   - Once Addison learns Ben's identity as a famous writer and understands the depth of his loss, their relationship evolves into a love story.  \n   - The novel features ups and downs, tears and laughter, obstacles and passions over seven weeks.  \n   - Addison's best friends come to stay with her when she needs them most, highlighting the importance of friendship and adding more romance to the story.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre Expectations:**  \n   - In the Afterword, Ms. Rosen explains that she set out to write this book as a romcom, but I did not find it comical at all.  \n   - The lack of comedy was fine with me, as I tend to prefer more serious books.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - It was good escape reading, well-written, and left me hoping Ms. Rosen is working on her next novel right now!  \n   - I gave it 4 stars, but I know the author has another 5-star novel inside her.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Seven Summer Weekends\" is a well-written, engaging novel that blends romance, friendship, and personal growth. While it didn't meet my expectations as a romcom, its serious tone and emotional depth made it an enjoyable read. Fans of Jane L. Rosen will appreciate the connections to her previous work, \"On Fire Island,\" though this book stands well on its own.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

            "The story follows 34-year-old Addison Irwin, who, after losing her job, inherits a home on Fire Island from her estranged aunt, Gicky. With just seven weeks to decide whether to sell or keep the property, Addison navigates the eccentric villagers and her growing feelings for her grumpy neighbor, Ben Morse. The premise is captivating, as Addison rediscovers her passion for sculpting and reconnects with her aunt’s life through the villagers and Gicky’s old friends.",

The supporting characters lack depth, primarily serving to fill in Gicky’s backstory or act as sounding boards for Addison.

However, I never felt particularly invested in the characters overall.\n   - There is a lot of family drama, especially involving Addison's relationship with her dad and her aunt's estrangement.\n   - The characters process a lot of grief, which adds depth to the story but makes it less of a breezy summer read.\n\n- **Emotional Tone and Themes:**\n   - The story is tinged with grief, which adds emotional weight but doesn't overwhelm the narrative like the darkness in *That Summer*.\n   - There is a strong sense of hope and exploration of how life's unexpected directions can lead to beautiful outcomes.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**\n   - I enjoyed the book as a nice, enjoyable summer romance.\n   - The story was engaging, but I felt that reading *On Fire Island* (the first book in the series) might have deepened my connection to the characters.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Seven Summer Weekends* is a quality beachy, summer book that explores themes of grief, family drama, and the beauty of life's unexpected turns. While I enjoyed the story and found Addison and Ben to be well-developed characters, I didn't feel deeply invested in them. The emotional tone, though tinged with grief, maintains a sense of hope and possibility. Overall, it's a pleasant summer romance that offers a thoughtful reflection on life's unpredictable journey.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

While the first guest (Gicky's BFF) was the most fleshed out, even her interactions with Addison could have been deeper and more meaningful.  \n   - The second guest (Gicky's boyfriend from India) and the final guests (two young women fangirling over the writer next door) were not as well-developed. Their conversations and contributions to the story lacked depth and could have been more impactful.  \n\n- **Descriptive Detail:**  \n   - The descriptions of the weekend guests and their interactions with Addison were lacking. The author missed opportunities to make these moments more vivid and emotionally resonant.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book's premise and found Addison to be a relatable and likeable protagonist.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  I loved the setting of this book on Fire Island, and the mentions of Montauk made me feel nostalgic for New York summers. Living in New York, I appreciated the familiar locations and the way they evoked a sense of place.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I enjoyed the artistic and creative elements of Addison and Gicky’s characters. However, I didn’t think Addison’s friends added much to the plot, and I didn’t feel a strong connection to any of the characters.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance felt way too forced and cheesy. I wanted to feel more invested in the relationship, but it didn’t resonate with me emotionally.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing felt a little choppy, and the storyline seemed to jump around at random times, which made it harder to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  The premise of choosing between city life and beach life was interesting, but the resolution felt unrealistic. In the “after” chapter, Addison somehow ended up with both a house and a downtown Manhattan apartment, which didn’t make sense given the earlier conflict.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While I appreciated the nostalgic setting and some aspects of the characters, I didn’t feel connected to the story as a whole. It was a quick summer beach read, but it fell short of my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its nostalgic setting and creative characters, the book didn’t fully deliver for me. The forced romance, choppy writing, and unrealistic resolution made it hard to connect with the story. While it had potential, it ultimately felt like a light, cheesy beach read rather than a compelling novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 ⭐️ (rounded down to 2 stars)"

After losing her job, she decides to reconnect with her aunt through the house and her aunt's friends and neighbors. The premise is engaging, with a mix of personal growth and romance.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Addison (not Addie) is the main character, and while her journey is relatable, I found her to be overly cheesy at times. The curmudgeon neighbor, who initially seems unwelcoming, becomes a key figure in the story as sparks fly between them.  \n\n- **Romance Dynamics:**  \n  The romance follows the classic \"enemy to lover\" trope, which, while enjoyable, felt predictable. The gradual development of the relationship between Addison and the neighbor was well-paced, though it didn’t offer many surprises.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The beach house on Fire Island serves as a beautiful and fitting backdrop for the story. The welcoming neighbors and the overall summer vibe make it a perfect beach read.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I found the story to be good, though not groundbreaking. It’s a light, predictable romance that works well as a summer read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a charming, if somewhat predictable, enemy-to-lover romance set against the idyllic backdrop of Fire Island. While the main character’s cheesiness was a bit much for me, the story’s warmth and summer vibes make it an enjoyable beach read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Having never been to Fire Island, I could easily picture the quaint beach town, the wagons lined up, the nosy locals, and the serene beaches with ocean views. The setting felt immersive and added a lot of charm to the story.  \n\n- **Main Character and Plot:**  \n  I really enjoyed following the journey of a thirty-something career woman who loses her job due to a comical mistake, inherits a significant amount from a long-estranged aunt, and spends the summer reevaluating her life and dreams. This premise was engaging and relatable, and I appreciated the depth of her character development.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The supporting cast was wonderful—her friends and neighbors added so much life to the story. Even though her Aunt Gicky wasn’t alive in the narrative, her vibrant and magical presence was strongly felt, which I loved.  \n\n- **Structure and Perspectives:**  \n  The structure of the book, with its multiple perspectives, was unique and meaningful. It added layers to the storytelling and made the narrative more dynamic.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  This book wasn’t light; it explored heavier topics like grief, complex family dynamics, marital struggles, friendship, and love. These themes were handled thoughtfully and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Areas for Improvement:**  \n  I did wish for a bit more romance and more details on some side characters and subplots. While the story was rich, I felt certain elements could have been expanded upon.  \n\n- **Connection to Previous Work:**  \n  This book is technically a sequel to *On Fire Island* by Jane Rosen. While it’s probably worth reading the first book for context, I found the plot of the first book too triggering for me personally.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a compelling and immersive read with a charming setting, well-developed characters, and meaningful themes. While I wished for more romance and deeper exploration of some subplots, the story’s unique structure and emotional depth made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75/5  \n\nThank you to NetGalley, Berkley, and Jane Rosen for providing an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review. The book is out now!"
