            "The novel follows four siblings—April, May, June, and July—who have drifted apart since their father's disappearance in Iraq a decade ago. It poignantly examines how personal tragedy can both fracture and reunite a family. However, the extensive historical and political context surrounding the Iraq War often feels disconnected from the family drama, affecting the pacing and causing some sections to drag.",
            "Each sibling's journey over the past decade is unique and captivating. June (Juniper/Junie), the most fully developed character, stands out as a professional soccer coach navigating her queer androgynous identity and her upcoming marriage, which makes her story particularly compelling. The youngest sibling, July, grapples with his first crushes and relationships in college, offering a relatable, youthful perspective. With two of the siblings identifying as queer, the narrative gains depth and diversity. June's exploration of identity and shifting societal attitudes toward gay marriage is especially noteworthy.",
            "The historical information is largely presented through monologues, which separates it from the narrative and makes it less engaging.",
            "The story unexpectedly explores the impact of the Iraq War on a family, diverging from what the book's cover and blurb suggest.",
            "The book cover and blurb hinted at a family drama revolving around relationships and a wedding, but I was surprised by the emphasis on the Iraq War, which was not what I sought in a relaxing read. Set a decade ago, the timeframe felt too recent to be considered historical fiction, yet the political events discussed lacked the immediacy to feel truly relevant."

        "conclusion": "This novel offers a poignant exploration of family dynamics and the impact of the Iraq War, with strong character development and meaningful queer representation. However, the heavy focus on historical and political context, delivered in a less engaging manner, detracted from the family drama I anticipated. While it may appeal to readers interested in the intersection of personal and political histories, it didn’t fully meet my expectations for a relaxing, relationship-centered story.",

            "The title intrigued me, but the siblings' names—April, May, June, and July—proved distracting. While April and May are fitting, June (short for Juniper) and July (for a boy) felt overly quirky and disrupted my immersion in the story. April, the eldest, grapples with control issues that manifest in her marriage.",

Its intense and poignant narrative provides a candid exploration of how trauma impacts individuals and their families.",

While April and May are acceptable, June (short for Juniper) and July (for a boy) felt unnecessarily quirky and pulled me out of the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Timeline:**  \n   - The story is set 10 years ago and focuses on events from 10 years prior to that. It spans the 10 months leading up to June's wedding, during which the siblings grapple with the unresolved trauma of their father's disappearance during the Iraq War.  \n\n- **Character Development and Trauma:**  \n   - Each sibling is deeply affected by their father's absence in distinct ways:  \n     - April, the eldest, struggles with control issues and acts out in her marriage.  \n     - May faces commitment issues and a failure to launch into adulthood.  \n     - June self-medicates with alcohol, sports, and unhealthy habits in her relationship with her fiancée, Hana.  \n     - July, who was only 9 when their father disappeared, grows up as the only man in a family of women and grapples with questions about his sexual identity without a male role model.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The novel explores heavy themes such as generational trauma, dysfunctional families, co-dependent relationships, substance abuse, depression, and the search for closure.  \n   - The story is intense and sad, offering an honest portrayal of how trauma shapes individuals and families.  \n\n- **Engagement and Genre Suitability:**  \n   - While the book wasn’t my favorite, it is well-crafted and emotionally impactful.

Each sibling navigates their father's disappearance in their own way, and I appreciated the exploration of their unique experiences. The siblings' journey of growing apart and eventually reconnecting adds depth to their relationships and enhances the story's emotional impact.",
            "Although I wouldn't categorize this as historical fiction, the author skillfully provides context about the political climate and conflicts in the Middle East during the early 2000s. This informative background is seamlessly woven into the narrative, enhancing the story without overshadowing it."

        "conclusion": "This novel masterfully weaves together themes of grief, family, and mystery against the backdrop of the early 2000s Middle Eastern political climate.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Potential:**  \n   - The book had a lot of potential but ultimately did not live up to it.  \n   - The story revolves around four siblings—April, May, June, and July—who grew apart after their father went missing 10 years ago while stationed in Iraq.  \n   - The reunion for a family wedding becomes complicated when April spots their father, adding a layer of mystery to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n   - Each sibling is affected differently by their father’s disappearance, which was both interesting and saddening to explore.  \n   - April seeks control but also craves unruliness outside her marriage.  \n   - May struggles with commitment and stability.  \n   - June is an undiagnosed alcoholic about to marry her fiancé, Hana.  \n   - July grapples with his sexual identity and unrequited love for his straight roommate.  \n   - However, the relationship dynamics and character growth were not explored as deeply as expected.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n   - While tagged as contemporary fiction, the book leans more into historical fiction with its focus on the Iraq War and a touch of mystery.  \n   - The historical/war elements, particularly around the Iraq War, were not as engaging for me personally.  \n\n- **Strengths and Weaknesses:**  \n   - The exploration of family trauma and its impact on each sibling was a strong point.  \n   - The heavy reliance on solving the mystery of their father’s absence overshadowed other potential aspects, such as deeper relationship dynamics and character growth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a compelling premise with its focus on sibling relationships and family trauma, but it fell short in fully exploring character development and relationship dynamics. The shift toward historical fiction and war elements, while unexpected, did not resonate with me as much as I had hoped. Overall, it’s a decent read for those interested in sibling stories, family drama, and historical/war themes, but it could have been more impactful with a stronger focus on its characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.2/5  \n\n**Read if you like:**  \n- Stories about siblings  \n- Historical/war elements  \n- Family drama  \n\nThank you to Netgalley and the publisher for a gifted eARC in exchange for an honest review. :) #aprilmayjunejuly #alisonbhart #bookreview"

Their varied reactions to their father's kidnapping and presumed death in Iraq reflect their ages and family roles, but the emphasis on all four siblings results in a scattered plot. A tighter focus on one or two characters could have enhanced the story's cohesion.",

The story revolves around estranged siblings—April, May, June, and July—who reunite after a potential sighting of their father, who has been missing for 10 years. The narrative delves into heavy themes like war, specifically the Iraq-Afghanistan conflict, and familial strife, which was not what I anticipated based on the cover.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book did not meet my expectations, as the tone and themes were much darker and more intense than the cover suggested.
