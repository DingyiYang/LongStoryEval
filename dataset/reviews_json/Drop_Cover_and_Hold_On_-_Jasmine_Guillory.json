            "The story follows Daisy on Valentine’s Day, narrated entirely from her perspective. While she intends to enjoy a cozy night in, she unexpectedly finds herself at a bakery owned by Harris, a man who seemingly harbors resentment towards her. An earthquake disrupts the evening, setting off unforeseen events. The premise is both charming and engaging, enhanced by humorous touches, including clever puns related to the earthquake. This 40-page short story is ideal for a single sitting, offering a brisk pace that never feels rushed despite its brevity.",

Harris, a grumpy yet endearing figure reminiscent of Mr. Darcy, conceals his feelings for Daisy beneath a rough exterior, adding depth to his character.

While some readers may feel the romantic progression is too rapid, especially their willingness to become intimate soon after the earthquake, I found it fitting for the story's tone and length.",

The pacing feels rushed, as there is a lot of buildup that the reader doesn’t experience firsthand.\n- **Character Dynamics:** The \"grumpy sunshine\" pairing is cute and engaging, though it requires the reader to suspend disbelief, especially regarding the instant connection between the characters.\n- **Romantic Elements:** The story includes a touch of spice, which adds an unexpected but enjoyable layer to the typical \"meet cute\" scenarios.\n- **Reader Engagement:** The novel is enjoyable if the reader is open to the \"insta love\" trope and can overlook the lack of detailed buildup.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel is a lighthearted and cute read, particularly for fans of the \"insta love\" and \"grumpy sunshine\" tropes. While the pacing and lack of detailed buildup might be a drawback for some, the addition of spicy moments and the charming character dynamics make it an entertaining experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The story follows Daisy Murray and her encounter with a baker on Valentine’s Day, culminating in an earthquake that forces them to take shelter under a table. At just 40 pages, the novella feels too brief to adequately develop the plot or the characters' relationship. The pacing is rushed, particularly with the insta-love trope, which lacks sufficient backstory and emotional depth. Compared to the author’s full-length novels, this novella feels underwhelming and less engaging. The limitations of the short format hinder a more thorough exploration of the story, characters, and setting.",
            "While the story features Daisy as the female main character (FMC), her repetitive assertions that the baker hates her render her one-dimensional. The absence of the baker's perspective detracts from the romance, as insights into his thoughts and feelings could have added depth and believability. Without sufficient character backstory or development, it becomes challenging to connect with or invest in them. The romance feels forced and underdeveloped, leaning heavily on the insta-love trope. Although the earthquake scene serves as a unique mechanism to bring the characters together, it doesn't compensate for the lack of emotional depth and meaningful interaction. The story concludes abruptly, leaving me wanting more clarity about what unfolds after the earthquake.",

However, I found the baker's grumpiness somewhat unconvincing, which slightly detracted from the believability of his character.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The novella includes positive plus-size representation, which is refreshing and well-executed.  \n\n- **Tone/Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the minor issue with the baker's characterization, the story is fun and funny, making it an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novella offers a lighthearted and entertaining story with a unique premise and strong plus-size representation. While the baker's grumpiness didn't fully resonate with me, the humor and charm of the FMC made it a delightful read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The forced proximity forces them to finally get to know each other. The Valentine’s Day setting, combined with baked goods and decadent desserts, creates a charming and cozy atmosphere.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The grumpy baker and the sunshine customer (Daisy) with a “resting smile face” make for an endearing dynamic. While I found Daisy’s obliviousness to the obvious a bit frustrating at times, her overall charm and the baker’s grumpy yet endearing personality balanced it out.  \n\n- **Romance Tropes:**  \n  The novella incorporates popular romance tropes like grumpy x sunshine, foodie romance, and he falls first, which are executed in a lighthearted and enjoyable way.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The story is super cute and feels like a ray of sunshine, making it a delightful read. The foodie elements and the cozy bakery setting add to the overall charm.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While I enjoyed the novella, it wasn’t my favorite. On a second read, I found myself lowering my rating slightly to 3.5⭐️. It’s cute and enjoyable, but it didn’t fully captivate me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis adorable novella is a light, feel-good read perfect for fans of grumpy x sunshine dynamics, foodie romances, and forced proximity tropes. While it didn’t completely win me over, it’s still a charming and cozy story, especially for Valentine’s Day.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️"

This made it harder to stay engaged with the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt underdeveloped, and their traits were questionable. The male lead’s behavior was inconsistent—he supposedly fell for the female lead at first sight but spent months glaring at her, which she interpreted as hatred. His explanation that his glaring was his “normal people” equivalent of smiling felt unconvincing and poorly executed.  \n\n- **Romantic Premise:**  \n  The romance felt forced and unrealistic. The sudden shift in their relationship during an earthquake, where he confesses his feelings after months of apparent hostility, didn’t feel believable. The dialogue, like “Because you hate me, that’s why!” highlighted the lack of depth in their interactions.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The novel was very short—I finished it in about 30 minutes. While this meant I didn’t waste much time, it also left little room for meaningful development. The few pages were further diluted by unnecessary explicit scenes, which felt like a waste of space.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  This book didn’t live up to the quality of the previous three in the series. It lacked the depth and coherence I expected based on the earlier installments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was still somewhat interesting and quick to read, it fell short in several areas, including writing style, character development, and romantic execution. The pacing was too rushed, and the explicit scenes felt unnecessary. Overall, it didn’t meet the standards set by the earlier books in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

My only critique is that it could have been slightly longer to better develop the characters and their relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this book to be a cute and enjoyable read, despite its short length.

It was well-described and added some depth to the story, though it wasn’t enough to fully compensate for other shortcomings.  \n- **Plot/Overall Story (2/4):** The plot felt underwhelming and didn’t hold my interest as much as I expected. The overall story lacked the engagement I was hoping for, especially compared to other books in the series.  \n- **Writing (3/4):** The writing itself was decent, with clear descriptions and a good flow. However, it wasn’t enough to elevate the weaker aspects of the book.  \n\n**Content Notes:**  \n- Moderate: Sexual content (open-door scene and innuendo throughout), Earthquake.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was my least favorite book in the series so far. While the setting and writing were relatively strong, the characters, romance, and plot didn’t resonate with me, making it difficult to fully enjoy the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Characters: 2/4  \n- Connection to the Book/Enjoyment: 2/4  \n- Setting: 3/4  \n- Plot/Overall Story: 2/4  \n- Writing: 3/4  \n- Total: 2.5/5 (calculated based on the provided scoring system)."

The transition from the male character being shy and awkward to suddenly becoming flirty and suave didn’t feel natural. I thought this shift should have been more nuanced.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The lust came on too strong, which felt jarring and didn’t align well with the initial tone of the story.  \n\n- **Author’s Intent and Style:**  \n  I recognize that the author was trying to showcase her talents and style in this short story to introduce herself to new readers. In that context, it definitely hits the mark.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the issues, the story was still enjoyable and fun to read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story had some inconsistencies in character development and pacing, it was an enjoyable read overall. The author’s effort to introduce her style and talents shines through, making it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars"

            "The novella centers on the romantic encounter between Daisy and Harris, the owner of a bakery that Daisy is obsessed with. Initially hesitant to engage with him, their relationship takes a turn when a 6.8 magnitude earthquake forces them into close proximity. However, the plot struggles to convincingly bridge the gap between their emotional states and the swift progression of their intimacy.",
            "Daisy is kind-hearted yet somewhat naive, mistaking Harris's extra pastries for incompetence rather than affection. Harris, infatuated with Daisy from the beginning, struggles to express his feelings, resorting to scowls and stares. Unfortunately, both characters feel underdeveloped; their emotional responses to the earthquake and their budding attraction come across as rushed and unconvincing. The romance lacks adequate build-up, with a kiss and a hand-in-hand walk occurring shortly after the earthquake, making the fast-paced intimacy feel forced and lacking credibility. There isn't enough dialogue or tension to justify their connection. Additionally, the novella falters in its use of the \"meet-cute\" trope, as Daisy and Harris's initial encounter happens off-screen, rendering their reencounter more of a second chance than a charming first meeting.",
            "The writing style is engaging, but the novella's brevity restricts the depth of both the story and character development. The pacing feels rushed, especially in the transition from the earthquake to the characters' intimacy, which leaves little room for emotional or narrative exploration.",
            "The novella explores themes of forced proximity and second chances but ultimately falls short in execution. While the idea of a near-death experience as a catalyst for romance is intriguing, it feels underutilized. The story struggles to balance the tension and charm typically found in a “meet-cute” narrative."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The author’s “Drop, Cover, and Hold On” is a quick, lighthearted read with an intriguing premise, but it suffers from underdeveloped characters, rushed romantic progression, and a lack of emotional depth. While the earthquake scenario adds a unique twist, the novella fails to fully capitalize on its potential, leaving the romance feeling unconvincing and the story incomplete.",

The insta-love trope felt accelerated at warp speed, which made the romance feel rushed.  \n- **Character Chemistry:**  \n  I enjoyed the chemistry between the characters, which was one of the highlights of the story.  \n- **Setting and Descriptions:**  \n  The bakery descriptions were delightful and added a charming atmosphere to the narrative.  \n- **Plot Development:**  \n  I felt the story could have been more fully developed if there had been a scene of the characters together at the bakery before the earthquake, rather than relying on retellings and flashbacks.  \n- **Series Connections:**  \n  I appreciated the mention of the bakery and the earthquake in *Rosie and the Dreamboat*, which made me curious if I missed similar callbacks in the other books. I also wondered if all the main characters in the series would have flower/plant names, like Terra, Holly, Rosie, and Daisy.  \n- **Narration:**  \n  Aure Nash's narration was terrific, especially Daisy's internal monologue as she tried to stay away from the bakery. Nash is my favorite voice actor in the series so far.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the chemistry, bakery descriptions, and narration, the story felt too short and rushed, leaving me wishing for more development and a stronger connection to the series' overarching themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Daisy, who intends to spend Valentine's Day alone but finds herself trapped in a bakery with Harris, the grumpy baker she thinks dislikes her. An earthquake forces them into close quarters, prompting candid discussions about their misunderstandings and past interactions. While the novella is charming, its pacing feels rushed, particularly in the development of their relationship. A longer format with more buildup and less repetition would have greatly enhanced the narrative.",
            "Daisy initially appears immature, frequently expressing her belief that Harris hates her, which feels excessive. As the story unfolds, Harris reveals secrets and becomes more tender, but this transition feels abrupt, veering into insta-love territory.",
            "The novella employs a third-person point of view, which feels inconsistent compared to the author's usual dual or single perspectives. While the writing is accessible, the repetitive emphasis on certain ideas, such as Daisy's belief that Harris hates her, diminishes the overall reading experience.",
            "The story effectively employs familiar tropes such as Grumpy x Sunshine, Forced Proximity, and Enemies to Lovers. While these elements are well-executed, they could benefit from deeper development. The mild spice introduced towards the end adds a nice touch of romance."

I am so impressed with how each author handled the prompt in their own way.\n\n- **Character Development and Chemistry:**  \n  - *The Exception to the Rule - Christina Lauren:* The characters were smart, funny, quirky, and the chemistry and tension were great with Christina Lauren’s signature witty banter.  \n  - *Worst Wingman Ever - Abby Jimenez:* This one had emotional depth but was also sweet and had some humor. Abby’s ability to tie in life’s harder moments with the lightheartedness of romance is truly a gift.  \n  - *With Any Luck - Ashley Poston:* I loved how quickly we got to know the main characters, and I did not predict this ending!  \n  - *Rosy and the Dreamboat - Sally Thorpe:* The witty banter and ridiculousness of this story were so good. I only deducted a star because the fireman was caricature-ish.  \n  - *Drop, Cover and Hold On - Jasmine Guillory:* The FMC was sort of irritating, and the two MCs lacked chemistry, and then were in bed together. It was too rushed but still worth the quick read.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - *With Any Luck - Ashley Poston:* This was highly unpredictable, which is rare in a romance, and especially in a short story.  \n  - *Royal Valentine - Sariah Wilson:* This story felt too short and rushed! Clearly, I need to go read her other books.  \n  - *Drop, Cover and Hold On - Jasmine Guillory:* The story was too rushed but still worth the quick read.\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  - *Rosy and the Dreamboat - Sally Thorpe:* This one honestly had me laughing out loud.

            "In this story, Daisy, a devoted bakery customer, decides to sever ties with the owner, convinced he harbors animosity towards her. However, their paths collide during an earthquake in San Francisco. Initially, the narrative suffers from forced proximity and an unrealistic instalove dynamic. Fortunately, it picks up around the 20% mark. As a California native, I found the earthquake depiction lacking in authenticity; the portrayal of panic and the subsequent redecorating felt exaggerated, unless it was a nod to the 1989 quake.",

            "I appreciated how the forced proximity between Daisy and Harris encouraged them to open up to each other. Daisy's confrontation of Harris regarding his poor treatment added depth to their relationship. I also liked that Harris saved a box of her favorite treats, anticipating they would sell out on Valentine’s Day, which revealed a thoughtful side to his character. However, I found Daisy's obliviousness to Harris's hints, like the free pastries, frustrating. His gruffness in their earlier interactions felt inconsistent with his later behavior. The transition to intimacy felt abrupt, and while there was some chemistry between the characters, it was too subtle to convincingly support their feelings and future together. Overall, the shift from tension to intimacy seemed rushed.",

Daisy frequents a bakery despite the grumpy baker, Harris, who scowls at her. She vows never to return but can't resist his delicious pastries. On Valentine's Day, an earthquake traps them together in the bakery, which I found to be a creative setup.  \n\n- **Character Development and Interaction:**  \n  I liked that the forced proximity finally prompted Daisy and Harris to open up to each other. Daisy confronted Harris about his poor treatment of her, which added depth to their dynamic. I also appreciated that Harris saved a box of her favorite treats, knowing they’d sell out on Valentine’s Day—it showed a thoughtful side to his character.  \n\n- **Pacing and Chemistry:**  \n  The leap to fooling around felt abrupt. While the characters didn’t entirely lack chemistry, it felt too subtle to justify the certainty about their feelings and future. The progression from tension to intimacy seemed rushed.  \n\n- **Character Awareness and Communication:**  \n  I didn’t like how clueless Daisy was about the hints Harris had been giving her, like the free pastries. His gruffness in their past interactions was confusing and didn’t align well with his later actions.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The line “And then the cow jumped over the moon, lol” added a humorous touch, though it felt a bit out of place in the context of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a quick read with an interesting meet-cute and some charming moments, particularly in the forced proximity scenario.

While the earthquake scenario was improbable, they had already met before, which took away from the charm of a true \"improbable meet-cute.\" Daisy had been to the bakery multiple times, and their dynamic was more of an enemies-to-lovers setup, which didn’t feel fresh or engaging for a short story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I struggled to connect with the characters due to the rushed progression of their relationship. The transition from despising each other to jumping into bed felt too abrupt and unrealistic. I wish the story had been longer so I could have gotten to know the characters better and seen their relationship develop more naturally.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  As a short story, the pacing felt off. The hate-to-love trope requires more time to establish the tension and resolve it convincingly, which this format didn’t allow. I think this story would have worked better as a full-length novel, where the characters and their relationship could have been explored in greater depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise had potential, the execution fell short for me.

The earthquake setting and the vulnerability of the characters were highlights, but the story felt rushed in places. Overall, it’s a fun and quick read that fits well within the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There was no proper buildup, and the conversations felt shallow.  \n\n- **Spice and Romantic Scenes:**  \n  I love spice in my books, but this one just made me cringe.  \n\n- **Series Overall Appeal:**  \n  The series was cute and entertaining overall.

The first two books were such good starters, and I loved both of them so much!  \n\n- **Adaptation Potential:**  \n  I wouldn’t mind if this was turned into a TV series like *Modern Love*.

            "I found the romance unconvincing. The love interest's behavior, particularly glaring at the female protagonist, contradicted the notion of subtle attraction. While misreading facial expressions or appearing unapproachable can be understandable, glaring felt overly harsh and unnatural. On the other hand, it seemed implausible that the female lead failed to notice the love interest's hints, such as consistently offering her extra baked goods three times a week. This lack of awareness felt forced and unrealistic, undermining the believability of their interactions."

If it hadn’t included that, I probably would have rated it lower.  \n\n- **Series Comparison:**  \n  I’m honestly shocked this book received lower ratings than the previous one in the series. My current ranking for the series is:  \n  1. *The Exception to the Rule*  \n  2. *Worst Wingman Ever*  \n  3. *Drop, Cover, and Hold On*  \n  4. *Rosie and the Dreamboat*  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the fast-paced nature of the enemies-to-lovers trope might not resonate with all readers, the addition of spice at the end elevated my enjoyment of the book.

An earthquake traps them together, revealing the owner's hidden crush on her. The plot is straightforward and leans heavily on the \"insta-love\" trope, which is a recurring theme in the series.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The FMC is portrayed as someone who misinterprets the bakery owner's feelings, adding a layer of misunderstanding that drives the narrative. The owner's sudden revelation of his crush feels somewhat abrupt, leaving little room for deeper character exploration.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The story is a quick and easy read/listen, making it accessible but not particularly deep. The pacing aligns with the light, breezy tone of the narrative, though it sacrifices complexity for brevity.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works in the Series:**  \n  While this story wasn't my favorite, it also wasn't the worst in *The Improbable Meet-Cute* collection. It shares the common trait of \"insta-love\" with most of the other six stories, which may appeal to fans of the trope but feels repetitive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis story is a light, quick read with a predictable yet charming premise.

However, it came together quickly, and the relationship between the characters developed swiftly.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Daisy, the protagonist, loves visiting her local bakery but believes the baker hates her because he always glares at her. This dynamic adds an intriguing layer to their interactions.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  A 6.8 earthquake shakes things up, creating a forced proximity scenario that accelerates the connection between Daisy and the baker. This event serves as a catalyst for their relationship.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  This is the first book in the series that includes some spice, adding a new dimension to the storytelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite feeling shorter than other books in the series, the story comes together quickly, with a compelling dynamic between Daisy and the baker. The earthquake serves as a clever plot device to bring the characters closer, and the introduction of spice adds a fresh element to the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "This story takes a different approach to the typical meet-cute trope, as the couple is already acquainted. They find themselves trapped in the MMC's bakery after an earthquake, which prompts them to confess their feelings and share intimate moments. While this scenario is engaging, it feels somewhat disconnected from the overall narrative, which leans towards charming and lighthearted beginnings. Although the tone remains cute, it doesn't quite match the style of previous installments. The absence of a traditional meet-cute makes this segment feel less cohesive with the rest of the series.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Narrative Perspective:**  \n  I didn’t enjoy that the story was written in the third person. It felt less personal to me, and I prefer first-person narratives.\n\n- **Character Dynamics (Obsession and Subtle Gestures):**  \n  The way the male character was obsessed with her was captivating. His small, thoughtful actions, like sneaking extra pastries to her without her realizing, added depth to his character. The moment he covered her during the earthquake was incredibly touching and showed his protective nature.  \n\n- **Romantic Gestures:**  \n  His effort to make her favorite pies just to see her happy was heartwarming. It highlighted his dedication and love for her.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The line, *“Do you have any idea how many times I've dreamed of this? So many times, but the reality is far better than my imagination,”* was incredibly romantic and left a lasting impression on me. It perfectly captured the intensity of his feelings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my dislike for the third-person narrative, the story’s romantic elements, particularly the male character’s obsession and thoughtful gestures, made it memorable. The emotional depth and tender moments between the characters were the highlights for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I could identify this trope within the first five pages of the novel, which made it predictable and frustrating for me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  Although this is part of a collection of novellas, this particular story felt excessively short and rushed. The pacing didn’t allow for proper development or immersion, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel's reliance on a predictable trope and its rushed pacing made it difficult for me to fully engage with the story. While it may appeal to readers who enjoy quick, light reads, it fell short of my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows a female main character who is enamored with a bakery run by a handsome owner. On Valentine’s Day, an earthquake strikes, leaving them trapped together in the empty shop. This straightforward premise highlights their unexpected connection. Spanning just 40 pages, the narrative is a quick read, but the rapid development of their relationship may not satisfy readers who favor slower, more nuanced romantic arcs.",

On Valentine’s Day, she visits the bakery, and an earthquake occurs, trapping them together in the empty bakery. The premise is simple and centers on their sudden connection.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  The romance is fast-paced, leaning heavily into the \"instalove\" trope. There’s a spicy makeout scene and a fade-to-black scene at the very end, which adds a touch of intimacy but leaves much to the imagination.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The story is concise, spanning about 40 pages. While this makes for a quick read, it also means the relationship develops rapidly, which might not appeal to readers who prefer slower, more detailed romantic arcs.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The bakery setting is charming and adds a cozy, romantic vibe to the story. The earthquake creates a sense of urgency and tension, heightening the emotional connection between the characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis short novel offers a quick, steamy read with a straightforward premise and a focus on instant romantic connection.

This small detail touched my heart and added a layer of sweetness to the story.  \n\n- **Author's Writing Style:**  \n  The author's writing style doesn't resonate with me. While I acknowledge that many readers enjoy her work, I've decided not to pick up another book by this author in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a few touching moments, the instalove trope and the author's writing style didn't work for me. I won't be reading more from this author, but I can see why others might enjoy her stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 Stars"

This lack of realism didn't work for me, though it might appeal to romance readers who prioritize emotional engagement over factual accuracy.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The overuse of exclamations in this short piece was very distracting and detracted from the overall reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel might resonate with romance readers who are less concerned with realism, it fell short for me due to its unrealistic portrayal of post-earthquake behavior and the distracting writing style.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars"

His excuse for his unfriendly behavior—claiming he struggles to appear approachable—fails to add depth to his character. The romance escalates unrealistically, jumping from animosity to intimacy in a matter of moments, with only a few superficial exchanges leading to a sudden connection.

His awkwardness was so pronounced that it detracted from my enjoyment of the story.  \n  - The character's behavior was cringe-worthy, and it contributed to the overall \"meh\" feeling I had about the book.  \n\n- **Plot and Engagement:**  \n  - The story didn’t hold my interest, and I can understand why it has a low average rating. It felt very underwhelming and failed to engage me.  \n\n- **Descriptive Elements:**  \n  - One positive aspect was the description of the pastries, which sounded delicious and added a small highlight to the otherwise lackluster experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel fell short for me due to the awkward and cringe-inducing male protagonist and the lack of an engaging plot. While the descriptions of the pastries were a nice touch, they weren’t enough to salvage the reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

In contrast, Harris comes across as overly aggressive and grumpy, making it challenging to find him redeemable in such a brief story. His behavior fluctuates between sweet and charming one moment and overly alpha and gruff the next, creating an inconsistency that undermines the believability of Daisy feeling comfortable enough to take him to bed.",

This felt inconsistent and unrealistic.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The wording used during the romantic scenes, particularly when they started to make out, made me cringe.

            "The novel felt rushed and overly brief, with the entire story unfolding in a single scene, leaving little room for character development or depth.

Additionally, after an earthquake, he manages to clean up broken glass before she notices his bleeding. The inconsistency in the text messaging—where she can receive but not send texts—also stood out as a notable flaw.",

I was excited for the chance to try another by this author as part of the Improbable Meet Cute series from Audible.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  This Valentine's Day, Daisy decides she's never going back to her favorite bakery because of how rude the head baker/owner is to her every time she comes in. However, she gives it one last try, and during her visit, a once-in-a-lifetime earthquake strikes, forcing the two together. The story explores whether they can get along and play nice.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Comparison:**  \n  This was okay. It wasn't as good as the first few books I've read by Guillory, but it was still such a quick read that it was worth it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book didn't quite meet the high expectations set by the author's previous works, it was a quick and enjoyable read, making it worth the time.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐⭐"

This structure feels disjointed and lacks a smooth transition.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style did not resonate with me. It felt unengaging and failed to draw me into the story or the characters' emotions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I did not enjoy this short story. The immature characterization, disjointed plot, and unengaging writing style made it difficult for me to connect with or appreciate the narrative.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The story felt rushed, especially with the abrupt introduction of a sex scene. There wasn’t enough buildup or chemistry to justify it, which made the scene feel out of place and cringy.  \n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Daisy’s character was likable, but Harris came across as unintelligent and frustrating. The dynamic between them felt unbalanced, with Daisy having to constantly explain things to him, which detracted from their connection.  \n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  The romantic progression felt forced and unnatural. Daisy making the first move after Harris expressed his feelings didn’t feel authentic, and the lack of chemistry made the relationship fall flat.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the story had potential initially, the execution of the romantic elements and character interactions left me disappointed. The abrupt shift in tone and lack of depth made it hard to enjoy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel started strong but faltered due to rushed romantic development, lack of chemistry, and an unbalanced dynamic between the main characters. The abrupt and cringy scenes overshadowed the potential of the story, leaving me unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 ⭐️"

The plot takes a sudden turn when an earthquake traps them together, leading to an instant romantic connection. The progression from dislike to love feels rushed and lacks depth.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The bakery owner appears to have a crush on the customer, as he gives her extra pastries, but his behavior—grunting and glaring—contradicts this, making her feel disliked. Their dynamic shifts abruptly after the earthquake, with their feelings turning romantic almost instantly, which feels unrealistic.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The transition from their initial interactions to becoming a couple happens \"literally that fast,\" which makes the relationship development feel unconvincing and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The insta-love trope and the lack of meaningful buildup between the characters made the story feel shallow and unengaging. The emotional connection between the characters didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel’s premise had potential, but the rushed pacing and lack of depth in character development and emotional engagement left me feeling underwhelmed. The insta-love trope, combined with the abrupt shift in their relationship, made the story feel unrealistic and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nMeh.

A slower, more deliberate exploration of their connection would have made the story more fulfilling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The transition from the protagonist thinking the male lead hated her to being intimate with him within 30 minutes was jarring and unrealistic.  \n- **Character Development:** The protagonist's tendency to overthink everything made her actions and decisions feel inconsistent and hard to connect with.  \n- **Story Length:** The novel would have benefited from being longer, as the rushed pacing and lack of depth could have been addressed with more time to develop the plot and characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential, its rushed pacing, inconsistent character behavior, and lack of depth made it difficult to fully enjoy. A longer story with more development could have significantly improved the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️.5 / 5"

The lack of significant events, combined with underdeveloped characters, made the novel feel bland and unmemorable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a short length, it lacked meaningful plot progression and character development. The focus on trivial details like baked goods and the unconvincing romance made the story forgettable and unengaging.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Her personality and actions made her extremely unlikable and frustrating to follow throughout the story.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This entire book was probably the worst thing I’ve ever read. Despite its flaws, I stayed up all night reading it, which suggests it had some level of engagement or addictive quality, even if it wasn’t enjoyable in a traditional sense.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the FMC was highly unlikable and the book overall was disappointing, it managed to hold my attention enough to finish it in one sitting.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Their actions and decisions lack believability, making it hard to connect with or root for them.\n\n- **Plot Coherence:**  \n  The story lacks logical progression and coherence. For instance, the main character's immediate reaction to an earthquake—deciding to have sex with someone they previously thought hated them—feels absurd and disconnected from any realistic emotional or situational context.\n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  The overall reading experience was disappointing. The combination of an unlikable protagonist and a nonsensical plot made it difficult to stay engaged or enjoy the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel fell short on multiple fronts, with an unrelatable main character and a plot that defies logic. The lack of coherence and believability made it a frustrating and unenjoyable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1 ⭐"

            "The protagonist's inner monologue in the opening pages is overly detailed, fixating on trivial choices like selecting pastries. Her belief that the baker dislikes her due to her size feels forced and unrealistic. Additionally, the romantic interest's abrupt transition from rudeness to flirtation is unconvincing and poorly executed. His comments about the protagonist's weight, even in a flirtatious context, come across as insensitive and off-putting. The romantic interactions evoke more of a daddy-daughter dynamic than a genuine connection. Furthermore, the protagonist's childish remarks, such as \"but you hate me,\" are cringe-worthy and reminiscent of a tantrum rather than a mature romantic exchange.",

I often found myself rolling my eyes and giggling at the awkwardness and lack of believability in their interactions. The intimate scene is particularly criticized for its cringe-worthy comparisons, such as likening lovemaking to earthquakes. Additionally, the post-intimacy dialogue, featuring the clichéd \"I never do this\" speech and pastry pillow talk, is poorly executed and unintentionally humorous."

The example provided encapsulates the forced romantic tension and awkward dialogue, which dominates the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel did not resonate with me due to its immature writing style, poorly executed tropes, and over-reliance on telling rather than showing. The story lacks depth and subtlety, making it feel repetitive and uninspired.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Her inability to recognize Harris's advances felt frustrating and unrealistic.\n  - Harris comes across as somewhat creepy, which added an uncomfortable dynamic to the story.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n  - The writing style didn’t resonate with me personally, though I can acknowledge the author’s intent and effort.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n  - The story felt chaotic and over-the-top, but not in a way that was enjoyable or engaging. It lacked the kind of controlled insanity I was hoping for.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I appreciate the author’s attempt to create a unique narrative, the characters and plot fell short of my expectations. Daisy’s lack of awareness and Harris’s unsettling behavior made it hard to enjoy the story, and the writing style didn’t align with my preferences. Overall, the novel didn’t deliver the kind of compelling chaos I was anticipating.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

It relies on familiar tropes such as insta-attraction, grumpy x sunshine, opposites attract, and miscommunication. However, the miscommunication aspect falls flat.

While I can understand other elements of miscommunication, this one is hard to accept; giving dirty looks clearly signals disinterest.",

The quick pacing and short length didn't allow for much depth, and the abrupt shift to smut at the end felt out of place. However, I might consider reading something else by this author, given their expertise in food writing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story presents an enemies-to-lovers trope but ultimately lacks depth and feels underdeveloped. The premise, featuring a male baker and his best customer, holds promise, yet the execution falls short. The conflict—rooted in the female protagonist's belief that the male lead dislikes her due to his resting face—resolves too quickly and unconvincingly during an earthquake, leading to an abrupt make-out session. The pacing is rushed, and the ending feels incomplete. With more character development and a deeper exploration of their relationship, the story could have been much more satisfying. Instead, it concludes too soon, leaving the resolution unfulfilling.",
            "The characters lacked meaningful backstories, making it difficult to connect with them. The male protagonist was defined solely by his New York origins and his confusion about earthquakes, while the female protagonist was characterized only by her California roots and knowledge of earthquakes. This minimal development left the characters feeling flat and unengaging.",

Their progression from kissing to crying to going to the bedroom felt rushed and lacked emotional depth.\n\n- **Trope Execution (Grumpy x Sunshine):**  \n  The book was marketed as a grumpy x sunshine romance, but it failed to deliver on this trope. The male character wasn’t truly grumpy—he just had a resting b*tch face (RBF). There were no cute or endearing moments that typically make this trope enjoyable, which was a major letdown.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The interactions between the characters felt shallow and lacked chemistry. The male character’s mood swings and the female character’s sudden change of heart didn’t feel authentic or well-developed. Their relationship lacked the charm and emotional connection I was hoping for.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The book was disappointing and didn’t meet my expectations.

This rapid progression felt unnatural and uncomfortable for me.  \n\n- **Trope Execution (Enemies to Lovers with Miscommunication):**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers trope, combined with miscommunication, didn’t feel well-suited for such a short story. It lacked the depth and development needed to make this dynamic believable.  \n\n- **Premise:**  \n  The premise was cute and had potential, but the execution fell short due to the rushed pacing and underdeveloped relationship dynamics.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a promising and cute premise, the romance felt rushed and poorly executed, especially with the enemies-to-lovers trope and miscommunication elements. The story could have benefited from more gradual development to make the relationship feel more authentic.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The use of \"he said\" and \"she said\" throughout the story felt impersonal and made it harder for me to connect with the characters.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n  The dialogue felt overly simplistic and clichéd. For example, the line, “I wasn’t giving everyone free stuff. I was giving you free stuff. Because I fell for you that first moment I heard you laugh that day,” came across as basic and uninspired.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The plot twist was predictable and lacked depth. It felt like a generic, overused trope that didn’t add any meaningful complexity to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book disappointing due to its impersonal narrative style, clichéd dialogue, and lackluster plot twist. It failed to engage me or offer anything original.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.75★"

It might have made more sense if they were childhood friends trapped in close quarters, getting to know each other better, rather than jumping straight into a physical relationship with a stranger they were actively avoiding.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The conversation between the characters flowed better compared to the third book, but the pacing was too fast. The brevity of the story, while impressive in some ways, made the relationship development feel rushed and superficial.  \n\n- **Steamy Scenes:**  \n  Given the book's short length, I was surprised and impressed that the author managed to include steamy scenes.

It felt unrealistic and hard to believe.  \n   - The line, \"It's okay, they're all okay,\" irritated me because it contradicted her actions—she was kissing him passionately just before receiving their texts.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n   - The execution of the story felt awkward, and the moving parts didn’t flow well.  \n   - I struggled to get through even 40 pages, which suggests the writing style didn’t resonate with me.  \n   - At this point, I’m not sure I get along with Guillory’s writing style, and this may be my farewell to trying her books.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Suitability:**  \n   - This could have been a fun and sweet read, but it fell short for me.  \n   - It might be a cute read for others looking to pass the time, but it didn’t work for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had potential but was ultimately disappointing due to its rushed pacing, unrealistic character decisions, and awkward execution. While it might appeal to some as a light, quick read, it didn’t align with my preferences, and I likely won’t be exploring more of Guillory’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot felt even thinner in this novella, which is typical for the genre. As always, the story features the familiar trope of insta-love.",
            "The MMC's tendency to ignore her due to his nervousness and infatuation—especially when he first met her and heard her laugh—was intended to be endearing, but I found it immature. It's time for him to grow up.",

        "conclusion": "While the novel lacked substantial plot development and featured an immature portrayal of the male main character, it still provided some lighthearted moments and was enjoyable as a quick audiobook. However, upon reflection, my initial rating of 2.5 dropped to 1.5, as the flaws became more apparent over time.",
