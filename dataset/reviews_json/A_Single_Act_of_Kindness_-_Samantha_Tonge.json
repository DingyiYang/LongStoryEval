            "Initially, I wasn't a fan of Tilda, the main character. However, as the story progressed, my perception shifted as I discovered the layers of her personality, much like peeling an onion. Milo helps to reveal the true Tilda, showcasing her wisdom beyond her years. Her journey of learning to disregard others' opinions really resonated with me. The side characters, particularly Riley, were delightful additions; despite her small role, Riley becomes immensely significant to Tilda. I found myself empathizing with Tilda, especially regarding her mother, whom I disliked on Tilda's behalf.",
            "I appreciate the story's heartfelt message: even the smallest gestures can have a profound impact on others. It emphasizes the importance of kindness, reminding us that we never truly know what someone else is experiencing.",
            "I truly appreciate books that evoke strong emotions, and every work by this author delivers just that. This story is imbued with empathy for those striving to overcome their demons. If you're seeking a book that will stir your emotions, I highly recommend picking up one of the author's works—you won't be disappointed. I found myself resonating with Tilda's mother's selfishness, which deepened my gratitude for my own mother and siblings. My own mother was quite absent during my childhood, strangely shaping me into a stronger person today."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The author's *A Single Act of Kindness* is a deeply emotional and relatable story that explores themes of personal growth, addiction, and the power of kindness. The characters, especially Tilda, are well-developed, and the portrayal of addiction is realistic and empathetic. This book left me feeling grateful and reflective, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a heartfelt read.",

She has a small part in the book but becomes something so much bigger to Tilda.  \n   - I hated Tilda's mother on her behalf and felt a kinship with Tilda in that way.  \n\n- **Relatability and Personal Connection:**  \n   - I could relate to the selfishness Tilda's mother showed, and it made me feel grateful for the mother and siblings I have.  \n   - My mom was a really absent parent when I was younger, and in a strange way, it made me who I am. I am so much stronger for it.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Realistic Themes (Addiction):**  \n   - What I really liked about this book was how realistic addiction was portrayed.  \n   - I have been through recovery with family members getting clean and/or sober. There should be no shame in overcoming addiction; it should be celebrated.  \n\n- **Message and Sentiment:**  \n   - I love the sentiment of the story: one small thing can mean a lot to someone, and if you can only be one thing, be kind because you never know what someone is going through.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSamantha Tonge's *A Single Act of Kindness* is a deeply emotional and relatable story that explores themes of personal growth, addiction, and the power of kindness. The characters, especially Tilda, are well-developed, and the portrayal of addiction is realistic and empathetic. This book left me feeling grateful and reflective, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a heartfelt read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Previous books by Samantha Tonge (*Lost Luggage*, *The Memory of You*, *When We Were Friends*) were all four or five-star reads for me.  \n- *A Single Act of Kindness* did not disappoint and aligns with the high quality of her previous works."

            "In the final 10% of the book, the romantic development between Tilda and Milo felt abrupt and unnecessary; I would have preferred them to remain supportive friends. Although I anticipated the ending, I was disappointed by its execution. The narrative focuses on Tilda and Milo as they navigate their individual traumas. Tilda, who leads a life of routine and isolation, chooses to help Milo during his illness, resulting in a significant act of kindness. I expected an uplifting story, but the overall tone remained somber, which was unexpected. Despite its 293 pages, the book felt longer, likely due to its heavy emotional themes and Tilda's repetitive reflections on her struggles. I enjoyed the first 30% of the book, but as the pacing slowed, I found it increasingly difficult to stay engaged.",
            "Tilda is a complex character, but her emotional walls stemming from past trauma and her persistent sadness felt exhausting, causing me to skip parts of her internal monologues. While Milo is a decent character, his friendship with Tilda lacked authenticity, and their dynamic never fully resonated with me. However, Dettel the cat was a delightful highlight; observing the growing bond between Tilda and the playful feline brought heartwarming lightness to the story.",
            "The book's central message revolves around kindness—both towards others and oneself—which I found profoundly meaningful and relevant."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the book has a meaningful message about kindness and features some touching moments (especially with Dettel the cat), it was ultimately too sappy and sad for my taste. Tilda’s emotional struggles became overwhelming, and the pacing felt slow. However, I can see how other readers might connect deeply with this story. If the premise appeals to you, it’s worth giving it a try.",

            "Matilda begins as a disciplined, rule-oriented woman running a cleaning business. Initially, her personality feels awkward, but she becomes more relatable as the story unfolds, particularly after Milo moves in. While her tendency to jump to conclusions and misinterpret situations is a flaw, it adds depth to her character. As the narrative progresses, her strict rules and reserved nature begin to soften, revealing a more vulnerable side. Milo, a kind and gregarious homeless man, unexpectedly enters her life, challenging her rigid lifestyle and fostering her emotional growth. Their relationship develops naturally, and Matilda finds herself increasingly drawn to him despite her initial hesitations. However, her interactions with the “French Romeo” (E) feel less convincing, as it’s difficult to believe someone as intelligent as Matilda would be swayed by him.",

While the lessons at the end emphasized the importance of love and friendship, Tilda spent most of the book isolating herself from both.\n\n- **Character Development (Tilda):**\n   - Tilda was a difficult character to empathize with.

The author withheld information, making it seem like we were getting Tilda’s inner thoughts when we weren’t. This revelation transformed her act of kindness into a return payment for Milo’s earlier good deed, which changed my perception of her in a less favorable way.\n\n- **Character Development (Milo and Tilda’s Mother):**\n   - Milo felt somewhat neglected as a character, lacking depth and development.\n   - Tilda’s mother was portrayed as one-dimensionally awful, to the point of becoming a caricature.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The book was a difficult read because much of it was painful and unhappy.

However, I didn’t find it satisfying as a romance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel was emotionally intense and well-written, it didn’t fully meet my expectations as a romance. Tilda’s character was fascinating but hard to empathize with, and the unreliable narrator trope detracted from my enjoyment. The abrupt ending and lack of earlier romance left me unsatisfied, though I still recommend it as a compelling and emotional read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Emotional Impact: 8/10\n- Character Development: 6/10\n- Plot and Pacing: 7/10\n- Romance Satisfaction: 5/10\n- Overall Recommendation: 7/10"

Tilda has built a \"successful\" life with her cleaning business, while Milo is homeless and sleeping rough, making him an unconventional romantic hero.  \n  - Tilda is a deeply relatable character, and I found myself rooting for her, wishing she could give herself a hug. Milo is a sweetheart from the start, and both characters are deserving of a break, which they eventually get.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  - The story is largely internal, with much of it taking place in Tilda’s flat and within the characters' minds. It’s a \"closed door\" narrative, focusing on emotional depth rather than external action.  \n  - The setting is very British, with its untidiness, tricky weather, and iffy food, but it adds to the novel’s heartfelt and rewarding nature.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The novel is thoughtful, insightful, and unusual, with a tone that balances the heaviness of its themes with moments of warmth and hope.  \n\n- **Pacing and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The pacing allows for deep emotional exploration, making the characters' journeys feel authentic and impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a heartfelt and rewarding novel that explores complex themes and characters with depth and sensitivity.
