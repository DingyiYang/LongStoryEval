However, certain elements, like the blending of dreams with reality and the protagonist drinking mysterious liquids, strongly reminded me of *Alice in Wonderland*.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Flow:**  \n  The writing flow was okay, but I felt the story needed more detail and depth, particularly in describing the dream world and the characters.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt underdeveloped, and I wished for a more comprehensive understanding of their motivations and growth.  \n\n- **Concept and Potential:**  \n  Despite its shortcomings, the series has an incredible concept and the potential to be truly captivating. I hope the world-building and character development are fleshed out more in future installments, allowing the author’s vision to be fully realized.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has an intriguing concept and some imaginative elements, it falls short in world-building, character development, and depth. However, the story shows great potential, and I look forward to seeing how the series evolves.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
