Natalia's exceptional talent means she rarely faces challenges, resulting in a series of effortless victories that make it difficult to stay invested. Additionally, the ending feels like a copout; it seems the author opted for a timeskip rather than fully developing the conclusion, leaving it feeling unearned.",
            "Including Russia's invasion of Crimea and Ukraine feels misplaced in this story. The author appears to have little to contribute on the subject and ultimately avoids addressing it directly. While it's true that any approach would likely draw criticism, a different historical context might have served the narrative better.",

Natalia is so talented that she never has to put in much work, leading to one victory lap after another. As a result, it's hard to stay invested.  \n\n- **Themes and Historical Context:**  \n  I think it's a mistake to include Russia's invasion of Crimea and Ukraine in the story. The author doesn't have much to say and ends up skirting around the topic anyway. Admittedly, no one would be happy no matter what she does, but she would've been better off setting the book in another period.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  My last complaint is that the ending feels like a copout and doesn't feel earned. It seems as though the author is too lazy to write out what happens, so she includes a timeskip instead.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a promising start with a cool premise and descriptive writing, it ultimately falls short due to a dull plot, lack of momentum, poorly handled historical context, and an unsatisfying ending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review.  \n\nThanks to NetGalley, HarperCollins, and Ecco for a free review copy."

            "By the end of the novel, I felt somewhat disappointed. While the author created many engaging and intricate elements, they ultimately seemed disconnected, rendering the story unresolved. Set against the fraught backdrop of Russia's invasion of Crimea and Ukraine, the narrative touches on challenging topics but rarely delves deeply into them, leaving me wishing they had either been explored more thoroughly or omitted altogether.",

            "The novel explores profound themes, notably the idea that \"life itself was the ultimate casting, and we wanted to know what our roles would be,\" highlighting the characters' quest for identity and purpose. Another significant theme is the potency of unspoken emotions: \"Everything becomes more powerful when it isn’t told. Fears, sadness, desires, dreams.\" This resonates with Starnone’s \"Trust,\" where internal secrets gain strength through shame, while shared secrets can be used as leverage against us."

Kim crafted many interesting and intricate pieces, but they seemed to miss each other in the end, leaving the story feeling somewhat unresolved.  \n  - The narrative is set against a fraught backdrop (Russia’s invasion/capture of Crimea and its invasion of Ukraine), but it skirts around truly difficult topics, making me wish they had either been explored more deeply or not brought up at all.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  - The novel touches on profound ideas, such as the quote: “Little by little, we were beginning to understand that life itself was the ultimate casting, and we wanted to know what our roles would be.” This reflects the characters’ search for identity and purpose.  \n  - Another theme is the power of unspoken emotions: “Everything becomes more powerful when it isn’t told. Fears, sadness, desires, dreams.” This echoes the point made in Starnone’s “Trust,” where internal secrets gain power through shame, while shared secrets give others leverage over you.  \n\n- **Potential for Adaptation:**  \n  - Despite its flaws, the story has strong potential for adaptation into a TV series, as its intricate elements and dramatic backdrop could translate well to the screen.  \n\n- **Literary References and Style:**  \n  - The inclusion of the quote about Raphael’s grave at the Pantheon (“Here lies Raphael.

The detailed ballet scenes and initial strong start are highlights, but the slow pacing and underdeveloped plot points left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The writing was truly beautiful and immersive, transporting me straight into these places.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While the FMC (female main character) was deeply developed, the rest of the characters felt a bit shallow. This made it harder to get fully invested in the sweeping scope of the story and somewhat challenging to keep track of who was who and how they were all interconnected.  \n\n- **Reading Experience (Format and Pace):**  \n  I listened to the book on Audible at 1.5x speed, which might have impacted my connection to the story. I think I might have connected better had I read it on Kindle, where I could slow down and re-read certain parts that required tighter focus.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the issues with character development and pacing, the book was a truly enjoyable read, and I would recommend it to others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel features stunning descriptive language and an immersive setting, but its character development falls short, particularly for secondary characters.

I particularly enjoyed delving into the mind of the prima ballerina, which added depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The split-timeline structure was occasionally confusing, as there wasn’t always a clear break between the present day and the past. This confusion might have been due to listening to the audiobook, as the physical book may have a more distinct layout.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the minor confusion with the timeline, I found the novel to be an enjoyable read overall. The unique setting and compelling characters made it a memorable experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the split-timeline structure could be disorienting at times, the captivating exploration of Russian ballet and the prima ballerina’s perspective made this novel a worthwhile and engaging read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded up to 4 stars)."

The story took a long time to develop, and I found myself wishing it would pick up speed.  \n\n- **Accessibility:**  \n  Since I know nothing about ballet, I had to frequently stop and look up terms. This disrupted the flow of reading and made it harder to fully immerse myself in the story.  \n\n- **Character Connection:**  \n  The writing felt detached from the characters, in my opinion. I struggled to connect with them on a deeper level, which made the emotional impact of the story fall flat for me.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The storyline itself was okay, but it didn’t stand out as particularly compelling. It felt like the potential was there, but the execution didn’t fully deliver.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I picked this book up because of Jenna Bush Hager’s recommendation, but unfortunately, it didn’t live up to my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an interesting premise, its slow pacing, lack of character connection, and the need to frequently look up ballet terms made it a challenging read for me. It didn’t quite meet the expectations set by the recommendation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
