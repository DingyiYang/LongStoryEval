            "The story begins with Gracie, a weary new mother who makes a poor decision by visiting a bar, triggering a series of events that unravel her marriage. While the premise holds promise, the narrative feels cluttered with too many ideas, resulting in unsatisfying pacing and execution. Additionally, certain aspects of the ending left me wanting more.",
            "I struggled to connect with the characters in a meaningful way. Gracie’s desperation came across as exaggerated, and I found the narration of her best friend unappealing. Overall, the characters lacked depth, making it challenging to engage with their struggles.",
            "The narration fell short for me, particularly in the dialogue of Gracie’s best friend. The writing attempted to address too many themes simultaneously, resulting in a disjointed and overwhelming story.",
            "I approached this book expecting a standard thriller, but it unexpectedly shifted into a theme I found unappealing: the struggles of tired mothers with newborns. This topic has become overly familiar to me, making it a poor fit for my tastes. Additionally, the narrative tackled a contemporary societal issue that I hadn’t anticipated and didn’t particularly enjoy. My low rating stems from the mismatch between my expectations and the book’s direction. I was disappointed, as I had hoped for a traditional thriller, but the story took a turn that didn’t resonate with me. While others may have appreciated it more, I recognize that my perspective is in the minority."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n  I went into this book thinking it was a standard thriller, but it morphed into a genre/topic I was not interested in reading about for various reasons. The story shifted into the realm of tired mums with newborns, a theme I’ve read too much of lately, which made it a bad choice for me. Additionally, the book delved into a very topical societal issue, which I was not expecting and did not particularly enjoy.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot started with Gracie, a desperate and exhausted new mum, making a bad choice by going to a bar, which set off a chain of events leading to a marriage in ruins. While the premise had potential, the story felt like a melting pot of too many ideas, and I didn’t find the pacing or execution satisfying. Parts of the ending also fell flat for me.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I didn’t connect with any of the characters in an enjoyable way. Gracie’s desperation felt overdone, and I particularly disliked the narration when Gracie’s best friend was speaking. The characters lacked depth, which made it hard for me to engage with their struggles.  \n\n- **Narration and Writing Style:**  \n  The narration was not enjoyable for me, especially during the dialogue of Gracie’s best friend. The writing style tried to tackle too many themes at once, which made the story feel disjointed and overwhelming.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Expectations:**  \n  My low rating is largely due to a mismatch between my expectations and the book’s direction. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to a standard thriller, but the book took a turn I didn’t enjoy. While others have enjoyed this more, I concede that I am an outlier in my opinion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book did not meet my expectations, primarily due to a genre mismatch and an overabundance of themes that felt disjointed. While the premise had potential, the execution, characters, and ending fell flat for me. However, I acknowledge that others may enjoy it more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars rounded up."

It moved away from the gritty thriller details about a murder and lies, and instead focused on the dynamics and context of the protagonist’s familial and personal life.\n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**\n   - There is an underlying narrative about sexual and personal violence against women. I won’t elaborate on how it relates to the plot to avoid spoilers, but as someone who has worked in this area, I appreciated the subject matter. I recently read *Prima Facie*, which has a similar tone but was presented differently. Both books are good, but *Prima Facie* felt more edgy and direct in its plot, whereas this one seemed to try to do too much.\n\n- **Character Perspective and Narrative Style:**\n   - The story is entirely from Gracie’s point of view, which makes sense as it’s her experience. However, I found myself wishing for an epilogue. The final chapters alluded to certain things but didn’t resolve them in a way that felt satisfying to me. I don’t mind being left hanging, but if so, it should be a “WTF” moment.

It did not provide a satisfying resolution or payoff for the time invested in reading the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book began with an interesting premise, it quickly became repetitive and tiresome due to the main character's relentless guilt and the mundane, day-to-day descriptions in the middle.

            "The story opens with Gracie's emotional turmoil, intensifying with her assault and the discovery of a missing woman. The plot is both gripping and realistic, featuring detailed police procedures and Gracie's internal struggles. The pacing keeps me engaged, although her refusal to heed police advice in the second half introduces tension and uncertainty about the outcome. The ending is somewhat divisive; while it resolves the narrative, it raises questions about Gracie's choices and their consequences. Despite some frustration with her decisions, the book remains a compelling read.",
            "Gracie, a distressed new mother grappling with sleep deprivation and feelings of inadequacy, becomes vulnerable when she accepts a drink from a stranger, resulting in her assault. Following this traumatic event, her shame and fear compel her to lie to her husband, friends, and the police. As the story progresses, Gracie's character evolves with the support of her husband and law enforcement. However, her stubbornness in the latter half of the book raises questions about her decision-making.",
            "The writing is skillfully crafted and emotionally resonant, powerfully conveying Gracie’s trauma and motivations. The plot feels authentic, especially in its depiction of police investigations and the psychological aftermath of assault. By drawing parallels to real-life cases, the story becomes both thought-provoking and relevant.",
            "The novel tackles themes of sexual abuse, workplace sexism, and the societal pressures women encounter. It poignantly illustrates how many women endure mistreatment from men in both professional and personal spheres. However, it also strikes a balance by recognizing that not all men are antagonistic, highlighting the presence of supportive and good-hearted individuals."

        "conclusion": "*The Eleventh Floor* is a gripping and emotionally charged novel that delves into themes of sexual abuse, societal expectations, and personal resilience. While Gracie’s character and decisions may frustrate at times, the story’s realism and social commentary make it a thought-provoking and impactful read.

Her struggles are both believable and vivid, making her choices and their consequences compelling. Readers may find themselves questioning whether they would make the same decisions. Grace is a fascinating, well-developed character, and her desperation for sleep, along with her fantasies surrounding it, feels relatable and authentic. The supporting characters are equally vivid, adding depth to the narrative.",

Additionally, the absence of justice for another assault victim further weakens the book's moral foundation. The pacing is inconsistent, shifting from a thriller to a more reflective tone, which disrupts the narrative flow. While the book begins as a thriller/mystery, it transitions into contemporary fiction, resulting in a disjointed and at times frustrating reading experience.",

Her struggle to communicate about a potential assault weeks after the event feels frustrating and perplexing, particularly in a narrative centered on consent. Her repeated choices to conceal information from both her husband and the justice system render her actions feel unethical and unrealistic.",

            "Gracie's actions lack credibility. Despite her financial constraints, she splurges on a hotel room and unnecessary shopping. Additionally, her choice to drink heavily during her stay, contrary to her goal of a restful night, feels counterproductive and unrealistic. Furthermore, her decision to return to work while pregnant, fully aware that she will soon need maternity leave, seems implausible.",

            "The book is marketed as a crime thriller but primarily centers on Gracie’s daily life, particularly her one-year-old son, which detracts from the crime narrative. The slow progress of the investigation and the underdeveloped victim's story shift the focus from thriller elements to domestic drama. While the premise is intriguing, it ultimately disappoints. Gracie's struggle with revealing her infidelity to save her marriage is misleading, as her husband uncovers the truth within the first 100 pages. The murder victim, Phoebe, lacks depth; her life, personality, and circumstances leading to her murder are not explored. The resolution feels rushed and occurs about two-thirds of the way through the book, leaving the timeline in the initial chapters disjointed as it abruptly stops tracking the time since Phoebe's disappearance. Part Two, titled *The Truth*, fails to provide meaningful revelations, falling short of its promise."

The author, Kylie Orr, effectively balances tension and emotional depth throughout the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel by Kylie Orr.

This approach made the book less personally triggering for me.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I listened to the audiobook version and finished it in the same day.

The second half, in particular, was a letdown, turning what could have been an engaging read into a frustrating experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
