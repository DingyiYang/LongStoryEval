Zhangwei's almost immediate love and affection for Liyen seemed baseless and unwarranted. Liyen's remark about \"the feelings that didn't feel wholly earned from him\" perfectly captured my sentiment throughout the book.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The first three-quarters of the book were puzzling and a little dull. While there was a significant twist that provided a new perspective and greater understanding of the characters' actions and emotions, it didn't entirely redeem the earlier sections.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world of *Immortal* is interesting, and there is definitely a compelling story here. However, the execution fell short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The twist added depth to the characters' emotions and actions, but it came too late in the story to fully salvage the earlier lack of connection.  \n\n- **Potential for Improvement:**  \n  I almost wish there had been a prequel. Knowing the twist from the beginning might have made the story more enjoyable and engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Immortal* wasn't a bad read, but it left me disappointed. The romance felt unearned, and the pacing was uneven, with the first three-quarters of the book being dull despite the interesting twist later on. While the world-building and story had potential, the execution didn't fully deliver.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 ⭐️  \n\nThank you to Netgalley and Avon and Harper Voyager for providing me early access to *Immortal* in exchange for an honest review.

            "**Liyen** quickly became one of my favorite characters. She embodies strength, bravery, and independence while displaying relatable flaws, making her character arc deeply engaging. **Zhangwei (The God of War)** stands out as an impressive male main character. He’s brave, witty, and completely devoted. His love declaration, *“You are all I need, whether we are together a year or a hundred. Never doubt my heart.

She is strong, brave, and independent, yet flawed, making her arc incredibly compelling to read.  \n  - **Zhangwei (The God of War):** He is the most jaw-dropping male main character (MMC). He is brave, witty, and utterly devoted. His declaration of love, *“You are all I need, whether we are together a year or a hundred. Never doubt my heart. I have loved you since we met—as I will for the rest of our days,”* was breathtaking.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was absolutely delicious.

While the story itself was interesting and I enjoyed most of it, especially the second half, I didn't connect with it as deeply as I expected. The inciting incident didn't hit hard enough for me, which made it difficult to empathize with the main character, Liyen.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I had a hard time with Liyen and found her pretty annoying in the first half of the book. I think more time spent developing her character throughout both parts of the story might have made me like her more. On the other hand, I really liked Zhangwei, the God of War, and his character was the main reason I finished the book.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt uneven to me. The first half dragged, while the second half felt rushed. The book seemed both too long and too short, and I think splitting it into two shorter books could have improved the overall flow and structure.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some issues, I found the book to be okay. My enjoyment might have been influenced by my mood, but I still appreciated the opportunity to read it. I want to thank Avon and Harper Voyager, as well as NetGalley, for providing the eARC.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story had its moments, particularly in the second half, my connection to the main character and the pacing issues hindered my overall enjoyment.

It was exactly what I was hoping for out of a romantasy written by Sue Lynn Tan.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The tension and the relationships in this book were incredible. I especially loved the interactions involving the God of War—I was itching for more of him throughout the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  If I had to say anything critical, it would be that around 50%-70% of the book felt a little dense. However, this didn’t detract too much from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The ending and the themes of feminine rage were absolutely captivating. I devoured every bit of it and was left wanting more.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  I can’t wait to read what comes next from this world. Sue Lynn Tan has truly created something special here.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book lived up to my high expectations and delivered a compelling romantasy experience.

I fell in love with *Daughter of the Moon Goddess* for its forbidden romance and the deep lore that was woven into the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  *Immortal* explores themes of grief, family, sacrifice, and the complexities of holding power.

Watching Zhangwei's icy exterior melt was also a highlight.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity and Twists:**  \n  The book has several twists and turns, some of which I did not see coming. At times, the plot felt overwhelming, and I struggled to grasp everything happening. However, the theme of choosing one's own destiny helped tie the various elements together by the end.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  While this book did not blow me away as much as *Daughter of the Moon Goddess* did, I still liked it. It was satisfying to see the exploration of creating a new path when neither of two options seems right.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Immortal* is a compelling novel that delves into themes of grief, power, and self-determination.

            "At first, the romance felt overly reliant on instant attraction, but it ultimately suited the story well. I grew to truly enjoy the dynamic between Liyen and Zhangwei. Liyen's dedication to her people was inspiring, and her character development—from hesitant to confident—was a pleasure to witness. However, I would have liked to see more of Zhangwei; including his perspective could have deepened his character.",

The political intrigue was just as captivating as in the previous duology, and I found myself eager to delve deeper into the conflict between the Immortals and the Wuxin. While this is a standalone novel, I highly recommend reading the duology first, as it's absolutely fantastic."

            "While some plot points in *Immortal* felt predictable, they prevented it from being a 5-star read for me. The story follows Liyen, the heir to the kingdom of Tianxia, who is poisoned. The only remedy is the Divine Pearl Lotus, a treasure coveted by the immortal queen and harvestable solely by Liyen’s grandfather. In a desperate attempt to save her, he betrays the immortal queen and gives Liyen the lotus. This act of defiance prompts the immortal queen to unleash the God of War on Tianxia, resulting in the death of Liyen's grandfather. As Liyen ascends to her role as the Lady of Tianxia, she vows to liberate her kingdom from the queen’s control.",
            "In this story, Liyen truly shines as a headstrong spitfire, fully embracing her role as the Lady of Tianxia. Her interactions in both the mortal and immortal realms, particularly with the God of War, are a highlight. The God of War, a brooding and formidable figure, reveals his softer side when he's with Liyen. Their evolving relationship is the heart of the narrative, and I found it utterly captivating. Additionally, I can't help but be drawn to the classic 'Who did this to you?' trope in romantasy novels—always a winner in my book!",
            "I highly recommend *Immortal* for anyone seeking a fast-paced, magical, and romantic read."

            "In this romantic fantasy, the central love story ultimately fell flat for me. The relationship between Liyen and Zhangwei, the God of War, felt rushed, with their romantic feelings developing too quickly by the 30% mark. This abrupt progression detracted from my enjoyment of their connection. Although a twist in the latter half attempts to explain their rapid attraction, it feels unearned, lacking prior hints to build anticipation. Consequently, I struggled to engage with their romance, questioning why a god would form such a strong attachment to a mortal he barely knew, and why Liyen, despite her distrust, would fall for him so swiftly.",

This quick development soured my enjoyment of their relationship.  \n  - While there’s a twist in the latter half that explains their rapid attraction, it felt unsatisfying because it came out of nowhere. I would have preferred better allusions to this twist earlier in the story.  \n  - I spent much of the book disconnected from their romance, unable to understand why a god would be so attached to a mortal he just met or why Liyen, who is distrustful, would fall for him so quickly.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  - Despite my boredom at times, the book was easy to breeze through.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Immortal* shares similarities with *Daughter of the Moon Goddess* in terms of vibes and writing style, it didn’t captivate me as much.

Liyen, the female main character, is central to the plot but doesn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  The book is described as “fine,” indicating that it meets basic expectations but doesn’t excel or leave a memorable impact.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Immortal* has an intriguing concept and a standout character in the God of War, the monotonous prose and lack of memorable dialogue prevent it from reaching its full potential. It’s a decent read but falls short of being exceptional.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

Initially fraught with tension, their dynamic transforms into a relationship rich with wit and undeniable chemistry.

            "The pacing of the story felt uneven, like a roller coaster with its constant ups and downs. The first part started strong and maintained a steady rhythm, while the second part excelled in exploring characters and politics. However, the third part, although action-packed, seemed disjointed due to the conclusion of part two. The twist was unexpected and initially confusing, but it became clearer as the narrative progressed.",
            "The characters are well-developed, with Liyen as a fiery and determined protagonist, though her stubbornness can be frustrating. Zhangwei’s unwavering devotion to her is a delight to read. The nuanced portrayal of morality stands out, as many characters navigate the grey areas of human nature, embodying neither pure good nor pure evil. While the romance is decent, it lacks depth, leaving me wanting more from their relationship, especially considering the familiar tropes. Unfortunately, I didn’t feel deeply invested in their connection, which rendered it less compelling than I had hoped.",

The narrative brims with betrayals, secrets, and ancient grudges, creating a constant tension that compels Liyen to remain vigilant. The pacing expertly shifts from a slow, graceful build-up in the first half to a chaotic, action-filled second half, culminating in emotionally charged confrontations.

The God of War, with his complex blend of danger and allure, adds a captivating dynamic to their relationship. However, their persistent reluctance to express their true feelings can be frustrating.

She is brought to the Immortal Realm by the God of War, and their lives become deeply entwined. The book incorporates several tropes: enemies to lovers, chosen one-ish, political intrigue, fated lovers, forbidden love, found family, and a dash of miscommunication.\n\n- **Romantic Relationship:**  \n  The romantic relationship between the MC and the God of War felt forced, especially in the beginning. While it is partially rationalized later in the book, the initial connection lacked organic development, spark, and chemistry. I believe the story might have been stronger without the romantic aspect or with better dynamics between the characters.\n\n- **World-Building and Imagery:**  \n  Sue Lynn Tan excels at creating vivid imagery and further developing the immortal realms she introduced in *The Celestial Kingdom Series*. Her ability to craft immersive settings remains a highlight of her writing.\n\n- **Appeal to Mythology Enthusiasts:**  \n  As someone who enjoys retellings of Chinese mythology, I appreciated the cultural and mythological elements woven into the story. While I wasn’t the biggest fan of this particular book, I think many others who share this interest will enjoy *Immortal*.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Immortal* showcases Sue Lynn Tan’s talent for world-building and her ability to weave Chinese mythology into her stories, the romantic relationship felt forced and lacked the organic chemistry needed to fully engage me.

I enjoyed exploring another part of this world with a cast of new characters.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The story follows Liyin, a brash and wise protagonist, and the honorable god of war as they meet and learn to trust each other. There is some character growth, but it felt secondary to the romance.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance is passionate and follows an enemies-to-lovers trope. I liked seeing the relationship develop between the two characters, though the writing felt very romance-focused and character-focused rather than plot-focused.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story feels plot-driven, with points of intrigue sprinkled subtly throughout. However, the inner monologue from the main character, which showcases her wide range of emotions, sometimes overshadows the plot.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is heavily focused on romance and character development, with a lot of inner monologue to convey emotions.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend this book to fantasy readers looking for an emotional and passionate romance without explicit content. It’s also a great choice for fans of the author’s other series who want to spend more time in this magical world of immortals.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis standalone novel offers a magical world reminiscent of a period Chinese drama, with a passionate enemies-to-lovers romance at its core. While the character growth and plot take a backseat to the romance, the emotional depth and subtle intrigue make it an enjoyable read for fans of fantasy and romance alike.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n7.57 Cawpile"

The prose is rich and multilayered, creating a vivid and immersive reading experience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Liyen’s character growth is wonderfully executed, as she navigates her rule in a mortal realm and grapples with profound questions about the worthiness of immortal versus mortal lives. However, the male main character (MMC), Zhangwei, feels less developed and lacks the depth and individuality that Liyen possesses.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  While *Immortal* is set in the same world as the *Celestial Kingdom Duology*, it only occupies a small corner of that expansive and unique universe. The story doesn’t heavily reference the broader world, making it unnecessary to read the duology first. However, I found myself longing for the more original and fresh world-building of the duology, as *Immortal* leans into popular romantasy tropes.  \n\n- **Plot and Originality:**  \n  The plot, while well-executed, felt underwhelming compared to the *Celestial Kingdom Duology*. It relies on familiar romantasy tropes, which, though handled competently, didn’t leave me as impressed as Tan’s earlier works.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  This is Tan’s spiciest novel to date, featuring one short “open door” scene. However, the spice level is still relatively mild overall.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend *Immortal* to romantasy lovers, especially as an entry point to Sue Lynn Tan’s beautifully lush world. It’s a solid read, though it didn’t quite capture the magic of her previous works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Immortal* is a lush and multilayered romantasy novel with strong character development for its female protagonist, Liyen. While it explores thought-provoking themes and features Tan’s signature writing style, it falls short in originality and world-building compared to her *Celestial Kingdom Duology*.

While I anticipated that some familiar character archetypes and plot points would unfold predictably, the story took unexpected turns, which was refreshing. However, the execution fell short for me, primarily due to pacing issues. Major reveals often surfaced in the midst of chapters, making them feel anti-climactic and diminishing their overall impact.",

However, Zhangwei’s character and motivations could have been explored more deeply to enhance the emotional impact of their relationship.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is beautiful and evocative, consistent with the author’s signature style. The descriptions are vivid, and the storytelling is immersive, making it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Immortal* is a captivating and immersive novel with exquisite world-building, beautiful writing, and a touching romance. While the pacing starts slow and the romance could have been more nuanced, the story is deeply engaging and a worthy addition to the Celestial Kingdom universe. I highly recommend it to fans of Asian-inspired fantasy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

I also found Liyen's resentment toward Zhangwei to be a bit repetitive at times.  \n\n- **Plot and Originality:**  \n  I felt quite bored with the book because the plot and storyline are very similar to a lot of other books and dramas I have read and watched.

This lack of context made it harder for me to fully immerse myself in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book isn’t bad, it didn’t meet my expectations. The pacing of the romance and the underdeveloped plot elements left me feeling disconnected. I appreciate the twists and the potential of the story, but it ultimately felt flat to me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book presents characters of Eastern descent, which I found to be a refreshing change. While it took me some time to differentiate between the characters, this only deepened my engagement with the story. The main character, Liyen, is particularly notable for her harshness and quick temper, effectively subverting the typical quiet, demure archetype commonly found in royal narratives. Her flaws and growth add to her complexity. The tension-filled interactions between Liyen and Zhangwei are a standout feature. Their relationship fits the enemies-to-lovers trope, yet Liyen’s refusal to become submissive around Zhangwei brings both depth and originality to the dynamic.",

Her work was so elegant and classy up to this novel, but now it has lowered to the level of every other fantasy spice/smut novel out there.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really loved the God of War in the story.

It got tedious.  \n\n- **World-Building and Imagery:**  \n  I did enjoy where the story ended up, and the world Sue Lynn Tan has created in her books is so vibrant, beautiful, and rich.

            "The author is an automatic read for me, as she crafts the type of fantasy I love—rooted in mythology and distinctly different from the typical UK fantasy settings. This story echoes elements from her Celestial Kingdom series while presenting a fresh narrative within the same universe. With a touch of Beauty and the Beast, particularly through motifs like the forbidden south courtyard and the library, it is a beautifully written standalone novel that unfolds seamlessly and hints at further adventures to come.",
            "Liyen's character was somewhat unlikable. While her strong leadership style stems from her challenging upbringing, she often veered too far in that direction. She tended to bulldoze first and ask questions later, neglecting to consider the consequences of her actions. In contrast, the God of War captivated us from the beginning. He was a standout character who brought significant charm to the story.",

This is the level of fantasy I like—based on mythology with recognizable ties and, thankfully, not another fantasyland based on the UK. You can see elements that go back to her Celestial Kingdom books while being a completely new story in the same universe.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  The story is rooted in mythology, which I appreciate, and it avoids the overused UK-based fantasy setting. The world feels fresh and immersive, with ties to her previous works while standing on its own.  \n\n- **Character Development (Liyen):**  \n  Liyen was a bit unlikable. While it’s understandable that she needs to be a strong leader after her sickly upbringing, it felt like she swung in the opposite direction a little too hard. Her approach was often to bulldoze first, ask questions later, and she didn’t always consider the consequences of her actions.  \n\n- **Character Development (God of War):**  \n  The God of War, however, had us swooning from the start. He was a standout character and added a lot of charm to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story has a bit of a \"Beauty and the Beast\" vibe, especially with elements like the forbidden south courtyard and the library. It’s a gorgeous standalone novel that works well within its own narrative while hinting at more to come.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Personal Impact:**  \n  I can’t wait for what comes next from this amazing author. I will absolutely be gifting this to family and friends and recommending it widely.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a beautifully crafted standalone fantasy novel that blends mythology, strong character dynamics, and a fresh world. While the protagonist’s personality might not resonate with everyone, the story as a whole is captivating and leaves me eager for more from Sue Lynn Tan.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story takes too long to reach its climax, making it feel drawn-out despite its intriguing premise and characters.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The main female protagonist (FMC) was especially underwhelming; while she sought to liberate her kingdom from the immortals, she paradoxically relied on them for protection during crises.

The main female protagonist (FMC) was particularly disappointing. She aims to free her kingdom from the immortals, yet she relies on them for protection when danger arises.

            "The story features an enjoyable twist about two-thirds in, along with a dramatic and epic showdown toward the end. However, it does lose momentum afterward, feeling somewhat stale.",
            "The characters lack depth and dimension. The main character was particularly frustrating, constantly expressing contradictory feelings— professing love one moment, then declaring she couldn't love him because he was too dangerous. As the story progressed, her fickleness became increasingly irritating, rendering her an insufferable presence.",

        "conclusion": "While this book is a light and easy read, it suffers from flat characters, unrealistic dialogue, and a main character whose contradictory behavior becomes frustrating. The plot has some redeeming moments, such as a twist and an epic showdown, but the story ultimately falls flat again. It’s an entertaining read for those seeking something undemanding, but it lacks depth and consistency.",

Though it didn’t fully captivate me, it was still an engaging and emotionally rich read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating score was mentioned in the review."

The dynamic between them, especially Zhangwei’s transformation from a reputably ruthless character to someone who shows his sweeter, gentler, and protective side, was heart-melting.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The exploration of love within family and the high stakes and sacrifices required to protect them added depth to the story. I appreciated the heavy cost of choices and sacrifices, as it made the story more believable. However, it kept me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails, unsure of which characters might meet a heartbreaking end.  \n\n- **Cover Design and Collectibility:**  \n  Sue Lynn Tan is blessed by the cover gods, and I can’t wait to collect the UK, US, and special book box editions of *Immortal*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Immortal* is a lyrical, magical, and emotionally gripping standalone fantasy that builds on the beloved Celestial Kingdom universe. With compelling characters, high-stakes sacrifices, and a beautifully crafted world, it’s another masterpiece from Sue Lynn Tan. I’m eagerly awaiting its release and will be adding multiple editions to my collection.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
