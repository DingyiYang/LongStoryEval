            "*James* is a retelling of Mark Twain's *Huckleberry Finn*, narrated from Jim's perspective. Jim, a slave, escapes upon learning he will be sold and separated from his family. His goal is to secure his freedom and raise enough money to liberate his wife and daughters. He partners with Huck, who fakes his own death to escape his abusive father. Their journey is filled with various adventures and challenges. While *James* closely follows the original plot, it diverges in significant ways.",
            "The author masterfully employs satire in *The Trees*, which I found incredibly engaging. I laughed out loud numerous times, even as I grappled with the profound subject of Black lynching. In contrast, *James* features less overt humor; it remains present but is much more subtle. The focus on slavery in *James* likely accounts for the author's more serious tone.",
            "*James* tackles the subject of slavery with a serious and nuanced approach. Although the humor is more understated than in *The Trees*, the emotional impact of the story is significant. The pronounced violence in *James* further enhances its intensity.",
            "While I didn't give this book a full five stars, I genuinely hope it makes the shortlist, and I wouldn't be disappointed if it won. The author truly deserves the recognition."

While I enjoyed it, I feel I might have appreciated it more had I read the original work. Nevertheless, it is a strong novel that deserves recognition, and I hope it achieves the accolades it merits.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Background and Previous Works:**  \n  I discovered Percival Everett two years ago when he was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for *The Trees*. I gave that book 5 stars, and it ended up as one of my favorite books of 2022. I also read *Dr. No*, which I liked but was not impressed by. *James* was excellent, but my enjoyment of it was less than *The Trees*.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Everett writes satire like a pro, and that is what I loved about *The Trees*. I laughed out loud many times, all the while being deeply moved by the subject the author chose: the lynching of Black people. In *James*, there is less humor—it is still there but much more subtle. The author chose slavery as his main subject in *James*, and probably that is why he took things more seriously.  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n  *James* is a retelling of *Huckleberry Finn* by Mark Twain, written from Jim’s point of view. Jim is a slave who runs away when he finds out he is going to be sold and separated from his family. The plan is to somehow get himself free and then find enough money to also free his wife and daughters. He teams up with Huck, who stages his own death to get away from his violent father. All kinds of adventures and mishaps follow. *James* follows the plot of the original novel quite well until it diverges in some vital points.  \n\n- **Comparison to the Original Work (*Huckleberry Finn*):**  \n  I haven’t read *Huckleberry Finn* and chose to peruse a summary of the plot instead. I tried and failed twice to read Mark Twain in childhood and did not feel the urge for one more attempt. After finishing *James*, I believe I probably made a mistake. I probably would have appreciated this novel a lot more had I gone through its inspiration first. Maybe that is why I am not giving this book 5 stars—perhaps I missed some overtones or references to the original material that would have elevated my experience.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The subject matter of *James*—slavery—is handled with seriousness and depth. While the humor is more subtle compared to *The Trees*, the emotional weight of the story is profound. The violence in *James* is more pronounced, which adds to its intensity.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite not giving it 5 stars, I hope this book will reach the shortlist, and I would not be sorry if it won. The author should finally receive the recognition he deserves.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*James* is a powerful and thought-provoking retelling of *Huckleberry Finn*, written with depth and seriousness. While I enjoyed it, I feel I might have appreciated it more had I read the original work. Nevertheless, it is a strong novel that deserves recognition, and I hope it achieves the accolades it merits.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly stated, but implied to be less than 5 stars due to the reader's lack of familiarity with *Huckleberry Finn*."
