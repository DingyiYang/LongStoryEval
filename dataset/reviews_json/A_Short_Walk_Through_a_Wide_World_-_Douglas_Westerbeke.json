            "This novel evokes the spirit of *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue* and *Life of Pi*, featuring Aubrey Tourvel, a protagonist fleeing a mysterious ailment that compels her to keep moving to escape a gruesome fate. The story forges its own identity through a unique plot and captivating globetrotting adventures, seamlessly blending magical realism and fantasy. The unexpected ending, with its transcendence of time and space reminiscent of *Interstellar*, left me both surprised and uncertain about my overall satisfaction.",
            "Aubrey Tourvel is a strong-willed, resourceful, and resilient protagonist, brought to life with humor by a male author. The romantic scenes are tastefully crafted, adding depth to her character without feeling forced or inauthentic.",
            "The prose is lush, sensory, and vivid, perfectly capturing my wanderlust through Aubrey’s travels. It's beautifully written without being overly ornate, which I greatly appreciated.",
            "The globetrotting adventures are immersive and vividly portrayed, making travel a standout aspect of the novel. However, Aubrey’s illness lacks clarity; I would have appreciated more detail regarding its origins and significance.",
            "This novel is a heart-wrenching and poignant exploration of human connection and the resilience of the human spirit. It thoughtfully examines themes of survival and the transient nature of relationships shaped by Aubrey’s condition, evoking both sorrow and joy."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this sweeping adventure was a lush, sensory, and thought-provoking experience that blended magical realism, fantasy, and travel. While the backstory of Aubrey’s sickness could have been more detailed, the novel excelled in its vivid prose, strong characterization, and unexpected ending. Fans of *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue* and travel enthusiasts will likely enjoy this as much as I did.",

The story follows Aubrey Tourvel, a nine-year-old girl in 1885 Paris, whose discovery of a magical puzzle ball sets her on a lifelong, fantastical journey. The concept of a life-threatening affliction that forces her to keep moving is compelling and unique.\n\n- **Character Development and Journey:**  \n  Aubrey’s journey is filled with wonder, beauty, and precarious situations. Her resourcefulness and resilience in the face of adversity, loneliness, and her mysterious disease are admirable. While she encounters a mix of kind and treacherous people, her brief interactions with them limit deeper emotional connections. The narrative spans seven decades, which makes it challenging to explore her relationships with other characters in depth.\n\n- **Magical Realism and World-Building:**  \n  The magical realism is well-executed, particularly the concept of the magical library and Aubrey’s connection to it. The story’s fantastical elements add intrigue and depth to her journey.\n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The narrative suffers from pacing issues, slowing down in parts with excessive telling rather than showing. The non-linear structure, while intriguing, feels slightly disjointed and detracts from emotional engagement with Aubrey. A deeper exploration of her character and emotions could have enriched the reading experience.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The novel touches on themes of survival, belonging, and human connection. While these themes are compelling, the emotional connection to Aubrey is limited due to the narrative’s structure and pacing. The ending, though ambiguous, is satisfying.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The story includes episodes of animal hunting and cruelty, with one particularly graphic description that may be disturbing to some readers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*A Short Walk Through a Wide World* is a skillfully crafted and wondrous story with a unique premise and well-executed magical realism.

This condition compels her to keep moving, as staying in one place for more than 2-4 days leads to uncontrollable convulsions and bleeding. Retroactive in nature, the disease prevents her from returning to any previous location without falling ill. Consequently, Aubry spends her life traveling the world—primarily on foot—navigating deserts, forests, and jungles while hunting and working to survive.

He spent a decade on the local panel of the International Dublin Literary Award, which inspired him to write his first novel, *A Short Walk Through a Wide World*.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The story follows Aubry Tourvel, who contracts a mysterious disease in 1885 at the age of nine. The disease forces her to keep moving, as staying in one place for more than 2-4 days causes her to convulse and bleed uncontrollably. This condition is retroactive, meaning she cannot return to any place she has been before without falling ill. As a result, Aubry spends her life traveling the world, primarily on foot, through deserts, forests, and jungles, hunting and working for survival. Over time, she ages, loses track of time, and witnesses the advent of commercial air travel, suggesting she lives into the second half of the twentieth century.\n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**\n   - The title, *A Short Walk Through a Wide World*, is interpreted as a metaphor for the brevity of life. Despite Aubry’s extensive travels, her journey is framed as a \"short walk\" in the grand scheme of existence. The novel explores themes of impermanence, the passage of time, and the human experience, encapsulated in the idea that \"you get what anybody gets—you get a lifetime.\"\n\n- **Fantasy Elements:**\n   - The novel incorporates fantastical elements, including a magical library (or *The Library*), which serves as a portal to distant places. There is also a mysterious wooden puzzle ball, whose significance remains enigmatic and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Aubry Tourvel is portrayed as a resilient and admirable protagonist. Her journey is both physical and emotional, and she forms meaningful connections with friends and lovers along the way. Her character is easy to love and root for, making her journey compelling.\n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**\n   - The novel strikes a balance between being contemplative and fast-moving. It combines introspective moments with the excitement of an adventure, creating a dynamic reading experience.\n\n- **Personal Reflection:**\n   - While reading, I found myself reflecting on the song *100 Years* by Five For Fighting, which resonated with the novel’s themes of time and mortality. The story’s exploration of life’s fleeting nature left a lasting impression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*A Short Walk Through a Wide World* is a magical and thought-provoking adventure novel that blends fantasy with deep philosophical reflections. Aubry Tourvel’s journey is both epic and intimate, making her a character readers can admire and connect with. The novel’s unique premise, rich symbolism, and balanced pacing make it a memorable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "The story centers on Aubry Tourvel, a young girl in 1885 Paris who discovers a mysterious puzzle ball. Shortly after, she falls ill with a rare, non-contagious disease that compels her to live a life of perpetual motion. Spanning her journey from adolescence to old age, the narrative delves into her relationships, travels, and the lasting impact she has on those she encounters. With a non-linear storytelling approach, events unfold across various times and places, creating a rich, interwoven tapestry.",
            "Aubry, a stubborn yet resilient protagonist, embodies strength and a zest for life amidst her struggles. The deep sense of family and the bonds she forms with others add profound emotional depth to the story.",
            "This book evokes the essence of *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue* and *Life of Pi*, yet it remains distinctly unique. It also captures the atmosphere of *Three Thousand Years of Longing*, *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button*, *The Starless Sea*, and *Dark Matter*, particularly through its use of doors and immersive storytelling. The narrative delves into themes of resilience, spirituality, and the human experience, often blending melancholy with a sense of peace. Beautiful proverbs and wisdom woven throughout add depth and emotional resonance. Overall, the story is profoundly moving, featuring moments that brought me to tears."

            "The premise of a character who becomes severely ill if she stays in one place is both compelling and unique. The story effectively explores the emotional and physical toll of Aubry's condition, making her journey both heartbreaking and fascinating. It raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of home, stability, and survival. Overall, the book is enchanting and emotionally impactful. However, the second half feels disjointed, suggesting the author struggled to maintain coherence. The introduction of a deus ex machina element in this latter part was disappointing and disrupted the narrative flow.",

Themes of grief, loss, and familial longing are poignantly woven into her dreams and memories of her sisters and parents. Additionally, the narrative skillfully integrates lessons about charity versus self-reliance into Aubry's character arc.",

Additionally, it delves into themes of self-reliance, resilience, and the quest for meaning in a fleeting existence."

The narration brought the story to life effectively.  \n\n- **Premise and Creativity:**  \n   - The premise is incredibly interesting and showcases the author’s creativity. It’s impressive that this is a debut novel.  \n   - The themes of humanity, discovery, strength, and survival are strong and thought-provoking. The concept of being unable to stay in one place for more than 2-3 days raises intriguing questions about whether it would be hell or an adventure.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The female main character (FMC), especially as a little girl, was well-written and often funny.  \n   - Some of the best chapters involved interactions with other characters, such as the Prince, the girl studying her, and the guy on the train.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The travel aspect began too quickly. I wanted more exploration of the magic puzzle ball, the sickness, and how it all started before diving into Aubry’s travels.  \n   - The pacing felt off, and the lack of other character perspectives was a drawback.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending left me uncertain. I’m not sure how I feel about it, even days after finishing the book. It’s open to interpretation and discussion.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I liked the book but didn’t love it. It’s a good magical realism novel with an interesting premise and plot, making it a solid choice for book clubs or discussions. However, it fell short of being great for me due to execution issues.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a good magical realism novel with a fascinating premise and strong themes, making it a worthwhile read, especially for fans of travel and thought-provoking stories.

            "The narrative shifts frequently between past and present as Aubrey encounters various people on her journey. This back-and-forth structure can be confusing, particularly between pages 80 and 200, although it becomes somewhat more manageable later on. The disjointed flow makes it difficult to stay engaged, and the constant digressions detract from the overall coherence. The story follows Aubrey Tourvel, who grapples with a mysterious, gruesome illness that forces her to keep moving, unable to return to previous places without risking her life. While the premise initially intrigued me, the execution ultimately left me unsatisfied. The book concludes without providing meaningful answers or context for Aubrey's suffering, resulting in a frustratingly unresolved ending.",

The emotional weight of this portion of the story was poignant and relatable. However, the constant emphasis on her severe pain and bleeding became overwhelming and repetitive. While I initially valued the raw honesty of the portrayal, it eventually felt excessive and unnecessary."

The book ends without providing meaningful answers or justification for Aubrey’s suffering, which felt frustrating and unresolved.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Relatability:**\n   - The portrayal of Aubrey’s childhood illness and the sudden disruption of her life resonated with me, as someone who also experienced a chronic illness as a child. The emotional weight of this part of the story was well-done and relatable.\n   - However, the relentless depiction of her gruesome illness—frequent excruciating pain and bleeding—became overwhelming and repetitive. While I initially appreciated the unflinching portrayal, it eventually felt gratuitous and pointless.\n\n- **Magical Realism and Ambiguity:**\n   - The use of magical realism, such as magical libraries that transport Aubrey to new locations, added an intriguing layer to the story. However, these elements were left unexplained, contributing to the overall sense of ambiguity and lack of resolution.\n   - While ambiguity can work in some stories, I felt it didn’t justify the extent of Aubrey’s suffering or provide a satisfying narrative payoff.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Flow:**\n   - The narrative frequently shifts between past and present as Aubrey meets various people on her journey. This back-and-forth structure was confusing, especially between pages 80-200, though it did become somewhat easier to follow later on.\n   - The disjointed flow made it difficult to stay engaged with the story, and the frequent digressions detracted from the overall coherence.\n\n- **Tone and Themes:**\n   - The book’s tone is overwhelmingly bleak and horrific, with Aubrey enduring constant emotional and physical torment. While I understand the intention to explore suffering, the relentless bleakness felt excessive and ultimately unrewarding.\n   - The lack of resolution or meaningful exploration of themes left me feeling that the story was pointlessly grim.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite its intriguing premise and a few emotionally resonant moments, the novel failed to deliver a satisfying or coherent narrative. The repetitive depiction of Aubrey’s suffering, the lack of answers, and the disjointed structure made it a frustrating and unrewarding read.

A deeper exploration of Aubrey as a person would have enriched the experience.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story follows Aubrey over seven decades, which leads to pacing issues, with some parts slowing down considerably.\n   - The non-linear narrative, while intriguing, felt slightly disjointed and detracted from my overall satisfaction.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**\n   - The novel touches on themes of survival, belongingness, and human connection, which I found compelling.\n   - Despite the ambiguity, I enjoyed the ending, though the emotional connection to Aubrey’s plight was somewhat hindered by the narrative structure.\n\n- **World-Building and Supporting Characters:**\n   - The author keeps the reader engaged with a flow of interesting characters and enthralling adventures.\n   - Aubrey’s encounters with people range from betrayal to overwhelming kindness, adding depth to her journey.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**\n   - The narrative includes episodes of animal hunting/cruelty, with one particularly graphic description that I found disturbing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *A Short Walk Through a Wide World* is a skillfully crafted, wondrous story with a fascinating premise and well-executed magical realism. While I admired Aubrey’s resilience and enjoyed the themes of survival and human connection, the pacing issues, non-linear narrative, and limited emotional depth kept me from fully loving the book. The ending, though ambiguous, was satisfying, and the inclusion of graphic animal cruelty is worth noting for sensitive readers.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5⭐️"

            "The story centers on Aubry Tourvel, who contracts a mysterious disease at the age of nine in 1885. This affliction compels her to remain in constant motion, as staying in one place for more than 2-4 days triggers severe convulsions and uncontrollable bleeding. As a retroactive condition, she cannot revisit any location, leading Aubry to traverse the world by foot, boat, train, and later, airplane. Throughout her journey, she faces numerous hardships and forges meaningful connections with others. The novel skillfully balances introspection with adventure, blending contemplative moments with an exhilarating pace, making it both engaging and thought-provoking.",
            "The author, a librarian from Ohio associated with one of the largest libraries in the U.S., draws inspiration from his decade-long experience on the local panel of the International Dublin Literary Award to craft his debut novel, *A Short Walk Through a Wide World*. The protagonist, Aubry Tourvel, is a resilient and admirable character whose journey from youth to old age is both physically and emotionally transformative, making her relatable and easy to root for.",
            "The story unfolds over decades, guiding Aubry through a variety of landscapes such as deserts, forests, and jungles. The incorporation of libraries and magical elements enhances the world-building, resulting in a rich and immersive setting.",
            "The title *A Short Walk Through a Wide World* implies that any journey within a single lifetime and on a single planet is brief. This theme resonates with the song *100 Years* by Five For Fighting, which I associate with Aubry's story. The novel delves into the notion that life, regardless of its length or adventure, is ultimately fleeting.",
            "The novel weaves in fantastical elements, including a magical library that transports characters to distant realms and a mysterious wooden puzzle ball whose significance adds to the enchanting atmosphere."

        "conclusion": "*A Short Walk Through a Wide World* is a magical and contemplative adventure novel that follows the extraordinary life of Aubry Tourvel. The author's debut is both imaginative and heartfelt, blending fantasy with profound themes about life and time. Aubry's journey is inspiring, and the novel's pacing keeps readers engaged from start to finish.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author Background and Inspiration:**\n   - The author, Douglas Westerbeke, is a librarian from Ohio who works at one of the largest libraries in the US. He spent a decade on the local panel of the International Dublin Literary Award, which inspired him to write his first novel, *A Short Walk Through a Wide World*.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The story follows Aubry Tourvel, who contracts a mysterious disease in 1885 at the age of nine. The disease forces her to keep moving, as staying in one place for more than 2-4 days causes her to convulse and bleed uncontrollably. This condition is retroactive, meaning she cannot return to any place she has been before. As a result, Aubry spends her life traveling the world by foot, boat, train, and eventually airplane, enduring hardships and forming connections with people along the way.\n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**\n   - The title, *A Short Walk Through a Wide World*, suggests that any journey within a single lifetime and planet is relatively short. This theme is reinforced by the song \"100 Years\" by Five For Fighting, which the reader associated with Aubry's story. The novel explores the idea that life, no matter how long or adventurous, is fleeting.\n\n- **Fantasy Elements:**\n   - The novel incorporates fantastical elements, such as a magical library (or *The Library*) that can transport people to distant places. There is also a mysterious wooden puzzle ball, whose significance remains enigmatic but adds to the story's magical atmosphere.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Aubry Tourvel is portrayed as a resilient and admirable protagonist. Her journey from a young girl to an old woman with white hair is both physically and emotionally transformative. Readers are likely to find her easy to love and root for.\n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**\n   - The novel strikes a balance between being contemplative and fast-moving. It combines introspective moments with the excitement of an adventure, making it engaging and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**\n   - The story spans decades and takes Aubry across diverse landscapes, including deserts, forests, and jungles. The inclusion of libraries and the magical elements adds depth to the world-building, creating a rich and immersive setting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*A Short Walk Through a Wide World* is a magical and contemplative adventure novel that follows the extraordinary life of Aubry Tourvel. Douglas Westerbeke's debut is both imaginative and heartfelt, blending fantasy with profound themes about life and time. Aubry's journey is inspiring, and the novel's pacing keeps readers engaged from start to finish.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "The story centers on Aubry Tourvel, a young girl in 1885 Paris, who stumbles upon a mysterious puzzle ball, leading her to fall ill with a rare, non-contagious disease that compels her to live in perpetual motion. The narrative traces Aubry's life from adolescence to old age, delving into her relationships, struggles, and the influence she has on those around her. With a non-linear structure, the story intricately weaves together events from various times and places, resulting in a rich and layered narrative.",

The narrative delves into themes of resilience, spirituality, and the passage of time, often tinged with melancholy.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n   - The book was compared to *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue*, but it doesn’t come close to matching the depth and magic of that story.  \n   - If you enjoyed *Addie LaRue* and have an interest in travel and world exploration, this book might still be worth checking out.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - The audiobook is highly recommended, narrated by a favorite narrator (who also narrates Kate Quinn’s books). The narration brought the story to life effectively.  \n\n- **Premise and Creativity:**  \n   - The premise is incredibly interesting and showcases the author’s creativity. It’s impressive that this is a debut novel.  \n   - The themes of humanity, discovery, strength, and survival are strong and thought-provoking. The concept of being unable to stay in one place for more than 2-3 days raises intriguing questions about whether it would be hell or an adventure.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The female main character (FMC), especially as a little girl, was well-written and often funny.  \n   - Some of the best chapters involved interactions with other characters, such as the Prince, the girl studying her, and the guy on the train.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The travel aspect began too quickly. I wanted more exploration of the magic puzzle ball, the sickness, and how everything started before diving into Aubry’s travels.  \n   - The pacing felt off, and the lack of other character perspectives was a drawback.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending left me uncertain. I’m not sure how I feel about it, even days after finishing the book. It wasn’t what I expected, and I’d love to discuss it with other readers.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I liked the book but didn’t love it. It’s a good magical realism story with an interesting premise and plot, making it a solid book club or discussion pick. However, it was missing something to elevate it to greatness for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a good debut novel with a fascinating premise and strong themes, but it falls short in execution, pacing, and depth compared to similar works like *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue*. The audiobook narration is excellent, and the FMC is well-crafted, but the rushed start, lack of multiple perspectives, and ambiguous ending left me wanting more. It’s worth reading for its creativity and discussion potential, but it didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up to 4 for Goodreads."

Additionally, the storytelling sometimes feels disjointed, as Aubrey uses these encounters to share unrelated stories, disrupting the overall flow.",

While the story delves into themes of suffering, rootlessness, and the quest for meaning, it ultimately falls short of providing satisfying resolutions.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The novel presents a unique and intriguing premise where a 9-year-old girl with a strong personality is afflicted with a condition that requires her to travel constantly. The catch is that she can never stay in one place for more than three days and can never return to any location she has visited. This concept of forced travel as a form of escape resonated deeply with me, as it mirrors the wishful thinking many of us have about leaving our problems behind.\n\n- **Narrative and Plot:**  \n  The story revolves around the girl's journey, which is both physical and metaphorical. The addition of a mysterious puzzle ball with a mind of its own adds an element of intrigue and unpredictability to the plot. This device kept me engaged and curious about how it would influence the protagonist's journey.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, a 9-year-old girl with attitude, is a compelling character. Her resilience and adaptability in the face of her unusual condition make her journey both relatable and inspiring. Her personality shines through, making her a memorable and endearing character.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The combination of a unique premise, an engaging plot, and a well-developed protagonist made for a captivating read. The narrative kept me hooked from start to finish, and I found myself deeply invested in the girl's journey.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a fresh and imaginative take on the theme of escape and self-discovery. The protagonist's journey, driven by her unique condition and the mysterious puzzle ball, is both engaging and thought-provoking. It’s a story that stays with you, blending adventure with deeper reflections on life and choices.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n*No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.*"

            "This novel evokes *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue* and *Life of Pi*, featuring Aubrey Tourvel, a protagonist fleeing a mysterious ailment that compels her to keep moving to escape a gruesome fate. The story forges its own identity through a unique plot and captivating globetrotting adventures, seamlessly blending magical realism and fantasy. The unexpected ending, with its transcendence of time and space reminiscent of *Interstellar*, left me both surprised and uncertain about my overall satisfaction.",

The male author effectively created an authentic female character, imbuing her with agency and empowerment. I was pleasantly surprised by the tasteful and skillfully written romantic scenes.",

            "The story quickly became repetitive after an engaging start. The pattern of Aubrey forming connections, experiencing emotional turmoil after just a few days, and then having to leave felt monotonous and detracted from the overall enjoyment.",
            "The side characters often felt indistinguishable, defined primarily by their nationalities. Aubrey's character, while driven by a desire for connection and resilience, lacked depth beyond these traits.",
            "I enjoyed the author's writing style and would gladly explore more of their works.",
            "The magic system lacked clarity and explanation, leaving several key questions unanswered: Why do the hidden libraries exist? Was Aubrey cursed or blessed? What is the significance of the puzzle ball? And why did the ending unfold as it did?",
            "Magical realism isn't usually my preferred genre, and I approached this book with some skepticism, especially given its comparisons to *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue* (which I rated 3 stars) and *Life of Pi* (my least favorite book). However, the first chapter immediately captured my attention. The premise of a girl cursed—or perhaps blessed—to wander the earth for eternity is both unique and intriguing. For the first 100 pages, I was completely engaged."

The retroactive nature of her condition prevents her from returning to any previous location.

He has spent a decade on the local panel of the International Dublin Literary Award, which inspired him to write his own book.\n\n- **Plot Summary:**\n   - The novel follows Aubry Tourvel, who contracts a mysterious disease in 1885 at the age of nine. The disease forces her to keep moving, as staying in one place for more than 2-4 days causes her to convulse and bleed uncontrollably. This condition is retroactive, meaning she cannot return to any place she has been before. As a result, Aubry spends her life traveling the world, primarily on foot, through deserts, forests, and jungles. She hunts and works for food, carries a spear and a gun, and forms friendships and romantic relationships along the way. Over time, she ages into an old woman, and the story spans into the second half of the twentieth century.\n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**\n   - The title, *A Short Walk Through a Wide World*, suggests that any journey within a single lifetime and planet is relatively short. This theme is reinforced by the song \"100 Years\" by Five For Fighting, which the reader associates with Aubry's journey. The novel also explores the idea of a lifetime as a finite, shared experience, as echoed by The Sandman's quote, \"You get what anybody gets - you get a lifetime.\"\n\n- **Fantasy Elements:**\n   - The novel includes fantastical elements, such as a magical library (or *The Library*), which serves as a portal to distant places. There is also a mysterious wooden puzzle ball, whose nature remains enigmatic and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Aubry Tourvel is portrayed as a resilient and admirable character. Her journey, both physical and emotional, makes her easy to love and root for.\n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**\n   - The novel is described as both contemplative and fast-moving, striking a balance between introspection and adventure.\n\n- **Reader's Personal Connection:**\n   - The reader found the story engaging and meaningful, drawing parallels between Aubry's journey and the universal human experience of a finite lifetime.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*A Short Walk Through a Wide World* is a magical and adventurous novel that combines fantasy with deep contemplation. Aubry Tourvel's lifelong journey is both inspiring and relatable, and the story's themes resonate with the reader on a personal level. The novel's blend of fast-paced adventure and thoughtful reflection makes it a compelling read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "The story centers on Aubry Tourvel, a young girl in 1885 Paris, who stumbles upon a mysterious puzzle ball and soon falls ill with a rare, non-contagious disease that compels her to remain in constant motion. Spanning her life from adolescence to old age, the narrative delves into her relationships, struggles, and the influence she has on those around her. The non-linear structure interweaves various times and places, enriching the story with depth and complexity.",
            "Aubry is a determined and resilient character whose tenacity helps her navigate extraordinary circumstances. The strong bond of love and family she shares with her parents and sisters adds a poignant layer to the story. As she travels, Aubry leaves a lasting impression on nearly everyone she encounters, gaining notoriety as her story unfolds.",
            "This book, while reminiscent of *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue* and *Life of Pi*, stands out as a unique narrative. It captures the essence of *Three Thousand Years of Longing*, *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button*, *The Starless Sea* by Erin Morgenstern, and *Dark Matter* by Blake Crouch. The intriguing concept of doors and the mysterious illness that Aubry grapples with in her mind infuse the story with an otherworldly quality. \n\nExploring themes of resilience, family, and the human condition, the narrative balances a strong sense of spirituality and peace with a melancholic undertone. Rich with wisdom and beautiful proverbs, the book offers emotional depth that resonates deeply. I found myself experiencing a wide range of emotions, from tears to a profound connection with Aubry’s journey."

There was something missing in the execution that I can’t quite pinpoint.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  This book was compared to *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue*, and while I can see some similarities, it doesn’t come close to the magic of that book. However, if you enjoyed *Addie LaRue* and love stories about travel and world exploration, this might still be worth checking out.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I listened to the audiobook and highly recommend it. The narrator, who also narrates Kate Quinn’s books, is one of my favorites and truly brought the story to life.  \n\n- **Premise and Creativity:**  \n  The premise is incredibly interesting, and I applaud the author for their creativity. It’s impressive that this is a debut novel, and I’d definitely check out their future work.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The book explores strong themes like humanity, discovery, strength, and survival. It makes you wonder what it would be like to never stay in one place for more than 2-3 days—whether it would be hell or an adventure.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The author did a great job writing the main character, especially as a little girl. She was well-developed and had moments of humor.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  My main issue was that the travel started too quickly. I wanted more background on the magic puzzle ball, the sickness, and how it all began before diving into 9-year-old Aubry’s travels and her life of loneliness.  \n\n- **Narrative Focus:**  \n  The majority of the book focuses on Aubry’s solo travels, which made the pacing feel off. I missed having more perspectives from other characters. My favorite chapters were the ones where she interacted with others, like the Prince, the girl studying her, and the guy on the train.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I’m still unsure how I feel about the ending, even days after finishing the book. I don’t know how I expected it to end, so I’m left with mixed feelings. I’d love to discuss it with other readers who’ve finished it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a good magical realism novel with an interesting premise and plot. It’s a great book club pick or discussion book, but it’s missing something to make it truly great in my opinion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up to 4 for Goodreads."

There’s a sense of both too much and too little happening at the same time, which left me conflicted.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt strange to me.

I felt that certain integral aspects of her identity as a woman were left unexplored, which is often the case when women are written by men.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n  I expected this to be a book about humanity, with the main character as the catalyst. Instead, it felt more like a story about a series of men trying to save a damsel in distress, while the women in the background did the real work to keep the main character from falling apart.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magical Realism:**  \n  The book is steeped in magical realism, but there were many loose ends and no clear explanation of the magic system or the significance of certain elements, like the key.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I wouldn’t not recommend this book. It’s an easy read and would make a great vacation book—perfect for reading on a plane or in an airport.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel is ambitious and has moments of brilliance, its uneven pacing, underdeveloped main character, and lack of clarity in its magical realism elements left me wanting more.

            "The narrative often shifts between Aubrey's present encounters and her past experiences, using her interactions with new people as a springboard for flashbacks. This back-and-forth structure can be confusing and disrupts the flow, especially between pages 80 and 200. Although it becomes easier to follow later on, this inconsistency detracts from the overall reading experience.",
            "The book's tone is overwhelmingly bleak and horrific, as Aubrey endures relentless emotional and physical torment. While suffering is a central theme, the absence of any meaningful resolution or purpose renders the story unnecessarily grim and ultimately unsatisfying.",

Having faced a life-altering chronic condition in my own childhood, I could relate to the unfairness and shock of such a disruption. This emotional aspect was well-executed and profoundly impactful.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Premise and Concept:**\n   - The novel follows Aubrey Tourvel, who suffers from a mysterious, gruesome illness that forces her to keep moving and never return to places she’s been before, risking death if she stays too long. This premise intrigued me initially, as it promised an unconventional life journey filled with unique experiences and encounters.\n\n- **Emotional Resonance and Relatability:**\n   - Early in the book, I found myself deeply moved by Aubrey’s story, particularly her sudden illness as a child. As someone who also experienced a life-altering chronic illness in childhood, I related to the unfairness and shock of such a rupture in one’s life. The emotional weight of this aspect was well-executed and resonated with me.\n\n- **Handling of Illness and Suffering:**\n   - Aubrey’s illness is depicted as gruesome and frequent, with excruciating pain and profuse bleeding if she doesn’t move every 2-3 days. While I initially appreciated the unflinching portrayal, the repetitive nature of these scenes became overwhelming and ultimately felt gratuitous. The lack of a clear purpose or resolution for her suffering left me frustrated and unsatisfied.\n\n- **Magical Realism and Ambiguity:**\n   - The book incorporates elements of magical realism, such as magical libraries that transport Aubrey to new locations. However, these elements felt underdeveloped and lacked meaningful explanation or connection to the overall narrative. The ambiguity surrounding these magical aspects, as well as the illness itself, left too many unanswered questions and undermined the story’s impact.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Flow:**\n   - The narrative frequently shifts between Aubrey’s present encounters and past experiences, often using her interactions with new people as a springboard for flashbacks. This back-and-forth structure was confusing and disrupted the flow, particularly between pages 80-200. While it eventually became easier to follow, it detracted from the overall reading experience.\n\n- **Tone and Themes:**\n   - The book’s tone is overwhelmingly bleak and horrific, with Aubrey enduring relentless emotional and physical torment. While I understand that suffering is a central theme, the lack of any meaningful resolution or purpose made the story feel unnecessarily grim and unsatisfying.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite its intriguing premise and moments of emotional resonance, the novel ultimately fell short of my expectations. The repetitive depiction of Aubrey’s suffering, the underdeveloped magical realism, and the confusing narrative structure left me frustrated and disappointed. While the portrayal of childhood illness was poignant, it was overshadowed by the book’s relentless bleakness and lack of resolution.

A deeper exploration of Aubrey as a person would have enriched the experience.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story follows Aubrey over seven decades, which leads to pacing issues, with some parts slowing down considerably.\n   - The non-linear narrative, while intriguing, felt slightly disjointed and detracted from my overall satisfaction.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**\n   - The novel touches on themes of survival, belongingness, and human connection, which I found compelling.\n   - Despite the ambiguity, I enjoyed the ending and appreciated the life lessons Aubrey learned through her journey.\n\n- **World-Building and Supporting Characters:**\n   - The author keeps the reader engaged with a flow of interesting characters and enthralling adventures.\n   - While some encounters are impactful, others feel less significant, and the brevity of these interactions made them somewhat tedious over time.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**\n   - The narrative includes episodes of animal hunting/cruelty, with one particularly graphic description that I found disturbing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *A Short Walk Through a Wide World* is a skillfully crafted and wondrous story that explores themes of survival, belongingness, and human connection. While I appreciated the magical realism and Aubrey’s resilience, the pacing issues, disjointed narrative, and limited emotional depth prevented me from fully connecting with the story. Despite these drawbacks, it was an intriguing read with a satisfying, albeit ambiguous, ending.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3.5⭐️"

            "The story centers on Aubry Tourvel, who contracts a mysterious disease at the age of nine in 1885. This affliction compels her to remain in constant motion, as staying in one place for more than 2-4 days triggers uncontrollable convulsions and bleeding. The retroactive nature of her condition prevents her from returning to any previous location. As she travels the world, primarily on foot, Aubry navigates her journey through various modes of transportation, hunting and working for her sustenance while wielding a spear and a gun. Along the way, she forms friendships and romantic connections. The narrative spans decades, depicting her transformation into an elderly woman with white hair, culminating in the advent of commercial air travel. The novel masterfully balances introspection and adventure, offering both contemplative moments and fast-paced action.",
            "This adventure novel, the debut work of an Ohio librarian, is inspired by his decade-long experience on the local panel of the International Dublin Literary Award. The protagonist, Aubry Tourvel, is a strong, admirable, and lovable character whose resilience and adaptability make her journey both compelling and emotionally resonant.",
            "The title *A Short Walk Through a Wide World* implies that any journey within a single lifetime on this planet is brief. This notion resonates with the broader theme of life's transience, echoing the sentiments expressed in Five For Fighting's song \"100 Years\" and the quote from *The Sandman*: \"You get what anybody gets.\"",
            "The novel features enchanting elements, including a magical library that transports individuals to far-off locations and a mysterious wooden puzzle ball whose true nature remains elusive."

        "conclusion": "*A Short Walk Through a Wide World* by the author is a captivating and magical adventure novel that combines a unique premise with rich themes and strong character development. The story of Aubry Tourvel's lifelong journey is both contemplative and fast-paced, making it a memorable read. The inclusion of fantastical elements, such as the magical library and the wooden puzzle ball, adds depth and intrigue to the narrative. Overall, the novel is highly recommended for its imaginative storytelling and emotional resonance.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author Background and Inspiration:**\n   - Douglas Westerbeke, a librarian from Ohio, wrote this adventure novel, his first. He has spent a decade on the local panel of the International Dublin Literary Award, which inspired him to write his own book.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - The story follows Aubry Tourvel, who contracts a mysterious disease in 1885 at the age of nine. The disease forces her to keep moving, as staying in one place for more than 2-4 days causes her to convulse and bleed uncontrollably. This condition is retroactive, meaning she cannot return to any place she has been before.\n   - Aubry travels the world repeatedly, using various modes of transportation, but mostly on foot. She hunts and works for her food, carries a spear and a gun, and makes friends and lovers along the way.\n   - Over time, she ages into an old woman with white hair, and the story spans decades, with commercial air travel becoming a reality by the end.\n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**\n   - The title, *A Short Walk Through a Wide World*, suggests that any journey within a single lifetime and on a single planet is relatively short. This ties into the broader theme of the fleeting nature of life, as encapsulated by the song \"100 Years\" by Five For Fighting and the quote from *The Sandman*: \"You get what anybody gets - you get a lifetime.\"\n\n- **Fantasy Elements:**\n   - The novel includes fantastical elements, such as a magical library (or The Library) that can transport people to distant places. There is also a mysterious wooden puzzle ball, whose nature remains enigmatic.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Aubry Tourvel is portrayed as a strong, admirable, and lovable character. Her resilience and adaptability make her journey compelling and emotionally resonant.\n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**\n   - The novel is described as both contemplative and fast-moving, striking a balance between introspection and adventure.\n\n- **Personal Reflection and Recommendation:**\n   - The reviewer found the novel to be a magical adventure that is easy to admire and love. They express gratitude to NetGalley and Simon and Schuster Canada for providing an advance reader copy and emphasize that the review reflects their honest opinions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*A Short Walk Through a Wide World* by Douglas Westerbeke is a captivating and magical adventure novel that combines a unique premise with rich themes and strong character development.

I would have preferred more background on the magic puzzle ball, the sickness, and the origins of the plot before diving into 9-year-old Aubry’s journey and her loneliness. The book primarily focuses on Aubry’s solo travels, which disrupts the pacing. Additionally, the absence of other character perspectives was disappointing. Even days after finishing, I’m still unsure about the ending; I can’t quite articulate my expectations, leaving me feeling uncertain.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Overall Enjoyment and Comparison to Other Works:**  \n   - I liked the book but didn’t love it. It was missing something in the execution that I can’t quite pinpoint.  \n   - It was compared to *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue*, but it doesn’t come close to that level of magic. However, if you enjoyed *Addie LaRue* and love travel and learning about the world, this book might still be worth checking out.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - I listened to the audiobook and highly recommend it. The narrator, who also narrates Kate Quinn’s books, is one of my favorites and brought the story to life beautifully.  \n\n- **Premise and Creativity:**  \n   - The premise is incredibly interesting, and I applaud the author for their creativity. It’s insane that this is a debut novel—I’d definitely check out their future work.  \n\n- **Themes and Reflection:**  \n   - The book explores strong themes like humanity, discovery, strength, and survival. It makes you wonder: What would you do if you couldn’t stay in the same place for more than 2-3 days? Would it be hell or cool?  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The author wrote the female main character (FMC) well, especially as a little girl. She was funny at times, which added charm to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - My main issue was that the travel started too quickly. I wanted more about the magic puzzle ball, the sickness, and how it all began before diving into 9-year-old Aubry’s travels and her life of loneliness.  \n   - The majority of the book focuses on Aubry’s solo travels, which made the pacing feel off. The lack of other character perspectives was a letdown.  \n\n- **Favorite Moments:**  \n   - Some of my favorite chapters were when Aubry interacted with other characters, like the Prince, the girl studying her, and the guy on the train.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - I’m still unsure how I feel about the ending, even days after finishing the book. I don’t know how I expected it to end, so I’m left feeling uncertain. I’d love to discuss it with other readers who’ve finished it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a good magical realism novel with a very interesting premise and plot. It’s a great book club or discussion book, but it’s missing something to make it truly great in my opinion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up to 4 for Goodreads."

There’s a sense of both too much and too little happening at the same time, which left me conflicted.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt strange, and the storytelling was inconsistent. At times, the storyline flowed well with the characters, but other times it felt disjointed and pulled me out of the book.  \n\n- **Characterization (Main Character):**  \n  The main character was hard to connect with, especially in a story that is so character-driven.

Meanwhile, the women in the story did the real work in the background to keep the main character from falling apart.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magical Realism:**  \n  The book is steeped in magical realism, but there were many loose ends and no clear explanation of the magic system or the significance of certain elements, like the key.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I wouldn’t not recommend this book.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The novel presents a unique and intriguing premise where a 9-year-old girl with a strong personality is afflicted with a condition that forces her to travel constantly. The catch is that she can never stay in one place for more than three days and can never return to any location she has visited. This concept of perpetual movement and the inability to return resonated with me as a metaphor for escape and the longing for freedom.  \n\n- **Narrative and Plot Development:**  \n  The story revolves around the girl's journey, which is both physical and emotional. The addition of a mysterious puzzle ball with a mind of its own adds an element of intrigue and unpredictability to the narrative. I found the plot engaging and well-paced, keeping me invested in the protagonist's experiences and challenges.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The protagonist, a 9-year-old girl with attitude, is vividly portrayed. Her personality and resilience shine through, making her a compelling and relatable character. Her struggles and the constraints of her condition are depicted in a way that evokes empathy and curiosity.  \n\n- **Themes and Interpretation:**  \n  The book explores themes of escape, freedom, and the human desire to break free from limitations. I interpreted the girl's condition as a metaphor for the universal longing to leave behind problems and start anew, even if it comes with its own set of challenges.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The combination of a unique premise, well-developed characters, and an engaging plot made it a memorable and thought-provoking read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a fresh and imaginative take on the concept of escape and the human desire for freedom. With its compelling protagonist, intriguing plot, and thought-provoking themes, it is a story that stays with you long after you finish reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.  \n\n*A sincere thank you to Douglas Westerbeke, Avid Reader Press, and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently review.*"

However, the pacing occasionally falters, with slower sections that lean more on telling than showing, a consequence of the narrative's expansive scope. The non-linear structure also detracted from my overall enjoyment, making the story feel somewhat disjointed and hindering my immersion in Aubrey’s struggles. Despite this, I appreciated the ambiguous ending, which prompted me to reflect on Aubrey’s journey and its broader significance.",

            "The story quickly became repetitive after an engaging start. The pattern of Aubrey forming connections, only to leave after 1-4 days due to bleeding, felt monotonous and detracted from the overall enjoyment.",
            "The side characters often felt indistinguishable, defined only by their nationalities. Aubrey's character, while driven by a desire for connection and resilience, lacked depth.",
            "I enjoyed the author's writing style and would gladly explore more of their works.",
            "The magic system lacked clarity and explanation, leaving several key questions unanswered: Why do the hidden libraries exist? Was Aubrey cursed or blessed? What is the significance of the puzzle ball? And what led to the resolution of the ending?",
            "Magical realism isn't usually my preferred genre, and I approached this book with some skepticism, especially given its comparisons to *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue* (which I rated 3 stars) and *Life of Pi* (my least favorite book). However, the first chapter immediately captured my attention. The premise of a girl cursed—or perhaps blessed—to wander the earth for eternity is both unique and intriguing. For the first 100 pages, I found myself genuinely engaged."

While I didn’t connect with the story, it may still resonate with readers who enjoy adventurous tales and are willing to overlook its flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐ 2/5 (DNFs are usually 1-star ratings, but I gave it an extra star out of respect for the author being a fellow librarian and the potential it might have for other readers.)"

            "The story centers on Aubry Tourvel, a young girl in 1885 Paris, who mysteriously falls ill after discovering a puzzle ball. Her condition is paradoxical: she appears healthy yet cannot remain in one place for long without enduring excruciating pain. The narrative chronicles Aubry's life from adolescence to old age, delving into her struggles for survival, experiences of exile, and the relationships she forges along the way. The non-linear storytelling weaves together events from various times and places, creating a rich and intricate tapestry.",
            "Aubry is a stubborn yet resilient protagonist whose love and energy profoundly impact those around her. Her stubbornness serves as a survival mechanism, while the deep sense of family and the relationships she forges add significant emotional depth to the story.",
            "This book evokes the essence of *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue* and *Life of Pi*, yet it remains distinctly unique. It captures the atmosphere of *Three Thousand Years of Longing*, the themes of *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button*, the motif of doors from *The Starless Sea*, and the existential exploration found in *Dark Matter*. The narrative delves into resilience, exile, and the human condition, intertwining spirituality and melancholy to create a profound sense of both peace and sorrow. Beautiful proverbs and wisdom enrich the story, adding depth and emotional resonance. I found myself deeply moved, often brought to tears, while also experiencing a sense of spiritual calm."

        "conclusion": "This book is a beautifully crafted, emotionally resonant story that follows the life of Aubry Tourvel, a character whose resilience and humanity leave a lasting impression. The non-linear storytelling, rich themes, and profound emotional impact make it a standout read. I highly recommend it and hope for its adaptation into visual media.",

            "The first half of the book is enchanting and well-paced, immersing me in Aubry's plight and her relentless journey. However, the second half feels disjointed due to the introduction of a deus ex machina element that disrupts the narrative flow and undermines coherence. The conclusion is nonsensical and inconsistent with the rest of the story, leaving me dissatisfied. It evokes comparisons to *Addie LaRue* rather than *Life of Pi*, indicating a lack of resolution and thematic alignment. \n\nDespite this, the premise of a character who cannot remain in one place without becoming ill is compelling and drives the story effectively. The narrative explores the emotional and physical toll of Aubry's condition, making her journey both heartbreaking and fascinating. Themes of grief, self-reliance, and the kindness of others are woven naturally into the plot, enriching the overall experience.",

I wished for more background on the magic puzzle ball, the illness, and the origins of the story before immersing myself in 9-year-old Aubry’s lonely journey. The book mainly centers on her solo adventures, and I found the pacing, along with the absence of other character perspectives, disappointing. Even days after finishing, I'm still ambivalent about the ending. I can't quite articulate my expectations, leaving me with mixed feelings. I’d love to discuss it with other readers who have also completed the book!",

It was missing something in the execution that I can’t quite pinpoint.  \n   - It was compared to *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue*, but it doesn’t come close to that level of magic. However, if you enjoyed *Addie LaRue* and love travel and learning about the world, this book might still be worth checking out.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - I listened to the audiobook and highly recommend it. The narrator, who also narrates Kate Quinn’s books, is one of my favorites and brought the story to life beautifully.  \n\n- **Premise and Creativity:**  \n   - The premise is incredibly interesting, and I applaud the author for their creativity. It’s impressive that this is a debut novel, and I’d definitely check out their future work.  \n\n- **Themes and Reflection:**  \n   - The book explores strong themes like humanity, discovery, strength, and survival. It makes you wonder: What would you do if you couldn’t stay in the same place for more than 2-3 days? Would it be hell or cool?  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The author wrote the female main character (FMC) well, especially as a little girl. She was funny at times, which added charm to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - My main issue was that the travel started too quickly. I wanted more background on the magic puzzle ball, the sickness, and how it all began before diving into 9-year-old Aubry’s travels and her life of loneliness.  \n   - The majority of the book focuses on Aubry’s solo travels, and the pacing, along with the lack of other character perspectives, was a bit of a letdown for me.  \n\n- **Favorite Moments:**  \n   - Some of my favorite chapters were when Aubry interacted with other characters, like the Prince, the girl studying her, and the guy on the train.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - I’m still unsure how I feel about the ending, even days after finishing the book. I don’t know how I expected it to end, so I’m left with mixed feelings. I’d love to discuss it with other readers who’ve finished it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a good magical realism novel with a very interesting premise and plot. It’s a great book club or discussion book, but it’s missing something to make it truly great in my opinion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up to 4 for Goodreads."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Ambition and Execution:**  \n  I found this novel incredibly ambitious for a debut, but I’m not sure if it fully lived up to the ambition it strived for. There’s a sense of both too much and too little happening at the same time, which left me conflicted.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt strange to me. At times, the storyline flowed naturally with the characters, but other times it felt disjointed and took me out of the book. This inconsistency made it harder to stay fully engaged.  \n\n- **Characterization (Main Character):**  \n  The main character was hard for me to connect with, especially in a story that is so character-driven. I felt that certain integral aspects of her identity as a woman were left unexplored, which is often the case when women are written by men.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n  I expected this to be a book about humanity, with the main character as the catalyst. Instead, it felt more like a story about a series of men trying to save a damsel in distress, while the women in the background did the real work to keep the main character from falling apart.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magical Realism:**  \n  The book is steeped in magical realism, but there were many loose ends and no clear explanation of the magic system or the significance of certain elements, like the key. This lack of clarity was a bit frustrating.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I wouldn’t not recommend this book. It’s an easy read and could be a great vacation book—perfect for reading on a plane or in an airport.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel shows promise with its ambition and magical realism, it struggles with pacing, characterization, and thematic focus. Despite these issues, it remains an accessible and enjoyable read, particularly for casual settings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The narrative shifts frequently between past and present as Aubrey meets new people and reflects on previous encounters. This back-and-forth structure was initially confusing, particularly between pages 80-200, but became easier to follow later. However, the disjointed flow disrupted my engagement with the story and made it harder to connect with Aubrey’s journey. The novel centers on Aubrey Tourvel, who suffers from a mysterious and gruesome illness that forces her to keep moving, risking death if she returns to familiar places. While the premise intrigued me, the execution ultimately left me unsatisfied. The lack of clear answers or justification for Aubrey’s suffering made the story feel frustrating and pointless.",

            "The book's tone is overwhelmingly bleak and horrific, as Aubrey endures relentless emotional and physical suffering. While I appreciate dark themes, the absence of purpose or resolution renders the story unnecessarily grim. Brief moments of emotional resonance, like the depiction of childhood illness, are overshadowed by the pervasive bleakness.",

However, the relentless focus on her suffering—marked by excruciating pain and constant bleeding—became repetitive and overwhelming. Over time, this portrayal felt gratuitous, lacking a meaningful resolution or purpose."
