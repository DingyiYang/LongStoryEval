The narrative feels disjointed, as events unfold largely to facilitate grand evil speeches from the characters. While the Red Queen's schemes for Caro and Icca are intriguing, they become lost amid the confusion and redundancy of the plot. Initially, the pacing is promising, but it deteriorates over time, making it challenging to follow the storyline. The repetitiveness of character actions and motivations ultimately led to my disengagement. As a result, I did not finish the book, stopping at 70% due to growing confusion and waning interest in the latter half.",

Meanwhile, Caro and Hattie have a codependent, sister-like bond: Caro idolizes Hattie, who, while fond of Caro, wouldn’t go out of her way to save her. Ultimately, the story reveals that all three girls yearn for recognition and love, yet it underscores the harsh truth that people often disappoint and fail to truly understand one another.",

While Caro and Icca’s dynamic starts off thrilling, it quickly becomes predictable and repetitive. Their chemistry feels lacking, and the romantic tension fails to resonate.

The retelling aspect feels superficial, serving more as aesthetic embellishment than as a means to enhance the narrative's depth.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Coherence:**\n   - The novel felt incoherent at times, with some instances seeming deliberate and others due to overindulgence.\n   - The author’s deep understanding of her characters was evident, but the narrative often rambled, inserting the author’s own analysis and thoughts rather than letting the characters speak for themselves.\n   - The retelling aspect of the story felt superficial, like mere aesthetics or set dressing, and didn’t add much depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**\n   - Hattie’s near-invincibility and chilling collectedness made her feel like a horror movie monster rather than a Mary Sue, which was intriguing. However, the lack of clarity about the limits of her magic was frustrating.\n   - Icca’s decline and Hattie’s abilities were portrayed with artistic body horror, which I appreciated.\n   - Caro and Icca’s back-and-forth was thrilling at first but became predictable and repetitive over time. Their chemistry felt lacking, and their romantic/sexual tension didn’t resonate with me.\n   - Cheshire’s character was annoying, and his quasi-love triangle with Icca led nowhere, making him feel irrelevant to the story.\n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**\n   - The magic system was gruesomely artistic, particularly in its depiction of body horror, which I enjoyed.\n   - The inclusion of Korean honorifics and cultural dress was a nice touch, adding a layer of casual diversity to the story.\n   - The Saint Races and Icca’s trial were confusing and left me unsure of what was happening, detracting from the overall experience.\n\n- **Pacing and Stakes:**\n   - The first quarter of the book built up a sense of dread effectively, but the stakes seemed to disappear as the story progressed.\n   - The middle/third quarter was the most engaging, as I began to settle into the madness of each character.\n   - The ending was a mess, with Icca’s POV feeling inconsistent with her character development. The “villain in someone else’s story” angle didn’t suit her.\n\n- **Themes and Moral Complexity:**\n   - The moral grayness and evil of the characters felt overdone and edgy rather than complex, which diminished their impact.\n   - Some concepts, like the casual inclusion of Korean elements and the thrill of Caro and Icca’s dynamic, were appreciated but ultimately overshadowed by the story’s flaws.\n\n- **Callbacks and References:**\n   - The nods to the original *Alice in Wonderland* felt forced and sometimes made me laugh or put the book down. Examples include the “Wonderland is like a looking glass” and “eat me” callbacks.\n\n- **Memorable Moments and Quotes:**\n   - Despite the flaws, there were a few standout quotes, such as “glorious magic was seen in those days, but also glorious hubris,” which were impactful.\n   - Caro and Icca, as a concept, became fascinating to me, and I found myself hyperfixating on the book until the disappointing ending.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel had moments of brilliance, particularly in its artistic depiction of body horror and the intriguing concept of Caro and Icca, it was ultimately let down by incoherent writing, confusing plot points, and an unsatisfying ending. The moral complexity of the characters felt overdone, and the callbacks to *Alice in Wonderland* often fell flat. Despite these issues, the book had enough compelling elements to keep me engaged, even if it left me frustrated by the end.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Additional star for memorable quotes and the hyperfixation-inducing concept of Caro and Icca."

Her speech was perfectly aligned with the story, her personality was well-defined, and her motives were clearly articulated. She was the most developed and least confusing character in the narrative. \n\n**Hattie:** An intriguing character, Hattie began as slightly eccentric yet sensible, and her descent into madness was masterfully depicted. Her compelling development added significant depth to the story. \n\n**Kai:** Despite his name, Mordekai, Kai brought a fun and lighthearted tone to the narrative, enhancing its overall appeal. \n\n**Icca:** In contrast, Icca felt inconsistent and difficult to grasp. The narrator's descriptions often contradicted her actions, making her frustrating and unlikable. Given her major role, this inconsistency was a notable drawback. The resolution between Icca and Caro was also unsatisfying; their relationship issues felt unresolved, and their dynamic—oscillating between animosity and a lack of clear motivation for their hatred—was frustrating.",

I personally enjoyed it.  \n   - It’s a chaotic, messy, gruesome, and diabolical trip, and you have to be okay with that.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The FMCs (female main characters) are mentally unstable, dark, and terrible people. They are exaggerated, violent, and have clear mental health issues.  \n   - There is no meaningful growth or triumph over their dark traits; instead, they embrace their flaws, and the world around them is equally unhinged.  \n   - I could see parts of myself in their exaggerated behaviors, having struggled with mental health issues in the past.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - There is no profound plot or character development, nor a satisfying conclusion or HEA (happily ever after).  \n   - The story revolves around the FMCs doing crazy, messy things to feel something and avoid their grief while trying to exterminate a race of grotesque beings called Saints.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing is intentionally long, winding, and repetitive, resembling a trippy stream of consciousness.  \n   - Despite the ridiculousness, there are some poignant tidbits in the narration.  \n\n- **Content and Tone:**  \n   - The book is unhinged, creative, random, and nonsensical, much like *Alice in Wonderland*, which it is inspired by.  \n   - It’s quite gory for a YA book, with graphic descriptions like skin melting and sticking to the ceiling.  \n   - The character names are intentionally insane (e.g., “Icca”), which can be jarring.  \n\n- **Cultural and Mythological Influences:**  \n   - I loved the Korean mythology influence and the cool magic powers.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Despite its flaws, the book was a lot of fun. It leans heavily into craziness, which might be too much at times, but overall, I had a great time.  \n   - I’d recommend it if you’re open to embracing a chaotic, insane reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a wild, unhinged ride with exaggerated, flawed characters and a chaotic, nonsensical plot. While it lacks meaningful growth or a satisfying conclusion, its creativity, gore, and trippy writing style make it a fun, polarizing read.

This dual timeline adds depth and complexity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The book delves into profound themes such as the nature of love, the blurred lines between love and obsession, and the lengths characters will go to survive. It also explores the sacrifices of morality for expedience, set against a backdrop of a fantastical, monstrous world.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The story is set in a Wonderland-like world filled with man-made monsters, where grief can be deadly, and survival often comes at the cost of one's moral compass.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are described as \"messy and complicated and lonely and afraid,\" yet they are oddly relatable. Their development is marked by their transformation into beings \"all teeth and claws and ardent delusion,\" shaped by their harsh environment.  \n\n- **Reader's Personal Reaction:**  \n  While the story might sound \"horrible\" to some (as noted by the reviewer's husband), the reviewer found it compelling and not at all off-putting. The characters' complexity and the poetic nature of the writing made the story resonate deeply.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a polarizing book that combines raw, gruesome elements with poetic beauty.

This chaotic nature kept me thoroughly engaged, even though it often felt nonsensical and contradictory.  \n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n  The story explores themes of change, grief, transformation, and the desire for love and recognition. It delves into the flaws of humanity, both in others and ourselves, and portrays characters who are morally ambiguous, driven by power, love, and revenge.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Not a single character is morally good; they are cruel and complex, yet I found myself drawn to them. Their flaws and motivations made them compelling, even if they were difficult to like.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The narration is unconventional, skipping like a stone between characters' thoughts and feelings. This loose, fragmented approach adds to the book's chaotic and engaging nature.  \n\n- **Originality and Retelling:**  \n  While the book borrows concepts, themes, and names, it is not a traditional retelling. Instead, it reimagines these elements in frightening and compelling ways, making it a unique and unconventional take on familiar ideas.  \n\n- **Accessibility and Appeal:**  \n  This book is not for everyone.

The story begins with subtle references that help orient readers before embarking on its own unique path. However, the narrative slows in the middle, creating a sense of stagnation. While there is a buildup to the revelation of the characters' backstory, the payoff takes longer to arrive than expected.",

While the inspiration is clear in the tone and atmosphere, the story diverges significantly from the original. I found the character names, such as Hattie November Kkul and Iccadora Alice Sickle, somewhat unappealing. Additionally, the relationship between Icca and Caro, presented as young lovers, felt underdeveloped. Their bond relied heavily on physical intimacy, and even in their youth, they didn’t appear to genuinely like each other.",

The visceral portrayal of magic, oozing from its user in trickles, streams, and clotted clumps, was both captivating and unsettling.

            "The main characters, Caro and Alice, are portrayed as deeply flawed and morally complex individuals. Initially, they exist in a morally gray space, but as the story progresses, they evolve into nearly irredeemable figures. Their descent into darkness is intricately linked to their traumatic upbringing and the horrific world around them. The dynamic between Caro and Alice, stemming from a past romantic relationship, is both fascinating and skillfully executed.",
            "While I appreciate the author's meticulous attention to detail in aspects of worldbuilding, such as the Saints and royal lineage, I find the overall execution to be messy and inconsistent. For instance, the distinction between humanoid Jabberwocky gentry and monstrous Jabberwocky creatures is unclear, and the reimagined *Alice in Wonderland* names feel overly obvious and corny. The story may have been more effective as a standalone dystopian fantasy, free from the *Alice in Wonderland* pretense.",
            "The author skillfully maintains suspense and creates a palpable sense of danger throughout the story. The use of chapter subheadings, such as “There are [x] remaining Saints,” effectively tracks the escalating threat and body count, enhancing both tension and the scale of the world. This dark fairytale retelling leans heavily into horror elements, making it notably darker than the author's previous works—often straddling the line between new adult and YA. The genuine horror atmosphere sets it apart from older dark fairytales, which often relied more on edginess and shock value than on authentic terror."

The reviewer appreciates the modern, visually appealing design, which they believe is a step forward for the genre.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**\n   - The novel is described as a dark fairytale retelling, leaning heavily into horror elements. The reviewer highlights that the book is darker than Mikuta’s previous works, almost bordering on new adult rather than YA. They commend the genuine horror atmosphere, contrasting it with older dark fairytales that relied on edginess and shock value rather than true horror.\n\n- **Characterization and Morality:**\n   - The main characters, Caro and Alice, are analyzed as deeply flawed and morally complex. The reviewer notes that while they start as morally gray, they evolve into nearly irredeemable individuals by the present timeline. Their descent into awfulness is tied to their traumatic upbringing and the horrific world they inhabit. The dynamic between them, rooted in a past romantic relationship, is described as fascinating and well-executed.\n\n- **Queer Representation:**\n   - The novel is praised for its unflinching queer representation, particularly its sapphic themes. The reviewer contrasts this with older fairytale retellings, where queerness was often sidelined or used as a trope for tragic side characters. They appreciate the normalization and depth of queer relationships in this story.\n\n- **Suspense and Horror Execution:**\n   - The reviewer commends Mikuta’s ability to maintain suspense and create a palpable sense of danger. They highlight the use of chapter subheadings (e.g., “There are [x] remaining Saints”) as an effective tool to track the escalating threat and kill count, which adds to the tension and scale of the world.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**\n   - While the reviewer acknowledges Mikuta’s attention to detail in certain aspects of worldbuilding (e.g., the Saints, the royal lineage), they criticize the overall execution as messy and inconsistent. Specific examples include the unclear distinction between humanoid Jabberwocky gentry and monstrous Jabberwocky creatures, as well as the overly obvious and corny reworking of Alice in Wonderland-related names. The reviewer suggests that the story might have worked better as a standalone dystopian fantasy without the Alice in Wonderland pretense.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Off With Their Heads* is a dark, unflinching retelling that showcases Zoe Hana Mikuta’s talent for suspense, horror, and complex character dynamics. While the novel excels in creating a genuinely horrific atmosphere and delivering compelling queer representation, its worldbuilding falters with inconsistencies and underdeveloped elements.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The strength of the characters, Caro and Icca, lies in their emotional depth. Their journey explores grief, revenge, and obsession, blurring the line between love and hate. Their relationship evolves from passionate young love to sworn enemies, adding emotional complexity to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story's pacing is a mixed bag. While it is filled with action, the exposition feels bulky and slows the narrative. The shifts between timelines (their youth as lovers and their reunion as enemies) and additional POVs (Cheshire and the queen) add depth but further disrupt the pacing.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Zoe Hana Mikuta excels at creating vast, intricate, and often confusing worlds. This reimagining of Wonderland as a dark, nightmare forest with unique magical systems (e.g., Caro controls crows, Icca travels through shadows) amplifies the horror element and transforms the classic setting into a haunting universe.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The sapphic romance between Caro and Icca is powerful and central to the story. Their love, which begins as indestructible, morphs into hatred after a devastating loss. Even as enemies, their connection remains an undercurrent, making their relationship maddening, unrelenting, and heartbreaking.\n\n- **Mystery/Suspense:**  \n  The mystery surrounding the queen and her secrets adds a layer of intrigue that helps maintain interest despite the slow pacing. This element of suspense is crucial to keeping the reader engaged.\n\n- **Tone/Prose:**  \n  Mikuta's prose is poetic and reminiscent of Tamsyn Muir's style, creating a dizzying, almost incomprehensible yet beautiful narrative. The language enhances the bizarre, magical atmosphere of the story, making it both eerie and captivating. The tone is weird but beautifully so, appealing to those who enjoy unconventional storytelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Off With Their Heads* is a dark, sapphic reimagining of *Alice in Wonderland* that explores themes of love, hate, grief, and revenge. While the pacing can be slow and the world-building complex, the emotional depth of the characters, the haunting atmosphere, and the poetic prose make it a compelling read.

However, the magic system lacked clarity, especially concerning the formation of the Saints and the mechanics of their powers.

Additionally, the ambiguity surrounding the world's functioning, beyond its approach to criminals, left the worldbuilding feeling incomplete.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n   - I had high hopes for this book, especially as an *Alice in Wonderland* retelling with toxic lovers-to-enemies lesbians. However, it didn’t fully meet my expectations.  \n   - While the writing had some nice lines and wasn’t bad, the execution of the worldbuilding and character development left me disappointed.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n   - The worldbuilding was intriguing and deliciously gory, with magic described as overflowing from every open space in the body, as intrinsic as blood.  \n   - However, the magic system was poorly explained, particularly regarding the formation of the Saints and how their magic works. It seemed like everyone’s magic was different, but this wasn’t clarified well.  \n   - The lack of clarity about how the world functions beyond its treatment of criminals made the worldbuilding feel incomplete.  \n\n- **Connection to *Alice in Wonderland*:**  \n   - This isn’t a true *Alice in Wonderland* retelling. It borrows vaguely Wonderland-esque names like “Hattie,” “Iccadora Alice,” “Carousel Rabbit,” and “Wonderland,” but the connection feels superficial.  \n   - The misuse of “Jabberwocky” instead of “Jabberwock” was a minor but noticeable inaccuracy.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters fell flat. Beyond their hatred for each other, there wasn’t much depth or backstory to make them compelling.  \n   - The transition from lovers to enemies wasn’t well-explained, even with a chapter dedicated to the moment they turned against each other.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Book:**  \n   - **Korean-inspired setting:** The inclusion of a Korean-inspired setting and actual Korean words was refreshing and a welcome departure from typical Westernized fantasy worlds.  \n   - **Concept of the Saints:** The Saints were genuinely gory and spooky, with their ability to crack ribs open and display victims on ceilings.  \n   - **Magic system:** Despite its poor explanation, the magic system was imaginative and unique, especially the main characters’ powers involving crows and shadows.  \n   - **Narrative voice:** The narrator’s direct address to the reader and quips about the situation added a unique charm. The non-linear storytelling, bouncing between past and present, was confusing but fun.  \n   - **Embracing madness:** The book didn’t try to make Wonderland sane or logical, which felt true to the chaotic spirit of the original story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some standout elements, such as its Korean-inspired setting, imaginative magic system, and unique narrative voice, it fell short in delivering a cohesive worldbuilding experience and compelling character development. The connection to *Alice in Wonderland* felt superficial, and the confusion around the magic system and character motivations detracted from the overall enjoyment. Despite its potential, the book left me wanting more clarity and depth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book offers a fresh and engaging take on Wonderland, skillfully weaving in references to the original *Alice in Wonderland* while presenting them in unique ways. The adaptation strikes a perfect balance between familiarity and originality, making it one of the best I've read. However, be warned: it contains graphic depictions of gore, violence, and torture involving both people and animals.",
            "**Carousel Rabbit (Caro):** A chaotic and traumatized character with a unique connection to crows. My relationship with Icca is a complex blend of love and hatred. **Iccadora Alice Sickle (Icca):** My polar opposite, she wields darkness and shares a similar past but has made different choices. **Mordekai Cheshire (Kai):** A fun, gossip-loving character who can turn invisible, cleverly sidestepping the painful side effects of magic. **Hattie November Kkul:** A multifaceted character who learns to accept herself and propels much of the storyline. **Narrator:** An unreliable yet humorous presence, the narrator adds a playful, meta layer to the story, often addressing me directly.",
            "In this reimagining of Wonderland, the setting transforms into a stunning yet menacing forest where individuals become exaggerated versions of themselves. The forest and its inhabitants, particularly the Saints—deformed monsters stripped of humanity—are vividly portrayed. Other locations, such as the walled villages, the labyrinth, and Petra, the capital, are intricately developed, enriching the narrative. Religion significantly influences the characters, who worship various entities, adding layers to their motivations.",
            "This story is dark and violent, featuring morally complex characters. It delves into themes of transformation, identity, and the consequences of power. The humor and unreliable narration provide a counterbalance to the darker elements, resulting in an engaging read."

        "conclusion": "This book is a unique and dark reimagining of *Alice in Wonderland*, blending familiar elements with original twists. The vivid worldbuilding, complex characters, and morally ambiguous narrative make it a compelling read. While it requires focus to follow the nonlinear timeline and intricate relationships, the story is both fun and thought-provoking. The unreliable narrator adds a layer of humor and intrigue, making this a standout adaptation.",

            "The characters in this story are intentionally angry and morally ambiguous, lacking traditional character arcs. Instead of the typical journey from good to bad, they embody a passionate and vicious relationship that highlights their villainous development. This deliberate choice showcases a unique narrative that beautifully captures their descent into madness, setting it apart from the morally upright arcs commonly found in literature.",
            "The prose was beautifully ornate and meandering, perfectly capturing the whimsical tone of the Wonderland setting. The narrator's imaginative and eccentric voice mirrored that of the main characters, Icca and Carousel, enhancing the book's charm.",
            "The magic system in this story is both unique and captivating. The imagery of magic seeping from characters' mouths, nails, and eyes is strikingly beautiful yet horrifying. The world-building is intricate and immersive, drawing parallels to the original *Alice in Wonderland* as the narrative unfolds, though the similarities are primarily limited to character names and the overarching theme of madness.",

I often judge books by their covers, and this one did not disappoint.\n   - The synopsis, describing a sapphic Korean-inspired reimagining of Alice in Wonderland with two insane women, intrigued me from the start.\n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**\n   - The prose was flowery and rambling, which I felt perfectly matched the tone and style of the story, especially since it’s set in Wonderland.\n   - The narrator was imaginative and just as mad as the main characters, Icca and Carousel, which added to the charm of the book.\n\n- **Character Development and Morality:**\n   - The characters were angry and lacked traditional \"good\" character arcs, but this was intentional. They were morally gray, evil, and insane, and the story focused on their passionate and vicious relationship.\n   - Their lack of growth was deliberate, showcasing a \"villainous\" character development rather than the typical morally correct arcs seen in most books. They started out good and became bad, which was beautifully written.\n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**\n   - The story was slow-paced, which some readers might find challenging, but I thought it fit the narrative well.\n   - The book kept me guessing until the very end, which is rare for me. I usually have some idea of where a story is heading, but this one was unpredictable.\n\n- **Magic System and World-Building:**\n   - The magic system was unique and fascinating. The imagery of magic leaking out of their mouths, nails, and eyes was both beautiful and horrifying.\n   - The world-building was intricate and immersive, with the story becoming more similar to the original Alice in Wonderland as it progressed, though the only direct similarities were the character names and the theme of madness.\n\n- **Reader Engagement and Confusion:**\n   - The book required some brain power to get through certain moments due to its convoluted and \"mad\" wording. There were times when I was entirely lost, but I usually figured things out early on.\n   - Despite the confusion, the unpredictability of the plot and the depth of the characters kept me engaged throughout.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book immediately became one of my favorites of the year.

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the dynamic between Icca and Caro, as well as their individual characterizations. Both characters can be genuinely terrible to each other and those around them, creating a fascinating mix of hateability that I found captivating. I appreciated the author’s willingness to portray all main characters as deeply flawed, rather than relying on the often superficial \"morally gray\" archetype. While they possess some redeeming qualities, their vengeful and obsessive tendencies frequently overshadow these traits, adding to their complexity. My favorite aspect of the story was the revelation of their personalities, particularly through the dual timelines.",

Occasionally, the cultural setting felt diminished, but I respect the author’s choice to maintain a balance in this regard.",

The flawed, complex characters, the dark and sarcastic prose, and the immersive atmosphere made it a standout read.

I highly recommend this book to fans of fantasy, horror, or anyone looking for a gripping and unique read.",

The flawed, complex characters, the dark and sarcastic prose, and the immersive atmosphere made it a standout read. While the plot had moments of confusion and the cultural elements could have been more prominent, these were minor issues in an otherwise incredible story. I highly recommend this book to fans of fantasy, horror, or anyone looking for a gripping and unique read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a very high rating, likely 4.5/5 or 5/5."

            "The story centers on two young magic users exiled to a forest inhabited by mysterious creatures known as Saints. Their struggle for survival, alongside the fervor of their relationship, drives the narrative. Although the novel is presented as a retelling of *Alice in Wonderland*, it shares only a few names and catchphrases with the original, diverging significantly from its source material.",
            "The ongoing angst and conflict between the two main characters felt excessive, hindering the story's pacing. Their repetitive discussions of hatred and dreams of each other's demise became tiresome, detracting from the narrative momentum.

            "The magic system in this story is both unique and complex, with each character's magic manifesting in distinct ways. One character sheds magical tears to command birds, while another channels her power through her back teeth, releasing it through her nose and mouth as she travels through shadows. This magic is cultivated through intense suffering and pain, making it one of the most distinctive systems I've encountered in fantasy.",

However, the story did not meet my expectations.  \n\n- **Characterization and Names:**  \n   - I found the names of the characters to be unappealing, except for Caro and Kai. I agree with other reviewers who questioned why the protagonist couldn’t simply be named Alice.  \n   - The characters were described as morally ambiguous, but I found them lacking any redeeming qualities. I disliked them from the beginning, and my opinion did not change by the end. There were no significant character arcs or growth.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n   - The frequent time-skipping made it difficult for me to follow the story and stay engaged.  \n   - I struggled to find context or clarity, even after reading a third of the book.  \n\n- **World-Building and Descriptions:**  \n   - The lack of detailed descriptions left the world feeling empty and underdeveloped. While there were minor mentions of hair color and a few other details, it felt like the characters were moving through a blank canvas.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n   - The use of an old-time narration style, with phrases like \"dear reader,\" often pulled me out of the story. It felt as though someone was verbally telling the story rather than immersing me in it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial excitement for the book’s concept and cover, I found the execution lacking. The unappealing characters, confusing plot structure, sparse world-building, and distracting narrative style made it difficult for me to enjoy the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

It came across as cringey and unconvincing.\n\n- **Positive Elements:**  \n  I found the Red Queen character interesting, and I appreciated the positive LGBTQ representation in the story. However, these aspects weren’t enough to outweigh the issues I had with the book.\n\n- **Engagement and Completion:**  \n  I ultimately decided to DNF (Did Not Finish) the book at 60%. The lack of coherence and development made it difficult to stay engaged, and I ended up looking up the ending instead of finishing the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some intriguing elements, such as the Red Queen and LGBTQ representation, the lack of coherent world-building, underdeveloped concepts, and unconvincing character arcs made it difficult to enjoy. The disconnect between my expectations and the actual story further contributed to my decision to stop reading.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (No specific rating score mentioned in the review.)"

While the extreme violence and disturbing scenes may not be for everyone, the clever character remakes, witty writing, and creative elements like the fourth-wall breaks and Korean inclusions make it a memorable read. However, the lack of redemption arcs for key characters and the overall confusion left me with mixed feelings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"
