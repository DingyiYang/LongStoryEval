            "The Russian antagonists in the story serve as compelling antiheroes, and it is gratifying to witness their eventual comeuppance. While the main character, Argyle, leans towards being a Marty Stu—an overly idealized figure—he remains tolerable throughout the narrative.",
            "This book is dynamic, expertly written, and showcases the skills of a seasoned author. Its neat and beautiful prose keeps the narrative fast-paced and engaging.",
            "This adventure novel offers a blend of thrilling chases, intense shootouts, and a courageous team of CIA operatives. Although the genre isn't my favorite—ten pages detailing just ten minutes of the characters' lives can feel tedious—I still found the story engaging."

        "conclusion": "This is a well-crafted adventure novel with a fast-paced, action-packed narrative. While it’s not my usual genre, it’s an enjoyable read, especially with its satisfying portrayal of antagonists and dynamic storytelling. The book has strong potential for adaptation, and I’m curious to see how it would translate to the screen.",

Everything is neat, beautiful, and fast-paced.  \n  - While it’s not my preferred genre, as I find reading 10 pages about 10 minutes of the characters' lives to be a bit tedious, it’s still an engaging adventure.  \n\n- **Characters and Antagonists:**  \n  - The antagonists are, of course, the Russians, but they are portrayed as antiheroes, and it’s satisfying to read about them getting their comeuppance.  \n  - The main character, Argyle, is somewhat of a Marty Stu (an idealized character), but he’s tolerable.  \n\n- **Adaptation Potential:**  \n  - The story feels like it would translate better to the screen than as a book, given its dynamic nature.  \n  - I’m curious if the bloody details will be included in a potential adaptation.  \n  - The tone seems to fall somewhere between James Bond and Charlie’s Angels, which is intriguing.  \n  - I’m also curious about who would play Argyle in a film adaptation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a well-crafted adventure novel with a fast-paced, action-packed narrative. While it’s not my usual genre, it’s an enjoyable read, especially with its satisfying portrayal of antagonists and dynamic storytelling. The book has strong potential for adaptation, and I’m curious to see how it would translate to the screen.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

            "The pacing of the book felt uneven; the first half dragged, while the latter half was packed with action and plot developments. This imbalance created a jarring reading experience, but it didn't significantly dampen my overall enjoyment. While the plot is typical of the spy genre—complete with Russian villains and missing treasure—I found it engaging, especially since I haven’t explored much in this genre. Each chapter ended on a cliffhanger, keeping me hooked and eager to see what happened next. The ending also hinted at future developments, which left me excited for what’s to come."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Discovery and Context:**  \n  I came across this book in an unusual way. It wasn’t due for release until January 4th, but I found a lone copy in a Waterstones in Central London on December 17th. There’s been a lot of speculation surrounding the book, particularly about Taylor Swift’s involvement. While I don’t believe Taylor Swift is Elly Conway (since Elly is a fictional character), there are many Taylor Swift-coded clues or \"Easter eggs\" that are hard to ignore. I’m more inclined to think Taylor Swift might be cast as the last character introduced in the book (I’ll leave the name out to avoid spoilers).\n\n- **Plot and Genre:**  \n  The plot is quite stereotypical for the spy genre—featuring Russian bad guys, missing treasure, and all the usual tropes. However, since I haven’t read much in this genre, I found it interesting and engaging. The story kept me hooked, especially with the way each chapter ended, leaving me eager to find out what happens next. The ending also teased another book and a potential film in the series, which has me excited for what’s to come.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was a bit uneven for me. The first half of the book felt slow, while the latter half seemed to cram in a lot of action and developments. This imbalance made the reading experience a little jarring, but it didn’t detract too much from my overall enjoyment.\n\n- **Excitement for Adaptation:**  \n  I’m incredibly excited for the film adaptation and how the book will fit into the blurring of reality and fiction. The story’s potential to translate to the screen, especially with the hinted connections to Taylor Swift, adds an extra layer of intrigue.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved this book! Despite its stereotypical plot and uneven pacing, it kept me engaged and left me eagerly anticipating the next installment in the series, as well as the upcoming film adaptation. The blend of reality and fiction, along with the cleverly placed Easter eggs, made it a unique and enjoyable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This added an educational layer to the reading experience.  \n\n- **Theories and Speculation:**  \n  - I found the theories about the author’s identity (e.g., Taylor Swift) amusing but irrelevant to the story. There’s nothing in the book that hints at such a connection.  \n\n- **Favorite Quotes:**  \n  - “Adulthood sometimes seems like a long procession of tiny betrayals that make you doubt everyone, but if you reframe it as a process of learning how to trust only yourself, it can be surprisingly liberating” (Conway, 249).  \n  - “Back off with that white-straight-male-saviour shit” (Conway, 291).  \n\n- **Movie Adaptation:**  \n  - The movie does not follow the book’s storyline, but it is entertaining and has a Post Credit Scene worth watching.  \n  - It’s amusing how Henry Cavill’s portrayal of Agent Argylle aligns with the BookTok/Bookstagram trend of imagining male characters as Cavill.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book for its engaging narrative, well-developed characters, and educational value.

The only commonality is the presence of a character named Argylle and his flat-top haircut. The book is significantly better than the movie, with a more engaging and detailed narrative.  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The book delves into a complex plot involving the CIA, weapons, Russians, Nazis stealing art, and verified killings. These elements make the story much more compelling and layered compared to the movie.  \n- **Initial Expectations:**  \n  In the first few chapters, I kept expecting someone to whip out a typewriter and begin the tale, which reflects the initial anticipation of a more traditional storytelling approach.  \n- **Personal Preferences:**  \n  While I am a fan of Henry Cavill (who starred in the movie), the book's depth and richness far surpassed my expectations, making it a more enjoyable experience overall.  \n- **Engagement and Interest:**  \n  The book held my interest much more than the movie, which I lost interest in and added to my \"watch later\" pile.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book *Argylle* is a far superior experience compared to its movie adaptation. With its intricate plot, engaging themes, and richer storytelling, it captivated me in ways the movie could not.

My expectations differed from others, and I found both the book and the movie enjoyable.\n\n- **Escapism and Reality:**  \n  I appreciated how the book teetered on the edge of reality, offering an escape from the mundane. I don’t read to relive everyday life; I read to experience something beyond it.\n\n- **Character Engagement:**  \n  I genuinely cared about the characters—Argylle, Keira, and Wyatt. Their stories resonated with me, and I became invested in their fates.\n\n- **Desire for Continuation:**  \n  Despite mixed reviews, I hope the author(s) continue the series. I’m eager to see more of this world and its characters, both in print and on the big screen.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book may have been overhyped, it delivered an engaging and escapist experience that I thoroughly enjoyed. The characters were compelling, and I’m hopeful for more installments in the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

I typically enjoy spy movies, so I’m not sure why I haven’t explored spy novels before. I picked this up because of the movie, but I should note that the book doesn’t follow the events of the movie (which you absolutely must watch!). There are only a few references to Elly, but I still really enjoyed it.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Argylle is a more complicated character than I was expecting. His early adventures, especially the beginnings of his friendships with Wyatt and Keira, were really fun to see. The dynamics between these characters added depth and made the story engaging.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The mission and mystery itself were fascinating and twisty! I liked how the book walked the fine line between being plausible and ensuring everything turned out all right for our characters. The balance between realism and a satisfying resolution was well-executed.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes many deaths, including a beheading, the aftermath of Nazi atrocities, and scenes of torture. Additionally, a character comes out to her parents and receives an upsetting response. These elements are important to note for readers who may be sensitive to such content.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite not being my usual genre, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The complex characters, engaging friendships, and twisty plot kept me hooked. While it doesn’t align with the movie, it stands strong on its own.

This creates a sense of mystery and tension throughout the book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Impact:**  \n  - I found this to be a nice spy thriller that has piqued my interest in the genre.

It was dangerous, intriguing, and romantic, as a love story is always a must.  \n\n- **Plot Elements:**  \n  There were treasures to discover, mysteries to solve, and a race against time, as the enemy was always waiting for the heroes to make a mistake.  \n\n- **Originality and Predictability:**  \n  Some plotlines felt a bit clichéd and overly predictable, but I think it’s easy to overlook this, especially with such exciting events unfolding.  \n\n- **Imagery and Atmosphere:**  \n  I felt incredible when the group of spies uncovered another clue, especially since everything in my imagination looked stunning, shimmering with golden colors and the glow of precious gems. There was a touch of magic in it.  \n\n- **Setting and Visual Appeal:**  \n  The book featured glamorous outfits reminiscent of action movies, the stunning Monaco, and several other extraordinary locations that already look beautiful in our imagination, let alone in reality.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was a thrilling and immersive read, blending action, romance, and mystery with a touch of magic. Despite some predictable elements, the excitement and vivid imagery made it a memorable experience.

The plot of the movie has nothing to do with the book's story. While the movie might have been \"inspired\" by the book, it was poorly executed, despite the star power involved. I even like the director and consider the first *Kingsman* movie a favorite, but this movie's plot was crappy.  \n\n- **Author's Perspective on the Movie Adaptation:**  \n  Given that this is Elly's first book, I don’t think she would mind the movie adaptation, as the PR from the movie likely helped people discover and read her book. Most of us would have never heard of it otherwise.  \n\n- **Engagement and Plot Quality:**  \n  The book itself is a solid spy novel. The plot and story kept me engaged, and I was eager to see how things would end. It’s much, much better than the movie.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend the book over the movie in this case.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book is a well-crafted spy novel with an engaging plot, far superior to its poorly executed movie adaptation. While the movie helped bring attention to the book, the book itself is the real standout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Despite this, the book is still considered \"a very good read.\"  \n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**  \n  - The review highlights a quote from the book that emphasizes the complexity of human identity: “You think you know about a person because you’ve gleaned a bunch of facts about where they came from or who their family is, but the tissue of a person is made up of so much more than that, all the tiny fibers of our lives, that weave themselves into a pattern that is unique. People are complicated.” This suggests that the novel delves deeply into character development and explores the intricacies of human nature.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Wit:**  \n  - The review includes a witty and memorable line from the book: “Hasn’t anyone ever told you, Argylle, sometimes being yourself is overrated? I mean, why would I be myself when I could be Halle Berry or Ruth Bader Ginsburg?” This indicates that the novel features sharp, engaging dialogue that adds to its appeal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a compelling spy thriller with well-developed characters and witty dialogue. While the reader found the connection between the book and its movie adaptation confusing, they still thoroughly enjoyed the book and appreciated its depth and humor.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

This unique concept intrigued me, especially since I haven’t seen the movie *Argylle* yet but now plan to after reading the book.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book is a really fun read, and I found myself constantly eager to see what would happen next. The pacing kept me hooked throughout.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Presentation:**  \n  The narrative is very cinematic, which makes sense given that one of the authors is a screenplay writer. The way the story is presented feels like watching a movie unfold on the page.  \n\n- **Standalone Appeal:**  \n  Even if you have no interest in seeing the movie, I’d still recommend this book. It stands on its own as a fun spy novel about a new CIA recruit evolving into a fully-fledged spy.  \n\n- **Connection to the Movie:**  \n  While the book shares some characters and the fictional author with the movie, it has nothing to do with the movie’s plot. This makes it accessible to readers who haven’t seen the film.  \n\n- **Desire for More:**  \n  I enjoyed the book so much that I hope it becomes the start of a series. I’d love to see more stories in this universe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a highly engaging and cinematic spy novel with a unique premise tied to a fictional author and characters from a movie. It’s a fun, standalone read that left me wanting more, and I highly recommend it even if you’re not planning to watch the movie.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the trailer seems to be quite different from the book. Despite this, I still plan to watch the movie when it’s released.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The book is a good action/adventure novel with a strong emphasis on history. It incorporates elements like mystery, problem-solving, CIA operations, and the classic battle of good versus evil, which I found engaging and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Pacing and Detail:**  \n  The book is very detailed, which sometimes made the pacing feel slow. I had to be in the right mindset to fully concentrate on the story. However, the depth of detail also added richness to the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the slower moments, I found the book to be a fun and intriguing read. The combination of history, mystery, and action kept me invested throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s detailed nature occasionally slowed the pace, it was a captivating and enjoyable read overall. The blend of history, mystery, and action made it a worthwhile experience, even if it differed from the movie trailer.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The mix of history and spy thriller, combined with strong character development and the potential for a series, made it a captivating read. I’m excited to see where the story could go next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The novel’s release was closely tied to the film, which added to the intrigue.  \n\n- **Relationship Between Book and Film:**  \n  I recommend reading the novel before seeing the film, but not for the typical reason of “the book is better than the movie.” Instead, this book serves as the origin story for Argylle, while the film, based on the trailer, takes place after book four. This means there are still gaps to fill even after reading the book.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Genre Comparison:**  \n  The novel was an enjoyable read, blending elements of James Bond, Mission Impossible, and Indiana Jones. It felt like a fun, action-packed adventure.  \n\n- **Reception of the Film:**  \n  I was disappointed by the dismal reviews of the film, as I had been looking forward to it. However, after finishing the book, I recommended it to my 88-year-old grandmother, who also enjoyed it. We saw the movie together and loved it, though I advise adjusting expectations if you’re expecting something serious or art-house.  \n\n- **Franchise Potential:**  \n  In an era of cinematic universes and media tie-ins, Argylle stands out with its novel as part of its universe. I hope the book series and franchise continue to grow.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nArgylle is a fun, action-packed novel that serves as the origin story for its universe.

It kept me hooked throughout, though it wasn’t entirely what I expected based on the movie trailer.  \n- **Pacing and Action:**  \n  The book felt like an action movie in novel form. The drama was captivating, and the action scenes were vivid and palpable.  \n- **Depth and Substance:**  \n  While the novel was entertaining, it lacked the depth and substance I had hoped for. The focus on action and drama came at the expense of more meaningful exploration or character development.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was a thrilling and engaging read, delivering on action and drama but falling short in terms of depth and substance. It’s a great choice for readers seeking an adrenaline-packed story, though those looking for more nuanced storytelling might find it lacking.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This espionage story follows a Russian man raised in the U.S. as he embarks on a presidential campaign in Russia. He promises to reunify the former Soviet Union by annexing former territories and is determined to locate the lost Amber Room from World War II. Meanwhile, the CIA, including the character Argylle, works to thwart his ambitions.

This motivated me to pick it up and start reading.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story revolves around espionage, featuring a Russian man raised in the U.S. who runs for president of Russia. His campaign promises include reunifying the former Soviet Union by annexing countries that are no longer part of it. He also vows to find the famous Amber Room, which was lost during World War II. The CIA, including the character Argylle, tries to stop him.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  In my opinion, the book felt too long, with many chapters that seemed like filler. While it’s not a bad read and is relatively easy to follow, the chapters could have been condensed to make the story more engaging.  \n\n- **Comparison to the Movie:**  \n  The book has no connection to the movie, as stated on the promotional band: “This is not the book the movie is based on, but it is the book that appears in the movie.” That said, I enjoyed the movie much more than the book.  \n\n- **Author Speculation and Recommendation:**  \n  I have no idea if Taylor Swift or Elly Conway wrote this book, but I would recommend it to fans of spy stories filled with action and plot twists.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has an interesting premise and is an easy read, its pacing and length could have been improved. The movie adaptation, though unrelated, was more enjoyable. Despite these flaws, it’s a decent choice for fans of action-packed spy thrillers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

I found it impossible to believe in them due to the excessive contradictions and absurdities in their portrayal. The attempt to show their emotional depth comes across as superficial. Additionally, I couldn’t connect the book’s Argylle with the film’s version, despite trying. For me, Henry Cavill was perfect in the film role, and I couldn’t see him in the book’s portrayal of the character.\n\n- **Marketing and Hype:**  \n  I gave the book three stars not so much for the novel itself but for the effective media promotion that initially drew me in.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book fell short of my expectations, particularly in terms of character development, emotional depth, and its connection to the film. While the marketing was strong, the execution of the story and characters left much to be desired.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars."

The story includes heists, double agents, torture, Russian politicians, Nazis, and a race to find the missing \"Eighth Wonder of the World,\" the Amber Room (which actually did exist in real life).\n  - The buildup of the story is stronger than the conclusion, which left me feeling that the original Spy Kids film might be better in terms of narrative satisfaction.\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**\n  - I appreciated the inclusion of a woman as the head of the CIA team, referred to as a \"legendary spymaster.\" Her character provides commentary on being underestimated by others familiar with the CIA, such as people incorrectly assuming she is married to an agent.\n  - The novel offers interesting depictions of women in terms of power, position, and how they utilize available resources, making it a potential topic for book club discussions.\n\n- **Potential for Adaptation:**\n  - I get the feeling that this book was written with the hope of it becoming a film, which it evidently has. The narrative structure and elements seem tailored for a cinematic experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the novel presents a unique and complex main character, an engaging plot with a strong buildup, and thoughtful representation of women in powerful roles. However, the conclusion falls short compared to the buildup, and the narrative feels tailored for a film adaptation. Despite this, it offers rich material for discussion, particularly around its themes and character dynamics.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

A little more strategic thinking could have led to a much better outcome.  \n\n- **Marketing and Hype:**  \n  The book was NOT worth the hype. I also believe the rumor that Taylor Swift wrote it was clearly a marketing ploy, which felt unnecessary and misleading.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had moments of excitement and a promising concept, it struggled with pacing, inconsistent scene transitions, and underwhelming action sequences. The writing and editing could have been stronger, and the marketing hype felt overblown. Despite its potential, the book didn’t fully deliver.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5⭐️ (rounded up)"

This choice of perspective made it harder for me to connect with the story.  \n\n- **Authorship and Background:**  \n  The book is revealed to be ghostwritten by Tammy Cohen and Terry Hayes. I haven’t read any of their works before, and based on this book, I doubt I will. It was intended as a companion novel to the movie of the same name. The author’s name, Elly Conway, is actually the name of the character in the movie who is an author and discovers that her writing mirrors real-life events. I haven’t watched the movie yet, but I hear it has little to do with this novel except for the fact that it’s supposed to be a book written by the character Elly Conway.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I just couldn’t get into this book. While parts of it were interesting, a lot of it failed to hold my attention. It almost felt like two different people wrote it—the cinematic-type action scenes were entertaining, but the rest of the story fell flat. Additionally, the book is quite long, and even listening at 2x speed, it felt like it dragged on.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book didn’t resonate with me.

However, I was unaware of the movie tie-in, which might have influenced my expectations. I initially liked the idea of a novice female author writing a spy story, but I later found out it was co-written by a male/female team of experienced authors, which changed my perspective.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The plot was mildly interesting but overly convoluted. There were way too many characters, which made it hard to keep track of everything. The story felt unnecessarily complicated, and I guessed the twist about the mole early on, which took away some of the suspense.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I didn’t like the main character, Argyle, at all. He was portrayed as too perfect, which made him unbelievable. Despite having no training or job experience, he was inexplicably good at his job. The authors seemed overly fond of him, constantly emphasizing his fluency in numerous languages and his vast knowledge of random historical facts. This made him come across as an aloof know-it-all, which I found off-putting.  \n\n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  If you enjoy action-packed stories about highly skilled, aloof spies, you might find this book enjoyable. There’s plenty of action, but for me, the lack of relatability in the main character and the overly complex plot made it hard to fully engage with the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was just okay.

Her pronunciation was distracting, as if she was guessing how to say words as she went along.\n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  I spent the first half of the book expecting a major plot twist about the main character that never happened.

If the film captures these settings effectively, it could be visually interesting and engaging to watch.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was underwhelming.

Knowing that the book was written by two non-American authors made the lack of authenticity in the American context more noticeable and jarring.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story was enjoyable and the characters were likable, the poor writing style, inconsistent language use, and numerous typos significantly detracted from the experience. The lack of authenticity in the American context also made the book feel disjointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

I should remember that going forward.\n\n- **Narration Quality:**  \n  The female narrator mispronounced \"Semper Fi\" as \"Semper Fee\" multiple times, which was jarring. In today’s world, especially in a genre like this, it’s surprising that someone wouldn’t know how to pronounce such a well-known phrase. If this were a fairytale romance, it might be more forgivable, but in a spy novel, it felt out of place.\n\n- **Genre Consistency:**  \n  The book is supposed to be about spies, but it didn’t deliver on that premise. The missteps in narration and the overall execution made it feel like it fell short of its intended genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book didn’t meet my expectations. The poor narration and lack of genre consistency left me feeling underwhelmed. It had potential, but the execution fell flat.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 Stars"

He makes a fateful decision to save DEA/CIA agents from a downed aircraft, which leads to his recruitment by the CIA. The team, described as \"mis-matched toys,\" embarks on a mission to stop a power-hungry Russian villain seeking the Amber Room. The plot includes a mole within the team, which I figured out early on, though the mole plays a significant role later in the story. Overall, the story was okay but not great.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  None of the characters stood out as particularly compelling or memorable. They felt underdeveloped and lacked depth, which made it hard to connect with them.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was decent but nothing exceptional. It served its purpose but didn’t elevate the story or make it particularly engaging.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  The torture scenes were excessive and detracted from the overall quality of the book. They felt over-the-top and unnecessary, weakening the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The book is a light, beach-read type of novel. While it had its moments, it didn’t leave a strong impression. Three stars feels like a generous rating for this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis espionage novel has an okay plot with some predictable elements, underdeveloped characters, and writing that doesn’t stand out.

It doesn’t particularly elevate or innovate within the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel provides an interesting comparison to its movie adaptation, it falls short in capturing the playful and self-aware tone of the film. As a spy thriller, it remains fairly conventional and doesn’t stand out significantly within the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Target Audience and Tone:**  \n  The novel is not marketed as a Young Adult (YA) book, but it strongly feels like one. The protagonist embodies a teenage girl's idealized version of a perfect hero—young, gorgeous, kind, philosophical, and damaged, yet a genius who speaks all languages and excels as the CIA's best operative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character comes across as overly perfect and unrealistic. His combination of traits—genius-level intelligence, linguistic mastery, and emotional depth—feels exaggerated and tailored to fit an idealized fantasy rather than a believable, nuanced individual.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The detailed, step-by-step descriptions of every mission became tedious and excessive. It seemed as though the author included every researched detail, which slowed the pacing and made the narrative feel bloated.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  The identity of the \"unknown\" spy was highly predictable, reducing the suspense and impact of the plot twist.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has elements that might appeal to a YA audience, its overly idealized protagonist, excessive detail, and predictable plot make it less engaging for readers seeking depth and realism.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I was misled—it turned out to be a mediocre spy novel, nothing terrible, but definitely not what was promised.\n\n- **Quality of the Novel:**  \n  The novel is of average quality, neither outstanding nor terrible. It lacks the humor and parody I anticipated, settling instead into a conventional spy genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book did not meet my expectations, as it failed to deliver the lighthearted and entertaining experience I was led to believe it would. While it is not a bad read, it is far from what I hoped for based on its marketing and associations.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It only became slightly more interesting in the last 30 minutes.\n- **Plot Clarity:** I was confused about what the main plot was throughout most of the book. The lack of a clear, driving narrative made it hard to follow and enjoy.\n- **Engagement:** The story failed to hold my interest until the very end, which was disappointing. I found myself hoping the movie adaptation would be better.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the book was a slow and confusing read that only became mildly engaging in its final moments. I struggled to connect with the story and am left wishing for a more compelling adaptation in the movie.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3/5"

The scenes involving clues and puzzles were particularly fun. However, the story didn’t leave a lasting impression on me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While I appreciated the multiple points of view, there were too many characters and too much going on to really dig into some of them. Argylle, in particular, felt one-dimensional. He gets recruited to the CIA out of nowhere and immediately becomes a top-notch spy who is a bit too perfect and never makes mistakes.  \n\n- **Comparison to the Movie Adaptation:**  \n  The movie claimed to be based on the novel, but the only similarities were the names and the spy theme. The plot was entirely new, which left me confused as to why they didn’t just create their own movie instead of loosely connecting it to a relatively unknown novel released mere weeks prior. As a huge Kingsman fan, I found the action and humor in this film similar but inferior. Some elements were over the top and quickly turned lame. That said, the cast was fantastic, and I wish the movie had been its own standalone project so I could have approached it without any expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel was an enjoyable but forgettable read with fun missions and puzzles, though it suffered from underdeveloped characters and an overly perfect protagonist.

Forgettable in others.\"  \n  - \"There were a couple of hilarious moments.\"  \n  - \"Life lessons to be learnt as well!\"  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - \"It was a decent read but not for everyone.\"  \n  - \"I do recommend you give it a go, though.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nElly Conway's *Argylle* is a spy novel with a mix of memorable and forgettable moments. While the plot and character development are engaging, the heavy use of CIA/military jargon and some confusing action scenes may not appeal to everyone. The book improves as it progresses, offering humor and life lessons along the way. It’s a decent read, particularly for fans of the genre, but may not resonate with all readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars ⭐️"

However, I didn’t feel particularly connected to them or their journey.\n\n- **Overall Appeal:**  \n  While the book didn’t resonate with me, it might be fantastic for others. I encourage interested readers to give it a try. There’s also a movie based on the book, which I might watch to see if it captures the story better.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had potential with its thrilling plot and high-stakes scenario, but it fell short of my expectations. It might appeal to others, so I’d recommend giving it a chance if the premise intrigues you.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️ (2/5)"

If it’s good enough for Netflix to pick it up, it’s probably worth reading the original!  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book has intriguing elements throughout, but it took a few chapters for me to fully absorb myself in the story. I think watching the film first might have helped with my engagement, but it was still an interesting read with a compelling plot.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I just wished I liked the characters more. I feel like I might have connected with them better if I’d watched the film first. Argylle is a typical gruffly likeable character, so it was easy to follow him, but I didn’t feel deeply attached to the cast.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The audiobook, narrated by Dakota Blue Richards, was an easy listen, and she did a great job. However, I struggled with engagement at times. It made for a good companion to the gym, though.  \n\n- **Pacing and Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The story ebbed and flowed in its pace, but once I got into it, I wasn’t going to DNF (did not finish). It was a good spy drama thriller overall, and I might watch the film and then revisit the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a compelling plot and intriguing elements, it took some time to fully engage me.

The marketing strategy, including the Taylor Swift connections, adds to the confusion rather than enhancing the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores mentioned in the review."

It seems like the book was written specifically to serve as a prop for a film, as it feels very generic.  \n\n- **Character Development (Argylle):**  \n  Argylle is a standard hero with an unwavering moral compass. He’s perfect in every way and emotionally detached, much like a Superman-type hero.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  The story itself doesn’t stand out. It’s forgettable, but it’s easy to get through. If someone is looking for something simple that reads like a Sylvester Stallone movie, this might fit the bill.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book feels like it was created to support a film rather than stand on its own. While the protagonist, Argylle, fits the mold of a classic, flawless hero, the story lacks depth and originality. However, it’s an easy read for those seeking something straightforward and action-packed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It felt predictable and lacked the depth or intrigue I was hoping for.\n- **Characters:** The characters didn’t stand out or leave a lasting impression. They felt underdeveloped and failed to engage me emotionally or intellectually.\n- **Author’s Reputation vs. Content:** The hype surrounding the author was more interesting than the book itself. I found myself more intrigued by the author’s background and reputation than by the actual story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the novel fell short of my expectations. While it adhered to the conventions of a spy novel, it lacked the compelling plot and memorable characters needed to make it stand out. The author’s reputation overshadowed the book’s content, which was disappointing.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The timing, coinciding with the uneventful start of 2024, added to my curiosity.  \n\n- **Readability and Pacing:**  \n  The book is readable and fun at times. It’s well-paced, which kept me engaged, and the cover design is visually appealing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are incredibly shallow. I found myself constantly confusing them, as they lacked depth and distinct personalities.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing feels unpolished, as if it was missing an editor. It’s badly written to the point of being hilariously noticeable.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The plot is inconsequential and lacks weight. The political intrigue, which could have been compelling, is resolved abruptly by a random act of violence, making the story feel unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  While Ian Fleming was a far superior writer, the novel does bear some resemblance to his works. Argylle, the protagonist, feels like an unkempt James Bond who, much like in *Casino Royale*, doesn’t accomplish much and often gets in the way.  \n\n- **Authenticity and Writing Style:**  \n  The novel reads as if it were ghostwritten. The writing style feels more suited to a romance novel than a spy story, which detracts from the intended tone and genre.  \n\n- **Overall Impression and Marketing:**  \n  The book feels rushed and underdeveloped, as if it needed more time to refine.

The absence of clear dialogue tags (e.g., “Character name says”) forced me to backtrack frequently to identify who was speaking.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story initially drew me in, but the non-stop action overshadowed any meaningful character development. The frequent POV changes within scenes, while possibly intentional, felt jarring and disrupted the flow.  \n\n- **Editing and Quality:**  \n  The book contained numerous spelling errors, some of which were glaring (e.g., “plac” instead of “place”). These mistakes should have been caught during the editing process, even with basic word processor checks.  \n\n- **Originality and Impact:**  \n  Despite claims by Matthew Vaughn that this could be the next great spy series, the story didn’t offer anything unique or special. The twist was predictable and failed to deliver a shocking or memorable moment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an engaging start, its lack of character development, poor editing, and unoriginal plot ultimately made it a disappointing read. The initial intrigue was enough to bump it up to 2 stars, but it fell short of delivering a compelling or unique spy narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The plot twists in the novel are very obvious, which detracts from the suspense and intrigue typically expected in a spy novel.  \n\n- **Character Development and Focus:**  \n  The main characters spend an excessive amount of time and resources on absurd and ridiculous situations, which feels like a misuse of the narrative space and detracts from the story's depth.  \n\n- **Authenticity and Authorial Voice:**  \n  The novel does not seem to have been written by Elly Conway or Taylor Swift, as speculated. Instead, the author appears to be British, evidenced by the use of British spellings (e.g., \"colour\" and \"manoeuvre\") and Britishisms in the dialogue of American characters. This inconsistency in voice and authenticity is jarring.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel fails to deliver as a compelling spy story due to its predictable plot, poorly focused character development, and lack of authenticity in its authorial voice. The Britishisms in the dialogue of American characters further highlight the inconsistencies in the writing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The hype surrounding the book didn’t quite match my experience, but I’m intrigued to see how the movie interprets the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The lack of clarity in the storytelling left me confused and disengaged.\n\n- **Plot and Story Quality:**  \n  The story itself was lackluster and disappointing. It failed to capture my interest or provide the thrilling espionage experience I was hoping for. The plot felt underwhelming and did not live up to the hype surrounding the book.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I cannot recommend this book, especially when there are far better-written espionage novels by authors like John le Carré, Tom Clancy, or Ian Fleming. These authors deliver more compelling and well-crafted stories in the same genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Argylle* was a disappointing read that did not meet my expectations. The confusing narrative style and unengaging plot made it difficult to enjoy, and I would advise readers to explore other, more well-written espionage novels instead.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The “Taylor Swift” theory added intrigue, but I dismissed it before reading. Unfortunately, the execution didn’t live up to the concept’s potential.  \n\n- **Impact on Movie Experience:**  \n  I’m curious if reading this book will enhance the movie-watching experience. Maybe that’s how it’s meant to be taken, but as of now, I hope to never return to this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a disappointment.

The lack of engagement and the unappealing writing style made it hard to continue.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book’s clinical and detached writing style, combined with its lack of originality and engagement, made it unappealing to me. I found the movie’s concept more interesting, and the book failed to deliver a compelling experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned, but the reader’s dissatisfaction is evident."

            "The book introduces two key female characters within the first 60 pages. The first is a Thai woman who is initially misjudged by a male character but later emerges as fiercely protective of her son. While this trait is commendable, her characterization lacks depth. The second woman, Coffey, is depicted with mousy brown tones and tortoiseshell imagery, but her primary defining trait is her struggle with a smoking addiction—essentially the only detail provided about her. Both women are reduced to singular, superficial traits early in the narrative, and their characters do not evolve beyond that. This lack of complexity is disappointing. Furthermore, the additional characters in the book suffer from similar underdevelopment, appearing more like two-dimensional sketches rather than fully realized individuals, which hinders the reader's ability to connect with or care about them.",

The narrative felt flat and overly simplistic, with a repetitive structure of \"he did this, then he did that.\"\n\n- **Authenticity and Purpose:**  \n  I agree with the sentiment that this book feels more like a movie prop than a genuine literary work. It raises the question: if it’s a real book, why was it chosen to be adapted into a movie? The connection between the book and the movie feels forced and commercially driven.\n\n- **Movie Adaptation:**  \n  The movie adaptation of this book is also disappointing. It didn’t resonate with me, and I found it to be lackluster. However, Henry Cavill’s performance was the only redeeming aspect. The director, Matthew Vaughn, who also owns the rights to the Kingsmen franchise, seems to be aiming to create another spy movie series, which explains the commercial approach.\n\n- **Confusion Around the Book Series:**  \n  There’s significant confusion about the book series itself. The movie is reportedly based on an unpublished fourth book, which raises questions about the existence and timeline of the series. Only one book has been published so far, and the movie franchise plans to adapt the first book with *Argylle 2*, while more books are supposedly in the works. This lack of clarity adds to the skepticism about the book’s authenticity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book failed to capture my interest, and its connection to the movie adaptation feels more like a marketing ploy than a genuine literary effort.

The lack of detail, poor character development, and underdeveloped plot made it difficult to enjoy. While I had high hopes due to its intriguing backstory and genre, the execution fell flat.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Initially, I thought my lack of engagement was due to being in a reading rut, so I switched to the audiobook format to see if that would help. Unfortunately, it didn’t improve my experience. Instead, it only amplified the frustration I felt while reading.\n\n- **Author Attribution and Respect:**  \n  If you believe Taylor wrote this book after reading it, I feel sorry for you. The quality and style of the writing do not align with what I would expect from her, and I think it’s important to give her the respect she deserves by acknowledging that this work doesn’t reflect her usual caliber.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a deeply frustrating experience for me, both in written and audiobook formats. It failed to engage me, and I strongly doubt its attribution to Taylor. Overall, it was a disappointing read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nIf I could have given this book zero stars, I would have."

The writing did not meet my expectations, which led me to attempt the audiobook as a second chance.\n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  I would not recommend this book to others. Instead, I suggest reading works by Agatha Christie, which I believe are far superior in quality and storytelling.\n\n- **Publishing and Adaptation:**  \n  I am puzzled by how this book secured a movie deal before it was even published. This decision seems questionable given the book's lack of quality.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book failed to meet my expectations in both written and audiobook formats. The poor quality of the audiobook further diminished my experience, and I found the writing to be subpar. I do not recommend this book and believe readers would be better off exploring Agatha Christie's works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
