I initially struggled to connect with Eloise and Kiel or understand their setting. It wasn‚Äôt until Eloise mentioned the brothers from the previous book that things began to click.

Their connection felt magical, and I appreciated how Kiel truly understood Eloise‚Äôs passion for painting, her process, and the time it required.

The significance of her paintings and the emotions tied to them added depth to the story. The reveal of her work at the show was a highlight, as it allowed everyone, including Eloise, to see the impact of her creations.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending was heartwarming and satisfying.
