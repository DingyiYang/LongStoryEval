            "This romance was irresistibly sweet and charming, leaving me giggling and kicking my feet as I read. It was a heartwarming love story that I thoroughly enjoyed. Initially, Stella came across as somewhat annoying, projecting an air of superiority. However, her character evolved throughout the book, which made her much more relatable. I absolutely adored Reece—his kindness and passion for reading made every scene he was in a highlight. Aurora was an absolute sweetheart, and her friendship with Stella was one of my favorite elements of the story. Phillip added a delightful touch with his goofy, playful nature. I loved his friendship with Reece and his enchanting relationship with Aurora; their love story completely captivated me.",
            "I absolutely loved the setting. Set in the world of *Sleeping Beauty*, it brought back fond memories from my childhood when I watched the movie countless times. Revisiting that enchanting realm was a true delight."

        "conclusion": "This book was a cute, nostalgic, and heartwarming read. While it didn’t quite reach 5-star status for me, I thoroughly enjoyed the setting, romance, and most of the characters. It’s a delightful story that I’d happily recommend.",

            "Rose (Aurora) is incredibly sweet and instantly likable, making me wish she were my friend. The book excels at humanizing the characters from Sleeping Beauty far more than the movie does, offering readers a deeper understanding of their personalities. Prince Phillip also shines in this retelling, providing plenty of laughs along the way.",
            "This book is incredibly clever, witty, and genuinely funny, filled with one-liners that had me laughing out loud. Prince Phillip stands out as one of the funniest characters I've encountered in a long time, while Merryweather delivers hysterical lines that add to the humor. The book is often hailed as one of the funniest ever written, showcasing expertly executed wit. As a lifelong Disney Princess fan, especially of Aurora, I admit my bias, but the humor and execution make it enjoyable even for those without that background. I typically only write reviews through Netgalley, so my choice to share a non-ARC review reflects my high level of enjoyment."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This review highlights the book’s exceptional humor, witty one-liners, and strong character development, particularly for Rose (Aurora) and Prince Phillip. I believe it surpasses the movie in depth and likability, making it a must-read for Sleeping Beauty fans. They express a strong desire for Disney to expand this into a series, with Snow White as the next focus.",

The book is commended for humanizing the Sleeping Beauty characters more than the movie, allowing readers to \"learn far more about a character through a book.\" Prince Phillip’s personality is also highlighted as a standout, making the reviewer laugh throughout.  \n\n- **Appeal to Fans:**  \n  The reviewer believes that \"any fan of Sleeping Beauty would love this book as much as I did.\" They acknowledge their personal bias as a Disney Princess and Sleeping Beauty fan but argue that the book’s quality stands on its own. They also express a desire for Disney to create more books like this, suggesting a series and specifically requesting a Snow White installment.  \n\n- **Comparison to the Movie:**  \n  The book is praised for going \"more in depth than movies,\" providing a richer understanding of the characters. The reviewer feels that Rose/Aurora’s sweetness and likability are even more pronounced in the book than in her movie portrayal.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Bias:**  \n  The reviewer admits their bias as a lifelong Disney Princess fan, particularly of Aurora, but emphasizes that the book’s humor and execution make it enjoyable even without that bias. They note that they rarely write reviews unless through Netgalley, so their decision to write a non-ARC review speaks to their high level of enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis review highlights the book’s exceptional humor, witty one-liners, and strong character development, particularly for Rose (Aurora) and Prince Phillip.

However, the execution of this concept felt lacking.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is uneven, with repetitive sections that dragged in places, leading me to skim through parts of the book.

The lack of a strong connection between the characters made them feel flat. Additionally, since the story is told solely from Stella's perspective, the supporting characters felt one-dimensional.  \n\n- **Target Audience Appeal:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I believe this book will resonate with teen readers. The combination of a magical trip to Disneyland before prom and a storybook adventure is likely to captivate them. The enduring popularity of *Sleeping Beauty* and Maleficent also adds to its appeal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Promchanted* has a clever premise and strong potential to appeal to its target audience, its execution falls short due to uneven pacing, predictable plotlines, and underdeveloped characters.

            "The plot is riddled with contradictions and inconsistencies, as characters often reverse their decisions and actions without explanation. The premise of entering the Disney cartoon version of *Sleeping Beauty* is poorly executed, with unclear and contradictory rules regarding the world’s time-space continuum and historical accuracy. Major plot holes, like Stella's inability to recall details of *Sleeping Beauty* despite her love for Disney, undermine the story's credibility. The resolution, involving Reece's decision to stay in the cartoon world and then return, feels contrived and illogical. \n\nThe first part of the book is slow, burdened by unnecessary details such as Stella's spreadsheets and prom decorations. Even after entering the cartoon world, the story struggles to maintain momentum, featuring repetitive and nonsensical events. The pacing suffers further from a lack of a clear through line or meaningful progression.",

Although Stella is portrayed as detail-oriented and logical, her actions and memory lapses contradict this characterization. Reece, Phillip, and Rose are similarly underdeveloped, and their interactions feel forced and unrealistic. Additionally, Maleficent, a compelling figure in the original story, is severely underutilized in this book.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters, especially Stella, are unlikeable and two-dimensional. They act inconsistently, changing their behavior and decisions without logical progression.  \n   - Stella is portrayed as detail-oriented and logical, yet her actions and memory lapses contradict this trait.  \n   - Reece, Phillip, and Rose are underdeveloped and lack depth. Their interactions and dialogue feel forced and unrealistic.  \n   - Maleficent, a compelling character in the original story, is severely underutilized in this book.  \n\n- **Plot Coherence and Logic:**  \n   - The plot is riddled with contradictions and inconsistencies. Characters frequently reverse their decisions or actions without explanation.  \n   - The premise of entering the Disney cartoon version of *Sleeping Beauty* is poorly executed. The rules of the world (e.g., time-space continuum, historical accuracy) are unclear and contradictory.  \n   - Major plot holes, such as Stella’s inability to remember details of *Sleeping Beauty* despite her love for Disney, undermine the story’s credibility.  \n   - The resolution, involving Reece staying in the cartoon world and then returning, feels contrived and illogical.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The first part of the book is slow and bogged down by unnecessary details, such as Stella’s spreadsheets and prom decorations.  \n   - The story fails to maintain momentum even after the characters enter the cartoon world, with repetitive and nonsensical events.  \n   - The pacing is further disrupted by the lack of a clear through line or meaningful progression.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n   - The setting alternates between Disneyland and the cartoon version of *Sleeping Beauty*, but the transitions are poorly explained.  \n   - The cartoon world’s rules are inconsistent, with characters behaving as if they are in medieval Europe while also using modern slang and concepts.  \n   - The lack of emphasis on the fact that they are in a fictional cartoon world creates confusion and detracts from the story’s potential.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Tone:**  \n   - The dialogue feels unnatural, especially when characters use modern slang in a supposedly medieval setting.  \n   - The tone is inconsistent, veering between serious and whimsical without clear justification.  \n\n- **Premise vs. Execution:**  \n   - The premise of blending a modern Disneyland setting with the *Sleeping Beauty* cartoon is intriguing but poorly executed.  \n   - The story fails to capitalize on its potential, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a promising premise but was ultimately disappointing due to its inconsistent characters, illogical plot, and poor execution. The story is riddled with plot holes, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of coherence. While the idea of merging Disneyland with *Sleeping Beauty* was creative, the execution fell flat, making it difficult to enjoy or recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot: 2/10  \n- Characters: 3/10  \n- World-Building: 4/10  \n- Pacing: 3/10  \n- Overall: 2.5/10"

            "The novel skillfully intertwines reality with a fairy tale, presenting an engaging premise. However, at nearly 400 pages, some sections—such as the poker game, dance lessons, chicken side quest, and Maleficent's storyline—seem unnecessary and could benefit from trimming to streamline the narrative. While the ending is surprising, it feels less believable than anticipated, and some loose ends, like Delilah's fate, remain unresolved. Although the pacing is generally good, the book's length causes certain parts to feel drawn out. Nonetheless, the author effectively adds depth to the fairy tale characters, enriching the overall experience without overshadowing the Disney version.",
            "Stella is a relatable and believable character, though her shift from being overly controlling to embracing the moment feels abrupt. Reece, while likable, comes across as underdeveloped and more of a supporting character. I would have appreciated more scenes from his perspective, particularly regarding the castle, library, and map room. Phil and Rose add depth to the story, with Phil being a particularly pleasant surprise.",
            "While categorized as a teen novel, this book reads more like a high school fantasy romance. It is clean and appropriate for preteens, featuring only mild elements such as a kiss and a battle scene that may be of concern to younger readers.",
            "The novel provides a refreshing and enjoyable twist on a classic fairy tale. Despite its length, it remains a satisfying and successful retelling."

While the book could have been more concise, it remains an enjoyable and creative story with relatable characters and a unique twist.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author and Book Choice:**  \n   - This is my first book by this author, but I’ve wanted to read her for a while. This was the perfect one to start with.  \n\n- **Setting and Fairy Tale Connection:**  \n   - I’ve only been to Disneyworld, never Disneyland, so I didn’t realize it was not Cinderella’s castle at both parks. Sleeping Beauty was one of my favorites, maybe even more so than Cinderella. It was fun to have this story where the characters ended up being dropped into the world of that fairy tale.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - Stella and Reece first get a weird glimpse in the castle of the scene at the beginning of the movie when Maleficent shows up and curses Princess Aurora. They assume it was some kind of immersive experience with actors. Later, when Reece can’t find his phone and they return, they end up in the fairy tale a week ahead of the big events when the prince meets Aurora.  \n   - They realize they have to ensure the story goes as it should, especially since Prince Philip (or Phil, as he’s going by) has already met Aurora. Reece convinces him to keep it a secret, which aligns with Phil’s own wishes.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Stella stays in the tree home with the three fairy godmothers (who Aurora thinks are her aunts), while Reece stays with the prince. They meet up daily, keeping their interactions secret from the fairies, and gradually get to know each other.  \n   - Stella’s pessimistic view of romance, stemming from her recent breakup, is something she must overcome to help keep the story on track. Reece, who knows the story well due to his younger sister’s love for the movie, has his own family issues to contend with.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n   - The book is a sweet romance, rom-com, and fairy tale all rolled into one.  \n\n- **Overall Impression and Recommendation:**  \n   - This was my first book by this author, and now I know I need to read more!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful blend of romance, comedy, and fairy tale magic. The unique premise of being transported into the world of Sleeping Beauty, combined with the characters’ personal growth and budding relationship, made for an engaging and heartwarming read. It has definitely encouraged me to explore more works by this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I hoped the Disney Parks aspect would make me fall in love, especially as a self-confessed Disney adult. However, it did not.\n\n- **Disney Representation:**  \n  The Disney aspect actually had me rolling my eyes. I questioned whether the author is genuinely a fan or if she was just given a list of places in Disneyland to mention in the book. As a Disney nerd, this was disappointing.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character (MC) was irritatingly controlling and seemed to live on another planet, given her zero knowledge of Sleeping Beauty. I understand it was a plot device to keep the reader in the dark, but it felt forced, especially since we all know how the story of Sleeping Beauty plays out.\n\n- **Plot and Teen Drama:**  \n  It was hard to get past the eye-rolling teen drama.

            "The reveal that Stella and Reece were always integral to the *Sleeping Beauty* story feels forced and unsatisfying, reminiscent of a *Lost*-style \"whatever happened, happened\" approach. It’s unconvincing that their actions could align with the original film’s events, especially given the significant changes they introduced. Furthermore, attributing the fairies' actions in the final battle against Maleficent to Stella and Reece undermines the original characters’ agency.",
            "The portrayal of characters in *Sleeping Beauty*, such as Aurora, Phillip, Flora, Fauna, Merryweather, and Maleficent, is inconsistent with their established personalities from the 1959 film. For instance, Aurora, who is cautious around strangers, suddenly engages in intimate conversations with the main characters, which feels out of character. Additionally, Stella, the narrator, demonstrates confusing inconsistency. While she's portrayed as needing control and planning, she neglects to educate herself on the *Sleeping Beauty* plot, which undermines her credibility as a Type A personality. Her use of modern items—like candy bars and Doritos—and phrases such as \"guac your world\" feels jarring and disrupts the narrative. Reece, her companion, also presents issues; his reluctance to share crucial plot details with Stella, despite her insistence, comes off as contrived and illogical.",
            "Stella's anger towards fairytales and the concept of true love feels exaggerated, particularly given her pragmatic nature. Her outrage at Disneyland and the Disney brand for perpetuating this illusion comes off as unrealistic and excessive. The theme of reassessing childhood fantasies fails to resonate, as Stella's character lacks the emotional depth and backstory needed to make this conflict believable.",
            "The book's premise, which begins in Disneyland and evolves into a *Back to the Future*-style twist on *Sleeping Beauty*, is both inspired and intriguing. Unfortunately, the execution does not live up to expectations, resulting in a greater disappointment than anticipated."

However, the execution fell short of expectations, disappointing even more than anticipated.\n\n- **Characterization (Original *Sleeping Beauty* Characters):**\n   - The portrayal of *Sleeping Beauty* characters like Aurora, Phillip, Flora, Fauna, Merryweather, and Maleficent felt off. Their dialogue and actions didn’t align with their established personalities from the 1959 film. For example, Aurora, who is wary of strangers in the movie, immediately engages in intimate conversations with the main characters, which feels inconsistent.\n\n- **Characterization (Main Characters - Stella and Reece):**\n   - Stella, the narrator, is frustratingly inconsistent. Despite her supposed need for control and planning, she fails to educate herself on the *Sleeping Beauty* plot, which undermines her credibility as a \"Type A\" personality. Her actions, like pulling out modern items (e.g., candy bars, Doritos) and using phrases like \"guac your world,\" feel jarring and narrative-breaking.\n   - Reece, her companion, is equally problematic. His reluctance to share crucial plot details with Stella, despite her insistence, feels contrived and illogical.\n\n- **Plot and Narrative Coherence:**\n   - The reveal that Stella and Reece were always part of the *Sleeping Beauty* story (a *Lost*-style \"whatever happened, happened\" approach) feels forced and unsatisfying. The idea that their actions align with the original film’s events, even when they introduce significant changes, is unconvincing.\n   - The fairies’ actions in the final battle against Maleficent being attributed to Stella and Reece’s influence rather than their own agency is insulting to the original characters.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Resonance:**\n   - Stella’s anger about \"fairytales and true love not being real\" feels like a stretch, especially given her pragmatic personality. Her indignation about Disneyland and the Disney brand perpetuating this \"lie\" comes across as unrealistic and over-the-top.\n   - The underlying theme of reassessing childhood fantasies doesn’t land effectively, as Stella’s character lacks the emotional depth or backstory to make this conflict believable.\n\n- **Appeal to Target Audience:**\n   - While the premise might appeal to younger readers or fans of self-insert fanfiction, the execution fails to deliver a satisfying experience. Even a younger version of the reviewer (a middle schooler obsessed with *Sleeping Beauty*) would likely find the inconsistencies and character flaws frustrating.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite its imaginative premise, *Promchanted* falls short in execution. The inconsistent characterization, illogical plot developments, and lack of emotional resonance make it a disappointing read, especially for fans of *Sleeping Beauty*. While it might appeal to younger readers seeking escapist fantasy, the book’s flaws overshadow its potential.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific numerical rating is provided, but the overall sentiment is strongly negative."

            "I deducted a star because I wished both characters had chosen to stay with Rose and Phil. What awaits them back home? For Reece, it's divorced parents and a sister who rarely sees him; for Stella, busy parents who barely acknowledge her existence. Staying with Rose and Phil could have deepened the story, illustrating how happiness can be found in unexpected places. I also felt that Stella’s breakup with her arrogant boyfriend, Cooper, wasn't fully developed. I would have liked to see a moment where she encounters Reece again and realizes she no longer cares about him. That said, I absolutely loved the execution of this book! The scenes were adorable and nostalgic, evoking fond memories of my younger years and my love for Disney.",
            "Reece was absolutely perfect—I fell in love with him! Stella grew on me as the story unfolded. Phil was my favorite character; what girl can resist a super cute guy who's adorably awkward? Rose was charmingly naive, adding to the mix. The chemistry between Reece and Stella developed realistically, especially in a time when so many stories rely on instant love. The romances between Phil and Rose, as well as Stella and Reece, were both sweet and a bit cringey, yet undeniably endearing!",

            "The story unfolds through Stella's perspective, culminating in a surprising introduction of Maleficent. A notable drawback is the lack of chapters from Reece's viewpoint, which could have enriched the narrative. I enjoyed the depiction of two modern teens entwined in the *Sleeping Beauty* tale. Skeptical of fairy tales and disillusioned by her recent breakup, Stella considers skipping the prom. However, she and her close friend Nisha decide to honor their tradition of pre-prom festivities at Disneyland and invite Reece, a newcomer to their town. Despite initial tension between Stella and Reece, a chance encounter with a hidden doorway in Sleeping Beauty’s castle thrusts them into the actual story. They must ensure the narrative stays on course, or they risk losing their way home.",

Following this experience, I am eagerly looking forward to *Gradchanted*.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  I particularly appreciated the narrative involving two contemporary adolescents becoming entangled in the *Sleeping Beauty* tale. Stella, who harbors skepticism toward fairy tales and believes that love stories are fallacious following her recent breakup before the prom, contemplates forgoing the event. As an age-old tradition, Stella and her close friend Nisha opt to partake in pre-prom celebrations at Disneyland. They extend an invitation to Reece, a recent addition to their town. Despite initial friction between Stella and Reece, an inadvertent passage through a concealed doorway in Sleeping Beauty’s castle transports them into the actual story. They then bear the responsibility of ensuring the narrative adheres to its original course, failing which they risk being unable to find their way home.\n\n- **Adherence to Source Material:**  \n  The book closely hews to the classic Disney rendition of *Sleeping Beauty* from the 1959 film. I found the detailed descriptions impressive, thereby lending the story a live-action ambiance rather than an animated or cartoonish aspect.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters of Rose (Aurora) and Phil (Phillip) are more intricately developed, affording insight into Rose’s time at the cottage in the week preceding her sixteenth birthday, evoking several moments of delight.\n\n- **Narrative Perspective:**  \n  The narrative unfolds from Stella’s viewpoint, hence marking a surprising turn with the eventual introduction of Maleficent. The sole drawback discernible was the absence of chapters narrated from Reece’s perspective, which I believe would have enhanced the overall enjoyment of the story.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  In summary, readers who admire the author's work, appreciate the trope of couples who initially clash but ultimately find love, or relish classic Disney stories infused with a contemporary twist are likely to find this book to be a gratifying read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Gradchanted* is a delightful blend of contemporary teen drama and classic Disney storytelling, with well-developed characters and a vivid, live-action feel.

The portrayal of Phillip being nervous about kissing her while she was asleep, like, \"Is it okay to kiss someone while they're sleeping?\" was so cute.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Reece was just going to leave Stella?! What the heck, dude?! I’m glad he wisened up, dummy! And he got a horse? Huge perk, definitely!  \n\n- **Accuracy to Source Material:**  \n  I don’t remember her parents visiting her posing as landlords. It has been a while since I saw the movie.

When Reece, a waiter who witnessed Stella's humiliating breakup, joins the group, tension arises. However, the two must work together to escape the fairy tale world.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Appeal:**  \n  This YA novel is perfect for fans of Disney and lighthearted, magical stories. While it’s categorized as young adult, the tone and themes feel more aligned with upper middle grade, making it a great fit for middle school readers. Many students are likely to enjoy and quickly devour this book.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Genre:**  \n  The book blends realistic fiction and romance with magical realism. While I typically enjoy Matson’s realistic fiction/romance works, the magical elements in this story felt a bit overwhelming for my personal taste.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The novel includes some instances of violence, which readers should be aware of.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a fun, whimsical story that will appeal to Disney fans and middle school readers. While the magical realism aspect didn’t fully resonate with me, the book’s charm and relatable characters make it a great addition to a middle school library.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 ⭐️"

While it lacks depth and a strong message, its humor, charming characters, and clever adaptation of *Sleeping Beauty* make it an enjoyable read. The ending, though a bit silly, fits the overall tone of the book. I’d recommend it for a relaxing afternoon and hope to see more from this world in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I didn’t mind the shift in focus.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The details about Disneyland are incredibly specific, down to Genie+ and the Mickey and Friends Parking Structure. Reading it felt like taking a literal walk in the park, which added a fun and immersive layer to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Adventure:**  \n  Overall, the book delivers a fun and engaging adventure. It kept me entertained, though I felt some moments and thoughts were over-explained or repetitive, which slowed the pacing at times.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Stella, the main character and narrator, came across as a bit annoying to me. Her cynicism about happily ever after felt overdone and somewhat clichéd. On the other hand, Rose and Phil were absolutely precious and felt like flawless, endearing characters.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  I wish there had been more moments between Stella and Reece to build their chemistry. Their relationship felt underdeveloped, which made the ending less rewarding than it could have been.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some minor flaws, such as Stella’s repetitive narration and the underdeveloped romance, the book is a delightful and immersive fantasy/adventure. The detailed Disneyland setting and the charm of side characters like Rose and Phil make it a fun read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Specifically, I found it hard to understand why the characters were worried about changing history when they’re in a fictional, made-up story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  When I realized I had six hours left in the story, I felt a sense of dread rather than anticipation, which ultimately led me to stop reading.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel didn’t resonate with me due to its young-skewing tone, uninteresting characters, and lack of logical coherence in the plot. The pacing and lack of engagement made it difficult to continue, leading me to stop reading at the 52% mark.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (No specific rating score mentioned in the review.)"
