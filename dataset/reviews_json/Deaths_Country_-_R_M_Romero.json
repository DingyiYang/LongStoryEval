            "The ending twist, while predictable, effectively aligns with the themes of self-acceptance and character growth. However, it falls short of the emotional impact the author likely intended. This queer retelling of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth follows Andres, a teenager grappling with a tumultuous home life. After drowning in the Tietê River, he strikes a bargain with death for a second chance. During this journey, he falls in love with both Renee and Liora. When Liora slips into a coma, Andres and Renee embark on a quest to the underworld to save her soul.",
            "The characters—Andres, Renee, and Liora—are thoughtfully developed, each with distinct personalities that harmonize beautifully. Their relationship feels authentic, with a deep care for one another that transcends mere romance.",
            "The novel's verse format, while poetic and impactful, restricts relationship development and world-building. At times, the writing feels disjointed, especially in the audiobook format, which disrupts the narrative flow.",
            "The underworld is a complex and intriguing realm that exceeds initial expectations. The incorporation of historical and cultural references, particularly the interaction with a soldier from the Ukrainian War, enriches the setting significantly.",
            "This book is a dark, romantic, and powerful exploration of self-discovery and love, featuring a rare polyamorous relationship in young adult literature. However, it does include content warnings for death, self-harm, drowning, disordered eating, and toxic parental figures."

        "conclusion": "*Death's Country* is a unique and ambitious novel that blends dark fantasy, romance, and mythology. While the verse format and occasional disjointed writing detract from the experience, the strong character dynamics, intricate world-building, and exploration of polyamory make it a compelling read.

I think it works well for both regular readers of verse novels and those, like me, who don’t typically prefer them.  \n\n- **Retelling vs. Inspiration:**  \n  The book doesn’t read well as a \"modern Orpheus & Eurydice\" retelling.

It stayed true to the essence of the original story while adding fresh, unique elements that made it stand out.  \n\n- **Author’s Work and Future Expectations:**  \n  I enjoyed this book so much that I’ve added R. M. Romero’s other works to my TBR list. If they’re anything like *Death’s Country*, I have a lot to look forward to. I’m excited to explore more of Romero’s body of work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Orpheus/Eurydice retelling was a beautifully written, immersive, and authentic story that I thoroughly enjoyed. The representation felt natural and integral to the plot, and the vivid imagery made the world come alive. I’m eager to read more from R. M. Romero.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As someone who loves that myth, I could truly feel its essence woven into Romero's *Death's Country*.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  I loved the queer representation and poly representation in the story. It felt authentic and meaningful.  \n\n- **Imagery and Atmosphere:**  \n  The imagery was stunning, and I felt completely immersed in the fantastical space alongside the characters. The story had a magical, whimsical quality, but it also carried a dark undertone that added depth.  \n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n  The book tackles serious and impactful themes, including self-harm, racism, struggles with immigration and displacement, grief and loss, and familial abuse/domestic violence between parents. These topics were handled with care and added emotional weight to the narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Flow:**  \n  While I loved the imagery and overall story, I struggled with the flow of the verses. At times, the writing felt disjointed, which repeatedly pulled me out of the moment and made it harder to fully enjoy the experience. This might just be a personal preference, though.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some challenges with the flow of the writing, *Death's Country* is a captivating and thought-provoking read. Its rich imagery, powerful themes, and authentic representation make it a book I would highly recommend, especially to those who enjoy stories with a magical yet dark atmosphere.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story presented too many themes that weren’t explored thoroughly.",
            "I struggled to connect with the characters. The romance, a key aspect of any Eurydice and Orpheus retelling, felt unconvincing and forgettable, particularly during the initial beach meet-cute. While Liora's arc aimed to critique the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope, she often came across as a mere plot device, lacking the depth needed to challenge her initial portrayal. I did appreciate Virgil's character, though he had limited on-page presence.",
            "The writing aims for a lush portrayal of characters, reflecting the darkly magical, neon-colored underworld. However, it prioritizes aesthetics over substance, resulting in a lack of depth. While I'm familiar with the author's direct style, this novel fell short in emotional resonance. The dialogue often felt unrealistic and cringeworthy, especially when attempting to weave in the mermaid and prince motif in a contemporary context. Some moments were so jarring that I had to pause my reading.",

While I found the first half more enjoyable than expected, it ultimately fell short of my hopes. I was hoping for the enchanting style reminiscent of Anna-Marie McLemore, especially in the beginning."

The reader finds this atmosphere \"totally welcome,\" suggesting it enhances the storytelling experience.  \n\n- **Pacing and Style:**  \n  The narrative is noted for being \"swift and sumptuous,\" indicating a balance between fast-paced storytelling and rich, detailed prose. This combination keeps the reader engaged while allowing room for reflection.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The story encourages the reader to think beyond the immediate plot, as it \"beckons you to consider\" deeper ideas. While the poly aspect of the story was expected to play a more significant role, the novel instead presents a \"tapestry of so many things that make a life and a person.\" These themes and elements are acknowledged but not fully explored, which the reader believes is intentional, emphasizing the complexity and fragility of life.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a haunting, thought-provoking read that balances swift pacing with sumptuous prose. While some themes are only touched upon rather than deeply explored, this approach underscores the intricate and fragile nature of life, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Initially, this book left me in a week-long reading slump due to my frustration with certain tropes. However, once I returned to it, the story gained momentum, particularly during the events in Death’s Country, which were far more engaging and emotionally resonant.",
            "The manic pixie dream girl trope, represented by Liora, was a major drawback for me. I find it disappointing that a woman must be quirky to be interesting, and Andres's sad loner persona felt clichéd. Initially, their romance seemed superficial, relying on quirky traits rather than genuine connection. However, as the story progressed, the characters developed more depth. Their journey through Death’s Country prompted them to confront their pain, rendering them more relatable and likable. Ultimately, I appreciated how the throuple dynamic added complexity to their relationships.",

Romero’s books strictly as YA is a disservice because her writing transcends age groups. Her novels are written in verse, blending poetry and storytelling, which appeals to a broader audience.\n\n- **Writing Style and Emotional Impact:**\n   - While this isn’t my favorite of Romero’s books (*The Ghosts of Rose Hill* still holds that spot), I was deeply moved by the writing. The story swept me away, and I found myself crying by the end.\n\n- **Representation of Polyamory:**\n   - The book handles polyamory with compassion and nuance, which is rare, especially in a story about 16-year-olds. I appreciate how Romero normalizes polyamory, showing that every heart has the capacity for infinite love, though not everyone is capable of it. This distinction between capacity and capability is important and well-explored.\n\n- **Personal Connection:**\n   - As someone who is polyamorous and raised my kids in a polyamorous household, I found the representation deeply resonant. My older child is also polyamorous, and I’ve met polyamorous teenagers, so this book felt particularly meaningful to me.\n\n- **Cultural and Mythological References:**\n   - I loved the musical references to David Bowie, the nods to Sylvia Plath, the homage to Gianni Versace, and the unique spin on the Orpheus and Eurydice myth. These elements added depth and richness to the story.\n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**\n   - The story is steeped in duality—light and shadow, bright neons against deepest darkness. This contrast creates a gorgeous and important vibe that Romero executes beautifully, enhancing the narrative.\n\n- **Recommendation:**\n   - As with all of Romero’s novels, I highly recommend this book. It’s a compelling blend of LGBTQ fantasy, romance, mythological fiction, and poetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a beautifully written, emotionally resonant story that transcends its YA categorization. It handles polyamory with compassion and depth, while weaving in rich cultural and mythological references. The duality of light and shadow creates a hauntingly gorgeous atmosphere. I wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n5 Stars."

            "The writing is lyrical and often flows beautifully, but the poetic metaphors can feel out of place in contemporary Miami, particularly when voiced by modern 15- and 16-year-olds. This style was more fitting in the author's previous fantasy novel, *A Warning About Swans*, where the historical setting complemented the prose.",

While the poetic style feels mismatched with the contemporary setting and the mythological references are overly self-aware, the story remains engaging and heartfelt. I’d recommend it to readers seeking good poly rep and a lyrical exploration of complex themes.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Cover Design:**  \n   - The cover is beautiful, with strong bisexual vibes. The use of blues, purples, and pinks is striking and visually appealing.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing is flowery and lyrical, which flows well for the most part. However, the poetic metaphors feel out of place in the contemporary setting of Miami, especially when spoken by modern-day 15/16-year-olds. This style worked better in Romero's previous fantasy novel, *A Warning About Swans*, due to its historical setting.  \n\n- **Mythological References:**  \n   - The story heavily references myths like Dante, Odysseus, and Eurydice (the tale this story is based on). While these references are on-the-nose, the characters' self-awareness of these myths while participating in a similar story feels out of place and unnatural.  \n\n- **Polyamorous Representation:**  \n   - The polyamorous relationship between Andres, Liora, and Renee is portrayed positively and is a highlight of the book. Their love and support for each other are sweet and well-developed, reflecting the growing visibility of poly rep in literature.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n   - The novel explores themes of trauma through lyricism, which adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The story is good overall, though it sits in the middle of Romero's works for me—not as disliked as *The Ghosts of Rose Hill* but not as loved as *A Warning About Swans*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is another solid novel-in-verse from Romero, offering a mix of lyrical writing, positive polyamorous representation, and exploration of trauma. While the poetic style feels mismatched with the contemporary setting and the mythological references are overly self-aware, the story remains engaging and heartfelt.

While this style may not appeal to everyone, I found it reminiscent of reading an ancient Greek epic, which enhanced my experience. The verse format allows for a quick read—I finished it in one sitting—though it does come with the typical limitations of verse novels.

I enjoyed the writing but felt the narrative could have been much richer with more development.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The Seminole didn’t move to South Florida until the 1830s, and their current reservation is in Hollywood, not the Everglades. The author might have confused it with the Miccosukee reservation.  \n   - Claiming Vizcaya is one of the oldest buildings in Miami is incorrect.

However, it lacks sufficient exploration of the later part of their quest, their strategies for coping with their pain, and meaningful, extended dialogue among the three characters.",

While they were interesting, I would have liked to see more complexity and growth in their personalities and relationships.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  I’m always delighted to see polycule books becoming more common, and this story was a neat addition to that growing representation. It was refreshing to see this dynamic portrayed in a novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable and quick read with a unique premise and refreshing representation. However, the fast pacing and lack of detailed character development left me wishing for more depth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
