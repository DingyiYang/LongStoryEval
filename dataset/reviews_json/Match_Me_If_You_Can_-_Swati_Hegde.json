The narrative underscores the importance of communication in relationships, as emphasized by the quote: \"Learn to put your ego aside and communicate with him.

Despite some frustrations, I couldn’t stop thinking about it after finishing it.  \n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance wasn’t the strongest aspect of the story. It only comes up in the last 8% of the book, which felt underwhelming. The love declaration was slightly disappointing, and the hidden identity plotline had potential but fell short.  \n- **Pacing and Slow Burn:**  \n  While I usually enjoy slow burns, this one was particularly frustrating and made me want to scream at times. I even let out a few groans of frustration while reading.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jia had some good character development, which I appreciated because she was driving me insane in the first half of the book. Jaiman, on the other hand, was lovely and heartbreaking, and I felt satisfied by the ending because I wanted to see him happy.  \n- **Relationships (Non-Romantic):**  \n  The platonic friendships, side character romantic relationships, and fatherly relationships were more entertaining and felt more important than the main romance.  \n- **Author’s Expertise:**  \n  The matchmaking scenes felt very knowledgeable, which makes sense since the author is a dating expert. Jaiman’s pining was amazingly written, and I appreciated having his point of view, as it added depth to the story.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you love slow burns, this romance should definitely be on your radar when it comes out in June.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a very cute debut novel with some strong aspects, such as character development and well-written relationships outside of the main romance.

Additionally, she seemed upset about him attending their family dinners, even though he was a regular presence. Jaiman, the MMC, was an emotionally unavailable ghoster who struggled with communication. While he acknowledged that ghosting was problematic, he continued the behavior.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Personality:**  \n   - Jia and Jaiman were both bullheaded and had poor communication skills, which hindered the progression of their friends-to-lovers romance.  \n   - Jia was overconfident and made decisions on behalf of others without considering how her actions might hurt them. However, her unapologetically girly personality was refreshing, as she avoided the \"not like other girls\" trope.  \n   - Jaiman had relatable moments, particularly his complex relationship with his parents and feelings of inferiority regarding his pub's lack of success.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n   - A lot of the dialogue felt stilted, and the main characters came across as immature at times.  \n\n- **Plot Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The story dragged at times but did have its good moments.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n   - The portrayal of Jia as an aspiring matchmaker highlighted her flaws as part of her learning curve, which added depth to her character.  \n\n- **Sensitivity and Triggers:**  \n   - Triggers include parent death from cancer (off-page) and an unwanted kiss.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements and Spice Level:**  \n   - The romance was a closed-door affair, with a spice level rated 2/5.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its strengths, such as Jia's refreshing personality and Jaiman's relatable struggles, the story was hindered by stilted dialogue, immature character dynamics, and uneven pacing. The romance could have been more compelling with better communication between the protagonists. Despite its flaws, the book had moments of genuine connection and character growth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice: 2/5 (closed door)  \n- Triggers: Parent death from cancer (off-page), unwanted kiss"

The central theme of matchmaking is woven throughout the plot, as Jia strives to demonstrate her skills while grappling with her own emotions.",

Jaiman, on the other hand, truly deserves the world—he's incredibly sweet! I adored the found family he created with Jia’s relatives. Despite his father’s skepticism about Jaiman’s dream of running a successful pub, he was fortunate to have such supportive people by his side in the end.",

            "This novel artfully combines elements of *Emma*, *You've Got Mail*, and *When Harry Met Sally*, featuring a friends-to-lovers trope rich with mutual pining, angst, and miscommunication. Although I typically shy away from friends-to-lovers stories due to their often frustrating tension, the author's world-building and well-developed side characters kept the plot engaging, driving Jia and Jaiman’s complex relationship forward. The slow-burn romance captures the emotional intricacies of childhood best friends exploring their feelings amidst matchmaking antics. Despite its leisurely pacing, the tempo enhances the emotional depth of their bond.",
            "I personally adore Jaiman—he embodies everything I value. While Jia's ambition is commendable, her character can be frustrating at times. Still, I can empathize with her perspective and imagine I would feel similarly in her situation. The side characters are endearing and add depth to the story."

        "conclusion": "This debut novel by Swati Hedge is an angsty, slow-burn friends-to-lovers story with a mix of classic romantic elements and lovable side characters. While Jia’s character could be frustrating at times, the overall plot and Jaiman’s charm kept me invested. I’m looking forward to the author’s future works!",

This changed once she realized the MMC's feelings.  \n  - The MMC was really struggling, and I felt for him. Once he changed his thinking a little, he got it.  \n  - Both main characters just needed a little help and less pride, and they eventually got there.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this modern take on Indian matchmaking, with its engaging subplots and character growth. While the main characters had their flaws, their development felt satisfying by the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While it wasn’t a standout read for me, it’s a decent choice for fans of lighthearted rom-coms and friends-to-lovers tropes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars"

            "This novel offers a delightful and vibrant reinterpretation of *Emma*, set against the backdrop of Mumbai's upper class. The protagonist, Jia, dreams of becoming a matchmaker while secretly dispensing romantic advice on her blog, a stark contrast to her work for a women's magazine. The narrative unfolds a slow-burn friends-to-lovers romance between Jia and her childhood friend, Jaiman, adding depth to the story.",
            "Jia's pragmatic yet naive approach to love fuels her misplaced confidence in her matchmaking skills, resulting in amusingly misguided attempts. Jaiman, reminiscent of Mr. Knightley, is more than just a paternal friend; he battles his own challenges, including a struggling bar and family expectations. The tension between Jia and Jaiman is palpable, with Jia privately acknowledging her attraction to him while resisting any change in their relationship. The romance unfolds as a slow burn, though certain moments, like Jaiman unzipping Jia's late mother's wedding lehenga, feel abruptly cut short, missing deeper emotional exploration. Similarly, their dance together and the subplot involving a mysterious blog correspondent could have benefited from further development. The physical intimacy is limited, featuring only a few kisses and one closed-door sex scene near the end.",
            "This book is a delightful blend of humor and lightheartedness, featuring entertaining moments like the culinary rivalry between Jaiman and Harish—the Frank Churchill character—who unveils an innovative restaurant concept called Vodka & Vada."

Despite this, the novel is a light, entertaining read that I would recommend to fans of diverse romcoms.",

For example, when Jia puts on her dead mother's wedding lehenga and Jaiman unzips her, the scene ends abruptly without much exploration of the emotional or physical tension.  \n  - Similarly, their dance together and the mystery blog correspondent subplot feel underdeveloped.  \n  - The physical intimacy is limited to a few kisses and one closed-door sex scene near the end.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  - The book is humorous and light, with entertaining moments, such as the culinary/career rivalry between Jaiman and Harish (the Frank Churchill figure), who introduces a fabulous restaurant concept called Vodka & Vada.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - The novel is enjoyable and frothy, perfect for readers looking for a diverse romcom.

Despite this, the novel is a light, entertaining read that I would recommend to fans of diverse romcoms.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall enjoyment: 4/5  \n- Romance development: 3/5  \n- Humor and tone: 5/5  \n\nThank you to Random House Publishing Group and NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for my review."

She is challenged to find a match for her coworker to earn a matchmaking column. Meanwhile, she ignores her feelings for her childhood friend, Jaiman, a chef struggling to keep his pub afloat. The narrative explores their slow-burn journey from friends to lovers, set against a backdrop of rich Desi culture.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jia's character was frustrating for me. Her ongoing denial of her feelings for Jaiman and her pushy nature made it difficult to connect with her or root for her love story.

It added depth and authenticity to the setting and characters, making the story feel grounded and immersive.\n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The story is a slow-burn romance, which worked well for the friends-to-lovers trope.

They added a playful and creative touch to the narrative, making certain scenes more enjoyable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book offers a heartfelt exploration of love, friendship, and cultural identity, Jia's character made it challenging for me to fully engage with the story.

            "The plot was straightforward but predictable, and while the romance had its charming moments, it ultimately felt superficial. Jia's attempts at matchmaking, especially with Charu and Eshaan, seemed forced and lacking in logical support. Additionally, the resolution of her efforts left much to be desired, as she only succeeded in reuniting Charu and Manoj, without achieving any other notable matches.",

Jaiman felt repetitive, with his chapters dominated by his unrequited love for Jia, his tears, and anxiety over his struggling business. Additionally, the absence of backstory for their relationship made their connection seem forced and underdeveloped.",

Jia's blog posts come across as juvenile and uninteresting, making it difficult to believe she has a substantial readership. Additionally, the fade-to-black sex scene lacks tension, feeling more like a tease than a significant moment.",

Jaiman was a particularly endearing character, open with his emotions, and even shedding tears during his struggles—an authentic depiction that is often missing in romance novels. However, I found some characters frustrating, and the character development felt unclear. I struggled to comprehend how they transitioned from Mindset A to Mindset B by the story's end. I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of their thoughts and more insight into Jia's matchmaking skills.",

All the descriptions of the food and drinks sounded so good and made me hungry.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Jia was a fairly strong and independent female character who cares about her family and friends. I loved all her friends and family, and getting to see their relationship dynamics throughout the book. Jaiman was also a really sweet character. I loved how he was in touch with his emotions and feelings, even crying during his difficult times in the book. That is something you so rarely see depicted in romance novels!  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  I enjoyed the first half the most, when Jia was actively match-making and trying to prove to her boss that this could be a successful column idea for their magazine. However, as the book went on, I feel like the plot got kind of lost for me, and nothing was really happening.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters started to annoy me, and I am not sure the character development was clear enough for me to understand how they got from their initial Mindset A to Mindset B at the end of the book. I wish we had dug into these characters' heads a little bit more and got to see more of Jia's matchmaking skills.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension:**  \n  I also wish there had been a little bit more tension and tender moments between the two main characters.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was really sweet. We love a good HEA (happily ever after) for all of the characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I was excited about the concept of this book and enjoyed its cultural representation and strong characters, especially in the first half. However, the plot lost momentum, and the character development felt unclear.

The main character’s selfishness and the stunted writing style made it difficult to stay invested. I ultimately decided not to finish the book, though I skimmed through to confirm my suspicions about the email partner.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- The book was \"pretty mid\" (average) in my opinion."

            "Jia is one of the most unlikable characters I've encountered in recent literature. Her selfishness and cruelty towards her childhood best friend, Jaiman, are striking. I struggled to understand her casual malice, especially when she accuses him of stealing her life and family, claiming he has no existence outside of them. While this story is a retelling of Jane Austen's *Emma*, Jia lacks the depth that made Emma's choices more relatable. Jia's thoughts and actions often feel absurd and frustrating, particularly during the scene at her sister's house, where she misinterprets a kiss with Jaiman as part of a bet. The conversation she overheard made no mention of a bet, and Jaiman had clearly dismissed any talk of \"landing\" Jia.",

The friends-to-lovers trope is skillfully executed, although it does rely on my least favorite element: miscommunication.",

It was a beautiful story with unique characters who came together seamlessly.  \n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  I appreciated the inclusion of real cultural moments and struggles that Indian people experience, such as holiday celebrations and the challenges of dating outside their religion.  \n\n- **Romance and Tropes:**  \n  The book is a slow-burn, closed-door romance featuring tropes like friends-to-lovers, found family, and miscommunication. These elements added depth and charm to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The author created complex characters and storylines that filled an empty spot in the romance world. I especially loved the \"Aww\"-worthy moments throughout the book.  \n\n- **Side Characters and Themes:**  \n  The side characters felt just as important as the main characters, highlighting the value of family and friendship. This added richness to the overall narrative.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  The cover is one of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. It perfectly captures the vibrance and color described in the book.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  I hope Ms. Hedge continues to write more books like this. Her voice is a refreshing addition to the romance genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a heartfelt, culturally rich romance with well-developed characters and a beautiful storyline. The author’s ability to weave together complex themes and relationships makes this a standout read. I can’t wait to add it to my shelf once it’s released.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This novel offers a delightful yet thought-provoking experience. It centers on Jia, an unfulfilled employee at a relationship magazine, and Jaiman, who struggles to keep his pub afloat while seeking validation from his affluent family. Both characters grapple with their shattered dreams, navigating a journey of self-discovery, perseverance, and the unexpected nature of love.",

            "The first half of the book is slow-paced, with the plot advancing very gradually. By the halfway point, the story has barely moved forward, making the buildup to the first failed matchmaking attempt feel frustratingly sluggish. This pacing issue led to some frustration with Jia's character and her responses to setbacks.",
            "As an Asian-American reader, I appreciated the diversity in this book. The main characters, Jia and Jaiman, hail from wealthy backgrounds in India, and the author openly addresses their affluence. It was refreshing to encounter a narrative that moves beyond the immigrant struggle while avoiding the clichés of a \"Crazy Rich Asians\" storyline, thereby enriching Asian representation in popular literature.\n\nWhile Jia and Jaiman are well-developed characters, the chemistry between them fell short for me. Despite the narrative insisting on their deep connection, it didn't come across as a genuine friendship. Jia's perspective felt somewhat shallow, as she rarely explored Jaiman's personality or motivations, rendering him more of a peripheral figure in her life. Likewise, Jaiman's frequent declaration that Jia is his first love felt unconvincing; he seemed to overlook who she truly is.\n\nAlthough I enjoy the childhood friends-to-lovers trope, the romantic tension between Jia and Jaiman didn't resonate. Jaiman's yearning and efforts were compelling, but their relationship often felt one-sided, lacking the mutual reciprocation necessary to make it truly engaging.",
            "The writing is rich in detail, especially regarding food and settings. The author has clearly invested significant thought into developing the two main characters, making their jobs and struggles feel authentic and relatable.",
            "The second half of the book truly hit its stride, with Jaiman emerging as the emotional core. His devastation and frustration with Jia were well-deserved, given her ongoing denial of their relationship. This dynamic added depth to the story and heightened the emotional conflicts, making them more engaging."

The main characters, Jia and Jaiman, grew up in India and come from wealthy backgrounds, and the author doesn't shy away from discussing their wealth. It was refreshing to have a story that wasn't about the immigrant struggle but also wasn't a \"Crazy Rich Asians\" narrative. This adds meaningful diversity to Asian representation in popular literature.\n\n- **Writing Style and Detail:**\n   - The writing was rich in details, particularly about food and settings. The author clearly put a lot of thought into developing the two main characters, making their jobs and struggles feel authentic and real.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Jia and Jaiman are well-fleshed out characters, but I felt the chemistry between them was lacking. Despite the narrative emphasizing their deep connection, it didn't feel like a genuine friendship to me. Jia's perspective often felt shallow, as she didn't delve deeply into Jaiman's personality or motivations, making him seem more like a peripheral figure in her life. Similarly, Jaiman's constant reiteration of Jia being his first love felt less believable because it didn't seem like he truly saw her for who she was.\n\n- **Plot Pacing:**\n   - The first half of the book was slow-paced, with the story progressing very gradually. By the 50% mark, the plot had only inched forward, which made the buildup to the first failed matchmaking attempt feel frustratingly slow. This pacing issue made me somewhat frustrated with Jia's personality and her reactions to setbacks.\n\n- **Romantic Tension and Chemistry:**\n   - While I love a good childhood friends-to-lovers trope, the romantic tension and chemistry between Jia and Jaiman didn't fully resonate with me. Jaiman's pining and groveling were well-done, but it felt one-sided at times, lacking the reciprocation needed to make their relationship truly compelling.\n\n- **Emotional Depth and Conflict:**\n   - The second half of the book was where it truly hit its stride. Jaiman emerged as the emotional center, and his devastation and frustration with Jia felt warranted, given her consistent denial of their relationship. This added depth to the story and made the emotional conflicts more engaging.\n\n- **Unnecessary Details:**\n   - I found it odd that Jia's virginity status was mentioned multiple times, especially in a book that is fade-to-black when it comes to intimate scenes. This detail felt unnecessary and out of place.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *Match Me if You Can* is a richly written novel with vivid imagery and well-developed characters. While it excels in representation and detail, it falls short in the pacing of the first half and the chemistry between the main characters. Despite these flaws, it’s a solid read, and I look forward to seeing more from this author, especially with her commitment to diverse and fully fleshed-out characters.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3.5 stars (slightly above average). For me, a 4-star book would have me \"giggling and kicking my feet.\""

The excessive miscommunication between them was frustrating; as adults, they could have resolved many issues through simple conversation. This, combined with the slow burn—a trope I usually enjoy—made it difficult for me to believe in their relationship. I struggled to connect with their love story, and the ending felt rushed. Jia's sudden realization of her feelings for Jaiman lacked clarity and left me confused.",

It was so well described, so beautifully presented, and it made me want to research more about it.  \n   - Swati Hegde did an excellent job putting her culture into writing.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Blog Entries**  \n   - I loved the blog entries. They were cute and showed that Swati is knowledgeable about relationships.  \n   - I believe it was a good debut, and I could see myself reading other books by Hegde.  \n\n- **Character Development and Behavior**  \n   - Both Jaiman (mmc) and Jia (fmc) acted like children. I couldn't believe they were in their mid-20s (especially Jaiman, who was 29).  \n   - The miscommunication was excessive for two grown adults who could have solved many of their problems by simply communicating.  \n\n- **Romantic Development and Slow Burn**  \n   - The miscommunication paired with the slow burn (a trope I usually like) made it extremely hard for me to believe they were good for each other.  \n   - I just didn't believe the love story. The ending felt somewhat rushed, and I didn't understand how Jia came to the realization that she was in love with Jaiman.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation**  \n   - Although the book was not for me, I would check out other books from this author in the future.  \n   - It was a sweet debut, but I can't say I enjoyed it as much as I wanted to.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Match Me If You Can* excelled in cultural representation and had charming blog entries, the character behavior, excessive miscommunication, and rushed romantic development made it difficult for me to fully connect with the story. Despite this, I appreciate Swati Hegde's writing and would consider reading her future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The support systems for Jia and Jaiman—such as Charu, Damini, Anshuman, and Flora—often fail to advance the plot and could benefit from either deeper development or reduction. Additionally, Tanu and Anshuman, as the protagonists' closest allies, are not given enough emphasis, which diminishes the familial aspect of the narrative. The main characters' feelings remain underexplored; their mutual pining and tension lack depth due to an insufficiently developed backstory. Jia's animosity towards Jaiman, particularly given their familial ties, is unclear, and her belief that their kiss stemmed from a bet feels inconsistent with her character.",

            "I believe I would have enjoyed the novel more if it had been told solely from Jaiman's perspective. Certain plot elements, especially the 'anonymous messaging' trope, felt forced due to the dual narration. Additionally, while the matchmaking angle aimed to infuse the story with a strong Desi vibe, it ultimately felt both overdone and underdeveloped.",
            "Jia, the female protagonist, often appeared selfish, immature, and willfully obtuse, which diminished her likability. In contrast, Jaiman, the male protagonist, stood out with a richly developed backstory and well-balanced inner conflicts. His compelling actions and decisions made him a character deserving of his happy ending.",
            "The book was enjoyable and entertaining, yet it felt like it had the potential to be even better. While it has its flaws, it certainly deserves more than two stars, though it falls short of four.",
            "Without having seen *Meet the Patels* (2014), I would have found it challenging to grasp the nuances of Jia's matchmaking approach compared to modern-traditional Indian matchmaking. Even after finishing the novel, I struggled to clearly define what Jia's method entailed.",
            "Fans of *Bride and Prejudice*, particularly those who desired an all-Indian cast, will likely appreciate this book. Enjoying it with a custom cocktail or two could further elevate the experience."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While *Match Me If You Can* was an enjoyable and fun read, its flaws—such as fumbled plot points, underdeveloped cultural elements, and an unlikable female protagonist—prevented it from reaching its full potential. However, the male protagonist, Jaiman, was a highlight, and the book may appeal to fans of Desi-inspired romances.",

The romance between Jia and Jaiman feels forced and underdeveloped; while Jaiman is a patient and likable character, Jia's inability to recognize what’s right in front of her is frustrating. This romance seems like an afterthought, detracting from the main narrative.

            "The story's heavy reliance on miscommunication, a trope I find challenging, diminished my overall enjoyment. While the matchmaking theme and Mumbai setting were intriguing, the plot felt predictable and lacked depth.",
            "I found Jaiman, the male main character, to be well-developed and relatable. However, I struggled to connect with Jia, the female main character. She often appeared selfish and created turmoil in the lives of those around her instead of taking responsibility for her own feelings and actions. Although she demonstrated some growth by the end, it would have been more satisfying to see her exhibit less self-centeredness throughout the story.",

            "The story unfolds at a deliberate pace, which may challenge the patience of some readers. Character development is largely concentrated toward the end, resulting in uneven pacing.",
            "Jaiman is a wonderfully sweet and patient character who faces significant challenges, including financial struggles with his pub, unrequited love, and conflicts with his archenemy. His vulnerability and raw emotions make him a compelling male lead. While he occasionally ghosts girls from dating apps, this minor flaw doesn't detract from his overall likability. \n\nOn the other hand, Jia can be frustrating, particularly due to her role in the miscommunication trope, which adds unnecessary tension. Her self-proclaimed title as a matchmaker feels misplaced, as she only sets up two couples and lacks a deeper exploration of her passion for matchmaking. Although she redeems herself in the final 10% of the book, her character development feels rushed and incomplete.",
            "The book skillfully weaves together popular tropes such as friends-to-lovers, he-falls-first-and-harder, and slow-burn romance. However, the heavy reliance on miscommunication may not resonate with all readers. Its narrative evokes comparisons to *Emma* and *You’ve Got Mail*, lending a nostalgic and familiar charm to the story.",

        "conclusion": "*Match Me If You Can* is a sweet, slow-burn romance with a likable male lead in Jaiman, though Jia’s character and the heavy reliance on miscommunication may frustrate some readers. The story shines in its exploration of vulnerability and cultural themes but falters in pacing and character development. Despite its flaws, it’s an enjoyable read for fans of slow-burn romances and friends-to-lovers tropes.",

            "This story, inspired by Jane Austen's *Emma*, builds on a strong foundation but introduces some complexity that may confuse readers. The dual POV shifts occur mid-scene rather than between chapters, which can be disorienting. Additionally, a flashback inserted midway through the narrative feels misplaced; it could have been more effective at the beginning or revealed gradually. Some subplots and antagonists come across as underdeveloped and unnecessary, ultimately detracting from the main storyline.",
            "Jia, the protagonist, is stubborn and often overlooks obvious solutions to her problems, which can be frustrating. Her best friend Jaiman has a compelling subplot about proving his culinary skills to his father, but it sometimes gets overshadowed by other story elements. The characters frequently miscommunicate, a nod to the inspiration from *Emma*, but this trope can feel overused. Additionally, the romantic elements are underdeveloped, with relationship dynamics often lost in the miscommunication. The chemistry between the characters could have been more engaging with improved pacing and focus.",
            "The author demonstrates considerable promise in this debut novel, showcasing moments of compelling storytelling. However, the book would have benefited from tighter editing, with a focus on fewer subplots to better develop the main narrative. Despite its shortcomings, there are strong moments that inspire optimism for the author's future works."

Despite its flaws, the book is a solid first effort, and I look forward to seeing how the author grows in their next project.",

The slow-burn romance between Jia and Jaiman serves as a central focus, showcasing their emotional growth throughout the narrative.",

The friendship among Jia, Damini, and Charu is also well-developed, highlighting their strong bond despite various challenges. The relationship between Jia and Jaiman stands out as a highlight of the book; their connection remains resilient even during conflicts, as they consistently support and comfort one another. The ending, where both characters take a courageous step toward a new beginning, is particularly satisfying.",

The portrayal of desi culture and the emotional ties to home are particularly commendable."

            "The introduction of Jia's family dynamics came too late in the story, disrupting its flow and depth. While misunderstandings and miscommunication were central to the plot, they primarily arose from Jia's actions, resulting in conflicts that felt one-sided.",
            "Initially, Jia's thoughts and life come across as frivolous and disjointed, making it difficult to connect with her. The family dynamics, particularly with her parents and sister, are not explored deeply enough early on, which would have enriched our understanding of her character. Jia embodies the stereotypical millennial—struggling to transition from a day job to pursuing her passion, single, and grappling with loneliness while overlooking the love right in front of her. Her headstrong yet clueless nature can be frustrating, but the matchmaking subplot adds a wholesome dimension to her personality. \n\nJaiman is a likable character, though it's easy to feel sympathy for him due to his constant troubles.

            "Emma retellings often miss the mark for me, primarily because Emma's character can be insufferable. This particular version features Jia, a wealthy young woman in Mumbai who aspires to be a matchmaker while writing listicles for a women's magazine. Unlike a typical teen protagonist, Jia's relentless obliviousness to her childhood friend Jaiman's feelings—and her own feelings for him—makes it challenging to root for her happy ending. Despite my frustration with her throughout much of the book, I found myself cheering for her by the end, which speaks to the enduring charm of the original Emma character. The romance between Jia and Jaiman is central to the story, with their slow-burn dynamic fueled by Jia's ignorance and Jaiman's deep involvement in her family life. While the resolution feels inevitable (they eventually figure things out), the journey remains engaging, albeit frustrating at times.

The novel stays true to Austen's original by emphasizing the intricacies of relationships, which will please fans of the classic. However, the abbreviated Frank Churchill plotline may leave some readers wanting more.",

His helplessness doesn't quite align with Jia's strong personality. The ensemble cast is diverse and engaging, reminiscent of the original *Emma*. I anticipated a pivotal moment for Jia—a \"Badly Done, Emma\" scene—where she would confront her interpersonal responsibilities, but this moment never fully materialized. The central relationship between Jia and Jaiman lacks the chemistry and balance expected in a romantic comedy, making it feel uninspiring.",

While the central pairing between Jia and Jaiman feels mismatched and uninspiring, the novel remains faithful to the original's focus on relationships and offers enough charm to satisfy both Austen fans and general rom-com readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n[No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.]"

            "This Indian romance novel, set in Mumbai, centers on the relationship between a writer named Jia and a business owner named Jaiman. I appreciated the fresh matchmaking concept, which emphasizes the couple's connection over family dynamics, making for an enjoyable read.",
            "Jia is an ambitious and confident woman who knows exactly what she wants in her career. However, her overly pampered nature, tendency to hold grudges, and refusal to communicate make her character frustrating for much of the story—particularly for someone aspiring to be a professional matchmaker. On the other hand, Jaiman is passionate about his dreams but struggles to maintain his enthusiasm for his career. While he has a more likable personality than Jia, his professional choices are questionable; he frequently complains about his pub's failure without taking meaningful steps to improve it. Although Jia and Jaiman are polar opposites, their long-standing friendship since childhood helps them complement each other. Yet, one wonders if their romance would have flourished without that shared history.",
            "The absence of adequate mention of Jaiman’s family, despite their status as family friends, felt odd and underdeveloped."

        "conclusion": "While *Match Me If You Can* offers a refreshing Desi romance with a unique matchmaking twist, the characters’ flaws and underdeveloped aspects of the story impacted my overall enjoyment. Jia’s personality and Jaiman’s professional struggles were particularly frustrating, though their shared history added depth to their relationship.",

            "This charming slow-burn romance weaves in elements of matchmaking and Indian culture. While the pacing starts off slow, it gains momentum around the 60-70% mark, becoming much more engaging and fast-paced.",
            "Jia, the main character, is difficult to connect with due to her selfish and self-centered behavior. Her unresolved feelings do not adequately justify her treatment of others, particularly Jaiman and Charu. In contrast, Jaiman is a more relatable and endearing character, especially in his bond with his found family and the pub that serves as a comforting refuge throughout the story. The relationship between Jia and Jaiman feels uneven; while Jaiman's deep love for Jia is evident, her feelings for him only emerge later, making their chemistry seem sudden and less believable.",

At its core, the story follows childhood friends Jia and Jaiman as they navigate their personal struggles. Jia, an underappreciated romantic advice writer, dreams of launching her own matchmaking column while secretly running a website to document her matchmaking efforts. Meanwhile, Jaiman grapples with his father's expectations to join the family business, all while aspiring to run his own pub. The subplot of his rival opening a bar next to Jaiman's struggling establishment adds tension but feels secondary to the main themes.",

            "The characters in the story initially felt emotionally flat, with only frustration and anger coming through until the latter part of the book. Jia was a strong presence, driving the plot forward, but I found her tendency to impose her ideals on her friend frustrating. She seemed more focused on her own career aspirations than on her friend's true needs. Jaiman, on the other hand, was endearing, yet I often wished he would break free from his passive demeanor. It felt as though he was merely letting life happen to him instead of actively pursuing his own happiness.",

It was so cute, and the cover was gorgeous, so I jumped at the chance to read it.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I found that the characters lacked feeling for a good portion of the book—it wasn’t until closer to the middle/end that I felt anything other than their frustration and anger.  \n   - Jia was a force, and while it moved the story along, I disliked how she pushed her own ideals into her friend as she tried to set her up, not taking into consideration her friend’s true needs while she focused on her own potential career.  \n   - Jaiman was so sweet, but sometimes I just wanted to shake him to make him come out of his passive, uncourageous attitude. It felt like he was just turning away from life and letting it happen to him rather than doing what he needed to make himself happy.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - I did struggle a bit with the story. The emotional depth of the characters took a while to develop, which affected my engagement early on.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Even with my frustrations, I did enjoy the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a charming premise and a visually appealing cover, the character development and emotional depth took time to resonate.

She came across as selfish, out of touch, and a bit spoiled. However, I recognize that this is true to the Emma archetype, so the portrayal was consistent with the original story.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Adaptations:**  \n  Unfortunately, I recently read another book that was also a reimagining of *Emma*, which led me to compare the two. This particular version wasn’t my favorite, though it wasn’t bad either.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This wasn’t the best book I’ve read this year, but I would recommend it to fans of *Emma*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this reimagined version of *Emma* stayed true to the original archetype, it didn’t stand out as a favorite for me, especially after reading another adaptation recently.

It felt like the whole book could have been resolved in one chapter if the characters had just talked to each other. However, the \"he falls first\" and pining tropes helped make the slow burn more tolerable.  \n\n- **Appeal to Specific Readers:**  \n  If you enjoy strong character growth, clever and sweet characters, and modern retellings of classics, you’ll definitely like this novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a charming and clever modern retelling of *Emma*, with lovable characters, satisfying relationships, and a sweet ending. While the slow burn and miscommunication trope were occasionally frustrating, the story’s strengths make it a worthwhile read for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I appreciate a slow burn, it felt forced because the MCs couldn’t communicate effectively.  \n  - The found family aspect and the diverse cast added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  - The connections to the original Emma retelling were clear and well-executed, making it easy to see the parallels early on.  \n  - The pacing was steady, and the story tied up nicely in the end, leaving me satisfied.  \n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  - The incorporation of Indian culture was a highlight, adding richness and authenticity to the setting and characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and entertaining read, despite my frustration with the miscommunication trope. The Emma retelling set in Mumbai, combined with the diverse cast and focus on relationships outside the main romance, made it an enjoyable experience. The story wrapped up neatly, leaving me with a positive impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25/5 stars  \n\nThank you to Netgalley and Random House Publishing Group for the ARC.

Jaiman is consistently charming from the start, and his endearing pining for Jia adds depth to his character, which develops nicely over the course of the narrative. While the slow burn of their romance felt overly drawn out at times—especially from Jia's perspective, which made me question her feelings for Jaiman—the eventual evolution of their relationship and the friends-to-lovers dynamic proved satisfying. Jia's meddling and misguided matchmaking attempts were occasionally frustrating, and she sometimes appeared insensitive to Jaiman's feelings. However, the portrayal of female friendship was enjoyable, and the resolution of Jia and her friends' storyline added meaningful depth to the overall narrative."

            "This friends-to-lovers romantic comedy set in Mumbai features a considerable amount of miscommunication between the female main character (FMC) and the male main character (MMC), making it an appealing read for fans of that trope.",
            "The FMC is both irritating and immature. Although she claims to be a skilled matchmaker, her lack of personal relationship experience undermines her credibility. Her excessive meddling in her co-worker's love life ultimately causes more harm than good. Overall, the unlikable characters detracted from my enjoyment of the book.",

The heavy reliance on miscommunication as a plot device may appeal to some readers, but it wasn't enough to compensate for the lack of relatable or endearing characters.",

However, certain character dynamics and decisions were frustrating and detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 4/10 (I'd say the 4 is generous, truly.)"

She’s prideful (bordering a bit on arrogant), pretty (and she knows it), never wrong (in her opinion), rich (extremely), shops (frequently) exclusively designer, and has the wardrobe of dreams. However, underneath her superiority complex is a heart of gold, which aligns perfectly with how ‘Emma’ is supposed to be portrayed.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The cast of supporting side characters is fun and distinct in personality. My favorite side character was Charu. I appreciated that Charu, a more ‘traditional’ character, didn’t undergo a condescending makeover montage, which is often a trope in similar stories.  \n\n- **Romantic Development (Jia and Jaiman):**  \n  Jaiman, the male main character, comes off as a bit bland compared to the rest of the lively cast. He was also way too passive as a love interest, which made it difficult for me to feel the romantic connection between him and Jia, who has a much stronger presence.  \n\n- **Subplot (Charu and Manoj):**  \n  Romance-wise, I was more invested in the Charu-Manoj drama and wish we had gotten to see a bit more of their story.  \n\n- **Romance Style:**  \n  This is a closed-door romance, which may appeal to readers who prefer less explicit romantic content.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this Emma retelling captures the essence of the original character through Jia, a flawed yet endearing protagonist.

I wouldn’t have minded some \"food porn\" to enhance the experience.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The FMC (female main character) and MMC (male main character) were a bit annoying and lacked depth. They needed more personality to make them more engaging.  \n  - The side characters, like Damini, Charu, and Flora, were more interesting than the main characters. I found myself wishing for more focus on them.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story was a quick and sweet read, which I enjoyed.  \n  - The romance was very light on spice, almost to the point of being nonexistent, which might not appeal to everyone.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Tone:**  \n  - The tone felt a little young for my taste, but I can see its appeal for a younger or more lighthearted audience.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Works:**  \n  - Despite its flaws, the book has potential. I would consider reading a second installment if the characters and plot were further developed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Emma ReMix set in India was a quick, sweet read with a refreshing setting and engaging side characters.

Her intense focus on Charu's happiness blinded her to the reality around her. Although Jaiman loved Jia, he failed to demonstrate the sincerity of his feelings, choosing instead to pursue casual relationships with other women. Despite remaining celibate for a year after their kiss, he eventually began dating and kissed someone else. This inconsistency undermined the romantic tension between Jia and Jaiman, making it feel unconvincing. Additionally, while Jia was a virgin, Jaiman's history of casual encounters further highlighted the disparity in their emotional investments.",

            "This book features dual perspectives from Jia and Jaiman, reminiscent of Mr. Knightley in \"Emma.\" In Austen's work, we gain insight into Emma's character through her own viewpoint, while Mr. Knightley effectively challenges her selfishness and meddling. However, in this story, Jaiman frequently praises Jia as funny, smart, and pretty, which feels dissonant given her unlikable behavior. While I’m not certain that a single perspective from Jia would have resolved these issues, it likely would have improved the narrative.",
            "Jia, much like Emma, is handsome, clever, and wealthy, but she is also incredibly annoying—far more so than Emma. I found myself pondering why Jia grated on me more than Emma did. Jaiman, the Mr. Knightley character, frequently praises Jia's humor, intelligence, and beauty, indicating his affection for her. However, this sentiment isn't fully realized until much later, as Emma remains oblivious to the depth of Jaiman's feelings.",

Nevertheless, I was eager to see how this version would unfold.",

            "In this story, Jia, a spirited writer for a women's magazine, dreams of becoming a matchmaker. She believes she has a knack for it, but her attempts often miss the mark, resulting in both successful and painfully misguided matches. Initially, I found Jia difficult to like due to her strong-willed nature and her determination to impose her matchmaking ideas, even when they faltered. Jaiman, her lifelong friend, is sweet and caring, but I felt he often allowed Jia to push boundaries, which was somewhat off-putting. While the characters, particularly Jia, do experience personal growth, I found this development to be slower than I would have preferred.",
