Although the ending was satisfying, I still wanted more. Additionally, some dialogues and references to TikTok felt unnecessary and detracted from the overall story.",

Initially, I found her frustration with Truett annoying, but I eventually grasped her perspective and the situation's complexity. \n\n**Truett**: I absolutely love him! By the end, I felt so proud of his growth—he truly deserves the world, just like Gwen. It was heartwarming to witness his healing journey and the positive changes he made, finally leading to the love story he always deserved.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the romance but wished for more insights into their past and the time they spent together. They are undeniably soulmates, and while I could have felt even stronger about them, I still found their relationship both cute and emotional. Some of their scenes were deeply touching, but I craved more depth.",

While the book is more focused on vibes and second chances rather than being plot-heavy, I still had a good time for the most part.  \n   - It’s a decent read that will get you emotional and make you want to give the characters a million hugs and kisses.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure**  \n   - The book isn’t very plot-heavy, which is fine, but I wanted more family dynamics and cute scenes after the ending. The conclusion was solid, but I still felt greedy for more.  \n   - There were some unnecessary dialogues and mentions of TikTok that didn’t add value to the story.  \n\n- **Characters**  \n   - **Gwen**: She was a nice character to read about and an awesome mother. She’s incredibly strong, and I give her all the credit for that. At first, I was annoyed by how annoyed she was with Truett, but I eventually understood her perspective and the complexity of the situation.  \n   - **Truett**: I love him! I was so proud of him by the end—he deserves the world, just like Gwen. It was great to see him work on healing, changing for the better, and finally getting the love story he deserved from the beginning.  \n\n- **Romance**  \n   - Overall, I enjoyed the romance, but I wish there were more moments from their past and more details about the time they spent together. They are undeniably soulmates, and while I could have loved them more, I still found their relationship cute and emotional. Some scenes between them were really touching, but I just needed more.  \n\n- **Quotes**  \n   - “The Gwendolyn Pierce standing in front of me may not be the same Gwen I was once married to. She may eat steaks now, she may not be able to cut a fucking tile straight to save her life, and she may have an insulting amount of confidence in my handyman abilities. But the Gwen of the present is still singlehandedly the only person I would want to spend my Saturday with.”  \n   - “I deserve every bit of hate and anger and resentment you feel for me. But make no mistake, I have never, not ever, not for one fucking second of my entire god-forsaken life, stopped loving you.”  \n   - “I love you, True.” “I love you too. Forever.”  \n\n- **Recommendation**  \n   - I would recommend this book. It’s not going to be perfect for everyone, but it’s a pretty decent read that will leave you emotional and invested in the characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a mix of fun, entertainment, and emotional depth. While it leans more on vibes and second chances rather than a heavy plot, it still delivers a satisfying experience. The characters, especially Gwen and Truett, are well-developed and endearing, though I wished for more exploration of their past and relationship.

            "The 18-year separation between the characters was excessive and frustrating, largely overshadowed by stubbornness and miscommunication.

            "Truett, the male protagonist, is a military man—typically not my favorite character type. However, I appreciated that the book steered clear of military or U.S. propaganda. Truett’s emotional baggage and trauma made him relatable yet occasionally frustrating. Though he had access to help, he stubbornly refused it, often feeling like he had failed the world. While this behavior is understandable given his past, it was maddening at times. I was relieved to see his growth by the end. \n\nI admired Gwen for standing up for herself and leaving Truett, despite the lack of choice he offered her. Unfortunately, I couldn't overlook how he hurt her. Overall, neither character left me feeling particularly enamored with them.",

However, this one didn’t meet my expectations.  \n\n- **Characterization (Truett):**  \n  Truett, the male protagonist, was a military man, which isn’t my favorite type of character. That said, I appreciated that the book didn’t push military or U.S. propaganda. Truett was full of emotional baggage and trauma, which made him relatable but also frustrating. He had access to help but refused to take it, constantly acting like he had failed the world. While his behavior was understandable given his trauma, it was still maddening at times. I was glad to see him grow by the end.  \n\n- **Characterization (Gwen):**  \n  I liked Gwen and admired how she stood up for herself and left Truett, even though he didn’t give her much of a choice. However, I hated how he hurt her. Overall, neither of the main characters made me fall in love with them.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The first 50% of the book was a bore, and I found it hard to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  I saw the plot twist coming, at least partially, which took away some of the excitement.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  Despite not liking the book overall, it made me sob multiple times. Every time I thought the tears were over, they’d hit me again.  \n\n- **Connection to Other Works:**  \n  This book is connected to *Written with Regret*, which I loved and gave 5 stars. It’s crazy how different my experience was with this one.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal:**  \n  While this book wasn’t for me, I can see how it might work for others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book didn’t live up to my expectations, primarily due to the slow pacing, predictable plot, and characters I couldn’t fully connect with.

            "Gwen is a resilient, recently divorced single mother reclaiming her life after escaping an emotionally abusive marriage. In contrast, Truett is a broken veteran grappling with grief and trauma, confined within his self-imposed isolation. Both characters are richly developed, with intricate histories and emotional arcs that are both heart-wrenching and beautiful.

Their love story is playful and sexy, interspersed with sweet moments that had me swooning. Watching Truett fight for his happy ending alongside Gwen is both uplifting and satisfying.\n\nGwen's friends inject moments of lightness and humor, balancing the heavier themes, while her son brings additional sweetness and joy to the narrative. The candid and fun interactions between Gwen and her friends create a strong support system, enhancing the overall emotional depth of the story.",

            "The first 30% of the book is confusing, filled with mysterious events and interwoven timelines, but everything ultimately aligns. The pacing is uneven, with the romance shifting abruptly from slow development to rapid acceleration. Instead of being the central focus, the love story highlights the intricate relationship between Truett and Gwen.",
            "The novel delves into themes of second chances, mental health, and the notion that love cannot heal all wounds. While the exploration of mental health is commendable, Truett's emotional turnaround seems rushed, particularly considering the depth of his struggles.",
            "The story is profoundly emotional, and I felt a strong connection to the characters, particularly Truett. As his struggles unfolded, the raw authenticity of his PTSD, depression, and self-loathing made his journey both compelling and heartbreaking.",
            "The blurb suggested one type of story, but the novel ultimately unfolded into a much darker and angst-ridden tale than I expected. The trigger warnings at the beginning did not sufficiently prepare me for the depth of the intense content."

        "conclusion": "This is a dark, angsty, and emotionally charged novel that delves deeply into themes of trauma, second chances, and mental health. While the pacing and rushed emotional turnaround were drawbacks, the story’s raw power and compelling characters make it a memorable read. It’s not a book for everyone, but it will undoubtedly resonate with those who appreciate complex, emotionally intense narratives.",
