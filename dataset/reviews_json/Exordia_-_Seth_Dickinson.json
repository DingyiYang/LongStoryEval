It’s witty, engaging, and sets up a super intriguing first contact alien scenario.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Complexity:**  \n  What follows the strong start is a dense, technobabble bonanza that prioritizes impenetrable science abstractions over story and character. Seth Dickinson’s brilliance is evident, but much of what he writes went well over my head. I felt out of my depth, questioning whether I’m simply not well-versed enough in science fiction literature to fully appreciate it.  \n\n- **Plot and Engagement:**  \n  I lost the plot and never got it back as Dickinson dove deeper and deeper into a cosmological rabbit hole that I just could not follow—literally, figuratively, or metaphysically. Despite this, the promise of the opening section kept me hopeful that the story would eventually re-engage me, but it never did.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  There will undoubtedly be a bloc of readers who love *Exordia*, and I wish I could count myself among them. However, I consider myself among the lesser mortals who could not connect with the frequency at which Dickinson is operating here.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Exordia* starts with an extraordinary and engaging opening act, the subsequent dense and abstract writing style made it difficult for me to stay connected to the story or characters.

            "The story takes a jarring turn early on, unlike another narrative where a shift occurs only after the first installment. In *Exordia*, it feels as though the entire narrative has been compressed into the prologue of a sequel, resulting in an overwhelming and unbalanced experience.",
            "The book explores complex themes like American intervention and moral dilemmas through the experiences of two men, but it struggles to evoke emotional engagement.

However, there was a shift in tone and scale in *Exordia* that I couldn’t reconcile with, leaving me feeling betrayed.  \n\n- **Tone and Scale Shift:**  \n  The story undergoes a drastic change very early on, which I found jarring. Unlike *The Traitor Baru Cormorant*, where such a shift happened after the first book, *Exordia* feels like the entirety of *Baru* was compressed into the prologue of a sequel. This made the narrative feel overwhelming and unbalanced.  \n\n- **Genre and Style:**  \n  The book transitions from a fun, character-driven first contact story into a dense, military sci-fi shooter. It’s packed with US government acronyms, nukes, quips, and pseudoscientific jargon, which even my STEM-oriented brain found exhausting.  \n\n- **Character Development and Narrative Momentum:**  \n  The first act introduces a compelling dynamic between the protagonist and a snake alien, but the story loses its character depth and narrative momentum as it shifts focus. The constant introduction of new characters, each with their own flashbacks and lore, made it hard to stay invested.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Stakes:**  \n  The book attempts to tackle complex themes like American intervention and moral dilemmas through the lens of two men, but it felt like a huge ask to engage with these ideas emotionally. While there’s a hot butch character, it didn’t compensate for the lack of resolution I wanted for the protagonist and her mother’s trauma.  \n\n- **Personal Preference and Audience Fit:**  \n  This might just not be the book for me. While I appreciate Seth’s intellect and ambition, *Exordia* didn’t deliver what I was hoping for.

His cultural world-building is on par with Ursula K. Le Guin, and his deep compassion for humanity shines through in his characters. When a character delivers a profound statement about mankind, it feels authentic and impactful.\n\n- **Setting and Tone:**  \n  The contemporary 2013 Obama administration setting of *Exordia* highlighted some of the issues I had with his *Traitor Baru Cormorant* series. The tone often felt heavy-handed, especially with characters like the 40-year-old special-ops national security advisors. I found it hard to suspend disbelief, and the military scenes reminded me of *Metal Gear Solid 4* cutscenes, complete with over-the-top dialogue and dramatic flair.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was surprisingly rough. While the first thirty pages had a compelling open-ended feel, by page 250, it became clear that the rest of the book would follow a similar slow, meandering trajectory. The non-linear narrative sacrificed momentum for the gradual development of a larger scientific theory, which might alienate half the readers. It reminded me of *The Three-Body Problem* in its complexity and density.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters felt flattened by their overlapping nerd tastes. Despite their diverse backgrounds, they all referenced the same pop culture touchstones—*Neon Genesis Evangelion*, *X-Files*, *Star Trek*, *Metal Gear Solid 2*, and *Call of Duty*. While these references were meant to highlight commonality and pay homage to influences, they made the characters feel less distinct and the writing less nuanced.\n\n- **Pop Culture References:**  \n  The frequent pop culture references were a double-edged sword. They were used to keep the tone light and acknowledge influences, but they often felt forced and detracted from the story’s depth. For example, characters comparing cosmic events to specific movie scenes made the writing feel less sophisticated than it actually is.\n\n- **High Points and Potential:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, the interesting parts of the book were *really* interesting. The ending sets up a clear sequel hook, and I would definitely read the sequel. I also found myself emotionally invested in the relationship between the two women, rooting for them to fall in love.\n\n- **Personal Quirks and Humor:**  \n  At one point, I accidentally started imagining the Neopets Hissi species and couldn’t shake the image, which added an unintended layer of humor to my reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Exordia* has moments of brilliance and showcases Seth Dickinson’s intellectual depth and world-building prowess, it struggles with pacing, heavy-handed characterization, and overuse of pop culture references.

            "The novel opens with a captivating premise involving aliens from Exordia, a galaxy-spanning civilization, whose conflicting missions threaten humanity. It follows a Kurdish refugee in the US who is recruited by a rebel alien. However, the middle section, which spans about 70% of the book, becomes a convoluted mess with non-linear storytelling, multiple points of view, and repetitive iterations of the trolley problem. While the initial 20% and the conclusion are engaging, the bulk of the narrative frustrates with its difficult-to-follow structure. The pacing is uneven; the strong start and intriguing ending are overshadowed by a middle that drags due to its repetitiveness. The non-linear approach and shifting perspectives further disrupt the flow, making it challenging to remain engaged.",

Their serpentine, hydra-like appearance underscores their inherent damnation from birth. The Exordia civilization is depicted as entirely evil, oppressive, and cruel without justification. While the premise is unique and initially intriguing, its execution ultimately becomes overwhelming and relentlessly dark."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  The novel begins with an intriguing premise involving aliens from the Exordia, a galaxy-spanning civilization, who come to Earth with conflicting missions that threaten humanity. The story follows a Kurdish refugee in the US who is enlisted by a rebel alien. However, the middle section of the book, comprising about 70%, is a convoluted mess with non-linear storytelling, multiple points of view, and repetitive iterations of the trolley problem. While the first 20% and the ending are engaging, the bulk of the narrative is frustrating and hard to follow.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are subjected to endless moral dilemmas, primarily variations of the trolley problem, which becomes tiresome and detracts from their development. This repetitive focus on ethical quandaries overshadows any meaningful growth or depth in the characters.\n\n- **World-Building and Concept:**  \n  The aliens’ technology is based on morality and souls, incorporating themes of heavenly judgment and damnation to hell. The aliens themselves are serpentine, with a hydra-like appearance, and are inherently damned from birth. The Exordia civilization is portrayed as entirely evil, oppressive, and cruel without justification. While the concept is unique and initially captivating, its execution becomes overwhelming and unrelentingly dark.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is uneven, with a strong start and an interesting conclusion, but the middle section drags due to its repetitive and convoluted nature. The non-linear storytelling and multiple perspectives further disrupt the flow, making it difficult to stay engaged.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the promising beginning and intriguing ending, the majority of the book is a slog. The repetitive moral dilemmas, confusing narrative structure, and unrelentingly bleak tone make it a disappointing read. The good parts do not compensate for the overall negative experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has a compelling premise and some interesting ideas, its execution falls short. The repetitive and convoluted middle section, combined with the unrelentingly dark tone, makes it a difficult and unsatisfying read. The strong start and intriguing ending are not enough to redeem the overall experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot recommended. The good bits do not outweigh the bad, and the overall book is a downer besides."

His talent for crafting intricate narratives populated by flawed yet relatable characters is truly unparalleled.",

Exordia is another stellar example of Dickinson's work, continuing to light my brain on fire in the same way *The Traitor Baru Cormorant* did five years ago. His ability to weave complex narratives with hurt, yet relatable, characters is unparalleled.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The novel is a high-concept, character-driven science fiction that blends elements of extraterrestrial encounters, body horror, fractal imagery, and cultural conflict. It has been described as \"Independence Day meets Annihilation,\" capturing its phantasmagoric explosion of ideas and themes. The book doesn’t shy away from challenging topics, such as the Kurdish people’s experiences with exploitation and genocide, as well as the trauma and moral complexities of its characters.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Complexity:**  \n  The narrative is challenging, leaping explosively between perspectives and settings, expecting readers to keep up. While initially dizzying, the structure becomes more comfortable by the midpoint. The elegantly complicated plotlines and ever-expanding cast of characters make it a demanding but rewarding read. The novel’s complexity is necessary to effectively cover its subject matter.\n\n- **Emotional and Intellectual Impact:**  \n  Exordia is both smart and emotionally resonant. It explores deeply traumatic experiences and moral dilemmas, with elements of body horror that are troubling yet powerful. At the same time, it is fun and bold, with moments of laughter and joy, such as characters admiring the beauty of fighter jet design or making rapid-fire pop-culture references. The second half of the novel is particularly insane and thrilling, though hard to describe without spoilers.\n\n- **Accessibility and Appeal:**  \n  The book won’t be for everyone due to its narrative shifts, complex plotlines, and challenging themes. It’s an acquired taste, but for those who enjoy high-concept science fiction like *Annihilation* or *Dune*, it will likely earn a spot among their favorite novels. While more accessible than Dickinson’s *The Masquerade*, it remains a singular and niche masterpiece.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nExordia is a masterpiece—frenetic, explosive, and elegant.

What started as a domestic first-contact story transforms into a military thriller meets cosmic horror. While I found the whole train wreck fascinating to watch, I’m not sure the narrative doesn’t start collapsing under its own weight.  \n\n- **Comparative Analysis:**  \n  This novel made me respect Neil Asher even more, as this sort of thing is his bread and butter, but with a lot less angst.  \n\n- **Ending and Sequel Potential:**  \n  The biggest issue is that the novel ends on a somewhat dispirited cliffhanger. Dickinson has made it clear that there’s no guarantee he’ll get to write a follow-up book, even though he has the raw material for it. I really want to read that book!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel starts strong and delivers a fascinating, albeit chaotic, narrative shift, its ending leaves much to be desired due to its unresolved cliffhanger and uncertain sequel prospects.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "The international cast is excellent, and you find yourself rooting for them, even as they face off against one another. However, the characters can come across as somewhat similar due to the frequent, prolonged discussions of complex topics.",
            "In reflecting on *Traitor Baru Cormorant*, I feel a sense of loss for its author, as this new book feels markedly different from that razor-sharp masterpiece. Seth Dickinson has evolved into an impressively brainy writer who wants you to know it. His prose captivates, yet can be frustrating at times. The narrative is laden with a wealth of knowledge—spanning physics, biology, political intricacies, religious beliefs, military details, and existential philosophy. Dickinson strives to illustrate how these elements intertwine into a rich and chaotic tapestry of thought and culture.",
            "The book is contemporary, featuring a diverse cast of characters and beliefs that Dickinson presents convincingly.",
            "This alien invasion story stands out as Dickinson explores the aliens' unknowable nature, treating them as a compelling subject rather than mere antagonists. The narrative examines our interactions with stories, revealing how we perceive ourselves as heroes, villains, or expendable figures in one another's narratives. The portrayal of alien body horror and the horrors of warfare is striking and impactful."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Exordia* is a brilliant, thought-provoking, and densely packed novel that showcases the author’s immense intellect and creativity. While it may not reach the heights of *Traitor Baru Cormorant*, it is still a remarkable work that will leave you pondering its themes and ideas for a long time. However, its modern cultural references and relentless intellectual discourse may not appeal to everyone.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author's Evolution and Style:**  \n  - I mourn the Seth Dickinson of *Traitor Baru Cormorant*, as this book feels different from that razor-sharp masterpiece.  \n  - This Seth Dickinson is evolved, painfully smart, and wants you to know it. His writing is sheerly impressive, a joy to read, but also aggravating at times.  \n  - The book is packed with knowledge—physics, biology, political intricacies, religious beliefs, nerdy trivia, military details, and existential philosophy. Dickinson wants you to see how it all coalesces into a marvelous, messy ball of thought and culture.  \n\n- **World-Building and Characters:**  \n  - The book is modern, with a truly worldwide cast of characters and beliefs, which Dickinson sells believably.  \n  - The international cast is wonderful, and you root for them, even as they are pitted against each other.  \n  - The characters, however, can feel a bit samey due to the constant, lengthy discussions of complex topics.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n  - This is an alien invasion story, but Dickinson treats the aliens and their unknowable nature as just another topic to explore, making them feel real and horrifying.  \n  - The book delves into how we interact with stories, seeing ourselves as heroes, villains, or expendable bodies in each other’s narratives.  \n  - The alien body horror and the hell of warfare are presented in incredible ways.  \n\n- **Drawbacks:**  \n  - The book includes modern cultural callbacks and in-jokes (e.g., a \"jet fuel can't melt steel beams\" pun), which can be annoying depending on your taste.  \n  - The constant intellectual discussions can make your eyes glaze over and blur the distinctiveness of the characters.  \n\n- **Standalone Potential:**  \n  - I hope this is a standalone book, as I’m not sure continuing the story would add value, despite the cliffhanger ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Exordia* is a brilliant, thought-provoking, and densely packed novel that showcases Seth Dickinson’s immense intellect and creativity. While it may not reach the heights of *Traitor Baru Cormorant*, it is still a remarkable work that will leave you pondering its themes and ideas for a long time.

            "*Exordia* is a spectacular mess that somehow holds together better than one might expect. Summarizing the plot is challenging due to its dramatic shifts in focus and scale. The first act is charmingly domestic, the second blends elements reminiscent of Tom Clancy and Jeff VanderMeer, and the third ventures into complex ethical dilemmas. While these tonal shifts are impressive, they can make the narrative difficult to fully embrace. At times, the book feels overstuffed, with prolonged action sequences that drag, while culturally rich backstories are far more engaging.\n\nThe main protagonist, Anna, often feels secondary, propelled by an alien's favor instead of her own agency. The result is a messy yet fascinating narrative that flits between ideas, seemingly unified only by the author’s interests. Although the story has a complete arc, it clearly sets up for a sequel. The grand scale established in the ending suggests that any sequel may require a new setting and cast, raising concerns about how long we might wait for it to materialize.",
            "The characters are profoundly flawed and strikingly human, often preoccupied with mundane concerns such as food, odors, and past relationships. Some exhibit genuine religious beliefs, lending an authenticity that is often absent in fiction. However, as the narrative unfolds, the main cast starts to caricature themselves due to alien soul manipulation technology. This element serves as both a critique of grand narratives and a playful nod to techno-thriller tropes.",
            "This thematically rich book delves into the repercussions of imperialism, particularly critiquing the Obama-era mantra of “don’t do stupid shit.” It raises ethical questions about complicity, pondering whether it is preferable to betray those close to you or to permit a more powerful entity to cause greater harm. Additionally, the narrative engages with Trolley Problems, exploring the morality of decisions surrounding life, death, and subjugation, especially in relation to immortal souls and the concept of hell.",
            "The story features humor that is hilariously dark and aligns perfectly with its characters' struggles with trauma. This unique approach sidesteps the common pitfall of melodrama in works that blend humor with serious themes.",
            "I've been eagerly awaiting this book for years, as the author is one of my favorites. Having read the short story it was expanded from, I was already familiar with the main elements of the climax, which likely shaped my perspective differently than that of the average reader."

I even read the short story it was expanded from before knowing it would become a novel, so I was already familiar with the broad strokes of the climax. This likely influenced my perspective compared to the average reader.\n\n- **Structure and Cohesion:**  \n  *Exordia* is a glorious, spectacular mess that somehow coheres far better than it has any right to. It’s a profoundly difficult book to summarize, with a plot that shifts dramatically in focus and scale. The first act is oddly domestic and endearing, the second feels like a blend of Tom Clancy and Jeff Vandermeer, and the third delves into complex ethical dilemmas. While the shifts in tone and scale are impressive, they make the book challenging to fully grasp.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The book is thematically dense, with a strong focus on the fallout of imperialism, particularly the Obama-era “don’t do stupid shit” approach. It explores the ethics of complicity, asking whether it’s better to betray those around you or allow a more powerful force to inflict greater suffering. The story also grapples with Trolley Problems, examining the morality of choices involving life, death, and subjugation, especially in the context of immortal souls and hell.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters are deeply flawed and incredibly human, often distracted by mundane concerns like food, smells, or past relationships. Several are sincerely religious, adding a layer of realism rarely seen in fiction. However, as the story progresses, the main cast begins to caricaturize themselves due to alien soul manipulation technology, which feels like both a commentary on grand narratives and a setup for a joke about techno-thriller tropes.\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  Some POVs are hilariously dark, with humor that’s objectively tasteless but fitting for characters coping with trauma. This avoids the bathetic trap many dramatic works fall into when mixing humor with serious themes.\n\n- **Technobabble and Detail:**  \n  The book is packed with technobabble covering theoretical math, cellular biology, cryptography, entropics, black holes, and more. It’s either meticulously researched or confidently speculative, but it can be overwhelming. I found myself skimming past the dense scientific jargon to stay engaged.\n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**  \n  The book feels flabby at times, juggling too many elements. Extended action scenes dragged on, while cultural digressions about the characters’ backstories were more engaging. Anna, the main protagonist, often feels vestigial to the plot, carried along because she’s favored by an alien. The result is a messy but fascinating narrative that flits between topics seemingly unified only by the author’s interest.\n\n- **Ending and Sequel Potential:**  \n  The book has a complete narrative arc but clearly sets up a sequel. The ending’s massive increase in scale suggests a sequel would require a new setting and cast, raising concerns about how long it might take to materialize.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Exordia* is a complex, ambitious novel that explores profound ethical dilemmas and the consequences of imperialism through a messy but compelling narrative. While its pacing and focus can be uneven, the characters’ humanity and the book’s thematic depth make it a rewarding read for those willing to navigate its challenges.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The other characters are also well-developed, each with their own moral compass and perspective, making them equally engaging.\n\n- **Themes and Moral Ambiguity:**  \n  The book raises complex questions about humanity and what is worth saving. Each character argues their point of view effectively, leaving the reader to decide who is right. The moral ambiguity and high stakes add depth to the narrative.\n\n- **World-Building and Science:**  \n  The alien beings are portrayed as superior, which introduces thought-provoking questions. The story is packed with action, morally ambiguous choices, and a lot of science and math. While some of the scientific elements went over my head, they didn’t detract from the overall readability.\n\n- **Emotional and Humorous Moments:**  \n  The novel balances intense moments with humor and heartfelt scenes, allowing the reader to connect deeply with the characters and their world. These moments make the story even more engaging.\n\n- **Accessibility:**  \n  The book is very science-heavy, which might be challenging for the average reader. However, if you’re invested in the story, it’s worth the effort. Getting lost in the science could make it hard to find your way back, so commitment is key.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Exordia* is a dense and lengthy novel, but it’s worth the investment, especially for fans of sci-fi and alien stories. The compelling characters, moral complexity, and emotional depth make it a rewarding read, despite its challenging length and scientific complexity.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

After the Big Event, the pacing slowed considerably, overwhelmed by extensive backstory and character history that detracted from the main narrative. The non-chronological timeline, with frequent shifts to minor characters, added confusion rather than depth. Additionally, the major disaster unfolded too early; allowing more time to develop the characters would have enhanced the emotional impact.",
            "In *Exordia*, the characters do not resonate as strongly as in the author's previous works. While Anna and the alien Ssrin are engaging, particularly during their first contact, this connection diminishes as the narrative expands. Frequent shifts in point of view create a sense of disconnection among the cast, making it challenging to engage with any one character. The storytelling often informs rather than immerses, leaving me feeling detached from their worlds.",
            "The book is filled with dense military, technical, and scientific jargon that can be overwhelming and alienating. The heavy reliance on hard sci-fi elements renders the story feel inaccessible, making it seem more like an observation of events than a genuine understanding of them. Additionally, the dialogue, while spoken by a diverse cast, lacks authenticity and comes across as oddly standardized.",

The first 50 pages are captivating, yet the story descends into incoherence with abrupt shifts in focus and pacing. The influx of characters and subplots feels overwhelming and poorly integrated. The final act, which revolves around a reality-altering device, is confusing and ultimately unsatisfying, lacking resolution.",

Anna, the protagonist, fades into irrelevance after the initial setup, with her actions having little impact on the plot.

Their interactions and motivations remain unclear, making their roles in the story feel forced and unnecessary.",

Phrases like “Davoud has built a miniature version of the brightest thing in the whole universe” and “Blackbird guzzles down God only knows how many metric tons of air” illustrate the book’s tendency to prioritize style over substance. The dialogue is stilted, and the exposition is clumsy, hindering the flow of the narrative.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n  - The novel critically examines American imperialism, human experience, psychological trauma, ethical systems, and morality.  \n  - It uses the \"horror\" of first contact to critique the American military-industrial complex.  \n  - Explores individual morality and the ways people justify their actions as good despite doing evil.  \n  - Delves into the tangible theme of objective good versus evil, particularly through the alien Ssrin's dialogue with Anna.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The prose is dense yet engaging, packed with wry, irreverent humor that both amuses and horrifies.  \n  - The writing is smart and accessible, avoiding condescension and treating the reader as an equal.  \n  - Exposition is seamlessly woven into the narrative, revealing information gradually without overwhelming the reader.  \n\n- **Characterization and POV:**  \n  - Most POV characters are well-received and effectively serve the novel's themes.  \n  - Each character's perspective contributes to the exploration of morality and self-justification.  \n\n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  - A perfect blend of \"soft\" and \"hard\" science fiction, appealing to fans of both genres.  \n  - Likely to resonate with readers who enjoyed books like *Annihilation*.  \n  - Combines tech and military SF elements with deep thematic exploration, making it enjoyable for fans of soft SF.  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  - One of the most thought-provoking books I've read in years.  \n  - Despite its heavy themes, the novel maintains a balance by not taking itself too seriously, ensuring the reader remains engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSeth Dickinson's *Exordia* is a masterful blend of science fiction genres that critically examines American imperialism, morality, and the human condition. Its dense yet accessible prose, well-crafted characters, and seamless exposition make it a thought-provoking and engaging read. Fans of both soft and hard SF, as well as those who enjoy thematic depth, will find this novel particularly rewarding.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The intricacies of the alien political system quickly became overwhelming, leaving me frustrated.

The novel delves into deep moral dilemmas, particularly questioning the acceptability of civilian casualties when confronted with existential threats.",

However, the early chapters adopt a sitcom-like tone, centering on Anna Sinjari's interactions with the alien Ssrin and their exploration of concepts such as serendure. This lighthearted beginning is intentionally deceptive, as the narrative soon descends into existential dread and horror. The author’s meticulous writing imbues the story with depth, as every word and scientific theory is thoughtfully placed.

The frustrating cliffhanger hints at an expansive story that ventures across the galaxy, delving into profound themes of existence and free will. Each of the five acts explores a distinct sci-fi subgenre: it begins with a quirky tale of friendship with an alien, shifts to a spy novel flashback, morphs into a Jeff VanderMeer-inspired Event Horizon, and culminates in an Independence Day-style air battle.",
            "The characters were well-crafted, featuring a blend of likable and unlikable traits. Their decisions, though often terrible, were frequently understandable as the plot unfolded.",

            "I recommend *Exordia* to those who appreciate genre blending and are fans of body horror, lengthy debates on math, and intricate moral dilemmas. Keep in mind that a cliffhanger can be tricky; sequels only get greenlit if the first book succeeds."

It's 500+ pages, and I couldn't put it down.  \n\n- **Genre and Structure:**  \n  Each of the five acts is more or less a different sci-fi subgenre, starting off with a quirky \"my friend the alien,\" transitioning to a spy novel flashback, then to \"If Jeff Vandermeer wrote Event Horizon,\" and culminating in an Independence Day-vibes air battle.  \n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n  Dickinson has Something To Say About The Kurds. That's going to annoy some readers, but I thought it was well done and relevant to the story and character backgrounds.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters were good, a mix of likable and awful, making terrible but often understandable decisions as the plot moved along.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  The ending is the reason this is not a five-star book. It’s a frustrating cliffhanger that sets up what could be a huge series, traveling across the galaxy and exploring very big ideas about existence and free will.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I recommend *Exordia* to people who don’t mind genre jumping and enjoy body horror, long arguments about math, and complicated questions of morality. As for the cliffhanger, remember that sequels don’t get contracts unless the first book does well.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Exordia* is a gripping and ambitious novel that blends multiple sci-fi subgenres, tackles relevant themes, and features complex characters. While the cliffhanger ending may frustrate some readers, it sets the stage for a potentially expansive and thought-provoking series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned, but implied to be less than five stars due to the cliffhanger ending."

Additionally, the well-placed references introduce a lighter tone without undermining the plot's gravity.",

Its sci-fi elements serve as both a reflection and critique of the banal evil inherent in empire-building and atrocities.

The plot is tightly paced, with intense twists and turns that kept me bouncing up and down with excitement. The escalation from a small premise to a massive, apocalyptic scenario was both comical and thrilling.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Seth’s evocative prose and dark humor are familiar and effective, creating a tonally cohesive narrative despite the heavy subject matter. The tonal dissonance, with each character’s disaffected humor about the apocalyptic situation, balances the despair and keeps the story grounded. The references peppered throughout add a lighter tone without detracting from the gravity of the plot.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The book features seven (or eight) distinct protagonist or deuteragonist perspectives, each with a unique outlook that makes them instantly recognizable. The characters are lovable, hatable, and everything in between, with each being compelling and distinct. My favorites were the dysfunctional autistic butch-femme lesbians, but I ended up loving all of them.\n\n- **Themes and Ethical Dilemmas:**  \n  The book delves deeply into ethical dilemmas, particularly the trolley problem and the moral justification for sacrifices made for the greater good. It questions who gets to make these choices and whether the greater good is actually good. The commentary on real-world American imperialism, drone warfare, and the military-industrial complex is sharp and on the nose.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  Set during the Obama administration in our world, the book uses an alternate history to explore real-world injustices. The sci-fi intervention into this setting reflects and critiques the banal evil of empire-building and atrocities. The central conflict, a locked box mystery, blends body horror, meta-narrative, and Lovecraftian math, creating a reality-shifting threat that is both scary and fascinating.\n\n- **Ending and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The climax and ending left me asking profound questions, similar to how I felt at the end of *Traitor*. The emotional impact was intense, with moments that made me cry and laugh simultaneously. The ending tied every thread together in a way that felt inevitable and deeply satisfying.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Exordia* is an absolutely incredible novel that combines gripping pacing, masterful writing, compelling characters, and profound ethical dilemmas. It balances dark humor with heavy themes, creating a story that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The ending is emotionally impactful and ties the narrative together perfectly.

Readers may be caught off guard as the tone never returns to its original whimsy, diverging significantly from initial expectations.",

The writing was occasionally hard for me to follow, but it was still engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I thought the characters in *Exordia* all had some messed-up histories, but I don’t think these were addressed to my satisfaction. There were conversations that I think should have happened but didn’t.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The novel had a rather fast pace, with something constantly happening or being revealed.

It’s reminiscent of works like *Ninefox Gambit*, *Blowback*, and *Blindsight*, with a mix of big ideas, narrative symmetries, and critiques of America’s interventions. The story revolves around a mysterious alien artifact and warring extraterrestrial factions.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Compared to the author’s previous work, *Traitor*, this book is punchier and more rooted in modern vernacular, with direct references to pop culture like *Terminator*. It’s a smart book with lots of neologisms and mathematical concepts, but the terminology is built from recognizable parts, making it accessible.

Anna and Ssrin are standout characters, while Khaje feels like a continuous thread of chaos. Iruvage is a compelling antagonist, and the US military characters are almost comically inept, adding a layer of dark humor. The multiple POVs provide diverse perspectives, enriching the narrative.\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The core mystery of the alien object is compelling, and the tension builds effectively. However, the middle section demands focus due to frequent POV shifts and time jumps. While the ending is satisfying, it leaves room for a potential sequel, which I would eagerly read.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book features significant body horror, more intense than in the author’s previous works. While it serves a purpose beyond mere shock value, it may not be suitable for readers who are sensitive to such content.\n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  The book rewards attentive reading and some background knowledge of mathematics and military history, though it’s not strictly necessary. The blend of real and invented terminology (e.g., “jineology”) adds depth but may require occasional research for full appreciation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Exordia* is a standout sci-fi novel that balances fun, intelligence, and depth.

While I appreciate a substantial read, the story feels divided between two distinct arcs: the scientific discovery of Blackbird and the ensuing intense combat. This tonal shift, akin to *The Outside*, is jarring. I found the beginning, with its wild alien elements, far more engaging than the later militaristic focus, which ultimately led to some skimming and disengagement.",
            "The elements of random sexual attraction between Erik and Clayton felt unnecessary and out of place, especially given the absence of similar internal monologues from other characters. For example, the hinted wlw relationship was not explored in a comparable manner, creating a sense of inconsistency that detracted from the story. Although the exploration of morality and trolley problems was compelling, I am uncertain whether the narrative effectively navigates the complexities of a \"White Man Writes Morality Play.\" While Clayton and Anna’s pragmatic arguments are well-presented, the portrayal of Aixue as a Chinese mathematician reduced to mere mathematics felt reductive and infantilizing, ultimately leaving me uncomfortable.",
            "I admire the boldness of the world and the intricate mechanics of the soul. The sci-fi elements are well-crafted, with a standout focus on soul physics that inspires thought-provoking discussions about free will, mathematics, and the universe's underlying structure. The worldbuilding is robust and captivating, making it a highlight of the story for me."

The worldbuilding is strong and engaging, which is a highlight for me.\n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The plot suffers from being overly dense and detailed, reminiscent of *Baru Cormorant*. While I enjoy a chunky book, the story feels like it moves through two distinct storylines: the scientific discovery of Blackbird and the intense combat that follows. This shift in tone, similar to *The Outside*, is jarring. The beginning, with its wild alien elements, was more appealing to me than the militaristic focus later on, which led to some skimming and disengagement.\n\n- **Science and Experimentation:**  \n  The scientific exploration and experiments were fascinating, with moments of body horror and the intriguing concept of pattern replication. However, the heavy military jargon and flight maneuvers were overwhelming and detracted from my enjoyment.\n\n- **Narrative Execution:**  \n  The use of flashbacks to convey the science story was confusing. While it made structural sense, the execution felt lacking, contributing to the sense of too much happening at once.\n\n- **Characterization and Relationships:**  \n  The random sexual attraction elements involving Erik and Clayton felt unnecessary and out of place. It was especially odd given the lack of similar internal monologues from other characters, like the wlw relationship that was hinted at but not explored in the same way. This choice felt inconsistent and detracted from the story.\n\n- **Morality and Representation:**  \n  The exploration of morality and trolley problems was compelling, but I’m conflicted about whether Seth successfully navigates the complexities of a \"White Man Writes Morality Play.\" While the pragmatic arguments of Clayton and Anna are well-presented, the portrayal of Aixue as a Chinese mathematician whose soul is reduced to math felt reductive and infantilizing.

It’s unpredictable yet follows a coherent pattern, ending in a way that feels inevitable. The middle section becomes a bit dense and unwieldy, though not impossible to follow, and the ending demands a sequel, though I feel a sequel might lessen the impact of Exordia.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The novel features a rich cast of well-developed characters.

Exordia consumed my waking thoughts and distracted me from hobbies and work. While the middle section feels dense, the overall pacing keeps the reader engaged from start to finish.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  Exordia has shades of Dickinson’s other works—the Masquerade series, the lore of Destiny, and Freespace: Blue Planet—but feels refined to a wicked edge.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Engagement and Initial Impressions:**  \n  I have rarely had a book put me off so much, so quickly. For me to barely make it 30 pages into a fiction book and find myself too fed up to continue is remarkable. The book failed to capture my interest early on, which is unusual for me.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The writing style is overly quippy and snarky, reminiscent of Marvel movies, which becomes exhausting quickly. The constant attempts at humor, combined with excessive pop culture references, make the narrative feel forced and tiresome.\n\n- **World-Building and Technobabble:**  \n  The book relies heavily on convoluted technobabble, similar to the nonsensical jargon in *Fantastic Planet*. Lines like, \"The Ubiet of Qo. An aretaic sensor of ancient provenance. It was made by a neuroscythe,\" are difficult to parse and rarely clarified. Even when explanations are provided, they are often unhelpful and add to the confusion.\n\n- **Character Development (Anna):**  \n  I found the protagonist, Anna, to be poorly written and inconsistent. Despite being portrayed as traumatized and paranoid due to her past experiences in Kurdistan, she acts recklessly and illogically. For example, when faced with an alien bomb, she inexplicably pokes it, which undermines her credibility as a character.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The beginning of the book, which is supposedly the strongest part according to other reviews, failed to engage me. If this is the high point, it suggests that the rest of the story does not improve, which is disappointing.\n\n- **Potential and Execution:**  \n  There were some elements in the book that had potential, but they were overshadowed by the convoluted and poorly executed presentation. The promising aspects were lost in the overwhelming flaws of the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Exordia* was a frustrating read for me. The combination of exhausting humor, confusing technobabble, and an inconsistent protagonist made it difficult to engage with the story. While there were glimpses of potential, they were not enough to salvage the overall experience. I ultimately decided not to finish the book, as it failed to hold my interest or provide a compelling narrative.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nIf I were to rate this book, I would give it a single star, as the beginning—which is supposedly the best part—was already a struggle to get through."

            "The book opens strong with an intriguing premise featuring Anna, a Kurdish refugee, who teams up with an alien named Ssrin to unravel the mystery of The Blackbird. However, Part 2 transitions to a militaristic sci-fi narrative focused on new main characters, Eric and Clayton. Although the complex plot and tech jargon posed some challenges, the enigma of The Blackbird kept me engaged. Unfortunately, the second half became excessively action-driven and repetitive, leading to a bloated pacing. I believe cutting approximately 200 pages would significantly enhance the flow without sacrificing substance.",
            "Anna's backstory and her dynamic with Ssrin were compelling, but the introduction of Eric and Clayton in Part 2 diluted the focus. Their childhood friendship and contrasting roles added depth, yet the character development felt stretched across too many characters.

However, the story shifts in Part 2 to a militaristic science fiction narrative with new main characters, Eric and Clayton. While the complex plot and technojargon were challenging, the mystery surrounding The Blackbird kept me engaged. Unfortunately, the second half became overly action-heavy and repetitive, making the pacing feel bloated. I believe cutting about 8 hours (or 200 pages) would have improved the flow without losing much substance.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Anna’s backstory and her dynamic with Ssrin were compelling, but the introduction of Eric and Clayton in Part 2 diluted the focus. While their childhood friendship and opposing roles added depth, the character development felt spread thin across the large cast. Some of this development could have been saved for a sequel to streamline the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Ambition:**  \n  The author’s ambitious ideas and world-building are commendable. The concept of The Blackbird, the alien conflict, and the high-stakes plot were intriguing. However, the complexity of the technojargon and the sheer scale of the story sometimes made it difficult to fully grasp.  \n\n- **Series Potential vs. Standalone:**  \n  I initially thought this was a standalone novel, but it ends on a cliffhanger, setting up for a series. While I see the potential for future books, I think the story would have been stronger as a standalone. I’m curious about what happens next but will wait for reviews or until the series is complete before continuing.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author is a skilled writer with a lot of interesting ideas.

            "The book's ending feels abrupt and clearly sets the stage for a sequel, a trend I've noticed in several titles this year. While I don't mind this approach, I believe it should be clearly marketed as the first part of a series. The absence of a complete story arc costs it a star in my rating. However, the narrative takes unexpected turns, including the near-total nuclear destruction of Earth and the protagonists' unconventional failures, which add depth and intrigue. The book resonates thematically with other dark sci-fi works like *Blindsight* by Peter Watts, *Alien*, *Fever House* by Keith Rosson, and *The Gone World* by Tom Sweterlitsch.",
            "In this thought-provoking narrative, Anna Sinjari, a Kurdish refugee in New York, confronts her personal struggles while resisting therapy. Her complex relationship with Ssrin, a multi-headed snake-like alien, propels the story forward. The book tackles heavy themes such as moral justifications, rationalizations, and the repercussions of violent choices. Rather than offering a feel-good experience, it presents a military-focused, nihilistic exploration of humanity's insignificance in a hostile universe.",
            "Set against the backdrop of the Obama administration, this book presents an intriguing and distinctive choice for its time period. As an expansion of a short story, certain setting decisions feel thoughtfully developed. The alien politics are intricately crafted and vividly realized, reminiscent of H.R. Giger's work, which adds a compelling layer of complexity and intrigue to the narrative."

While I don’t inherently dislike this approach, I feel it should be transparently marketed as \"part one of the Exordia series.\" The lack of a complete story arc deducts a star from my rating.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The book is set during the Obama administration, which is an interesting and unique choice. It’s an expansion of a short story, which might explain some of the setting decisions. The alien politics are intricate and vividly realized, described as \"Byzantine via H.R. Geiger,\" adding a layer of complexity and intrigue to the narrative.  \n\n- **Characters and Themes:**  \n  The protagonist, Anna Sinjari, is a Kurdish refugee living in New York, grappling with personal struggles and refusing therapy. Her dynamic with Ssrin, a multi-headed snake-like alien, drives the story. The book explores heavy, dark themes, including moral justifications, rationalizations, and the consequences of violent choices. It’s not feel-good sci-fi but rather a military-heavy, nihilistic narrative that delves into humanity’s insignificance in a hostile universe.  \n\n- **Plot and Uniqueness:**  \n  The story takes unexpected turns, such as the near-total nuclear destruction of Earth and the protagonists’ failure to achieve their goals in a conventional sense. These choices are refreshingly unconventional and add depth to the narrative. The book shares thematic similarities with other dark sci-fi works like *Blindsight* by Peter Watts, *Alien*, *Fever House* by Keith Rosson, and *The Gone World* by Tom Sweterlitsch.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a complex, dark, and thought-provoking sci-fi novel with richly realized characters and intricate alien politics.

            "While I found the characters and plot unappealing, I remained curious about the direction of the story. The book felt like a collection of intriguing ideas that collided on the pages, resulting in numerous beginnings but few satisfying conclusions. The pacing was inconsistent, alternating between slow stretches and bursts of action.",
            "The book is entertaining in its oddness, but it isn’t well-written. While the author demonstrates considerable research, the information often feels overwhelming and disorganized, covering topics such as U.S. government acronyms, Kurdish political history, and theoretical math and physics in a haphazard manner. The inconsistent use of multiple languages is frustrating; for example, Chinese is presented in pinyin like a beginner’s textbook, while Arabic letters appear on the same page. Additionally, the book is excessively long, with tiny font sizes that make reading tedious. Pacing issues further contribute to an uneven and exhausting experience. Sticking to a single tone—whether parody or seriousness—would have greatly enhanced the narrative.",

I really wanted to like this book more than I actually did.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  The book has some fascinating concepts and incredibly compelling characters. It features some of the best handling of memetic hazards I've seen in fiction. The prose is excellent, the imagery is vivid, and it sparkles with moments of brilliant wit.  \n\n- **Flaws:**  \n  1. **Emotional Tone:**  \n     The book is overwhelmingly miserable. It takes the grimmest parts of the Baru Cormorant books and doubles them. Positive emotions are so rare that they can practically be counted on your fingers, which makes the reading experience exhausting.  \n  2. **Pacing and Structure:**  \n     The book feels slow despite the high, apocalyptic stakes and a specified time limit. This is largely due to the author's decision to frequently switch points of view, providing multiple perspectives on the same events. While this technique makes the characters memorable and believable, it also means that not much actually happens. Each event is dissected so thoroughly that by the time the next plot beat arrives, I was heartily sick of reading about the previous one.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  When I started the book, I was excited to finish it because of its promise and wonderful ideas. However, by the end, I was fed up and glad it was over. I can't call it bad—it's too fine a piece of writing for that—but I did not actually enjoy the experience overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book is well-written with compelling characters and fascinating concepts, its unrelenting misery and slow pacing made the reading experience exhausting and ultimately unenjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the hard-hitting emotions and complex characters that define Dickinson's writing are still present.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The book features a completely different setting and societal expectations compared to Dickinson's previous works.

Each party is composed of individuals who act and are acted upon, adding layers to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Stakes:**  \n  The stakes are both personal and existential, with the two being intertwined through the early-established concept of universal, fated relationships.

Ssrin, in particular, stands out as a character who is both deeply alien and intimately familiar, making her actions consistently compelling.  \n\n- **Engagement and Length:**  \n  Despite being a 400-page \"chonker\" of a book, it was so engaging that I read it in a single day and still wanted more. The tension and character depth injected into even short scenes were highlights of the crafting.  \n\n- **Potential for a Series:**  \n  The book feels like the beginning of a brilliant series, not just for the protagonists but also for the greater world it introduces.

A couple fewer complications at the climax, and this would have been a solid five-star read for sure.  \n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  This story explored many ethical and philosophical disputes, with a core theme revolving around what it means to be coerced into committing acts of violence.

It’s a fun read, but it’s also about genocide, nuclear war, and aliens that embody evil.  \n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  I wouldn’t automatically recommend this to fans of the *Baru Cormorant* series, though there’s some thematic crossover (war, violence, moral ambiguity). That said, I had a great time reading it. (Is this a series? It’s gotta be a series, right?)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a gripping, thought-provoking, and darkly enjoyable read. While the pacing faltered slightly toward the end, the book’s exploration of violence, its morally complex characters, and its blend of fun and tragedy made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5 (rounded to 4 stars due to the slightly laggy ending)."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The book opens with a fascinating premise: Anna Sinjari, a genocide survivor turned office worker, makes first contact with an eight-headed alien in Central Park. This sets the stage for an alien war over something called Blackbird, with humans caught in the middle. The concept is strong and intriguing, but the story becomes overly complicated, resembling a \"trolley problem\" that left me questioning what I had just read.  \n\n- **Character Focus and Development:**  \n  While Anna’s introduction is compelling, the story loses its way by shifting focus to other characters. This detracts from the emotional connection and depth that could have been developed with Anna as the central figure.  \n\n- **Scientific and Military Elements:**  \n  The book delves deeply into hard science and military jargon, which, while impressive, can feel overwhelming and detract from the narrative flow. This heavy focus on technical details made the story less accessible and harder to follow.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  At over 26 hours in the audiobook format, the story feels unnecessarily long. While the narrator, Sulin Hasso, does an excellent job, the book could have benefited from tighter editing to improve pacing and allow readers to absorb the implications of the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Introspection:**  \n  The book attempts to provoke introspection while maintaining a fast-paced action narrative. However, it doesn’t give readers enough time to reflect on the deeper implications before moving on to the next plot point.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I believe this book has a very specific audience that will truly appreciate its complexity and depth. While I enjoyed many elements, I don’t think I fall into that camp of readers who will love it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Exordia* by Seth Dickinson is a novel with a strong and intriguing premise, but its execution falters due to an overly complicated plot, excessive focus on technical details, and uneven pacing.

            "The book shifts to the perspective of a character who comes off as deliberately aloof, written in a gonzo journalism style reminiscent of a TC Boyle character. Unfortunately, I’m not connecting with it. The narrative feels rushed and disjointed, even at just page 60. My unfiltered opinion is that it reads like someone very intelligent indulged in edibles and attempted to be profound without considering the reader's enjoyment. It exudes a stoner vibe that takes me back to college and my struggles with *Broom of the System*.",

            "The abstract science magic feels ungrounded and confusing. While the ideas are grand and imaginative, they lack a relatable reality. There's insufficient magic and an overwhelming focus on science. Both elements operate on a Pokémon card logic, adapting effortlessly to fit the plot without genuine consequences.",

The latter feel unnecessary since the end state and major developments are already known.  \n  - The American military/government characters are one-dimensional and grating, though this may be intentional to serve the plot's soul metaphysics. The Iranian pilot is also one-dimensional but less irritating.  \n\n- **Praises:**  \n  - The aliens feel genuinely alien, and the world-building is well-executed without feeling underexplained.  \n  - The Anna/Ssrin dynamic, though appearing only occasionally, is a highlight, as are the moments involving the antagonist alien.  \n  - The book excels at maintaining tension and employing a potentially unreliable narrator, keeping the fates of characters uncertain and engaging.  \n\n- **Desire for a Sequel:**  \n  - While there is interest in exploring more stories in this universe with these characters, there is no desire to revisit the Erik/Clayton storyline.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book offers a strong start with its dark absurdist comedy and compelling characters like Ssrin, but its excessive length, achronological structure, and one-dimensional human characters detract from the overall experience.

This was going to be a fun ride into the unknown. The story of Anna, a Kurd, a survivor of a genocide, and an alien had to be told. It was written in the book: the Universe is about stories. They matter. I couldn't put the book down; I needed to understand what was going on and what Anna's deal was. Why she doesn't fit anywhere? And I was in awe of the prose. I was sure this would be a perfect book I will cherish for years to come.\n\n- **Ambitious Themes and Execution:**  \n  The book is ambitious. It's bending the usual alien invasion story, mixing it with a heavy tone of political critique towards the USA's international policies, Kurdish history, and science.

All the personal duress could be shown faster to have the same impact. This book feels like someone couldn't kill the darlings at the editing round.\n\n- **Overall Disappointment:**  \n  It wasn't. I seldom write book reviews like this one, but I'm confused. This could have been a great book, but something happened to it. I'm sure of it. I'm so sad. This could have been a perfect book, ticking all the boxes I love.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had the potential to be a perfect read for me, with its ambitious themes and initial promise. However, its execution fell short due to disengaging characters, poor pacing, and a lack of focus. While I appreciated its political critique and Anna's complexity, the story's prolonged and unfocused narrative left me disappointed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the prose was impressive, the physics concepts felt superficial and poorly integrated. It seemed like the author borrowed broad ideas without a solid grasp of their mathematical foundations or how they fit together, which detracted from the story’s credibility.\n\n- **Intertextuality and References:**  \n  I was pleasantly surprised by the numerous references to other books and media, such as *Outer Wilds*, Jeff Vandermeer’s *Southern Reach*, Michael Crichton, Junji Ito’s *Uzumaki*, Cixin Liu’s *Three Body Problem*, Ted Chiang’s *Story of Your Life*, and Sylvain Neuvel’s works.

While I usually enjoy this in science fiction—like Andy Weir’s work, where he takes complicated concepts and integrates them into personal and intimate stories—here, it felt overwhelming.

The narrative felt diluted by the sheer volume of elements, which detracted from the intimacy I was hoping for.\n\n- **Author’s Effort and Potential:**  \n  I can see the amount of care Seth has put into this narrative, and it hurts me as a fan of his and a writer to critique it.

The theme of sacrificing a few to save many is central and is one of the best portrayals of evil I’ve ever encountered.\n\n- **Genre and Execution:**  \n  The story evolves into military science fiction early on, which is typically not easy or pleasant to read. However, this book stands out as hardcore, tragic, and deeply disturbing. It’s not a light, heroic war tale but a savage and heartbreaking narrative that feels all too realistic. The concept of manufactured consent as a tool of warfare is particularly striking and serious.\n\n- **Realism and Complexity:**  \n  The novel is fascinatingly complex, grounded in real-world considerations that make it feel uncomfortably close to reality.

However, once the story picks up again, it becomes super propulsive and engaging.\n\n- **World-Building and Concepts:**  \n  I loved the novel’s cosmology and theodicy, as well as the unique concept of achieving faster-than-light travel by moving through moral states. The explicit comparisons between alien tactics and the US military were fascinating, and the narrative causality—where the novel acknowledges its status as a story—added a clever meta layer. The mechanistic reason for why a small battle in an Earth village matters to technologically advanced aliens was a standout element.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters were nuanced and beautifully depicted, but there were simply too many of them for me to care about each one. I would have preferred fewer characters and more focus on the aliens, who were particularly intriguing.\n\n- **Potential for Sequels:**  \n  The book feels like it’s setting up an inevitable sequel, and I hope it includes more alien perspectives and exploration of the fascinating concepts introduced in this novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has a strong start and an exciting conclusion, the middle section suffers from pacing issues and an overabundance of characters. Despite these flaws, the world-building, unique concepts, and clever narrative elements make it a memorable read. I’m eager to see where the story goes in future installments.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story evolved significantly from its original conception as a short story, growing into a complex narrative with rich layers of content and characters. This expansion felt organic, akin to the work of a meticulous gardener.\n\n- **Science and Math Integration:**  \n  The science in the novel is quite hard in terms of plausibility, while the math is hard-adjacent. Some readers might find the density of these elements overwhelming, but I found them thoroughly enjoyable. Concepts like pink noise were particularly intriguing, and the infusion of \"magic hand-wavery\" was wonderfully conceived, adding depth to the sci-fi elements.\n\n- **World-Building and Conceptual Handling:**  \n  The story incorporates complex ideas such as souls, the aretea, and the founding gods of the universe. These concepts are semantically bundled and presented as translations of alien ideas, which I found to be a clever approach. As an atheist, I appreciated how Dickinson provided a tool to render these ideas into something humanly inconceivable, making them more accessible.\n\n- **Character Development and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The narrative structure, from the setup to the subsequent acts, demonstrates Dickinson's careful planning and attention to detail. The story grows in both content and characters, reminiscent of GRR Martin's ethic, but remains faithful and meticulous in its execution.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Despite its complexity and the density of its scientific and mathematical elements, the story was engaging and well-crafted.

However, the large cast of characters, particularly the female ones, was occasionally confusing, especially in the audiobook format. Despite this, the story’s depth and potential for a series left me eager to explore more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

However, I must acknowledge that Sulin Hasso did an excellent job with the narration.\n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  If you're looking for early 2000s-style first contact stories that delve into PTSD with a dark humorous tone (similar to the first part of *Exordia*), I recommend Lindsay Ellis' *Noumena* trilogy. For eldritch horror aliens using humans for their own means, Premee Mohamed's *Beneath the Rising* trilogy offers creepy body horror and better character development.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a promising start, the novel failed to hold my interest due to its generic military sci-fi plot and dated feel.

As a Filipino-Ugandan in a science fiction setting, she made me feel seen, even though I don’t share her background or expertise in physics. Her unapologetic use of Tagalog, even without context, resonated deeply with me and filled my heart. While some Tagalog phrases felt out of place for the book's setting, I can overlook that.

Later, it slows down significantly with flashbacks, lost scenes, and meandering dissertations, making it feel like waiting for the sloth in *Zootopia* to answer a question.  \n- **Concept:**  \n  The book has a SUPER intriguing and unique concept that impressed me.  \n- **Execution:**  \n  While the concept is strong, the execution is inconsistent, with extreme shifts in pacing that detract from the overall experience.  \n- **Engagement:**  \n  The book kept me engaged enough to finish it, but the uneven pacing made it a mixed experience.  \n- **Spoiler (Minor):**  \n  Trust no one, especially talking snakes. It’s a lesson that seems to echo biblical themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had the potential to be either a 1-star or a 5-star read due to its unique concept and uneven pacing. While I was impressed by the intriguing idea, the inconsistent execution—ranging from too fast to too slow—left me with a mixed impression. Ultimately, it’s a 3-star read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

Similarly, the random facts that Clayton likes to spew were intriguing but didn’t add substantial value to the story.\n\n- **Handling of Major Events:**  \n  Some major events involving key characters, like Anna being thrown into literal hell, were brushed off as if nothing significant happened.

It definitely requires brain energy to fully engage with the material.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  I love how blisteringly critical the book is of America’s war crimes in the Middle East. It directly implicates Obama, which was something I wasn’t expecting in a first-contact alien sci-fi novel. Seth Dickinson doesn’t shy away from tackling heavy, relevant issues.\n\n- **Author’s Skill and Appeal:**  \n  Seth Dickinson really goes there with his storytelling, and I’d read anything he writes at this point. His ability to weave complex ideas with bold themes is impressive.\n\n- **Comparisons and Genre Blend:**  \n  The novel feels like a blend of *The Three-Body Problem*, *Venom*, and *The Sympathizer*. It’s a unique mix of hard sci-fi, sharp social critique, and gripping narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a bold, intellectually demanding novel that combines hard sci-fi with incisive social commentary. While some parts were challenging to fully grasp, the book’s fearless exploration of heavy themes and its unique blend of genres make it a standout read. Seth Dickinson’s writing is compelling and thought-provoking, leaving me eager to explore more of his work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, despite its complexity, I found it enjoyable.  \n\n- **Engagement and Experience:**  \n  The narrative felt like riding a wave—there were moments where I felt pummeled by the intensity or confusion, but making it through to the other side left me eager to dive back into Mr. Dickinson’s wild ride.  \n\n- **Contextual Influence:**  \n  Reading Kaveh Akbar’s *Martyr!* right before starting *Exordia* heightened my experience, and I’d recommend others do the same to enhance their engagement with the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its challenging and often perplexing nature, *Exordia* was an enjoyable and immersive read. The experience was enriched by the context of having read *Martyr!* beforehand, and the book’s intensity left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The biological concepts presented are quite elementary and oversimplified, lacking depth. While I am not a professional mathematician, I suspect the mathematical elements of the story may also be similarly flawed or underdeveloped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel begins with a strong and engaging first chapter, it struggles to maintain its momentum due to its overly complex narrative and uneven pacing. Additionally, the accuracy and depth of the scientific content leave much to be desired, detracting from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Dickinson’s ability to create cultures with such depth and specificity is rare and highly commendable.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the novel is well-written, the hard science fiction elements were occasionally difficult to follow. This complexity led to moments where my attention wandered, affecting my overall engagement with the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is very well-written, with standout strengths in character development and world-building. However, the complexity of the hard science fiction concepts and occasional pacing issues slightly hindered my full immersion in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Anna is a brilliant anti-hero, and the world-building is excellent. It’s literally breath-taking in its onslaught of facts and nods to other writers.  \n\n- **Pacing, Mood, Characters, and Plot:**  \n  The pace, mood, characters, and plot are fairly riveting.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book makes fantastic points about man’s inhumanity to man, particularly toward women and children, who are always the greatest victims. This theme is blended well into the personal, individual choices we all make and how these contribute to the world we live in.  \n\n- **Length and Overindulgence:**  \n  The book was about 200 pages too long. While the science stuff was undeniably interesting (and puts most sci-fi books and movies about aliens attacking Earth firmly in their schlock-fiction places), it became excessive. Additionally, the constant moral agonizing of Erik and Clayton felt belabored.  \n\n- **Middle Section Critique:**  \n  I’d cut a good chunk out of the middle of the book. While I understand the author was trying to make a point about the Kurdish Anfal, the repetition felt unnecessary.  \n\n- **Ending and Sequel Potential:**  \n  Dickinson retrieves the baton in the latter quarter of the book, and the ending was excellent—both devastating and thought-provoking. It’s a real hook for what will surely be a sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its excessive length and some overindulgent sections, the book delivers a compelling premise, strong characters, and excellent world-building. The ending is particularly impactful, leaving me eager for a potential sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nMy thanks to NetGalley for the DRC.

The plot shifts perspectives and unfolds gradually, introducing a range of characters while deepening world-building and character development.
