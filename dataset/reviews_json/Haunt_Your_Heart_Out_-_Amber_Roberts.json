            "The plot juxtaposes her love for the town with her unhappiness, resulting in a disjointed narrative. The subplot involving fake ghosts feels contrived, particularly since she fabricates them to secure the bookstore. While the happily ever after (HEA) conclusion is predictable, it feels out of place due to the unresolved tension in her character arc.",
            "The female protagonist (FMC) works at a bookstore, a cliché that fails to add depth to her character. Although she claims to love her job, the lack of creative freedom makes it feel like a dead end. Her abandonment issues are central to the narrative, but they render her unrelatable as she vilifies her parents, who merely want to connect with her. Her choice to remain in a town that emphasizes her loneliness and limited opportunities feels contradictory; a more compelling arc would have involved her leaving to explore the world. The male protagonist (MMC) is adequate but forgettable, and their relationship, rooted in the strangers-to-lovers trope, lacks depth. The film's kink scene feels unnecessary and detracts from the story. While the book includes mental health representation, the protagonist's struggles are neither fully explored nor resolved. Additionally, the bi/pan representation is present but does not significantly influence the story or character dynamics.",

            "The story has moments of slow pacing that somewhat detract from the overall experience. Additionally, the lack of communication between characters toward the end feels unnatural, especially when compared to their earlier, more direct exchanges. Nevertheless, the narrative is heartwarming, beautifully intertwining the spirits of Halloween and Christmas. It follows Lex, who resides in a small town away from her family, grappling with anxieties since her teenage years while learning to manage them over time. Lex cherishes her life in her grandfather’s memory-laden house, despite financial strain, and finds solace in her work at a bookstore, where her love for literature flourishes, even as she struggles with the owner’s resistance to her improvement ideas. Her stable world is upended, however, with the arrival of James.",

The narrative centers on Lex, a thirty-something woman working in a local bookstore, who encounters James, a paranormal documentary filmmaker exploring ghost stories in Stowe. Initially, Lex is wary of James’ charm, aware that tourists often depart. However, as their relationship evolves, she starts to reevaluate her life choices.",
            "This story offers a refreshing perspective with a female main character (FMC) in her thirties, a change from the typical early-twenties protagonists found in many romance novels. The LGBTQ+ representation is commendable, featuring Lex as pansexual and James as bisexual. Initially, Lex and James share a strong chemistry, but this seems to wane as the narrative unfolds. While the third-act breakup diverges from conventional romance tropes, the resolution feels rushed, and James’ final decision, though satisfying, comes across as abrupt given the story's development.",

            "The plot's uneven pacing hindered my engagement with the story. Many miscommunications and misinterpretations felt contrived, seemingly included just to propel the narrative toward its conclusion rather than serving a meaningful purpose. This disjointedness slowed the book down significantly. While the story does end on a happy note, its predictability and awkward pacing rendered it somewhat redundant by the time I reached the finish.",
            "I appreciated the authentic portrayal of anxiety in the female protagonist, Alex. Her struggles felt genuine and often uncomfortable, which I found compelling, even if some readers might deem her 'unlikeable' for it. The chemistry between the two main characters began strong but diminished toward the end. By the 30% mark, it felt as though the climax of their relationship had already occurred, leaving the latter part of the story lacking in emotional depth.",
            "The setting, reminiscent of Stars Hollow and featuring an expansive cemetery, added a distinctive charm to the story. The exploration of themes surrounding a woman in her 30s searching for a sense of home resonated deeply with me."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the novel excels in its authentic representation of anxiety and its exploration of themes like belonging and identity. However, the uneven pacing, lack of sustained character chemistry, and predictable ending detracted from the overall experience.",

It was very truthful and often felt uncomfortable, which I appreciated. I imagine some readers might label her as ‘unlikeable’ for this reason, but I found it authentic and compelling.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot felt unevenly paced, which made it difficult to stay engaged. Many moments, miscommunications, and misinterpretations seemed thrown in just to move the story toward the end, rather than serving a meaningful purpose. This slowed the book down and made the narrative feel disjointed.  \n\n- **Character Chemistry:**  \n  The chemistry between the two main characters started strong but fizzled out toward the end. It almost felt like the climax of their relationship had already happened by the 30% mark, which left the latter part of the story lacking in emotional depth.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The story does conclude with a happy ending, but its predictability and the strange pacing made it feel redundant by the time I reached the end.  \n\n- **Setting and Themes:**  \n  The setting, a town reminiscent of Stars Hollow with a giant cemetery, added a unique charm to the story. The themes of a 30+ pan woman searching for home were well-explored and resonated with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel excels in its authentic representation of anxiety and its exploration of themes like belonging and identity.

            "I was initially drawn to the book by its unique premise: a romance novel centered around ghost hunters. While the beginning was engaging, the story eventually dragged on longer than necessary. Once the main characters were together, the narrative lost its momentum, becoming repetitive and dull. Additionally, frequent miscommunications among the characters contributed to an overall sense of frustration.",

            "The argument between Lex and James was unsatisfying, lacking depth and emotional resonance, leaving too much unaddressed. The resolution felt rushed and hollow, particularly with James's gesture and admission. Their quick reconciliation in the final 20% of the book was disappointing and diminished the tension built earlier.",
            "Lex is a brilliantly crafted character, and I felt a strong connection to her, particularly in her interactions with her family. The development of her relationships with her sister and parents was gradual and authentic. While other characters, like James, were heartwarming and relatable, they didn't have the same depth as Lex.",
            "The town exuded a cozy, authentic charm, fostering a strong sense of community where everyone looked out for one another. Although it occasionally veered into Hallmark territory, it delivered the warmth I sought in this light-hearted romance featuring ghosts."

        "conclusion": "This book had a promising start with sweet moments, well-developed characters, and a cosy setting.

The characters and the dynamics felt promising, and I was invested in the relationship between Lex and James.  \n\n- **Conflict Development:**  \n  As the story progressed, the lies between Lex and James grew bigger, and I became uncertain about how the conflict would be resolved. This uncertainty created a sense of dread that the story might lose its brilliance.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Development:**  \n  Lex is a brilliant character. I felt deeply connected to her, especially in her interactions with her family. The gradual and believable steps in her relationships with her sister and parents were well-executed. The other characters, including James, were heartwarming and believable, though not as fleshed out as Lex.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The town felt cosy and authentic, with a sense of community where everyone looked out for each other. While it leaned a bit too Hallmark at times, it provided the warmth I needed in this light-hearted romance with ghosts.  \n\n- **Conflict Resolution:**  \n  The argument between Lex and James felt unsatisfactory. It lacked depth and emotional impact, with too much left unsaid. The resolution felt rushed and hollow, especially with James’s gesture and admission. The ease with which they made up in the final 20% of the book was disappointing and undermined the earlier tension.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the strong start and engaging characters, the ending was a let-down. The rushed and unconvincing resolution between Lex and James overshadowed the book’s strengths.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a promising start with sweet moments, well-developed characters, and a cosy setting. However, the unsatisfactory conflict resolution between the main characters, particularly the rushed and hollow ending, significantly detracted from the overall experience.
