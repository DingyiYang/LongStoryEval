            "Persephone is a strong, intelligent character who defies the typical damsel-in-distress trope, which I greatly appreciated. The author skillfully portrays her as someone who is clear about her desires, understands her boundaries, and knows when to assert herself or step back. Her awareness of the contrasts between her world and Hades’ is well-executed, and she fully grasps the significance of her role. She has quickly become one of my favorite characters in literature.\n\nHades is also depicted in a refreshingly nuanced way, moving beyond traditional portrayals. He is cautious, introspective, and constantly reflects on his past mistakes to avoid repeating them. His respect for Persephone’s power and his unwavering support for her add depth to his character, making him more than just a flirty or secondary figure. This portrayal enriches the narrative and enhances the dynamic between the two characters."

I appreciated the author’s explanation of how this book would take the original story and spin it into something entirely different, giving Persephone agency and reversing roles in a more modern setting.  \n\n- **Plot and Reimagining:**  \n  While I liked the concept, I felt the plot could have gone further in its reimagining. I compared it to works like *ACOTAR* (a reimagining of *Beauty and the Beast*) or *For the Wolf* (which blends *Red Riding Hood* and *Beauty and the Beast*), and wished this book had pushed the boundaries similarly.  \n\n- **Time Scale and World-Building:**  \n  The occasional mention of events happening in other decades and Persephone’s scheming over centuries confused me. Since humans don’t think on the same time scales as gods, this aspect made me feel disconnected from the story and characters. I think avoiding explicit dates or time spans and instead alluding to them more generally would have worked better.  \n\n- **Characters and Romance:**  \n  I enjoyed the characters and found the book to be a quick read. The romance was sweet and well-developed, with funny and engaging side characters. However, readers looking for a retelling in the style of Madeline Miller, Natalie Haynes, or Rosie Hewlett might not find what they’re seeking here, as this book takes the original story in a completely different direction rather than adding another perspective.  \n\n- **Investment in the Story:**  \n  Overall, I’m not sure I’m invested enough in the fate of these characters to want to read the sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Courting the Underworld* offers a fresh take on the Hades and Persephone myth with a modern twist and engaging characters, it falls short of fully embracing its reimagining potential. The handling of time scales and the lack of deeper innovation in the plot left me somewhat disconnected. It’s a sweet romance with enjoyable side characters, but it may not satisfy readers seeking a more traditional or profound retelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars."
