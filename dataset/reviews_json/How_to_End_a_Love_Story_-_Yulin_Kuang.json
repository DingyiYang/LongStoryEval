            "The novel centers on Helen Zhang, a successful YA author, and Grant Shepard, a screenwriter, whose lives converge following a tragic event involving Helen's sister, Michelle. A decade later, they reunite in a writers' room, where the narrative expertly weaves romantic tension with complex family dynamics, resulting in a profoundly emotional experience.",
            "The author demonstrates exceptional emotional intelligence and a masterful command of \"show, don’t tell.\" Their ability to evoke profound emotions within just 300 pages is truly remarkable. It's no wonder she landed a seven-figure deal for her first three books, as I believe she will become a significant voice in the romance community. Her writing is witty, tender, and infused with delicious angst. The novel is an emotional roller coaster that explores themes of love, vulnerability, and acceptance. The portrayal of Helen's relationship with her mother and her struggle to honor Michelle's memory while forging her own path is particularly moving. I eagerly await her next work.",
            "The book offers a beautifully vulnerable exploration of love in its various forms. A standout moment is the couch scene, which masterfully weaves sensuality with intimacy and respect. This scene echoes the church moment in *Alone with You in the Ether* and Rodin's cathedral sculpture. The author’s emotional intelligence allowed me to feel profoundly seen and connected to the characters.",
            "While I’ve never considered myself a romance enthusiast, this book truly resonated with me. I find chick-lit to be emotionally insightful and genuinely relatable, and this book stands out as a remarkable addition to the genre. It has quickly become one of my all-time favorites."

It explores love, family, and personal growth in a way that feels both intimate and universal. The author's writing is a revelation, and this book has firmly established itself as one of my all-time favorites. I am excited to see what she creates next.",

            "The third-act conflict transcends the typical breakup-and-reunion trope, focusing instead on Helen's struggle with emotional vulnerability. The resolution is compelling, as she ultimately confronts her feelings and what it means to allow Grant into her life.",
            "The author skillfully employs the writers’ room setting and the adaptation process of Helen’s book to parallel Helen and Grant’s relationship. This mirrored approach feels authentic, though some readers argue that the romance develops too quickly. I, however, found it effective. While the book contains more sex scenes than I usually enjoy, they are thoughtfully executed. These moments underscore the theme of emotional vulnerability, illustrating that for Helen, being physically intimate is less important than allowing herself to be emotionally open with Grant.",
            "Set against the vibrant backdrop of Hollywood, this story follows Helen, a YA author whose bestselling series is being adapted into a TV show. As she transitions to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter for the first time, she collaborates with others and witnesses her beloved characters come to life. However, her journey is complicated by the presence of Grant, a man from her past with intricate ties to her family.",
            "The audiobook opens with a necessary content warning about grief, given its intense beginning. The first chapter occurs thirteen years before the main narrative, featuring Helen at her sister’s funeral. Her sister's suicide—prompted by stepping into traffic—connects to Grant, the driver involved in the incident. This premise initially raised my doubts about the story's potential for romance; however, the author's skillful writing effectively navigates this delicate territory.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Discovery and Context of the Book:**  \n   - I discovered this book through Libro.fm, which was a blessing because it wasn’t initially on my radar. I later learned it was a Book of the Month (BOTM) selection, and the publisher heavily promotes Yulin Kuang’s connection to adaptations of Emily Henry’s work. Personally, I think Kuang is surpassing Henry in the adult romance genre.  \n\n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n   - The story is set in Hollywood, which I absolutely love. It follows Helen, a YA author whose bestselling series is being adapted into a TV show. She moves to LA to work as a screenwriter for the first time, collaborating with others and seeing her characters come to life. The only obstacle is Grant, a man from her past with complicated ties to her family.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n   - The audiobook included a content warning about grief, which was necessary given the heavy opening. The first chapter takes place thirteen years before the main story, at Helen’s sister’s funeral. Her sister’s suicide (likely caused by stepping into traffic) is tied to Grant, who was the driver of the car that struck her. This setup made me skeptical about how the story could evolve into a romance, but Kuang’s writing skillfully navigated this challenge.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n   - Kuang cleverly uses the writers’ room setting and the process of adapting a romance from Helen’s book to the show as a template for Helen and Grant’s relationship. This mirrored approach felt believable to me, though some reviewers felt the romance developed too suddenly. I disagree—it worked well for me.  \n\n- **Intimacy and Emotional Vulnerability:**  \n   - The book includes more sex scenes than I typically prefer, but they were handled thoughtfully. The scenes tied back to the theme of emotional vulnerability, showing that for Helen, physical intimacy wasn’t as significant as allowing herself to be emotionally open with Grant.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n   - The third-act conflict isn’t a typical breakup-and-reunion trope. Instead, it’s a culmination of Helen’s avoidance of emotional vulnerability. The resolution is compelling, as Helen finally confronts her feelings and what it means to let Grant into her life.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n   - I was completely gripped by this book. Kuang’s debut is excellent, and I’m eager to read more from her, though I’m unsure if her busy schedule as a screenwriter and director will allow for another book anytime soon.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a standout in the adult romance genre, blending Hollywood intrigue, complex emotional themes, and a believable romance. Yulin Kuang’s writing is skillful and compelling, making this a memorable debut.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

I was initially apprehensive but found it to be a beautifully written romantic drama.\n\n- **Writing Style and Craftsmanship:**\n   - Yulin Kuang’s background in screenwriting and directing shines through in her ability to craft vivid scenes and dialogue. Her writing often felt cinematic, as if I were watching the story unfold rather than reading it.\n   - Her characterization is particularly strong. The characters, including Helen Zhang, Grant Shepard, their colleagues, and Helen’s parents, are realistic, fully formed, and complex.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Helen Zhang evolves from a serious, awkward teenager to a reserved, career-focused adult, while Grant Shepard’s outward charm masks deeper anxieties and intimacy issues.\n   - The supporting characters, including Helen’s parents and their colleagues, are well-developed and avoid being overly quirky or stereotypical.\n\n- **Use of Tropes:**\n   - The tropes of forced proximity, office romance, and forbidden love are handled skillfully, adding depth to the story without feeling clichéd.\n\n- **Third Act Break-Up:**\n   - The third act break-up was a disappointment. While I understand its necessity for character growth, I found the length and circumstances of the separation to be overly dramatic and somewhat unnecessary, given the existing obstacles in Helen and Grant’s relationship.\n\n- **Overall Themes and Impact:**\n   - The novel is a compelling exploration of vulnerability and forgiveness, leaving a poignant impression. Despite the hiccup with the third act break-up, it remains a smoothly executed and memorable read.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*How to End a Love Story* is a beautifully crafted romantic drama with strong character development and skillful use of tropes. While the third act break-up felt overwrought, the novel’s exploration of vulnerability and forgiveness makes it a standout read.

Typically, I find third-act conflicts frustrating, but this time, Helen’s choices aligned well with her upbringing and character. While the ending felt a bit rushed after all the emotional buildup, I appreciated that both characters recognized they weren’t fully healed—and that was perfectly fine. Not every plot point is neatly resolved, which adds to the story's realism. I particularly enjoyed the final chapter; it provided the montage and highlight reel our hearts needed!",

Bound by tragedy, they share a deep pain, albeit from different perspectives. Helen's struggles with her family, particularly her mother, resonated with me deeply. I found echoes of my own experiences in those scenes, which captured the weight of familial respect, responsibility, guilt, and disappointment in a way that left a lasting impact.",

I couldn’t fathom rooting for a romance under these circumstances.  \n   - I was hooked from the first chapter and didn’t want to put it down.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n   - The story that unfolded was raw and painful and pushed me emotionally.  \n   - It opened discussions within my own family, and I’m still thinking about these characters.  \n   - The angst was almost too much for me at times, but there were sweet and tender moments too.  \n   - How to End a Love Story is a romance, but it’s also a story of family, forgiveness, acceptance, and healing.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - I don’t agree with all the choices Helen and Grant made, but I think the beauty of their love is in the mess.  \n   - These two are forever tied by tragedy and share a pain so similar, but from two different sides.  \n   - Helen’s relationship and struggles with her family, especially her mother, resonated with me so much.  \n   - I saw many of my own life experiences on the page, and I don’t think I can fully articulate what a chokehold those scenes with Helen’s family had on me.  \n   - I could feel the weight of familial respect, responsibility, guilt, and disappointment so profoundly.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - The progression of feelings felt a bit fast, but given the atmosphere and vacuum of the writer's room, I can see how things could unfold that way.  \n   - Normally, the third act conflict frustrates me, but this time, Helen’s decisions felt very in line with her upbringing and character.  \n   - The ending felt a bit rushed after all that angst, but I appreciated that both characters acknowledged that they weren’t 100% healed and that was OK.  \n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Elements:**  \n   - The spice was a great surprise, and I truly didn’t think the book would be as steamy as it was.  \n   - I’m still a bit stunned that the author got me invested in this romance at all.  \n\n- **Realism and Resolution:**  \n   - There isn’t a pretty bow for every plot point, but I think that was more realistic.  \n   - I really enjoyed the final chapter (the montage/highlight reel all our hearts needed LOL).  \n\n- **Content Warnings and Notes:**  \n   - CW (from the author): This story contains on-the-page discussions of complicated grief, suicide loss, and the death of a sibling.  \n   - Other CW's encountered: panic attacks (on page), strained relationship with parents, car accident and hospitalization/injury (on page).  \n   - OW/OM notes: FMC goes on a date with an OM after things have started with the MMC. MMC has an old hometown hookup/friend and is also friendly with an ex. No OW/OM during the separation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHow to End a Love Story is a deeply emotional and complex romance that explores themes of family, forgiveness, and healing. While the angst was intense at times, the tender moments and realistic portrayal of messy love kept me invested. Helen and Grant’s relationship, tied by tragedy, felt authentic, and Helen’s struggles with her family resonated deeply with me. The pacing had its flaws, but the ending, though rushed, was satisfying in its realism. The unexpected spice and the author’s ability to make me root for this unconventional romance were standout elements. I’m eager to see what Yulin Kuang writes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The relationship between Grant Shepard and Helen Zhang is intricately examined, revealing moments of vulnerability and longing. Grant’s creative writing assignment, where he composes poems about the conversations he hopes to have with Helen, underscores his emotional depth and desire. Helen’s internal struggle regarding her ability to love, and whether others perceive this conflict, adds layers to her character. Their dynamic is charged, with Grant oscillating between frustration and adoration; he chooses to spend time with Helen over engaging in mundane activities. Helen feels revered by Grant, and their connection has a poetic quality, encapsulated in the line, “loving him is poetry.”",

The inclusion of Spotify playlists as a narrative device adds a contemporary and relatable element to the story. The tone gracefully oscillates between tenderness, melancholy, and rawness, mirroring the characters' emotional landscapes. Poignant dialogue, such as Grant's admission, “you’re so easy to love,” and Helen's plea, “it’s my birthday. lie to me. treat me like you love me back,” captures the complex dynamics of their relationship, blending affection with an underlying tension.",

Similarly, Helen’s late-night drive, accompanied by a playlist titled “driving away from the stupid damn love of my life,” vividly illustrates her emotional turmoil and yearning. Grant’s raw honesty in wishing to confront someone about their final actions, coupled with his inability to do so, adds depth to the grief and sense of unresolved closure in the story."

The angst, tension, and teasing had me holding my breath, squirming, and kicking my feet. It’s perfect for fans of complicated, emotional love stories.  \n   - The emotional, complicated love story DELIVERED and felt so fresh. The ANGST, tension, and teasing left me breathless, sweating, kicking, and screaming!  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection**  \n   - At first, I didn’t feel a strong connection with Helen, but she grew on me over time. Both Helen and Grant’s stories and psyches were very layered, making this a great read for those who enjoy romances with depth.  \n   - The narrative on immigrant families and the spectrum of how families show love added a lot of depth to the characters.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing**  \n   - The story started a bit slow for me, but I was immediately curious about how Helen and Grant would overcome their past. The slow build kept me on the edge of my seat.  \n   - The forbidden love and slightly enemies-to-lovers dynamic felt fresh and more complicated than typical tropes.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Perspective**  \n   - The book is written in third-person dual POV, which took some getting used to but worked well for the story.  \n   - Yulin’s background in screenwriting made the book play out like a movie in my head, which was a delight.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes**  \n   - I absolutely loved the Asian representation and the exploration of grief from two unique perspectives. It was raw and impactful.  \n   - The themes of forbidden love, workplace romance, and the complexities of family dynamics were well-executed.  \n\n- **Minor Criticisms**  \n   - I felt like I was being led to believe Helen and Grant had a different history in high school, which would have made their shift from hate to curiosity more believable. At times, I thought I was missing a piece of the puzzle that never came.  \n   - There were a few minor reasons why this wasn’t a 5-star read for me (spoilers), but overall, it was a must-read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is an emotional, complicated love story that delivers on angst, tension, and fresh storytelling. While it started slow and had a few minor flaws, the layered characters, unique perspectives on grief, and excellent representation made it a standout romance. It’s a must-read for fans of tortured love, forbidden romance, and stories with depth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

I didn’t find them repetitive or boring, though this might be a personal preference since I’m not always in the mood for steam.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Plans:**  \n  I loved this book and am really curious about how the audiobook will sound, so I’ll probably reread it in that format!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*How to End a Love Story* is a standout romcom that balances angst, tenderness, and depth. Yulin Kuang’s unique writing style, relatable characters, and exploration of heavy themes make this a memorable read. It’s not your typical light romcom but offers a richer, more engaging experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I absolutely loved Helen's character—she was messy, genuine, funny, and relatable. I saw aspects of myself in her, particularly her tendency to listen to others' Spotify playlists instead of creating her own to express her emotions. Her journey as the eldest daughter and her relationship with her parents were central to her development. While I couldn’t entirely relate to the cultural elements, I deeply resonated with her struggles. \n\nGrant was incredible; I don’t think I’ve ever loved a fictional character more. His humor, insecurities, and overall personality were so endearing, especially in how he dealt with the accident. Discovering more about him in each chapter was a delight. \n\nHelen and Grant's relationship felt both rocky and authentic. Their playful banter was refreshing, and the longing and tension between them were superbly portrayed. Watching their emotional barriers fall was gratifying, and their intimate moments made me feel like an intruder simply by reading.",

It included everything I could wish for: complex characters, rich history, significant character development, yearning, angst, tension, and profound emotional depth.",

The way Helen and Grant handled their grief from the loss of Helen’s sister, Michelle, was profound and intricately woven into the story.

To be mine. I love every part of you, you silly, infuriating woman. I love the parts of you I haven’t even met yet.”  \n   - Best Helen line: “She thinks of the infinitely different love stories they could have lived instead—and she decides she’ll write them all. She’ll fracture this feeling into a million shards of glass reflecting back the same, unbelievable love story so she can capture it for the days when she needs to read it back to herself and to him—when they’re sad, or tired, or annoyed, or hurting. Or happy, she reminds herself.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an absolute gem, and I will defend it to the ends of the earth. It’s bold, emotional, and beautifully written, with characters and lines that stay with you long after reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nFive enthusiastic stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Background and Credibility:**  \n  Yulin Kuang is attached to both of Emily Henry’s adaptations—*People We Meet On Vacation* (adapting screenwriter) and *Beach Read* (writer/director). This announcement initially put her on my radar, but her debut novel stands strong on its own and would have been a hit regardless. Her insider knowledge of adapting books to the screen adds authenticity and depth to the story, which I really appreciated.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Spice:**  \n  Some reviews mentioned that the book “wasn’t spicy,” but I found the buildup to the romantic tension incredibly satisfying (the pen scene? hello?!). The slow burn was executed so well that it kept me hooked.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Grief:**  \n  Kuang paints a realistic and nuanced picture of grief—it’s complicated, messy, and not linear. This aspect of the book was just as compelling as the romance, and I appreciated how it was handled with care and authenticity.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book was sad but not overwhelmingly so—it didn’t leave me crying my eyes out, which was exactly what I needed at the time. The emotional balance was perfect for me.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  I highly recommend checking the triggers for this book, as it deals with heavy themes like suicide, mental health/anxiety, and grief.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a fantastic debut novel that combined a slow-burn romance with a heartfelt exploration of grief.

            "Grant is the first to express his feelings for Helen, a gesture that feels both genuine and tender. In contrast, Helen maintains a more guarded and uncertain demeanor. Despite their complex history, their dynamic never feels forced. This is a masterful example of the grumpy x sunshine trope, striking the perfect balance between playful give and take, with one character falling first while the other grapples with vulnerability.",

Its exploration of deep trauma and healing is underscored by heavy themes such as suicide, grief, and panic attacks.

The way Grant wanted and needed Helen was so tangible.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n   - Grant falls first and isn’t afraid to tell Helen what he wants. It’s so genuine and soft.  \n   - Helen is more stand-offish and unsure, but their pairing doesn’t feel forced, even with the circumstances of their past and present.  \n   - THIS is how you do the grumpy x sunshine trope. It’s not too much of either—just the right amount of give and take, with one falling first and the other afraid to admit it.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - Kuang’s writing swept me away. It’s harsh in a whimsical way, an oxymoron of sweet subtle sentences and hard honest dialogue.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - The story is very demanding of all of your emotions. It’s definitely not a romcom but a romantic drama with deep trauma and healing.  \n   - There are heavy overall themes of suicide, grief, and panic attacks.  \n   - The book explores the idea that “loving can hurt, and I want to do it anyway.”  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - One second I’m like okay, and then I’m obsessed with the way they sink deeper into each other’s orbits and forgive themselves for being who they once were.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nYulin Kuang’s debut novel, *How To End A Love Story*, is a masterful blend of yearning, tragedy, and romance that evokes the emotional depth of classic literature while feeling entirely modern. With its compelling characters, raw dialogue, and heavy themes, this book is a deeply emotional journey that demands your full attention and leaves a lasting impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Depth**  \n   - The book focuses on the individuals, Grant and Helen, as much as their relationship.  \n   - Both characters are portrayed as flawed humans with baggage, which adds depth to their personalities.  \n   - Helen’s acknowledgment of her lack of \"health\" and the emphasis on their need for individual growth highlight their complexity.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics**  \n   - The connection between Grant and Helen is rooted in a tragic shared history, which adds layers to their relationship.  \n   - The fact that they aren’t together for much of the book works well, as it allows them to grow individually before coming together.  \n   - The third-act breakup felt necessary for their growth, which is a refreshing take on a common trope.  \n\n- **Themes of Grief and Trauma**  \n   - The book provides a poignant portrayal of grief, particularly when grieving a loved one lost to suicide.  \n   - Helen’s journey involves not only loving Grant but also understanding her family and learning to love them.  \n   - The exploration of trauma from their teenage years adds emotional weight to the story.  \n\n- **Writing and Adaptation**  \n   - Yulin Kuang successfully captures the essence of Emily Henry’s storytelling, particularly in writing romances that center on the people.  \n   - The adaptation feels authentic and true to the original style, making it a compelling read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book resonated deeply with me due to its focus on character growth, realistic relationship dynamics, and its heartfelt exploration of grief and trauma. Yulin Kuang’s adaptation of Emily Henry’s style is masterful, and I’m excited to see what she does next, both in adaptations and original works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I wanted a deeper exploration of how Helen navigated her marriage, especially given the significant impact of her relationship with Grant on her parents. That’s a complex issue that deserved more attention. The premise is quite striking—Helen’s sister committed suicide by jumping in front of Grant’s car—but it ultimately resonated with me. The timeline, where Helen was returning to NYC with an underlying sense of urgency, mirrored the early days of my own relationship with my husband, making Yulin’s writing particularly relatable.",

Helen is introverted and often questions herself, yet she is also ambitious and focused. Her complicated relationship with her parents adds layers to her character. Meanwhile, Grant struggles with anxiety, feeling inadequate in pursuing his dreams, but his vulnerability is truly remarkable. The chemistry between them is palpable, especially in the spicy scenes, which are utterly engaging. ",

Both characters are deeply flawed yet relatable, and their personal growth unfolds as they confront their shared past.

This book was amazing! I was highly anticipating it because the author is involved with upcoming Emily Henry adaptations, directing/writing *Beach Read* and writing for *People We Meet on Vacation*. A debut Asian romance author making moves in the film industry is so exciting!  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Helen and Grant, two writers who are forced to work together after not seeing each other since their teenage years, when a tragic incident linked their lives. Helen’s sister died by suicide in a car accident, and Grant was behind the wheel. This creates a forbidden romance element, as Helen initially wants nothing to do with Grant due to the tragedy.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Helen and Grant’s relationship is layered and compelling. Grant is an A+ love interest—charismatic yet vulnerable, and so in love with Helen. Their admiration for each other’s craft adds depth to their connection, going beyond just physical attraction, though there’s plenty of spice and lust as well.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  I loved the writers’ room setting, which added a unique and engaging backdrop to the story. The workplace romance dynamic, combined with their complicated history, made for a captivating read.  \n\n- **Cultural and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The book explores Asian American family dynamics and the struggles of eldest daughters of immigrants. The opening dedication describes it as a love letter to these women, and as someone who fits that description, I felt deeply seen and loved by this story. It reminded me of *Beach Read* meets *The Heart Principle*, with sad writers carrying emotional baggage, though it wasn’t as heavy as *The Heart Principle*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a heartfelt, spicy, and emotionally layered romance that combines workplace dynamics, forbidden love, and cultural depth. It’s a love letter to eldest daughters of immigrants and a must-read for fans of Asian romance and complex, heartfelt storytelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "Helen and Grant are incredibly endearing characters. The author masterfully encourages readers to empathize with both perspectives, avoiding the pitfall of villainizing either character. Helen, initially shy and uncertain, gradually gains confidence in her work and among her fellow screenwriters, highlighting the beautiful theme of found family. Grant, while easygoing and well-liked, grapples with anxiety and panic attacks when alone, a representation I appreciated. I particularly enjoyed the moments when Helen comforts him during his panic attacks. Their relationship is truly special, developing naturally and beautifully. I loved their friendship and the palpable tension between them, especially in the memorable scene on the couch in Grant’s room. The way they care for each other throughout their 'arrangement' is heartwarming. I aspire to be loved the way Grant Shepard loves Helen Zhang!",
            "This debut from a talented author is truly impressive. My initial concerns about the beach read adaptation have vanished; I now trust this writer completely.",
            "This book delves into grief and the complex emotions surrounding suicide. I appreciated how the author candidly portrays the anger that often accompanies loss, particularly through Helen's feelings toward Michelle's actions. The sensitive handling of these difficult topics makes the characters deeply relatable.",

I cherished every page, and I know this book will linger in my heart for a long time. Its beauty filled me with warmth, and I found myself in tears throughout. Helen's final letter to Michelle particularly resonated with me."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a deeply emotional and beautifully crafted story about love, loss, grief, and forgiveness. The characters, Helen and Grant, are incredibly well-developed and relatable, and their relationship unfolds naturally and poignantly. The author handles sensitive topics with care and delicacy, making the story both heart-wrenching and heartwarming. It’s a debut that leaves a lasting impression, and I have complete faith in the author’s storytelling abilities.",

It resonated with me on an emotional level, which I greatly appreciated.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved how the novel focused on the characters' arcs rather than just the relationship between the two main characters. Helen, in particular, was a character I related to in many aspects of her personality, which helped me connect with the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style was initially unfamiliar to me, but I grew to like it more as I progressed through the story.

I didn’t feel it was needed to understand Helen’s motives, as they were already well-crafted earlier in the story. This was the main reason I couldn’t give the book a full 5-star rating.  \n\n- **Author and Influences:**  \n  I am a fan of Yulin Kuang’s writing and trust Emily Henry’s recommendations, which likely influenced my overall enjoyment of the book.

However, it turned out to be far from a romance or comedy. The story revolves around the suicide of the main character’s sister and the emotional aftermath, making it a heavy and intense read.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The book delves deeply into grief, family dynamics, and complex emotions, especially the struggles Helen faces with herself, her family, and her unresolved feelings about her sister’s death. The line, “I don’t hate you, I just hate the way you love me,” perfectly captures the intricate and painful relationship Helen has with her mother.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story is a slow burn, which I personally enjoyed, though I understand it might not appeal to everyone. The pacing allows for a thorough exploration of the characters’ emotions and relationships.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Authenticity:**  \n  The writing feels incredibly real and raw, making the characters and their struggles relatable. The sex scenes are blush-worthy but also add to the authenticity of the story.  \n\n- **Uniqueness and Tropes:**  \n  This book breaks away from traditional romance tropes, which I found refreshing and impressive, especially for a debut novel.  \n\n- **Author’s Background and Future Work:**  \n  The author is also the screenwriter for Emily Henry’s adaptations, which adds an exciting layer of anticipation for future projects.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a deeply emotional and unique exploration of grief, family, and love. It defies genre expectations and delivers a raw, authentic story that lingers long after reading.

I strongly related to Helen's relationship with her parents, particularly her mother, and the struggle of navigating cultural identity—feeling neither fully Chinese (or Mexican, in my case) nor entirely American."

The third act is particularly well-crafted, featuring seamless shifts between various perspectives that create a cinematic feel.

            "The characters in this story are complex and realistic, avoiding typical tropes. Each one has their own motivations and backstory, which adds depth to the narrative. Grant, with his panic attacks, is particularly relatable. Helen, though socially awkward and unable to express her feelings, is endearing and just needs time to open up. Initially, she comes off as cold and uncomfortable, but as the story progresses, the group becomes friends, creating a fun dynamic. While the characters may not be deeply explored, each has their unique traits. Helen's family, on the other hand, is quite dysfunctional—stiff and unloving—but they try their best in their own way. Overall, the character development is engaging and adds richness to the story.",
            "The highlight of the story is undoubtedly the dialogue. I absolutely love it! The banter and back-and-forth exchanges are incredibly entertaining and hilarious. The writing team has immense potential for clever banter and inside jokes related to the series, making it all the more enjoyable!",
            "The settings are perfect, showcasing immense potential that the creator fully utilizes. The process of structuring the series is incredibly entertaining, with everyone sharing ideas and brainstorming on the whiteboard. The retreat to the cabin for team bonding is a fantastic touch. The scene where they’re all high while hiking up the mountain and learning to coexist is a standout moment. Overall, it’s a remarkable experience.",

El final fue una tortura: todo mal, todo el mundo triste, y la atmósfera pesada se prolongó demasiado. Además, lo de la boda me pareció un poco aleatorio.",

            "Helen and Grant are two characters whose love seems impossible. Their story unfolds as a slow burn, making any other approach feel inappropriate. Complicating matters further is Helen's family, who will never accept their relationship. Ultimately, this is a love story destined for heartbreak.",
            "In this story, Helen and her family direct their blame at Grant, despite their underlying resentment and anger towards Helen's sister. The narrative powerfully conveys the depth of their emotions—anger, sadness, and frustration. As the plot progresses, the characters are compelled to confront and navigate these buried feelings.",
            "How is this a debut novel? I am completely blown away by the emotional depth and power of this book. It's hard to believe this is the author's first work!",
            "I approached this story with little prior knowledge, only aware of its positive reviews. I quickly found myself immersed in the narrative, reminiscent of Emily Henry's style—unsurprisingly, as she is the screenwriter for *Beach Read* and *People We Meet on Vacation*. This tale offers a fresh take on the enemies-to-lovers trope, as both characters grapple with the aftermath of Helen’s sister's situation—Grant with guilt and Helen with anger. The story beautifully weaves together themes of sadness, heartbreak, passion, and uncertainty.",
            "I definitely don’t recommend reading the second half of this book on the same day you watch the *It Ends With Us* movie—I learned that the hard way! There simply aren’t enough tissues for both. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book; it’s sure to be one of my top reads of 2024."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This debut novel is an emotionally powerful and deeply layered story that defies typical romance tropes. The complex relationship between Helen and Grant, rooted in tragedy and unresolved emotions, is a slow burn that feels authentic and inevitable. The writing is exceptional, especially for a debut, and the emotional depth left a lasting impact. It’s a must-read and will undoubtedly be one of the standout books of 2024.",

It resonated with me on a personal level, especially as someone who longs to be loved out loud by someone who would find it impossible to ever stop loving me.  \n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  The story hit me HARD as an insecure lover girlie and as an Asian American child of immigrants with complicated mommy issues and sisterly quarrels. The protagonist’s decision to move to LA for college to live truly and independently felt deeply personal, especially since her middle name is Michelle (because Sarah Shelley didn’t sound as good).  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The only reason I didn’t cry is because I had my contacts in the whole time I was reading it. The emotional depth of the story was intense and moving.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel explores themes of self-discovery, independence, and the complexities of love and family. Lines like “while I learn not to care and know not to settle” and “hope yours will soon follow and that in some incomprehensible ways you seek God on your own before you get better” struck a chord with me.  \n\n- **Humor and Relatability:**  \n  The humor and candidness in lines like “a mid man’s ego is a curse I wouldn’t wish upon my worst female enemy” added a layer of relatability and wit to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel is a masterpiece of storytelling, blending a unique writing style, well-developed characters, and a deeply human romance. It resonated with me on multiple levels, from its emotional depth to its exploration of identity and love. I’m not ashamed of my digital footprint because this book deserves all the praise.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores were mentioned in the review, but the tone and enthusiasm suggest a highly positive rating, likely 5/5."

This gave me complete faith in her ability to adapt Emily Henry’s books.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Familiarity:**  \n  This had a lot of the same elements that make me love Emily Henry as a writer. I enjoyed this from the first page.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Yulin set up a really difficult task for herself with such a heartbreaking start to Helen and Grant’s story. They’re connected in a way that’s absolutely unimaginable. But in the end, it’s perfect, and their relationship makes sense. Of course, Helen and Grant would fall in love for the same reasons that once kept them apart.  \n\n- **Setting and Unique Elements:**  \n  I also really loved the writer’s room setup. It was fun seeing how a show is created and written.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Themes:**  \n  The depictions of grief and guilt are done so beautifully. It feels like a really honest portrayal of the grief you feel when you lose someone unexpectedly and the guilt you may feel that you couldn’t help them more.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  It’s not often that I know a book is going to be a five-star read from the jump. I really hope that Yulin writes more books (after she directs *Beach Read*!). She has an easy space in my rotation of favorite romance writers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel captivated me from the very beginning, blending heartfelt emotions, relatable characters, and a unique setting. Yulin Kuang’s ability to adapt and write with such depth and authenticity makes this a standout read.

I strongly connected with the portrayal of an immigrant daughter navigating two separate lives—one for her parents and one for herself. The heartbreak of immigrant children striving to meet their parents' expectations while yearning for their love was profoundly moving. The protagonist's wish to go back in time to teach her grandparents how to express love, so it could be passed down to her parents and then to her, was particularly emotionally impactful."

            "The breakup and third-act angst were heart-wrenching yet refreshingly distinct from the usual cycle of breakup, wallow, and reconciliation. The resolution offered a more nuanced and satisfying conclusion.",
            "Helen resonated with me as an aspiring writer and chronic overthinker, reflecting my own struggles. She stands out as one of the many female protagonists who have touched me personally. The chemistry between Helen and Grant—both physical and emotional—felt authentic and organic. Their slow-burn journey to a happily-ever-after (HEA) added a layer of realism that enhanced the story. Grant is irresistibly gorgeous, romantic, and deeply in love with Helen, his palpable yearning making him utterly relatable. I loved how hopelessly devoted he was to her. Meanwhile, Helen believes that Grant would be better off without her, even though he can't envision a future with anyone else.

She felt like a mirror to my own struggles, and I will hold her close to my heart as one of the many female main characters who spoke to me on a personal level.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Development:**  \n  Grant is diabolically gorgeous, romantic, and deeply in love with Helen. His angsty yearning was palpable, and I adored how horrendously, unequivocally \"down bad\" he was for her. Helen’s love for Grant is so profound that she believes he’d be better off without her, while Grant can’t imagine a future with anyone else. Their dynamic was both painful and beautiful.  \n\n- **Chemistry and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The chemistry between Helen and Grant—both physical and emotional—felt organic and believable. Their journey to a happily-ever-after (HEA) was a slow burn, which added a layer of realism that worked well for this story.  \n\n- **Handling of Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  The breakup and third-act angst were heartwrenching but refreshingly different from the typical \"breakup, wallow, and reconcile\" trope. The resolution felt more nuanced and satisfying.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Sensuality:**  \n  The sex scenes were incredibly sexy and tastefully written, avoiding the trap of being smut for the sake of smut. They added depth to the story and characters.  \n\n- **Themes of Grief and Mental Health:**  \n  The novel beautifully and bravely depicted grief, particularly the kind felt after losing a loved one to suicide. While I wished Grant’s anxiety and panic attacks were explored more, I was still satisfied with the portrayal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a flawless 5-star read for me. It lived up to the hype, which is rare, and left me emotionally moved. I sobbed (just a bit) but am incredibly happy I gave it a chance.

It felt refreshing and added a unique layer to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt fully realized and whole, which isn’t always the case in romance novels. I found myself deeply caring for them and rooting for their success throughout the story.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The “behind the scenes” look at working in a writer’s room was fascinating and added a lot of fun to the story. It was interesting to see how these dynamics influenced the characters’ relationship.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The book tackled heavy topics like grief, death, and challenging family situations. While these added depth to the story, they might not be suitable for readers who aren’t in the right emotional space for such themes.  \n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Scenes:**  \n  The book is very spicy/open door, almost bordering on smut in my opinion. While this might not be for everyone, I thought the scenes were mostly well done and didn’t feel overly awkward or cringe-worthy.  \n\n- **Overall Appreciation:**  \n  I truly appreciated the depth of feeling and thought that went into this book. It left me curious about what the author, Kuang, will do next, especially with the adaptation of Emily Henry’s books to the screen.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel surprised me in the best way. With its well-developed characters, engaging setting, and emotional depth, it was a standout read. While the heavy themes and explicit content might not be for everyone, I found it to be a deeply satisfying and thought-provoking romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The prologue was truly shocking and unexpected, and I appreciated the content warning. Initially, I wasn’t sure if I should continue due to the seemingly impossible premise, but the story was so compelling from the start that I couldn’t put it down.  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  Kuang achieved the impossible by making me deeply care about the characters and their love story. I particularly adored Grant and related a lot to Helen’s worldview. It was a joy to grow alongside Helen in a new space and witness her love story with Grant unfold.  \n\n- **Romance and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The forbidden, yearning romance was beautifully written and reminded me of the best fan fiction I’ve read in the past. It was heart-wrenching but in the most satisfying way. This book truly hurt my heart, but it was so, so good.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel exceeded my expectations with its intense prologue, compelling characters, and emotionally resonant romance. Despite its challenging premise, the story drew me in completely, leaving a lasting impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The darker, sadder backdrop to the enemies-to-lovers and friends-with-benefits-esque story made it more interesting and unique.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters were great and complex, and I enjoyed the fun cast of side characters as well.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The unique setting of a TV show production added a fresh layer to the story. Given that the author is Emily Henry’s screenwriter, it also felt very meta, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Minor Criticisms:**  \n  I’m knocking off a half star because of a dumb nickname that randomly appeared 70% of the way through the book. It felt unnecessary and out of place.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved this book for its originality, complex characters, and unique setting. While there was a minor flaw with an odd nickname, it didn’t detract significantly from my enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐️"

            "Helen is a deeply relatable character—a people pleaser who wishes she could turn back time and struggles with commitment. I felt her longing when she refrained from telling Grant she loved him, even though I understood her reasons.

            "The plot is rooted in realism, creating a compelling and emotionally challenging narrative. The themes of trauma, forgiveness, and healing are explored with depth and sensitivity. The third-act breakup feels both necessary and authentic, enhancing the story's credibility. Helen's choice to write a love letter to her sister in her next novel serves as a poignant and fitting conclusion.",
            "The romance between Helen and Grant is refreshingly realistic and beautifully developed. I appreciated that Grant wasn't a flawless love interest; their relationship evolved authentically despite various challenges. \n\n**Helen:** I resonated deeply with Helen, seeing reflections of myself in her independence, struggles with self-worth, and eventual growth. Her journey was both heartwarming and inspiring. \n\n**Grant:** I admired how the story delved into Grant's mental health and trauma, making him a complex and relatable character. His honesty and vulnerability with Helen were particularly poignant. \n\n**Supporting Characters:** Suraya, Nicole, Saskia, Tom, Eve, and Owen enriched the narrative, with Suraya’s mentorship and the found family dynamic standing out as highlights. \n\n**Helen’s Parents:** Their portrayal as first-generation immigrants felt authentic, and I appreciated that their challenges weren't magically resolved. \n\n**Grant’s Mom:** Her character added a lighthearted touch, making her subplot endearing. \n\nThe book excels in POC representation, especially in Helen’s family dynamics and cultural background.

I was grateful to receive an advanced copy via NetGalley, and the book did not disappoint.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Scene-Setting:**  \n  Yulin Kuang is a master of details and setting the scene. She vividly portrays the culture of a writers' room, a setting many readers might not be familiar with. One standout scene involves the writers sharing their deepest, darkest secrets instead of \"fun facts\" to get to know each other. While this might seem jarring in another context, it felt perfectly natural in the writers' room and helped me understand the setting and characters better.  \n\n- **Realism and Depth in a Rom-Com:**  \n  While this is a rom-com, the book stands out for its realistic portrayal of life’s imperfections. For example, the main character’s disagreements with her parents are never fully resolved. Unlike traditional rom-coms, where parents might fully embrace the love interest by the end, the relationship here improves but never reaches complete approval. This added a layer of authenticity that I appreciated.  \n\n- **Character Development and Redemption:**  \n  Initially, I was annoyed with Helen’s insistence on hating Grant, as it felt unfair to him. However, her character redeemed herself by the end, which made her arc satisfying and well-rounded.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a joy to read.

The deep intertwining of their hurt and trauma enhances the beauty of their connection.

Kuang put so much heart and depth into Helen’s emotional process and her interactions outside of Grant. It really made her infuriating decisions and mind-boggling responses become not only plausible but justifiable.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The way these two characters are so deeply woven together in their hurt and their trauma makes their connection even more beautiful. Their chemistry is palpable, and sometimes they were so hot for each other that I did question: do these two like each other for anything else? But honestly, I think readers sometimes get swept up in the spice that they forget about the buildup where the bond is solidified.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Banter:**  \n  This was the PERFECT level of bantery. Kuang had her finger on the pulse of realism here; the quippy comebacks, the romantic declarations, the moments where no words work at all. Everything felt seamless and natural in a way that my recent reads have not.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n  This was artful. Kuang’s debut was incredible, and I can’t wait to see what she does next.

I look forward to reading more from Yulin Kuang.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This is a deep, emotional, and spicy romance novel. It’s not a light, funny rom-com but rather deals with heavy themes like grief, regret, and trauma. The tone is more introspective and emotional, which sets it apart from lighter romance stories.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character’s journey of self-discovery and self-forgiveness was a highlight for me. She carries guilt from her past actions, which haunt her for years, and it was satisfying to see her growth and healing throughout the “coming of age” plot.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story has strong side plots that go beyond just the romance, which I appreciated. It’s not solely focused on the love story but also delves into deeper themes like trauma bonds, grief, and personal growth. The exploration of these themes added layers to the narrative.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The book had more spice than I expected, and fans of spicy romance novels will enjoy certain chapters. One chapter, in particular, had a memorable and intense moment that stood out.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Adaptation Potential:**  \n  The author’s talent shines through, especially given their background as a screenwriter (they worked on Emily Henry’s *Beach Read* script). The story felt cinematic, and I could easily visualize it playing out. I’d love to see this adapted into a film or series.  \n\n- **Reception and Discussion Potential:**  \n  The book was recently picked by Reese Witherspoon for her book club, which adds to its appeal. It’s a great choice for group discussions, especially given its emotional depth and layered themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a worthwhile read. The emotional depth, strong character development, and unexpected spice made it stand out. While the trauma bond aspect left me unsure, the story’s exploration of grief, regret, and self-forgiveness was compelling. The author’s screenwriting background adds a cinematic quality to the narrative, making it a strong candidate for adaptation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

If you’ve ever found yourself perplexed by the differences in what men and women find attractive or just want to know what turns women on (in general, of course) - read this book 🙈. I wanted more reason as to why Helen and Grant loved each other besides their shared tragic past and their sexual attraction to one another. I do think they both served a purpose in each other’s lives for that period, but I didn’t have any investment in them being together long term.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**  \n  I thought Helen’s grief journey and reconciliation with her parents was beautifully portrayed. It was one of the highlights of the book.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution and Relationship Outcome:**  \n  This book isn’t 5 stars for me because I almost feel like Helen and Grant didn’t need to end up together at the end to have the resolution we got.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Still, I really liked it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excelled in portraying emotional depth and Helen’s personal journey, the romantic resolution between Helen and Grant felt somewhat unnecessary and lacked deeper justification beyond their shared past and physical attraction. Despite this, the book was highly enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4⭐️"

            "Helen's realization that Grant wasn't to blame for the dark event marked a pivotal moment in the story, though the timing of this epiphany was unclear.

The authenticity of their strained dynamic resonated deeply, especially moments like her mother reading her diary, criticizing her late-night reading, and dismissing therapy. I appreciated that their relationship wasn't miraculously resolved, as this felt more realistic. While the romance was enjoyable, it was somewhat overshadowed by the parental drama.

            "The author's writing is impeccable, skillfully crafting flawed yet relatable characters. The romance is steamy without veering into cheesiness, and the characters feel authentic and believable. The emotional depth of the story is palpable, making the characters' journey of healing and love profoundly moving.",
            "The novel delves into themes of self-love following tragedy, acceptance of professional lifestyles, friendships, and family dynamics. As a Chinese American, I resonated with Helen’s challenges in navigating her relationship with her parents, who grapple with the loss of their daughter and struggle to express their love for Helen in the way she truly needs.",
            "In this poignant narrative, the protagonist grapples with the tension between healing and the fear of losing someone they deeply care for. They express a desire for health and happiness, yet struggle with trusting in the permanence of joy, viewing it as a transient experience that may never return. The protagonist's concern that \"happily-ever-afters\" are unattainable for people like them adds a layer of melancholy.\n\nGrant's raw admission, \"I don’t want to be healthy. I just want you,\" reveals his desperation and emotional turmoil. The narrative contrasts their struggles with the notion of deserving love, suggesting that a woman worthy of Grant would have recognized his value in the moment, rather than succumbing to regret and despair. This reflection on love and loss underscores the complexity of their relationship, highlighting the profound impact of emotional connection and the weight of unfulfilled potential.",

            "The story follows screenwriter Helen and novelist Grant, who must collaborate on adapting a book series. Their shared trauma—Helen’s sister committing suicide by jumping in front of Grant’s car during high school—serves as the foundation of their connection. While the plot is intriguing, it often feels contrived, as this traumatic event appears to be the only reason for their bond. The reliance on trauma bonding can come across as forced at times.",
            "In this story, Helen's harsh treatment of Grant often feels unwarranted, as she consistently rebuffs his attempts at kindness and professionalism. Her hostility seems unjustified, particularly since Grant is not responsible for the traumatic event that affects them both. In contrast, Grant emerges as a sympathetic character, displaying remarkable patience and kindness despite Helen's cruelty. His emotional depth and vulnerability make him particularly compelling. \n\nHowever, the abrupt shift in their relationship from animosity to flirtation feels rushed and underdeveloped. While the romantic tension and angst between them are well-crafted, the transition occurs too quickly—around 20% into the book. Additionally, the third-act breakup comes off as predictable and frustrating, given that their relationship is built on a fragile foundation of trauma and unresolved issues.",
            "The third-person perspective hinders a deep connection with the characters' emotions and thoughts. Frequent shifts in point of view within chapters create confusion and diminish the story's emotional depth. A first-person perspective would have offered greater insight into the characters' inner worlds.",
            "The story delves into themes of trauma, guilt, and healing, yet its execution often feels superficial. The ineffectiveness of the characters' therapists undermines the potential for genuine emotional growth. Nevertheless, the book succeeds in evoking strong emotions, particularly through Grant's character and his poignant moments with Helen."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Dialogue and Romantic Appeal:**  \n   - The novel features swoon-worthy, Ryan Gosling-esque dialogue that could make a romantic heart flutter.  \n   - The romantic elements were designed to evoke strong emotional reactions, which worked for the intended audience.  \n\n- **Plotline and Realism:**  \n   - The plotline felt problematic and unrealistic, particularly the premise of the love interest coincidentally being the boy the protagonist's family blamed for her sister’s death.  \n   - The idea that this person also becomes a co-worker in a highly niche profession (screenwriting) and is located across the country from where they grew up stretched believability.  \n   - The workplace fraternization trope was acknowledged but set aside for the sake of the story.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Content:**  \n   - The explicit dirty talk and sexual content did not resonate with the reviewer, who currently prefers fade-to-black scenes.  \n   - The reviewer found the sexual elements unappealing and ineffective in enhancing the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its moments of romantic charm and emotional appeal, the unrealistic plotline and excessive sexual content detracted from the overall enjoyment. The reviewer acknowledges that the book may appeal to others but found it difficult to fully embrace due to logical inconsistencies and personal preferences regarding romantic and sexual content.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 Stars."

This aspect of the novel was particularly impactful and meaningful.  \n\n- **Setting and Authenticity:**  \n  The Los Angeles setting felt authentic and added a layer of realism to the story, which I always appreciate in a novel.  \n\n- **Character Development and Romance Arc:**  \n  I liked both of the two main characters, who were complex and conflicted. Their romance arc was well-developed, and I enjoyed the satisfying happily-ever-after (HEA) ending. Additionally, I counted this book as my AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islander) month read, which added to my appreciation.  \n\n- **Focus on Screenwriting Craft:**  \n  The excessive focus on the \"craft of screenwriting\" (referred to as \"the room\") did not interest me at all. This aspect of the story felt overdone and detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Spice Level and Content Warnings:**  \n  The spice level was extremely high (🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️), to the point where even the author advised skipping several chapters. I followed this advice, as it was too much for my taste. Additionally, the book includes a trigger warning regarding the suicide of a sibling, which is important to note for sensitive readers.  \n\n- **Overall Hype and Expectations:**  \n  While the book had some strong elements, I don’t believe it lived up to the hype surrounding it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had a mix of strengths and weaknesses for me.

Despite these flaws, the author’s talent is evident, and I remain excited for her future works, particularly her adaptations of Emily Henry’s books.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I appreciated Grant's character and his deep care for Helen, while Helen herself was relatable, particularly in her relationship with her immigrant parents.

By the time I finished? Less than 10 percent. Oof.\"  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  \"I wasn't sold on any of the rest of the book's elements either: not its petulant main characters... I didn't want to spend any more time than I had to enduring Helen's insufferable bullshit and Grant's 'crackerjack' terms of endearment.\"  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship:**  \n  \"At one point in this book, a secondary character tells Helen (the protagonist), 'You trauma bonded your way into mutual attraction ... Healthy.' Ummm, IS IT THOUGH? IS IT REALLY? After 300+ pages, I remain unconvinced... not its underbaked love story.\"  \n\n- **Plot and Coincidences:**  \n  \"Not the coincidences that had to happen for them to find each other (twice!) after the tragedy that first brought them together.\"  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  \"The writing in this debut was solid enough to warrant three stars, but the plot tedious enough...\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the writing quality was decent, the novel failed to deliver on multiple fronts, including character development, the romantic relationship, and the reliance on coincidences to drive the plot. The initial excitement waned significantly, leaving me unimpressed and eager to move on from the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars (based on the writing quality, despite other shortcomings)."

The main character (MC) transitions from hate to obsession too quickly, which felt unrealistic and disconnected from a natural emotional progression.  \n\n- **Pacing and Content (40-70%):**  \n  From the 40% to 70% mark, the story seemed to rely heavily on sex scenes without much focus on building a genuine emotional connection. This was disappointing, as emotional depth is crucial for me in a romance novel.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  While I loved the first 40%, the latter part of the book fell apart for me due to the lack of emotional depth and rushed romance.  \n\n- **Author Potential:**  \n  Despite my disappointment with this book, I’m still interested in exploring more works by this author in the future, as I believe another book might resonate better with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had a strong start but ultimately failed to deliver a convincing and emotionally satisfying romance. While the first 40% was engaging, the rushed relationship development and overemphasis on physical intimacy detracted from the overall experience. I remain hopeful about the author’s future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The author seemed to be adhering to expected patterns rather than allowing the story to unfold organically, which made it feel less engaging.\n\n- **Potential Adaptation:**\n   - The reviewer speculated that the story might work better as a movie or limited series, given the author’s background in screenwriting.

            "The ending was disappointing, lacking a satisfying resolution for both the story and the characters' arcs. While the plot felt unrealistic, I might have overlooked this if the writing had been stronger. The female main character's shift from hostility to romantic interest in the male main character was too abrupt, lacking logical reasoning or emotional buildup.",
            "I found the FMC unlikable, which significantly detracted from the storytelling. As the eldest daughter of immigrant parents, I could relate to her struggles, but her character felt flat and poorly developed. She often treated both the MMC and her parents unkindly, and her behavior seemed unjustified and lacking in depth. This made it difficult to empathize with her. \n\nThe MMC was the book's only highlight, but his portrayal felt idealized, resembling a fantasy of what women want rather than a realistic character. His unwavering devotion to the FMC felt undeserved given her treatment of him, creating an off-putting dynamic. Additionally, his personal issues remained unresolved, leaving his character arc incomplete. \n\nThe romantic relationship felt forced and lacked emotional depth, relying more on physical intimacy than meaningful connection. The author seemed to use their hookups as a distraction from the FMC's disjointed character, which I found unsatisfying. Overall, the story fell short in its character development and emotional resonance.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Development:**  \n  - The story begins with Helen’s sister jumping in front of Grant’s car and dying, which sets up a complex dynamic between Helen and Grant.  \n  - Helen is initially mean to Grant when they have to work together, but her feelings change abruptly after a sex dream, leading to a sudden romantic and physical relationship.  \n  - The plot heavily focuses on their sexual encounters, which felt excessive and out of character, overshadowing deeper themes.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Helen’s emotions and motivations felt inconsistent and underdeveloped. Her shift from hostility to love happened too quickly and lacked believability.  \n  - Grant’s character was reduced to repetitive phrases like “growling” and lacked emotional depth.  \n  - The characters’ grief, parental expectations, and healing were touched upon but not explored in a meaningful way.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  - The novel had potential to delve into themes like grief, healing, and love but only skimmed the surface.  \n  - The emotional depth of the characters was lacking, making it hard to connect with their journey.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - Some scenes were well-written and engaging, but the repetitive phrases (e.g., “the tattoo of her heart,” Helen going “hmm”) became distracting and confusing.  \n  - The writing leaned heavily into smutty content, which overshadowed the potential for a more poignant and thoughtful narrative.  \n\n- **Reader Experience:**  \n  - If you’re looking for a smutty book, this might be enjoyable.  \n  - If you prefer a story with depth and relatable characters, this might not meet your expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential to explore meaningful themes like grief and healing, it ultimately fell short due to underdeveloped characters, a rushed romance, and an overemphasis on sexual content. Some scenes were well-executed, but the repetitive writing and lack of emotional depth made it hard to fully connect with the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "The character development in this story felt disjointed. In their first meeting since high school, Helen confronts Grant, calling him her sister's murderer, yet they skip over any meaningful discussion about this traumatic event before jumping into a sexual relationship. The excessive focus on sex began to feel like a waste of page space, especially since the significant issue—the unresolved trauma of Helen’s sister's death—remained largely unaddressed. The romance was minimal, with the narrative consisting of 300 pages of sexual encounters and discussions about writing, followed by 70 pages of Helen grappling with her relationship with her parents, culminating in a wedding.",
            "The prose was frustrating, with lyrical and metaphorical elements that seemed straight out of a Creative Writing 101 critique. Although the book employs dual third-person limited narration, about 20% of each page is filled with italicized inner monologue, making it feel more like dual first-person writing.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations and Comparisons:**  \n   - I held this book to an extremely high standard before it was even published, largely due to frequent comparisons to Emily Henry.  \n   - This book is not comparable to any Emily Henry novel. It lacks the atmosphere, warmth, esoteric wittiness, and genre-defying literary fiction tones that make her an auto-buy author for me.  \n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**  \n   - I found the prose irritating. The lyrical, metaphorical tidbits felt like they were pulled directly out of a Creative Writing 101 critique.  \n   - The book is written in dual third-person limited, but approximately 20% of every page is dedicated to italicized inner monologue. At that point, it might as well have been written in dual first person.  \n\n- **Character Development and Trajectory:**  \n   - The characters' trajectory made almost no sense to me. In their first meeting since high school, Helen calls Grant her sister's murderer, but they have no substantive conversations about the event that unites them before they have sex.  \n   - There is so much on-page sex that it started to feel like a waste of page space, especially since the characters hadn’t begun to unpack the enormous elephant in the room: the hanging ghost of Helen’s dead sister and the trauma surrounding her passing.  \n\n- **Romance and Plot Structure:**  \n   - There was so little romance to me. It felt like 300 pages of two people having sex and talking about writing, followed by 70 pages of Helen raking her nails over her relationship with her parents, and then a wedding.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics (Suicide and Grief):**  \n   - The handling of the hefty topic of suicide felt ludicrously careless at times. Grief is complex, painful, angry, and real, and while I love portrayals of grieving women who are equally complex and real, this book might have been genuinely dangerous for me at a different point in my life.  \n   - There are agreed-upon standards for depicting suicide in a way that honors storytelling while preventing unnecessary harm, and this book didn’t even respect the basics. The longer I think about it, the angrier it makes me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell far short of my expectations, particularly in comparison to Emily Henry’s works. The prose, character development, and handling of sensitive topics like suicide and grief left me deeply unsatisfied.

            "The plot overlooked essential moments in character development and relationship progression. Helen's abrupt declaration at Michelle's grave, stating she never blamed Grant, felt out of place and contradicted her previous actions. While the story was engaging and fast-paced, the predictable resolution ultimately left me feeling unsatisfied.",
            "The portrayal of suicide and its associated stigma in the story is problematic. Michelle’s death primarily serves to justify Helen’s irrational behavior, and the narrative fails to effectively counter the stigma surrounding mental health. The treatment of sensitive topics like grief and family dynamics lacks the necessary nuance and care. Helen’s mischaracterization of Grant feels unrealistic, especially given the decade that has passed since her sister’s suicide. Her ongoing anger and blame toward Grant, whom she labels her sister’s murderer, contradict her supposed therapy and personal growth. \n\nHelen’s inability to discuss Grant’s role in her life with her parents reflects deep-seated grief, but the portrayal lacks the depth needed to make it believable. Grant’s attraction to Helen, despite her inconsistent and often harsh treatment, is unconvincing. His willingness to forgive and pursue her without any significant change on her part is hard to accept. Helen’s lack of meaningful atonement or growth is a major issue; instead of seeking therapy or making amends, she writes a manuscript of letters to her sister, which she sends to Grant—a superficial attempt at closure. \n\nGrant’s decision to reconcile with Helen without her demonstrating significant change undermines the believability of their relationship. While Helen’s self-doubt about being “good enough” for Grant is valid, the resolution fails to address this adequately.",

The link between her substance abuse and mental health issues was unclear, and her death often served as a plot device rather than being explored meaningfully. Additionally, the book did not sufficiently address the toxic family dynamics, especially Helen’s relationship with her mother. Helen's ongoing involvement with her family, without clear justification, was particularly frustrating."

            "The exposition begins with promise but soon descends into a series of random, poorly justified events. Key conflicts, such as Helen's sister's death and her parents' influence, are introduced too late and receive insufficient exploration until the third act.",
            "The main characters, Grant and Helen, are underdeveloped and lack depth. Grant comes across as a generic, average white American millennial with no distinctive traits. While Helen is somewhat more relatable, her character relies too heavily on superficial reflections of her Chinese immigrant upbringing, which do not contribute to meaningful development. Supporting characters, such as Helen's parents, are introduced too late and lack sufficient buildup, diminishing their impact on the story. The romance is problematic and toxic, characterized by repetitive cycles of hookups, denial, passive-aggressive behavior, and self-sabotage. The relationship suffers from a lack of healthy communication and emotional depth, rendering it unrealistic and unromantic. Despite its diverse premise, the story fails to engage in meaningful discourse on interracial dating.",
            "The writing is flawed, featuring forced storytelling and random events that lack organic flow. The plot hinges on contrived situations, such as a camping trip, to artificially generate chemistry between the characters.",
            "The book inadequately explores trauma and its effects on character development. It oversimplifies diversity by reducing Helen's identity to her ethnicity, neglecting her personality and experiences. Additionally, the story romanticizes unhealthy relationship dynamics, potentially misleading readers."

It relies on forced plot devices, underdeveloped characters, and toxic relationship dynamics, all while failing to address meaningful themes or advance racial discourse.

The story centers on Helen's sister, who tragically commits suicide by throwing herself in front of Grant's car 13 years before Helen and Grant are reunited and compelled to work together.

I wish the author had focused more on this instead of the romance between Grant and Helen.\n\n- **Plot Focus and Potential:**\n   - The book had moments that worked well, but it missed the mark by prioritizing a romance plot over exploring Helen’s grief and her relationship with Michelle.

            "The segments featuring the show were particularly engaging.",
            "I struggled to connect with the main characters and found their romance unconvincing. While the relationship began with promise, it quickly deteriorated due to an excessive focus on sex, which was introduced too early—around the 40-45% mark. This shift left little room for emotional connection, making their bond feel purely physical. The relationship had significant potential, but it was ultimately undermined by the overemphasis on sexual elements.",
            "I found the writing compelling, with a gripping and powerful exploration of grief.",
            "I approached the book with different expectations, and its unexpected direction surprised me. The emphasis on physical intimacy rather than emotional connection was disappointing, as I prefer romances that delve into emotional depth."

        "conclusion": "While the writing and exploration of grief were compelling, the lack of emotional connection between the main characters and the overemphasis on physical intimacy detracted from the story. The romance fell short of my expectations, leaving me disappointed.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics:**  \n   - The book is built around an extremely tragic and traumatizing experience, which I felt was treated disrespectfully and inappropriately for a light-hearted contemporary romance.  \n   - The traumatic event was used as a plot device to connect the main characters, but it lacked depth and sensitivity.  \n   - The characters’ reactions to the trauma felt unrealistic; actions like driving, accepting, or forgiving should have been much harder to overcome, not glossed over as if everything was resolved with good sex.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n   - The romance felt rushed, going from hate to physical intimacy without meaningful emotional buildup.  \n   - The chemistry between the leads was lacking; their conversations were awkward, and they seemed to have nothing in common beyond the traumatic experience.  \n   - The relationship lacked believable growth or connection, making it hard to buy into their “love.”  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The pacing was uneven, with unnecessary content dragging on and then abrupt time jumps in the final chapters.  \n   - The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying, with months passing between paragraphs, leaving little room for resolution.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I found the book disappointing and struggled to finish it, despite giving it a fair shot.  \n   - While I went in prepared for the hit-or-miss nature of contemporary romances, this one missed the mark for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell short in its handling of sensitive topics, romantic development, and pacing. The rushed romance, lack of chemistry, and unrealistic portrayal of trauma made it difficult to connect with the story or characters. Despite my efforts to give it a fair chance, the book was ultimately disappointing and not one I would recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1 star."
