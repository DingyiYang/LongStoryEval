This made much of *CATALINA* feel repetitive and overly familiar.\n\n- **Characterization and Themes:**\n   - Catalina/Karla is portrayed as an undocumented girl from Ecuador living in Queens, admitted into Harvard, coded as bipolar, and excessively intelligent. While these traits are compelling, they don’t feel fresh or expanded upon in this book.\n   - The narrative jumps between themes, subjects, settings, and timelines, which creates a disjointed reading experience. The reliance on pithy observations and brief characterizations doesn’t contribute to a cohesive story.\n\n- **Genre and Style:**\n   - *CATALINA* fits into the \"no plot, just vibes\" and \"messy 20-something girl\" subgenres, which are popular on platforms like Bookstagram and BookTok.\n   - The writing style aligns with authors like Sally Rooney, Genevieve Wheeler, J.D.

Though there are moments of lyrical prose and impactful scenes (like Catalina jumping out of a moving car), the book fell short of my expectations, particularly in its handling of the romance subplot and overall coherence.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She is shaped by trauma, which leads her into a series of problems, making her both fascinating and frustrating. Her tendency to bottle up emotions and react impulsively adds complexity to her character, though it also makes her somewhat inaccessible at times.\n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Structure:**\n   - The novel is written in a lyrical prose style, reminiscent of the author’s non-fiction work, *The Undocumented Americans*.

It offers sharp commentary on academia, critiquing the white savior mentality and the often misleading interactions with faculty. These themes are woven into the story effectively, culminating in a satisfying ending that ties everything together.\n\n- **Comparison to the Author’s Memoir:**\n   - The novel shares many similarities with Villavicencio’s memoir, *The Undocumented Americans*, including the writing style and thematic focus. At times, the overlap felt too pronounced, making the book feel repetitive and less distinct as a work of fiction. This similarity detracted from the overall experience, as it raised questions about what new insights the novel offered.\n\n- **Cultural and Historical Context:**\n   - Set during Obama’s second term, the book provides a rich backdrop of the political and social climate surrounding DACA and the challenges faced by undocumented students. This context adds depth to Catalina’s story and enhances the exploration of identity and belonging.\n\n- **Pacing and Development:**\n   - While the ending effectively brings the themes together, certain parts of the story felt underdeveloped.

However, I recognize that some readers might appreciate the style of writing, and if that's your preference, you may enjoy it more than I did.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel addresses a significant and timely issue with a compelling concept, but its execution and writing style didn't fully meet my expectations. While I appreciated the themes, the lack of depth in character development and the journal-like tone left me somewhat unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This lack of connection made it difficult for me to stay invested in their stories or care about what happened to them.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The book’s description led me to believe it would be emotionally impactful, but it didn’t tug at my heart as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Personal Reflection and Themes:**  \n  I found myself wondering how much of the story was based on the author’s personal experiences rather than pure fiction. The topic of immigration resonated with me, especially as my views on it have evolved over time through reading and the experiences of relatives. My heart goes out to anyone in a situation like Catalina’s.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While I’m sure many readers will love this book, it just wasn’t for me. I only finished it because I had an ARC and felt obligated to provide an honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial excitement, this book didn’t resonate with me due to its unlikeable characters and lack of emotional engagement. While I appreciate the themes and potential personal connections to the author’s experiences, it ultimately wasn’t a story I enjoyed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The novel is driven by her stream-of-consciousness narrative, which immerses readers in her thoughts, including her humorous and sometimes chaotic daydreams.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The novel employs a stream-of-consciousness style, which feels unstructured but is highly engaging. Catalina's voice is distinctive and entertaining, though it can be overwhelming at first, especially in the audiobook format. Switching to a physical copy made the experience more enjoyable.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book thoughtfully explores themes such as the experiences of undocumented immigrants, nepotism, being a person of color in elite spaces like Harvard, and the familial pressures faced by immigrant and first-generation children. Catalina's astute observations provoke reflection on these important topics.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The ending felt abrupt, which might not suit all readers. However, it aligns with Catalina's unpredictable and unconventional personality, making it a fitting conclusion to her story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Catalina* is a highly enjoyable and thought-provoking novel. Its unique narrative style, compelling protagonist, and exploration of significant social issues make it a memorable read, despite the abrupt ending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It exceeded my expectations, and I finished it in just four days. It reminded me of *The Idiot* by Elif Batuman, which I also gave five stars. Both novels feature female students at Harvard, written in the first person by witty, brilliant, and well-read authors. While *The Idiot* is set in the 90s, this book is more contemporary.  \n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n  This book delves into more serious and complex issues compared to *The Idiot*. It explores topics such as undocumented Americans, Latin American culture, Spanish colonialism, mental health, race, and class. Some parts were emotionally challenging to read, particularly the protagonist's struggles with depression and her reluctance to capitalize on her talents or opportunities.  \n\n- **Cultural Perspective and Highlighted Passages:**  \n  One of the most impactful perspectives in the book is how Latin Americans feel when viewing museum depictions of their historical culture. A particularly striking passage I highlighted was: *\"Watching busloads of white American children make their way through the halls of annihilated peoples made me feel like I was on an amusement park ride in hell.\"* This resonated deeply with me.  \n\n- **Personal Connections and Additional Insights:**  \n  As an aside, I have a friend from Ecuador who vaguely knew about Khipus but wasn't aware of their historical significance. This book also inspired me to add three more books to my \"want to read\" list, which is always a bonus.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a compelling and thought-provoking read, tackling weighty themes with wit and depth. It left a lasting impression on me, both through its cultural insights and its exploration of personal struggles.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars (implied through comparison to *The Idiot*, which was also rated 5 stars)."

A central theme is the notion of existing solely as an object of beauty, which requires constant attention to thrive; when that attention wanes, it evokes a profound sense of soul death.

            "The main character's toxic relationships, including her relationship with herself, add depth to her struggles. While I appreciated the complexity of her internal voices and could understand some of her actions, I ultimately found her unlikable and struggled to connect with any of the characters. However, her feelings of inadequacy—whether as an American, Ecuadorian, daughter, granddaughter, or for herself—resonated deeply with me. As a Latina who attended Harvard, I particularly related to her experiences there, especially the anecdote about mispronouncing \"Goethe\" and the isolation that followed.",

            "The book is structured into four parts, representing the seasons, rather than traditional chapters, which can slow the reading pace. It tells the story of Catalina, a girl who survives a near-death experience in Ecuador and relocates to New York to live with her undocumented grandparents. As she navigates her time at Harvard—interning at a magazine, working at the Peabody Museum, and befriending the son of a renowned filmmaker—Catalina's journey ultimately leads her into a downward spiral. Central themes include identity, privilege, and the challenges of being undocumented.",
            "Catalina is a complex character—raw, delicate, selfish, and fearful. Her depth is evident in moments such as her reaction to her friend's anthropology trip to Colombia, where she fixates on her exclusion rather than the trip's educational value. While her fear of deportation looms large, it often clashes with her moments of selfish carelessness.",
            "The author skillfully uses stream-of-consciousness storytelling, which I found engaging rather than distracting, as I might have in the past. The narrative is enriched by profound moments that are often lightened by humorous, straightforward remarks, like, “Imagine being born a goldfish.”",

            "The introspective pacing of *Catalina* is well-suited to its shorter length, though a longer format might have felt overwhelming. The audiobook format effectively maintains momentum. This campus novel follows Catalina during her final year at Harvard as she navigates the challenges of being an undocumented student. She confronts the uncertainties of DREAMer and DACA legislation, her struggle to find post-graduation employment, and the emotional impact of her grandfather's detention in an ICE raid. The narrative poignantly explores her internal conflicts and the narrow options available to her.",
            "Catalina's internal monologue conveys a profound sense of depersonalization. She observes her relationships and emotions from a distance, often conforming to external expectations instead of revealing her true self. By the end, her desires and identity remain ambiguous, underscoring a significant disconnect. This character development evokes *The Bell Jar*, presenting a contemporary and inclusive perspective on sad girl academia.",
            "The novel reads like an intimate collection of diary entries, offering a deeply personal, relatable, and insightful experience. Rich with literary references, it weaves together Latin American sociopolitical and cultural history. The narrative's flights of thought and imagination reflect the mind's natural tendency to leap between concepts, memories, and speculations. While this distinctive style is engaging, it can also be disconcerting, occasionally pulling me out of the story.",
            "This novel is rich with poignant, thought-provoking quotes that capture Catalina’s struggles with identity, survival, and societal expectations. Lines such as, “The problem with being an object of beauty… means you exist only when you’re looked at,” and “Emasculation at the hands of the state is a very cunning thing,” resonate powerfully. The story is a tragic, open-ended exploration that is both heartbreaking and satirical, leaving a lasting emotional impact.",

I eagerly requested it on NetGalley and was grateful to receive an eArc.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - *Catalina* is a campus novel narrated by the titular character during her final year at Harvard.

The novel explores her internal struggles and the limited options she faces.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Tone:**\n   - The novel is deeply internal, akin to reading diary entries. It feels personal, relatable, and intelligent, with numerous literary references and a rich interweaving of Latin American sociopolitical and cultural history. The narrative includes flights of thought and imagination, mirroring how the mind jumps between concepts, memories, and speculations. This unique style is both connecting and disconcerting, pulling me out of the story at times.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Catalina’s internal monologue reveals a sense of depersonalization.

This character development feels reminiscent of *The Bell Jar*, offering a modern, inclusive take on \"sad girl academia.\"\n\n- **Pacing and Format:**\n   - The slower pacing, driven by the introspective style, worked well for the novel’s shorter length.

            "The novel left me wanting more, as it felt too short and swept me off my feet. I found myself wishing for a few hundred more pages. While the climax was less tragic than I expected, it seemed as though the author had more to convey but was constrained or rushed in their storytelling.",
            "In *Catalina*, the author employs a conversational yet incisive voice that echoes her previous work, *The Undocumented Americans*. While Catalina's character reflects the writer, it's simplistic to label the novel as autobiographical; the emphasis remains on the narrative rather than elevating the author to a mythical status. Catalina is self-aware, clever, and relatable, embodying both joy and pain. She skillfully sidesteps the unreliable narrator trope, showcasing her grit and pioneering the normalization of flawed, undocumented individuals. Her poignant epilogue line captures her resilience: “Out of all the abandoned girls in the world, I could be their valedictorian.”",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Uniqueness of the Story:**  \n   - The novel stands out among coming-of-age stories, despite its seemingly familiar rags-to-riches trope.  \n   - The protagonist, Catalina, is a \"self-protagonist\" who relies on her wit, drive, and the kindness of strangers, reminiscent of a female Pip.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Representation:**  \n   - Catalina is a brilliant misfit, perpetually displaced as an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador raised in Queens and educated at Harvard.  \n   - Her story captures the stress, trauma, and depression of being a DACA kid, constantly torn between two worlds: New York (family, money worries, deportation fears) and Boston (Harvard, privilege, literature, and a white boyfriend).  \n   - Her internal conflict is poignantly summarized: \"The real world was sad . . . and literature was beautiful\" (9).  \n\n- **Themes of Displacement and Injustice:**  \n   - Catalina’s undocumented status creates a perpetual state of anxiety: \"When police get involved, ICE gets involved and there goes your life. I thought about this every day of my entire life\" (88).  \n   - She grapples with historic injustices, such as the Conquistadors' destruction of the Inca world, which \"made my blood boil\" (192).  \n   - Her museum internship and study of world languages highlight her inability to travel, even for family funerals, deepening her sense of displacement.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Voice:**  \n   - Catalina’s voice is nonlinear and challenging to follow at times, ventriloquizing a \"normal\" student’s thoughts about assignments or sex.  \n   - Her rage and wit are vividly portrayed, such as her reaction to white privilege: \"The rest of the world is plundered and bombed so rich white people can eat Caesar salad with each other and be inane\" (173).  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n   - The book doesn’t conclude traditionally but rather ceases, with a brief two-page coda that loosely ties up major threads.  \n   - Despite the abrupt ending, the story’s images and echoes linger long after reading.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a powerful and unique coming-of-age story, deeply rooted in the struggles of an undocumented immigrant. Catalina’s journey is marked by displacement, trauma, and a relentless striving for belonging, all conveyed through a nonlinear narrative and sharp, angry wit. While the ending feels abrupt, the story’s emotional depth and thematic resonance leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book struggled with a weak plot, making it a challenging read. The narrative was often drawn out by excessive internal monologues, giving it a diary-like quality reminiscent of *The Diary of a Young Girl*.

The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying, particularly the epilogue, which failed to provide closure, especially concerning Catalina’s grandfather.",

            "Catalina Ituralde, the protagonist, is an undocumented immigrant in her final year at Harvard. Her compelling background includes the loss of her parents as a baby, living with relatives in Ecuador, and now residing in Queens with her underemployed grandparents. Throughout her early years at Harvard, Catalina struggles to remain invisible, but in her senior year, she begins to “emerge whole,” confronting her identity and future. Despite her challenges, she often feels detached from her life, aloof from friends, and disinterested in academics, likely due to her uncertainty about the future. \n\nCatalina's relationships are few but meaningful. She shares a close bond with Delphine, a Puerto Rican friend raised as a Jehovah’s Witness, and her budding romance with Nathaniel, the son of a famous director, adds complexity to her story, though it doesn’t fully anchor her emotionally. Her interactions with her grandparents, who have converted to Jehovah’s Witnesses, offer insight into her family dynamics and the sacrifices they have made.",
            "The novel thoughtfully examines the challenges faced by undocumented immigrants, particularly their inability to work legally, travel, or pursue their desired careers. It sheds light on systemic issues, including the unsuccessful passage of the DREAM Act and the limited options available to undocumented individuals, such as marriage or legislative changes. Additionally, the story addresses class disparities, as Catalina contemplates how only the wealthy can afford unpaid internships in media, contrasting sharply with her own precarious financial situation.",
            "The novel thoughtfully explores significant themes, but it struggled to engage me emotionally. Catalina's detachment from her life and her lack of enthusiasm for both academic and personal pursuits made it hard to connect with her character. While the narrative addresses systemic issues and Catalina's internal struggles, I found myself yearning for greater emotional depth and a clearer sense of her personal growth."

I think you can see in our eyes the kind of sadness, which is in two places at once – mourning the past, grieving the future.”* The narrative also examines the complexities of interracial relationships and cultural misunderstandings, particularly in Catalina’s interactions with her white boyfriend and others. It offers sharp commentary on the immigrant experience, highlighting the challenges faced by undocumented individuals. Additionally, the novel critiques the superficial engagement some have with Latin American culture, as illustrated by Catalina’s reflections: *“White people have always tried to bond with me about Latin America in this anxious, insecure, and very awkward way.”*"

            "In Catalina's senior year at Harvard, framed by the DREAM Act, the story initially hints at character growth and emotional depth. However, her half-hearted activism feels inconsequential to her journey. Instead, she immerses herself in a hedonistic lifestyle, ultimately objectifying herself in her quest for permanence. This narrative left me with a sense of squandered potential and a bleak perspective on human selfishness.",
            "The book falls short of its intriguing premise as suggested by the blurb. Instead of the anticipated magical realism in Catalina's infiltration of Ivy League elites, readers are met with mundane experiences among American elites. The depiction of privilege and excess is underwhelming, lacking both glamour and engagement."

The blurring of fiction and reality, unmet expectations, and lack of meaningful character development left me disappointed.

            "This story delves into the precarious lives of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., focusing on the challenges faced by Dreamers like Catalina. The deportation order for her grandfather heightens the narrative's tension and urgency. The novel effectively highlights systemic issues, including the constraints of Catalina's undocumented status and the ongoing failures to pass the Dream Act.",

Throughout her senior year at Harvard, she undergoes significant personal growth, becoming more honest with herself even as she grapples with honesty toward others. Her sharp wit and resilience make her a memorable character. While the secondary characters lack depth, this is understandable given the novel's brevity (224 pages) and its status as a debut work.",
            "The writing is sharp and engaging, striking a balance between wit and emotional depth. While the novel's brevity keeps the story focused, it also limits the development of secondary characters.",

While the secondary characters lack depth, the emotional engagement and social relevance of the story make it a compelling read. The novel not only tells Catalina’s story but also serves as a call to action for legislative change, making it an important and necessary voice in contemporary literature.",

            "This novel excels in both writing and characterization, achieving a level of perfection that is hard to overstate. Its unique and captivating voice feels both singular and special. The author explores profound themes with striking clarity, as seen in lines like, “I wanted to be loved and admired, but I did not want to be talked about,” and “The problem with being an object of beauty is that you exist only when you’re looked at; to remain alive, you must be constantly observed, much like sharks that need to be in motion to breathe.” \n\nThe narrative captures the struggle for validation and existence, illustrated by the poignant reflection, “I lulled myself to sleep by rattling off to God all the reasons it would be mutually beneficial for me to not wake up in the morning, but when the son of a gun kept me alive, I ragefully said, ‘Okay! You won!’” \n\nThe protagonist's desire for connection is vividly portrayed: “I wanted to reach my hand into their brains through their ears and scratch in new grooves with my acrylic nails.” The contrast between her outward confidence and inner turmoil is encapsulated in her self-assessment: “I was doing incredible. I was beautiful and also a genius. I had great legs. I spoke so many languages.” \n\nThe novel also reflects on the nature of literature itself: “Unless it is read, a book is just an object. There are no holy texts without believers to read them.” Ultimately, the protagonist’s journey resonates deeply, as she declares, “Out of all the abandoned girls in the world, I could be their valedictorian.” This novel is a powerful exploration of identity, beauty, and the human condition.",

It shares similarities with autofiction and explores themes of identity and relationships.  \n   - The author’s nonfiction debut, a part-memoir and part-reported work, provided insight into her life, mental health struggles, and her refusal to craft an inspiring narrative. CATALINA revisits the author’s universe and worldview but shifts into the “sad girl novel” genre.  \n\n- **Genre and Style:**  \n   - The book embodies the “sad girl novel” genre with its self-declarative first-person prose, chaotic stream-of-consciousness style, and a self-destructive protagonist.  \n   - The narrative style is intentionally uncomfortable, preventing the reader from settling into the story.

The story rarely immerses the reader in the intellectual or social environment of the university.  \n   - Catalina’s constant shuttling between Harvard and Queens, along with her focus on family, leaves little room for side characters or a deeper exploration of the campus setting.  \n\n- **Character Development and Intellectual Depth:**  \n   - Catalina is a deeply introspective character, constantly name-dropping books and ideas, which hints at her intellectual depth. However, these references often feel fleeting rather than fully developed.  \n   - The chaotic narrative style sometimes detracts from the character’s intellectual journey, leaving the reader wanting more.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The book’s pacing is uneven, with moments of extreme chaos that can overwhelm the reader.  \n   - A more measured approach might have allowed the story to hit harder and explore its themes more effectively.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nCATALINA is a chaotic and intentionally uncomfortable read that blends the “sad girl novel” genre with the harsh realities of being undocumented.

While she has a few friends, her relationships are often strained. She yearns for a romantic connection but finds it challenging to identify a suitable partner and commit. As an undocumented immigrant, her struggles are intensified, making her a sympathetic and relatable figure. A quintessential Dreamer, she embodies the American spirit more than many, yet faces unemployment and the constant threat of deportation for herself and her grandparents.",

Tightly wound and tense, she often comes across as judgmental, convinced that her insights surpass those of others and that no one can truly comprehend her. Her defensive barriers hinder genuine connections, making it difficult for others to reach her.",
            "If I had encountered Catalina during my undergraduate years, I likely would have avoided her, preferring to remain in my judgmental bubble with a few close friends. Many people outgrow such tendencies, and I hope I have as well. By the story's conclusion, it appears that Catalina may be on a similar path of growth."

She is a classic Dreamer, more American than many, yet unemployable and at constant risk of deportation for herself and her grandparents.  \n\n- **Catalina's Flaws and Realism:**  \n   - Catalina embodies a less attractive but very real side of Harvard undergraduates: a mix of grandiosity based on her academic achievements and a deep-seated inferiority complex.  \n   - She is tightly wound, exudes tension, and is judgmental, often believing she sees more deeply than others and that no one can truly understand her.  \n   - She puts up barriers against others, making it hard for people to connect with her.  \n\n- **Relatability and Personal Reflection:**  \n   - If I had met Catalina as an undergraduate, I would have avoided her, sitting quietly in my own judgmental isolation with my few friends.  \n   - Most people grow out of these issues over time, and I hope I have. Toward the end of the story, it seems Catalina might too.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a compelling and realistic portrayal of undergraduate life at Harvard, with Catalina serving as a deeply human and sympathetic protagonist. Her struggles with identity, relationships, and her undocumented status make her relatable, while her flaws add layers of realism. The story resonates with personal reflections on growth and the challenges of youth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book suffers from a weak narrative structure, lacking a clear plot until well beyond the halfway mark. Instead of a traditional story arc, it relies heavily on atmosphere and tone, which may not resonate with readers looking for a tightly woven narrative. The storytelling is fragmented, propelled by anecdotes and sporadic historical reflections rather than a cohesive storyline.",
            "Catalina is a richly complex protagonist, a literary prodigy grappling with her identity as an undocumented immigrant. Torn between her fascination with American pop culture—celebrity haircuts and hip-hop songs—and her deep connection to her Ecuadorian heritage, she embodies a compelling internal struggle. Her desire for fame clashes with her fear of jeopardizing her family's legal status, while her longing for romance is undermined by her tendency to push others away. This nuanced portrayal of her conflicts adds depth to her character and enhances the story's emotional resonance.",

            "This book offers an engaging start and is easy to read, but its pacing suffers from uneven time jumps. While I enjoyed the overall story, the ending left me feeling somewhat disappointed. The narrative follows Catalina Ituralde, an undocumented migrant from Ecuador raised by her undocumented grandparents in Queens after her parents' tragic death. Upon gaining admission to Harvard, Catalina navigates elite subcultures, internships, literary journals, lavish parties, and secret societies with a blend of fascination and skepticism. The story explores themes of love, grief, longing, humor, and fear, particularly as Catalina confronts her undocumented status, DACA, and the looming threat of her grandfather’s deportation. It poignantly captures her internal struggle between her deep love for her grandparents and her desire for a different life.",
            "Catalina is a multifaceted protagonist—an achiever, observer, and interloper who is both relatable and occasionally challenging. Her relationships with unconventional friends like Delphine and Kyle, who break the mold of the typical Harvard student, enrich her character. Additionally, her budding romance with a fellow student, an anthropologist, offers a deeper understanding of her reconnection with her Latin American heritage.",
            "The book utilizes a stream-of-consciousness style that is both engaging and, at times, disjointed. The narrative features significant time jumps, particularly between the beginning and the Harvard section, which takes center stage. A memorable line captures this experience: \"She had a front-row seat to my emotional state.\"",
            "The novel delivers a incisive critique of Harvard's culture, exposing issues of nepotism, privilege, and the influence of the wealthy elite. It also offers a nuanced depiction of the undocumented immigrant experience, skillfully intertwining humor with heartbreak."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a compelling exploration of identity, ambition, and the undocumented immigrant experience, set against the backdrop of Harvard’s elite culture. While the stream-of-consciousness style and time jumps occasionally disrupt the flow, the story’s emotional depth and cultural insights make it a worthwhile read. Despite some pacing issues and a less satisfying ending, I found myself invested in Catalina’s journey and appreciated the author’s personal connection to the subject matter.",

While this breadth is impressive, I wished Catalina had delved deeper into some areas. I was particularly curious about her thesis, despite her reluctance to write it; its absence felt like a missed opportunity to further explore her intellectual journey.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Relatability of the Protagonist:**  \n   - I found many similarities between myself and Catalina, the protagonist. We both come from undocumented Latine families, graduated from an Ivy League university, and worked at our university’s natural history museum.  \n   - Catalina’s character breaks away from the typical portrayal of undocumented students as activists or successful professionals. Instead, she is witty, navigates the “hidden curriculum” of higher education, and is deeply knowledgeable about literature and pop culture.  \n   - Her awareness of how her migratory status limits her opportunities, coupled with her unapologetic self-expression, resonated deeply with me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I would have loved to see more of Catalina’s grandmother, as her character could have been further explored to avoid portraying her solely as a victim of her circumstances.  \n   - The side characters, particularly Kyle and Delphine, felt underdeveloped. Kyle, being the first person Catalina confides in about her migratory status, had potential for deeper exploration.  \n\n- **Pacing and Depth of Themes:**  \n   - The book is fast-paced and covers a wide range of topics, including academia, pop culture, history, and policy. While this breadth is impressive, I would have liked to see Catalina delve deeper into some of these areas.  \n   - I was particularly curious about Catalina’s thesis, even though she dreaded writing it. Its absence felt like a missed opportunity to explore her intellectual journey further.  \n\n- **Accessibility and Connection for Readers:**  \n   - I wondered how my experience reading about Catalina might have differed if I hadn’t attended an Ivy League university. However, I recognize that readers don’t need to mirror the protagonist to connect with their story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a refreshing and relatable portrayal of an undocumented Latine protagonist navigating higher education and societal expectations. While Catalina’s character is compelling and her story is engaging, the side characters and certain thematic elements could have been more developed.

            "The novel poignantly addresses the struggles of undocumented immigrants in America, particularly the emotional burden of being unable to return home for significant family events, such as funerals. The protagonist, Catalina, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador, moves to Queens to live with her grandparents after her parents die in a car accident. The narrative follows Catalina's journey as she navigates her faith—first in Catholicism and later in Jehovah's Witnesses—while striving to reconnect with her Ecuadorian roots. Her time at Harvard unfolds as she awaits the passage of the DREAM Act. The theme of the Khipu, traditional knotted cord devices from the Andes, is introduced, though its relevance to the plot remains somewhat ambiguous.",
            "Catalina is a richly developed character whose journey highlights the struggles of undocumented immigrants, particularly the exploitation she faces in her relationships with men while seeking to understand her heritage.

        "conclusion": "While *Catalina* is a compelling and emotionally resonant novel that sheds light on the undocumented immigrant experience, it fell slightly short of my expectations. The themes of family, identity, and resilience are well-explored, but the inclusion of the Khipu theme felt underdeveloped. Despite this, the book remains a meaningful read, particularly for those interested in stories of immigration and cultural identity.",

It delves into her life on the brink of DACA and the DREAM Act, highlighting her fears for the future and her acceptance into Harvard. Key plot points include her grandfather's looming deportation and her struggle to prevent it, alongside her relationship with Nathaniel, a wealthy benefactor whose father aims to document her journey. However, several subplots, such as the video collection project and historical references, feel underdeveloped and unresolved.",
            "Catalina is a smart, witty, and introspective protagonist, though her narcissism adds complexity to her character. Her grandfather plays a pivotal role, imparting knowledge about Latin American history and politics. In contrast, Nathaniel and his father, Bryon, embody privilege and wealth, highlighting the disparities in Catalina's experiences.",
            "This book is rich in historical and cultural references, featuring many thought-provoking passages. However, the narrative leaves several plot points unresolved, making it feel more like a character study than a fully developed story. While the stream-of-consciousness style offers valuable insight into Catalina’s mind, it may leave readers craving more action and closure.",
            "The novel explores themes of immigration, identity, and the challenges faced by undocumented Americans. Through Catalina's stream of consciousness, it addresses critical issues such as femicide in Latin America, the disappeared individuals of Colombia and Guatemala, and the atrocities committed by European conquerors. Historical and political commentary is seamlessly integrated into the narrative, often conveyed through her grandfather's teachings, including his insights on the rise of fascism in Western countries."

While the narrative is rich in ideas and cultural depth, it lacks resolution in several areas, focusing more on Catalina’s internal journey than on a cohesive plot. It’s an entertaining and thought-provoking read, but readers seeking a tightly structured story may find it lacking.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The story follows Catalina, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador, who moves to NYC after her parents' death and lives with her grandparents.  \n   - The narrative explores her life on the cusp of DACA and the DREAM Act, her fears about her future, and her acceptance into Harvard.  \n   - Key plot points include her grandfather's potential deportation and her fight against it, as well as her relationship with Nathaniel, a wealthy benefactor whose father wants to document her experiences.  \n   - Several subplots, such as the video collection project and historical references, don’t fully develop or resolve.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The novel delves into themes of immigration, identity, and the struggles of undocumented Americans.  \n   - Catalina’s stream of consciousness highlights issues like femicide in Latin America, the disappeared peoples of Colombia and Guatemala, and the atrocities of European conquerors.  \n   - Historical and political commentary is woven into the narrative, often through her grandfather’s teachings, such as his observations on the rise of fascism in Western countries.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Catalina is portrayed as smart, witty, and introspective, but also somewhat narcissistic, making her an entertaining yet complex protagonist.  \n   - Her grandfather serves as a key figure, educating her about Latin American history and politics.  \n   - Nathaniel and his father, Bryon, represent privilege and wealth, offering a contrast to Catalina’s experiences.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n   - The book is rich in historical and cultural references, with many thought-provoking passages.  \n   - However, the narrative lacks resolution for several plot points, making it feel more like a character study than a fully developed story.  \n   - The stream-of-consciousness style provides insight into Catalina’s mind but may leave readers wanting more action or closure.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a compelling exploration of Catalina’s life as an undocumented immigrant, blending social commentary, historical insights, and witty observations. While the narrative is rich in ideas and cultural depth, it lacks resolution in several areas, focusing more on Catalina’s internal journey than on a cohesive plot. It’s an entertaining and thought-provoking read, but readers seeking a tightly structured story may find it lacking.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

My heart broke for Catalina when she had to deal with her grandfather’s deportation orders on top of the usual pressures every college student faces. The story does a great job of showing her as a full, complicated young person, by turns confident and vulnerable.  \n\n- **Character Development and Complexity:**  \n  Catalina is portrayed as a typical young person trying to figure out who they want to be, but her journey is complicated by her undocumented status and her reluctance to be seen as a poster child for her entire group. The imperfect family she and her grandparents make together is full of love but also has its own set of problems, which adds depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Cultural Representation and Identity:**  \n  The story highlights the challenges Catalina faces as an undocumented immigrant, including the little moments where even seemingly well-meaning adults and friends treat her culture and history like an exotic 'other.' This aspect of the story is handled with sensitivity and nuance.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story is fast-moving and engaging, though some of the jumping around in time could have been less jarring. Occasionally, I had to reread a paragraph because I didn’t realize it had shifted from the present day to a different timeline.  \n\n- **Themes of Family and Education:**  \n  Catalina’s grandparents, despite being undocumented and having limited opportunities, understand the doors education can open for her and push her to be a high achiever. This theme of family support and the value of education is central to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a very engaging and emotionally resonant read. The story effectively balances Catalina’s personal growth with the broader challenges she faces as an undocumented immigrant, while also exploring the complexities of family dynamics and cultural identity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It did not disappoint!  \n\n- **Overall Impression and Rating:**  \n  This novel sits at 4.5 stars for me. It was extremely smart but also purely vibes.  \n\n- **Narrator and Characterization:**  \n  Catalina is a very sharp, wry, and vulnerable narrator. Her observations were cutting, heartbreaking, and hilarious.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  Many people will likely compare this book to Elif Batuman's *The Idiot*. Initially, the similarities of the stories drew me to this novel—I love a mini-bildungsroman set at an elite college from the perspective of a weird young woman. I don’t think the comparison is unflattering to either novel, even though the stories and themes are completely different.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is frenetic and stream-of-consciousness in the smartest way possible, making connections between tons of disparate subjects and settings.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  Catalina does a lot of showing rather than telling. For example, she encounters many (mostly white) people who study her home country of Ecuador, including ancient, sacred artifacts, and describe landscapes she's never seen. The possibility of never experiencing her own culture firsthand, for herself, is deeply painful and understandably frustrating. Instead of reflecting on this explicitly, we see these emotions play out through her behavior.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  The novel relies on the reader to make observations and connections, which I really appreciated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a brilliant blend of sharp wit, emotional depth, and thought-provoking themes.

The novel is narrated by Catalina in the first person, providing the reader with the perspective of a \"Dreamer\"—an individual who came to America as a child and whose memories of her birth country are vague and limited.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement and Connection:**  \n  I struggled to connect with the story or its characters. I persisted to the end only because of my sense of obligation to read and review the book, which was provided to me free via NetGalley.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  Unfortunately, this book turned out not to be a good choice for me, and not one I can recommend.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel offers a unique perspective on the life of a \"Dreamer\" through Catalina's first-person narration, I found it difficult to engage with the story or its characters. Despite my appreciation for the author's previous work, this novel did not resonate with me, and I cannot recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While her backstory is compelling, her detachment when describing her family’s unfulfilled ambitions makes it hard to connect with her emotionally.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  I appreciate the author’s decision not to focus solely on Catalina’s legal status, but the broader narrative lacks literary depth. The themes felt underdeveloped, and the story didn’t resonate with me enough to form a strong connection.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style is detached and observational, which, while intentional, made it challenging to fully immerse myself in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Catalina* offers a unique perspective on the immigrant experience and academia, its lack of plot, emotional resonance, and literary depth left me feeling disconnected. I admire the author’s personal journey, but the novel didn’t fully engage me as a reader.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This immaturity detracted from the introspective depth I had hoped for, though it made sense given her journey of growing up away from her grandparents and finding herself.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  The ending felt unsatisfying, as it didn’t tie up loose ends. However, the book still provided a compelling exploration of the immigrant experience and the internal struggles of adapting to a new country.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  While the book was challenging to read due to its chaotic nature and unconventional style, it offered a profound and insightful look into the immigrant experience. Despite its flaws, I found it to be a great read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book, though tough to get through and somewhat chaotic, delivers a powerful and relatable portrayal of the immigrant experience. Despite Catalina’s occasional immaturity and the unresolved ending, the story’s depth and authenticity make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The first was *The Undocumented Americans*, a short memoir about her time as a volunteer translator for unaccompanied minors applying for asylum.  \n   - Both works are short but impactful, shedding light on the experiences of undocumented immigrants.  \n   - *The Undocumented Americans* was a finalist for The National Book Award for non-fiction, and this novel was longlisted for the award for Fiction this year.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The story follows Catalina, who immigrated to the United States from Ecuador as a child and grew up in Queens with her undocumented grandparents.  \n   - The book covers a year of her life attending Harvard, paralleling the author's own experiences.  \n   - It highlights the struggles of undocumented students who are intelligent and have potential but are limited by their lack of proper documentation.  \n   - The novel is less about campus life and more about the unique ties that bind immigrants, how these ties differ from those of their peers at elite universities, and how they both anchor and constrain them.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Impact:**  \n   - The author is a compelling storyteller with a lot to say.  \n   - Her ability to convey profound messages through concise narratives is remarkable.  \n   - She is an author to watch, and I would highly recommend this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a powerful exploration of the immigrant experience, particularly the challenges faced by undocumented students at elite institutions. The author's storytelling is both concise and impactful, making her a standout voice in contemporary literature.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Her transition to fiction seems to have contributed to the novel's strength, making it a strong technical debut.  \n\n- **Characterization and Themes:**  \n   - Catalina, the protagonist, is an undocumented Harvard student, but her undocumented status is not the sole focus of the story. It plays a role in certain aspects, like finding jobs without a Social Security Number, but it isn't portrayed as a tortured center.  \n   - Catalina's interactions with her conservative Ecuadorian grandparents, her desire to leave a mark, her romantic relationships, and her navigation of Harvard's privileged environment add depth to her character and the story.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Tone:**  \n   - The book features a wry, dark humor that I found particularly enjoyable.

The pacing was slow, especially at the beginning, which reminded me of a long-winded, random story.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The main character was a gritty, depressed, self-sabotaging female lead who frequently discussed sex and degradation. While this type of character is not my preference, there were moments where the complexity of her personality shone through, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writer’s prose was excellent, showcasing their talent. However, the narrative style at the beginning felt overly verbose and disjointed, similar to a viral Twitter story.  \n\n- **Personal Preferences:**  \n  I strongly dislike the trope of depressed, self-sabotaging, and sex-obsessed main characters. This made it difficult for me to fully enjoy the novel, despite its merits. I think I would enjoy the author’s nonfiction work more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had moments of brilliance in its prose and character complexity, the slow pacing, disjointed beginning, and reliance on a character trope I dislike made it a challenging read for me.

The emotional struggles of the protagonist were well-portrayed, though the narration and some unresolved character choices held it back from being a standout read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review."

I wanted more depth and development, as it left me feeling like there was untapped potential.  \n\n- **Themes and Perspective:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was thought-provoking and offered illuminating insights into cultures and perspectives outside of my own.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I’m glad I read it, but I’m unsure if I’d recommend it at this time. I would, however, be interested in exploring other works by the author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its shining moments and provided valuable cultural insights, its disorganized structure, confusing timeline, and lack of depth made it a challenging read. It left me wanting more, but I still appreciated the thought-provoking nature of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development (Catalina):**  \n   - Catalina is the protagonist, a Harvard student and a Dreamer, living with her undocumented grandparents in the United States.  \n   - She is portrayed as an interesting character, but I found her self-absorption off-putting. I would have connected more with the story if I had liked her personality better.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The novel explores the challenges Catalina faces as an undocumented student at a prestigious university, highlighting the uncertainty and struggles of her future.  \n   - It also delves into broader themes of identity, including what it means to be a student, a daughter, an orphan, and a woman, emphasizing the strength required to navigate these roles.  \n\n- **Plot and Narrative:**  \n   - The story provides a compelling look at Catalina’s life, balancing her academic aspirations with the harsh realities of her undocumented status.  \n   - While the narrative is engaging, my connection to the story was hindered by my lack of affinity for Catalina as a character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Catalina* is a thought-provoking novel that sheds light on the struggles of undocumented immigrants, particularly through the lens of a young woman navigating her identity and future. While the protagonist’s self-centeredness made it harder for me to fully engage with her journey, the book’s exploration of important social issues and its portrayal of resilience make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

It delves into themes of class, manners, and the precarious position of being a \"dreamer,\" offering a more profound and thought-provoking narrative than the marketing suggests.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The protagonist, Catalina, is compelling and well-drawn.

While these references are insightful, they detract from the novel's narrative structure, making it feel less like a cohesive story.  \n\n- **Balance Between Plot and Commentary:**  \n  The author attempts to balance storytelling with cultural commentary, but this effort often feels uneven. The narrative sometimes struggles to integrate the plot with the opinions, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  \n\n- **Humor:**  \n  There are moments of humor that elicited laughter, though mostly in the form of chuckles rather than full-on laughs. The humor adds a light-hearted touch but doesn’t dominate the tone of the book.  \n\n- **Depth and Stickiness of Insights:**  \n  The observations and insights, while smart, often feel too brief and lack the depth needed to build into something more impactful. The narrative feels like a rapid-fire waterfall of opinions, some of which come across as familiar or milquetoast.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Ending:**  \n  The ending of the book is touching and effective, particularly once the story narrows its focus. This shift allows for a more emotionally resonant conclusion.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book is a fun read overall, offering a mix of humor, cultural commentary, and a heartfelt ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel struggles with an over-reliance on references and an uneven balance between plot and commentary, it still manages to deliver moments of humor, smart insights, and a touching conclusion.

The story touches on important moments, though they felt few and far between.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I hated the writing style. It was more of a stream of consciousness with lots of fantasies strewn about, which made for an unreliable narrator and a lot of rambling. This approach created clutter that overshadowed the story’s potential.  \n\n- **Potential and Execution:**  \n  The book had the potential to be a beautiful and important short story, and it might already be that for others. However, I couldn’t see past the clutter and the disjointed narrative style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s theme and subject matter were compelling, the writing style and execution detracted from its impact. The stream-of-consciousness approach and unreliable narration made it difficult for me to fully appreciate the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It offers a concise yet impactful read that educates readers about a frequently overlooked segment of the American population. The novel highlights the significant contributions of undocumented workers, including their $1.8 billion tax contribution in Florida two years ago.

Ultimately, the book emphasizes the crucial role undocumented workers play in sustaining the service economy across many states."

There were numerous references to literature and culture, which came across as overly self-aware.  \n\n- **Humor and Voice:**  \n  The book had some genuinely funny lines, and the narrative voice was enjoyable at times, adding a layer of fun to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development (Catalina):**  \n  Catalina, one of the main characters, was a mess, but not in an entertaining or compelling way. While I typically enjoy reckless and insane female characters, Catalina's self-absorption made her unlikable and difficult to engage with.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had moments of humor and an occasionally fun narrative voice, but it was overshadowed by the author's tendency to overemphasize their knowledge and the unappealing portrayal of Catalina.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the story eventually settles into a more coherent narrative, making it easier to follow.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While I still don’t know a lot about the main character, I find her plight intriguing. The character’s background and struggles are compelling, even if her depth isn’t fully explored.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  I appreciate that the book sheds light on the life of an illegal immigrant, specifically a DREAMer, and portrays them as complex, relatable humans. This representation is meaningful and important.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is an odd but intriguing book. While the randomness at the beginning is jarring, the narrative eventually becomes more cohesive. The portrayal of a DREAMer’s life is a standout aspect, offering a humanizing perspective on an often-overlooked experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narrative Style and Tone:**  \n   - The novel is told in first person, almost in a stream-of-consciousness style.  \n   - The protagonist, Catalina, has a certain snobbishness, reminiscent of how some college kids try to sound smart and engage in intellectual debates.  \n\n- **Themes and Character Depth:**  \n   - Despite her intellectual pretensions, Catalina grapples with real, pressing issues, such as being in the country illegally.  \n   - Her grandparents, who raised her, are also undocumented, and she faces uncertainty about her future, including her ability to secure a job after Harvard due to her lack of a Social Security number.  \n   - These struggles contrast sharply with the privileged lives of her peers, particularly legacy students, who cannot fully empathize with her situation.  \n\n- **Structure and Pacing:**  \n   - The book is divided into seasons of one year rather than traditional chapters, which makes the narrative feel fast-paced despite the length of each section.  \n   - The structure allows for a mix of superficial and turbulent moments, creating a compelling immersion into Catalina’s life.  \n\n- **Humor and Observations:**  \n   - The novel includes many witty observations and quips that elicited genuine laughter.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n   - While the story unfolds gradually, some of the most significant events occur toward the end, keeping the reader engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a unique blend of intellectual snobbery and raw, real-life struggles, told through a stream-of-consciousness narrative. Catalina’s journey is both humorous and poignant, with a structure that keeps the story moving swiftly. The contrast between her superficial concerns and deeper, more turbulent issues makes for a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I found that her foray into fiction left me unsatisfied and a bit confused. I'm not quite sure what to think of it.\n\n- **Themes and Ideas:**\n   - This book has a lot of ideas/questions, similar to her other book. It explores questions like: What happens when we center only \"good\" or \"innocent\" immigrant stories or consider only these immigrants deserving of opportunities? When we see people as perfect, does this take away from their humanity? How do you deal with family members who, because of their pasts, are not good to you, but you have the obligation to help them anyway?\n\n- **Narrative Style and Connection to Narrator:**\n   - I generally enjoy the ideas in this book, but I am not a fan of distanced narrators. What bothered me most was that I didn't feel a connection to or particularly like the narrator. I found it a bit unpleasant to be in the narrator's head. While the author may have been trying to make a point with this style, my rating is based on my enjoyment, and I found myself teetering between like and dislike for most of the novel.\n\n- **Readability:**\n   - I will give the book points for being very readable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel presents thought-provoking themes and questions, the distanced narrative style and lack of connection to the narrator hindered my overall enjoyment.

The story is deeply character-driven and examines how the U.S. views undocumented individuals and the challenges they face in surviving here while still grieving for their homeland at times.  \n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**  \n  Not only is Catalina's story told, but we also get a glimpse into the lives of her grandparents, who are her guardians. We see how hard it is for her grandfather to maintain a job as an undocumented worker and what it's like for her grandmother to receive dental care without qualifying for federal assistance. Catalina is thrust into a world where she doesn't always fit in with her native culture or her life in the States, where few know her undocumented status. She is trying to find her own way to survive.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Authenticity:**  \n  Much of Karla's own life seems to influence this story, as she was also an undocumented student at an Ivy League school. This adds a layer of authenticity and emotional depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Impact and Recommendation:**  \n  Much like *The Undocumented Americans*, I feel this is a story that should be widely read by others. It sheds light on important issues and humanizes the struggles of undocumented individuals.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKarla's first work of fiction is a powerful, character-driven story that explores the challenges faced by undocumented individuals in the U.S. Through Catalina's journey and the lives of her grandparents, the novel offers a poignant and authentic portrayal of survival, identity, and belonging. It is a must-read that deserves widespread attention.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Target Audience and Tone:**  \n   - The novel felt like it skewed a little young adult (YA) to me. I’m not sure if this was due to the narrative voice or the way the story was told, but it felt like so much was made explicit, leaving little room for readers to infer or discover things on their own.  \n\n- **Plot Logic and Realism:**  \n   - There were moments when certain events didn’t make sense to me. For example, Catalina’s ability to zip up a dress that was two sizes too small seemed unrealistic. I found myself questioning whether this was physically possible, even though the dress eventually tears. While I don’t want to nitpick too much, these moments were a bit distracting.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Novel:**  \n   - Despite these issues, the story itself was strong, and the narrative voice was very compelling. I enjoyed the overall experience and will definitely check out the author’s other books in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a pretty good read, though it leaned a bit too YA for my taste and had some moments that strained believability. However, the strong story and engaging narrative voice made it worthwhile, and I’m interested in exploring more of the author’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
