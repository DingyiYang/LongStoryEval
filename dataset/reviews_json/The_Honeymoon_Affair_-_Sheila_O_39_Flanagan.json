Just as the female main character appeared to redeem herself by ending a flawed relationship, the book concludes with an ambiguous \"will they, won’t they\" scenario. This reliance on her overwhelming love for him felt unsatisfying and poorly justified.",
            "The female main character (FMC) comes across as immature and unreliable, particularly in her hasty decisions to get engaged to two men she barely knows, one after the other. Similarly, the male main character (MMC) exhibits selfishness and immaturity, rendering their relationship both nonsensical and unrelatable. The absence of tension or emotional investment between them makes it difficult to care about their connection. Furthermore, the lack of respect and understanding only deepens the disconnect. In contrast, the ex-wife emerges as the most compelling character, possessing depth and intrigue that the others lack."

Charles came across as self-centered, and Izzy seemed naive in her dealings with him.

It reminded me of her earlier books.  \n- **Writing Style Critique:**  \n  Be careful, Sheila... you seem to be catching Karen Rose's eye-narrowing bug 😕  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel successfully creates engaging tension between the main female characters, reminiscent of the author's earlier works. However, there is a slight critique regarding the writing style, which seems to be adopting a mannerism similar to Karen Rose's.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
