While his earlier books often feature dark humor, this one has a more serious tone. Despite the shift, it is just as good.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story made me grateful to live in the present day. The idea of being a girl cast out by your family during a vulnerable time, with no agency over your decisions, is unthinkable.

It delves into the true horrors experienced by real girls who were subjected to these \"homes,\" \"caretakers,\" and \"doctors.\" These places are from the past, but not as far in the past as one might think.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  Reading this was simultaneously intense, rage-inducing, and heartbreaking. There is A LOT of heart in this book, which made the emotional journey deeply impactful.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Hendrix created characters that felt genuine and relatable. I cared for them deeply and wanted to see justice for their struggles.  \n\n- **Supernatural Elements:**  \n  The witch element plays a role in the story, but it often takes a backseat to the rest of the narrative.

This novel showcases his ability to tackle diverse narratives and genres with skill and sensitivity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a powerful departure from Hendrix’s previous works, blending realistic horror with heartfelt storytelling.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Perspective and Motivation:**  \n  I think it’s bold for a white childless man to write about a 15-year-old girl being sent to a home in Florida to have her baby and put it up for adoption. However, reading the acknowledgments helped me understand his reasoning and motivation. With the support of his team, he was able to shed light on a scenario that’s often overlooked—these homes were essentially erased from history after Roe in the 1970s. While I believe it’s crucial to highlight lived experiences and amplify those voices, this book serves as important exposure to these homes.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were phenomenal. Fern was a powerhouse protagonist, and I loved her selflessness. She genuinely cared about all the girls and was willing to change her entire life for them. Her growth after having her baby was remarkable and showed significant character development. The other girls were equally well-crafted, reflecting the complexity of the times and how these circumstances affected different people. Holly’s tragic story, Rose’s wild journey, and Zinnia’s complex narrative all evolved in ways that made me deeply care for them.  \n\n- **Magic System and Witchy Vibes:**  \n  I do wish there were more witchy vibes in the book, but I loved the magic system, the coven, and their involvement in the story. The magical elements added depth and intrigue to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The ending was killer, and I loved the action that unfolded. The story is far more complex than the author’s previous works, and I appreciate how he weaves serious and traumatic issues into a campy thriller/horror framework. While he uses less of that campy tone in this book, the story was incredibly effective.  \n\n- **Adult Characters and Perspective:**  \n  The adults in the story were portrayed as a spectrum, which I think was well done, especially since we’re reading from a 15-year-old girl’s perspective. This added layers of realism and nuance to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a complex and impactful read that tackles serious and often overlooked issues while maintaining a compelling narrative. The characters, especially Fern, are deeply engaging, and the story’s blend of trauma, magic, and action makes it a standout. I’m thrilled to have enjoyed another Hendrix novel and hope to see more of this kind of work from him.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The setting provides a heartbreaking insight into the discrimination and societal issues faced by these women.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The story blends horror and historical fiction, creating a compelling narrative.

Discovering the experiences of his female friends who were sent to these homes added a deeply personal dimension to the narrative.",

When horror evokes such strong emotions, it’s an automatic 5-star read for me.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Research:**  \n  The acknowledgments section was particularly moving, as Hendrix shared his inspiration for writing this story and the research he conducted.

The true horror of this tale lies in the way young girls were treated at this time. I honestly had to check that the author was actually a man and it wasn't a pseudonym used by a woman, as it captures the feelings of these girls so well.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This isn't a \"typical\" horror.

However, the childbirth scenes are still quite visceral and not for the squeamish.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are a standout strength of the novel. I loved their sass, their terror, and how they each dealt with the shame imposed on them by the world, transforming it into anger, pride, or a desire to move past it.  \n\n- **Plot and Atmosphere:**  \n  The plotting is strong, and the scary elements are well-executed, contributing to the overall appeal of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel, while gentler than Grady Hendrix's typical style, still delivers impactful and intense moments, particularly in the childbirth scenes. The characters are the heart of the story, with their relatable struggles and growth making them deeply engaging. The plot and atmosphere are also well-crafted, making this a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
