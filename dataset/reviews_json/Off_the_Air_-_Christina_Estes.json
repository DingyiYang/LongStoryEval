            "The story follows Jolene Garcia, a TV reporter probing the murder of controversial radio host Larry Lemmon. However, the narrative is bogged down by excessive factual information, which transforms it into an exposé on journalism rather than a gripping fictional mystery.",
            "Jolene Garcia is a tenacious reporter in pursuit of a career-defining story, yet she frequently finds herself outperformed by her rival, JJ. At the center of the conflict is Larry Lemmon, a controversial figure whose actions ultimately result in his downfall. Surprisingly, I found myself in agreement with the justification for his murder.",

        "conclusion": "While the novel offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of journalism and the complexities of Arizona’s social and political landscape, its heavy reliance on factual information and slower pacing may not appeal to all readers. The political undertones and gritty themes add depth but may also be polarizing. Ultimately, the book succeeds in delivering a thought-provoking narrative, though it leans more toward an exposé than a traditional mystery.",

            "The story follows Jolen Garcia, a local TV reporter in Phoenix, AZ, as she investigates the murder of a prominent conservative radio personality. Unlike traditional mysteries that emphasize police work, this narrative prioritizes the relentless pursuit of interviews, video, and sound bites, often at the expense of safety and integrity. However, the plot suffers from a lack of suspense, with the mystery frequently overshadowed by unnecessary digressions, such as scenic descriptions of Arizona and discussions of historical news events that do little to advance the storyline.",

When Jolene finally connected the dots, the truth was compelling, though it left me feeling unsettled. While the motive for the murder was understandable, I would have preferred if she had contacted the police rather than taking matters into her own hands.

            "The book follows a TV reporter in Phoenix, Arizona, striving to escape mundane assignments when she receives a tip about the death of a right-wing talk show host. While it attempts to tackle themes surrounding the decline of American democracy, it ultimately fails to engage the reader. The mystery of the host’s death is predictable and only gains significance in the last 20% of the narrative. The plot dwells excessively on the monotonous aspects of reporting—texts, meetings, phone calls, and interviews—which come off as tedious. With uneven pacing, the story spends too much time on the reporter’s routine, leaving the mystery feeling tacked on and resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.",
            "The characters lack depth and development, failing to explore their motivations adequately. Relationships and interactions feel unengaging and lack meaningful connections. The protagonist is especially frustrating, appearing passive and consistently trailing behind in the investigation, making errors instead of propelling the story forward.",
            "The book addresses the impact of right-wing media on American democracy, but its heavy-handed approach makes it unengaging. The focus on contemptible conservative figures and their associates is off-putting and lacks resonance.

The story attempts to explore themes related to the downfall of American democracy, but it fails to engage. The mystery surrounding the host’s death is uninteresting and only becomes a focus in the last 20% of the book. The plot heavily emphasizes the mundane process of reporting, including texts, meetings, phone calls, and running around for interviews, which feels tedious and uninspired.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The characters are flat and underdeveloped, with no depth or exploration of their motivations. The relationships and interactions between them are dull and lack any meaningful connection. The protagonist, in particular, is frustratingly passive, always two steps behind in the investigation and making mistakes rather than driving the story forward.  \n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n  The book attempts to tackle themes like the impact of right-wing media on American democracy, but it does so in a way that feels heavy-handed and unengaging. The focus on hateful conservative personalities and their circle of peers is off-putting and fails to resonate. The story’s attempt to mirror real-world issues feels more like a chore than a compelling narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is uneven, with the majority of the book focusing on the reporter’s mundane tasks and the mystery only coming into play near the end.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book was long-winded, slow-paced, and boring. It included numerous backstories that did not contribute to the plot or storyline, making it feel like a waste of time to read.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character was unlikeable with almost no redeeming qualities. Despite the expectation to care about her, I found her unrelatable and unengaging.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was overly detailed, likely due to the author's background in TV journalism. This level of detail did not resonate with me as a reader. Additionally, repetitive phrases like \"chewing on her thumbnail\" (used at least 10 times) and \"let out a breath that she didn't realize she was holding\" became irritating.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This was my worst read of 2023, and I struggled to finish it. I did not enjoy the book at all.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my strong dislike for this book, I appreciate the opportunity provided by NetGalley and St. Martin's Press, Minotaur Books to read and review this ARC. The book is set to release on March 26, 2024, but based on my experience, I cannot recommend it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

Her interactions with others often came across as annoying, and while the book briefly touched on her childhood, it wasn’t enough to make me feel like I truly understood her.  \n\n- **Plot and Plausibility:**  \n  The story felt implausible, and Jolene’s decisions in her job didn’t seem well thought out. The overall narrative came across as surface-level, which made it hard for me to fully engage with the plot.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I struggled to get into the book when reading it on my Kindle, so I switched to the audiobook. The narrator did a good job, and while I was able to finish the audiobook, I still wouldn’t recommend it. I wish the story had been more exciting and that Jolene had been a more substantial character I could root for.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the audiobook format improved my experience, I found the novel lacking in character depth, plausibility, and overall excitement. Jolene’s character didn’t resonate with me, and the story felt too surface-level to be compelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

That said, I believe the author has potential and would be open to reading future works from her.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.  \n\nThank you to St. Martin's Press for providing me with a digital ARC in exchange for an honest review. *Off the Air* releases on March 26, 2024."

Nonetheless, it’s a worthwhile read for those interested in the behind-the-scenes dynamics of news reporting.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars.  \n\nThank you, NetGalley and Minotaur Books, for an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. The publication date is March 26, 2024."

            "This mystery diverges from the typical whodunit, as reporter Jolene Garcia is more focused on chasing a story than pursuing a killer. While this perspective occasionally slows the narrative and introduces extraneous details, the engaging twists and thrilling final confrontation with the killer compensate for it. Despite Jolene's lack of insight into the killer's identity until the end, the climax remains exciting.",

Additionally, the predictability of Lemmon’s character—given his widespread unpopularity—undermines the mystery, making the resolution feel unsurprising. The finale, especially the big reveal, is muddled and unsatisfying, largely due to Jolene’s problematic behavior.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Expectations:**  \n  The premise of the book sounded promising, especially since my husband majored in Journalism and many of our friends are reporters. However, it didn’t deliver on the mystery and suspense as much as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt underdeveloped, unlikable, and clichéd. I found it difficult to root for the main character, which made the story less engaging for me.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery Elements:**  \n  For a murder mystery, the stakes felt incredibly low. The focus seemed to be more on teaching how to be a journalist and gather sources rather than solving the crime. The mystery itself was anticlimactic—I didn’t care about finding out the killer by the 75% mark, and the reveal felt rushed and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Themes and Political Content:**  \n  The book was more politically charged than I expected. The way these conversations were handled—often glossed over or ignored—didn’t sit well with me. It felt like a missed opportunity to delve into deeper discussions.  \n\n- **Setting and Local Appeal:**  \n  If you’re local to Arizona, you might enjoy the book more as it features real local businesses. The author’s knowledge and appreciation for reporting are evident, which could be a highlight for some readers.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Final Thoughts:**  \n  I would not recommend this book, especially if you’re looking for a strong mystery. However, if you set your expectations for a lighter, journalism-focused story, you might enjoy it more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise was intriguing and the setting had local appeal, the book fell short in character development, mystery execution, and handling of political themes. The anticlimactic ending and low stakes made it a struggle to finish.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The protagonist, Jolene, embodies the archetype of the relatable everygirl, grappling with work challenges and a tragic family background, but she is overshadowed by her glamorous and successful friends. Her rival, a shallow and irritating character, further detracts from Jolene's journey. These familiar tropes make it difficult to fully invest in Jolene's story.",

The idea intrigued me, but the execution was just okay.  \n\n- **Characterization and Dynamics:**  \n  Some of the characters and their dynamics felt overdone. For instance, the protagonist, Jolene, is portrayed as the underwhelming every girl who struggles at work, has a tragic family history, and is surrounded by hotter, more stylish, and successful friends. Her rival is depicted as a vapid and annoying Barbie who somehow outshines her. These tropes felt clichéd and made it hard to root for Jolene.  \n\n- **Protagonist’s Actions and Sympathy:**  \n  Jolene’s persistence in harassing people because she keeps getting scooped in her reporting was not sympathetic. It was frustrating to read, especially when she blamed others for her lack of success rather than acknowledging her own shortcomings. Additionally, her decision to buy crutches instead of seeking medical attention for an injury was infuriating, especially as someone in physical therapy. She has health insurance—she should use it to ensure proper healing.  \n\n- **World-Building and Detail:**  \n  I enjoyed the handful of times the author delved into the history of different parts of Phoenix or the Emmy award. These moments were fun and informative without disrupting the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Impression and Potential:**  \n  This was a decent debut novel. While the execution fell short in some areas, the premise was intriguing enough that I might consider reading a second book if it becomes part of a series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting premise and some enjoyable moments of detail, the overdone character dynamics and unsympathetic protagonist made it a mixed experience. It’s a decent debut, but there’s room for improvement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5"

I didn’t feel invested in solving the murder, and the focus on media details overshadowed the intrigue.  \n- **Authenticity and Detail:**  \n  The author’s background in media lent authenticity to the descriptions of newsroom operations, camera angles, and attire, but these details felt excessive.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the book wasn’t bad, it didn’t meet my expectations. It’s best suited for readers with a strong interest in journalism and news media.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a detailed dive into the world of journalism and news media, but it falls short as a mystery novel. While the authenticity of the setting is commendable, the slow pacing, lack of character depth, and underwhelming mystery made it a challenging read for me. It’s a niche book that will appeal to those fascinated by the behind-the-scenes of reporting but may disappoint readers seeking a traditional cozy mystery.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They felt distant and unrelatable, which made it hard for me to invest in their journey.  \n\n- **Pacing and Detail:**  \n  The book was a bit too detailed for my liking. The level of detail slowed down the pacing and made the story feel heavy and less engaging.  \n\n- **Plot Engagement:**  \n  The story felt rather flat to me. Despite the intriguing premise of a journalist solving a murder, the execution didn’t captivate me, and I struggled to stay interested.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I’m clearly not the right audience for this book. I think readers who are passionate about journalism or investigative reporting might enjoy it more, as the themes and setting seem tailored to those interests.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of a journalist solving a murder had potential, the book fell short for me due to a lack of character connection, excessive detail, and a flat plot. I struggled to finish it, but I believe it might resonate more with readers who have a strong interest in journalism.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While marketed as a murder mystery featuring local TV reporter Jolene, the book ultimately offers a deeper exploration of newsroom dynamics, with the murder investigation taking a backseat. The detailed depiction of Jolene’s responsibilities and the inner workings of a news station, though unexpected, was both intriguing and enjoyable. The story starts strong but transitions into a slow burn as it immerses the reader in the nuances of Jolene's role. Although the level of detail could feel excessive at times, the author’s background as a reporter adds authenticity and depth to the narrative, enhancing the overall reading experience.",
            "Jolene is a driven, relatable, and flawed character whose perspective makes the story easy to follow. Her imperfections add a layer of realism, making her feel genuinely human. At times, her desperation leads to illogical decisions, evoking both empathy and frustration in the reader.",
            "This book serves as a heartfelt tribute to Phoenix and its surroundings, imbuing the narrative with a cozy and personal touch that reflects the author's career.",
            "I wish the book had been marketed as a behind-the-scenes glimpse into a newsroom investigating a local murder rather than a traditional murder mystery. This would have more accurately reflected the content and set clearer expectations for readers."

The book is a heartfelt tribute to the author’s profession and the city of Phoenix.",

There were moments where her desperation led to illogical decisions, which made me both empathize with her and want to shake her.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The book starts off interesting but becomes a slow burn as it delves into the minutiae of Jolene’s job and the newsroom. While the level of detail felt excessive at times, I appreciated learning about the inner workings of a newsroom, especially since the author’s professional experience as a reporter lent authenticity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book is filled with references to Phoenix and its neighboring areas, serving as a love letter to the city and the author’s career. This added a cozy and personal touch to the story.  \n\n- **Marketing and Expectations:**  \n  I wish the book had been marketed more as a behind-the-scenes look at a newsroom investigating a local murder rather than a traditional murder mystery.

Her determination to solve the murder and her initial excitement about the story of her career make her compelling.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book contains a decent amount of discussion of both conservative and liberal politics, which could be a turn-off for some readers.

Having a personal connection to Scottsdale made the setting more relatable and enjoyable for me.  \n- **Behind-the-Scenes Insight:**  \n  The book provides an intriguing look into the inner workings of a local news station, highlighting the stress and challenges of the job. While fascinating, it reinforced that this is not a career I would pursue.  \n- **Trigger Warnings and Content:**  \n  Although the book includes an extensive list of trigger warnings, I was surprised by the significant role the current political climate played in the story and the murder. Had I known this beforehand, I might have chosen not to read it.  \n- **Character and Plot Reception:**  \n  Many readers, including myself, agree that the character Larry got what he deserved, which added a satisfying element to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Off The Air* is an engaging cozy mystery with a strong sense of place and an insider’s perspective on local news.

The premise is compelling: Jolene García, a TV news reporter, investigates the suspicious death of a controversial talk show host. However, the mystery often takes a backseat to lengthy commentary and detailed descriptions of a radio station's operations. While these elements highlight the author's expertise, they hinder the plot's momentum and agility. The narrative tends to tell rather than show, which ultimately affects the pacing."

However, I appreciated Jolene’s character development by the end and found the audiobook format more engaging.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars"

            "The first 70% of the book focuses on Jolene's struggles to secure a scoop, leading to a slow and repetitive pace. Despite having a crucial interview with Larry Lemmon, she fails to leverage it effectively. Additionally, several red herrings, like the subplot involving the creepy neighbor, feel unnecessary and disrupt the story's cohesion. Streamlining these elements could have made the perpetrator's motivations more coherent by the end.",
            "I struggled to connect with the main character, Jolene Garcia. She came across as whiny, entitled, and perpetually negative, often treating others poorly and failing as a friend. Her moral compass was inconsistent; while she adhered to journalistic ethics, she often disregarded basic human decency. Initially, I hoped she would prove to be a competent reporter despite her flaws, as she appeared witty and motivated. However, she took little initiative to improve her situation, relying heavily on her exclusive source, the head of the Special Investigations Unit, who provided hints but insisted they were off the record. Instead of taking action, Jolene often sat idle, lamenting her inability to use the information. She frequently complained about being a better reporter than her rival, yet her lack of effort suggested she deserved to be outperformed. Additionally, her disdain for using social media felt out of touch, especially in today's digital age."

She was mean to people and a bad friend. Her morals were inconsistent—she adhered strictly to journalistic rules but ignored common human decency.\n  - Initially, I hoped Jolene would be a good reporter despite her flaws, as she seemed witty and motivated. However, she did practically nothing to help herself. She relied heavily on her exclusive source, the head of the Special Investigations Unit, who gave her hints and leads but insisted they were off the record. Jolene would then sit and wait or complain about not being able to use the information yet.\n  - She constantly complained about being a better reporter than her rival but failed to take initiative. Her lack of effort made it seem like she deserved to be scooped by others.\n  - Her annoyance at being required to use social media felt out of touch, especially in the 21st century.\n\n- **Pacing:**\n  - The first 70% of the book consisted of Jolene getting beat out for the scoop and her complaining. This made the pacing feel slow and repetitive.\n  - Jolene didn’t effectively utilize her last interview with Larry Lemmon, which was supposed to be her big advantage.\n  - There were several red herrings, such as the creepy neighbor storyline, that felt unnecessary and detracted from the story’s cohesion. Cleaning these up could have made the perpetrator’s reasoning feel less abrupt at the end.\n\n- **Integration of Social Issues:**\n  - Certain passages, like a two-page history of Native American schools, felt disjointed and irrelevant to the story. While the issues are important, their inclusion felt forced and took me out of the narrative. It seemed like the author included them solely to bring attention to causes, rather than integrating them organically into the plot.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *Off the Air* was just fine.

It was an enjoyable read but could have been more compelling with better balance and momentum.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars rounded up."

            "I chose this story expecting the murder of Larry Lemons, a conservative radio firebrand, to be the main focus. Instead, the plot is overshadowed by tedious details of life at a local TV news station in Phoenix. Excessive asides—like phone calls from managers, conference room meetings, and even the type of pizza ordered—slow the narrative and detract from the central storyline.",
            "The book features a range of characters, including Jolene's coworkers: the decent Nate, the \"woman hater,\" and the van driver Roger Hale, known as \"Snail.\" While these characters add some depth to the narrative, their interactions primarily focus on workplace politics—jockeying for position and guarding scoops. Although these scenes are realistic, they often feel tedious and fail to captivate the reader.",
            "The writing is excessively detailed, often including irrelevant information that detracts from the story. For instance, rather than simply stating that Paradise Valley is a wealthy suburb, the author delves into a lengthy history of its police department, zoning laws, and absence of chain stores.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Focus and Pacing:**  \n  I selected this story hoping the murder of Larry Lemons, a conservative radio firebrand, would be the central focus. However, the plot takes a backseat to mundane details of working at a local TV news station in Phoenix. The story is bogged down by excessive asides, such as phone calls from managers, conference room meetings, and even the type of pizza ordered. These details slow down the storytelling and detract from the main plot.  \n\n- **Setting and Local References:**  \n  As someone who lived in Phoenix for 30 years, I expected to enjoy revisiting the city through this book. Instead, the narrative is overloaded with oddly specific name-dropping of people, products, and places (e.g., Pat Tillman, Maryvale, Indian School Road, Arizona Cardinals, Food City, Orange Patch). The author includes lengthy, unnecessary explanations of local history and culture, which feel like they were lifted from Wikipedia and add little to character development or plot progression.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The book introduces various characters, such as Jolene’s coworkers, including the decent guy Nate, the “woman hater,” and van driver Roger Hale, nicknamed “Snail.” While these characters add some flavor to the story, their interactions often revolve around workplace politics, like jockeying for position and protecting scoops. These scenes, while realistic, become tedious and fail to engage the reader.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Detail Overload:**  \n  The writing is overly detailed, often including irrelevant information that doesn’t serve the story. For example, instead of simply stating that Paradise Valley is a wealthy suburb, the author provides a lengthy history of its police department, zoning laws, and lack of chain stores. This level of detail feels excessive and disrupts the narrative flow.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a behind-the-scenes look at broadcast journalism, but its focus on mundane workplace details and excessive local references overshadows the murder plot. While it might appeal to readers interested in the inner workings of a news station or those familiar with Phoenix, the lack of plot progression and character development made it a disappointing read for me. I ultimately stopped reading at the 60% mark.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF (Did Not Finish) at 60%."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Genre Expectations:**  \n  The description of the novel made it sound intriguing, but it misled me slightly on a key detail. While branded as a mystery, I don’t consider it one. The murder case is in the background, but the protagonist, Jolene, isn’t focused on solving it. Instead, she’s chasing interviews for her story, driven by competition with her nemesis rather than a quest for justice.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jolene Garcia, the protagonist, is a workaholic reporter with a limited social life. Her background in foster care and her grandmother’s influence are mentioned but not deeply explored, leaving her character feeling somewhat shallow. Two recurring traits—her nail-chewing habit and fear of dogs—are highlighted often, but overall, I felt she lacked depth.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  The novel is a quick read with smooth pacing. The story moves along without feeling disjointed or leaving gaps, making it easy to follow.  \n\n- **Setting and Descriptions:**  \n  The story is set in Phoenix, Arizona, and includes several descriptions of local eateries, which add a sense of place. However, these details sometimes felt excessive and didn’t significantly contribute to the plot.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The reason behind Larry Lemmon’s murder was understandable and evoked some sympathy for the person responsible. However, one plot point involving Max felt unrealistic and unresolved.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this wasn’t a bad book, it didn’t fully meet my expectations as a mystery. It’s better suited as a quick fiction read with a focus on journalism and competition rather than crime-solving. The protagonist could have been more developed, and some plot elements felt undercooked.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "The story follows Jolene, a television reporter investigating the murder of a controversial radio talk show host. I appreciated the realistic depiction of a reporter's mindset and the intense pressure to break the story. However, some elements, particularly the attempts to portray Jolene as being in danger, felt somewhat exaggerated, especially since she wasn't pushing boundaries at that stage. I would have preferred to see more of Jolene's amateur detective work rather than her primarily relying on traditional methods of contacting witnesses and sources.",
            "Jolene is a captivating protagonist, and her rivalry with JJ, a local superstar reporter, creates engaging tension. The supporting characters, including her colleagues and neighbors, are well-developed and feel authentic. However, Jim's character falls short; his interactions with Jolene lack depth and serve mainly to convey information. I particularly enjoyed the subplot involving Jolene's unsettling new neighbor and would have liked to see more of it.",
            "As someone with a background in television production, I found the portrayal of the news industry to be both realistic and insightful. The book provides a captivating, fictionalized glimpse into the news-making process that I believe many readers will appreciate.",
            "I initially thought this was a cozy mystery, but it actually focuses on a reporter pursuing a major case and competing with the media for the best information. Unlike an amateur sleuth, Jolene operates in a professional capacity, which distinguishes this story from typical cozy mysteries."

        "conclusion": "This is a unique and engaging mystery that provides a realistic glimpse into the world of journalism. While some elements, like the portrayal of danger, felt a bit forced, the overall story is compelling and well-crafted. The characters, especially the background ones, are well-developed, though Jim could have been more dynamic. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in a behind-the-scenes look at reporting or a fresh take on the mystery genre.",

            "I found the mystery engaging, filled with enough twists and turns to keep me guessing about the culprit. While the protagonist, Jolene, isn't a detective by profession, she skillfully pieces together information from her sources, conducts internet research, and does her own legwork to uncover the truth. I enjoyed following her journey to the solution.",
            "I struggled to engage with *Off the Air* due to its reliance on over-stereotyped characters. Jolene’s rival, JJ, leans heavily on her looks; the victim is a crude far-right shock radio host; the station manager makes choices based on his wife's whims; there's a buzzword-spouting consultant; and even Jolene's well-meaning but intrusive neighbor fits the mold. While stereotypes exist for a reason, the world is full of nuance, and *Off the Air* would have benefited from incorporating more of it.",
            "The author, an Emmy-award-winning journalist, effectively explores the challenges and ethical dilemmas confronting today's journalists. She highlights the pressure to secure scoops, the relentless demand for digital updates, and the financial strains on news organizations as audiences shift away from traditional sources. Additionally, she addresses the competition between local and network outlets, as well as the public's expectation to engage in the reporting process. While the insights are thought-provoking, I found myself without clear solutions."

Although the protagonist, Jolene, isn’t officially a detective herself, she does a nice job of putting together what she hears from her sources, some internet investigation, and her own legwork, and eventually comes up with the solution. I enjoyed following along as she did.  \n\n- **Themes and Real-World Relevance:**  \n  The author, Christina Estes, an Emmy-award-winning journalist herself, does a very nice job of addressing the challenges and ethical issues facing journalists today. This includes the need to get a scoop, the 24/7 pressure to put out digital updates, the financial stresses on news organizations as customers move away from traditional news sources, the competition between local and network operations, and even the public’s expectations that they should get to be involved in the reporting process. There was a lot that made me think, although I have no solutions.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Sadly, I had trouble really getting into *Off the Air*, mainly because I found many of the characters to be over-stereotyped. Jolene’s competitor and nemesis, JJ, relies on her looks to get by; the victim is a nasty far-right shock radio host; the station manager makes decisions based on his wife’s whims; there’s a buzzword-spouting consultant; and even Jolene’s possibly well-intentioned but ultimately nosy neighbor. I understand that stereotypes exist because there are lots of people who fit them, but there’s also a lot of nuance in the world, and *Off the Air* could have used a bit more of that.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  Overall, I thought that the good outweighed the bad, and I would still recommend *Off the Air* to read. However, if you lean far to the right in your politics and might agree with the right-wing victim, you probably won’t enjoy this read. Definitely not an issue for me, but YMMV.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Off the Air* didn’t fully live up to its promise for me, it was still worth the read. The engaging mystery and thought-provoking exploration of journalistic challenges were highlights, though the over-stereotyped characters detracted from my overall enjoyment.

I prefer thrillers over straight mysteries, so this may be the main reason the book didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Behind-the-Scenes Insight:**  \n  I appreciated the behind-the-scenes look at the TV news industry, but it felt overdone. The book delved too deeply into the industry, to the point where it became overwhelming and too \"inside-baseball\" for my taste.  \n\n- **Setting and Local Details:**  \n  The extensive information about Arizona was excessive.

I found myself just wanting to finish the book rather than being engaged by the plot.  \n\n- **Potential Alternative Focus:**  \n  I think I might have enjoyed the book more if it had focused solely on the TV news industry instead of combining it with a murder mystery.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book offers an interesting glimpse into the TV news industry, it was overshadowed by an unengaging murder mystery, excessive local details, and characters that didn’t resonate with me. It wasn’t my cup of tea, but readers who enjoy straight mysteries and detailed industry insights might find it more appealing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story follows Jolene Garcia, a reporter delving into the murder of controversial radio host Larry Lemmon. While the mystery of Larry's killer drives the plot, the police investigation comes across as unrealistic, particularly their oversight in thoroughly testing the studio and focusing solely on toxicology results. Additionally, Jolene's pivotal moment—her last interview with Larry before his death—fails to significantly influence the narrative.",
            "Jolene's poor decisions and relentless quest for information made her a frustrating character throughout the book. Oliver's storyline seemed superfluous; his absence wouldn't impact the plot. Surprisingly, my favorite character turned out to be Norma, the obnoxious neighbor.",
            "The book offers an in-depth look at the media's inner workings, exploring the relationships, positions, and rivalries among networks. While it is informative, the depiction of the media environment feels excessively stressful, and the character of David, who frequently uses the term \"sexy,\" is rather off-putting.",

            "The book shows promise but requires substantial rewrites, beta reading, and editing. It feels underdeveloped and could benefit from significant trimming—ideally to around 100 pages—by removing irrelevant details. For instance, the explanation of kimchi adds little to the plot and serves as an example of the excessive information that detracts from the story. This over-explanation is reminiscent of a podcast segment where a reporter elaborates on the obvious.",
            "I sought an entertaining escape into a murder mystery featuring reporters and a controversial radio star, but instead, the book immersed me in real political drama, including references to Trump and divisive political views. I encounter these issues often in reality and preferred to avoid them in my fiction.",
            "I finished this book, which is a positive sign. While it nearly pushed me to my limits at times, I found enough to keep me engaged despite its flaws.",
            "Marketed as a murder mystery, the book leans more towards lecturing about the life of a news reporter than unraveling the mystery itself. It reads like a cheesy educational film, prioritizing exposition over entertainment. While this book didn't resonate with me, I believe it may appeal to readers who appreciate detailed explanations and political themes."

It didn’t annoy me to the point where I couldn’t read it, though I was super close a few times. I kept reading despite its flaws.  \n\n- **Potential and Execution:**  \n  I saw the book’s potential, but it seriously needed more rewrites, beta reading, and editing. It felt underdeveloped and could have been significantly shorter—around 100 pages max—if irrelevant details were cut.  \n\n- **Pacing and Relevance:**  \n  The book included too much unimportant information that didn’t contribute to the plot. For example, it explained what kimchi is, which had nothing to do with the story. This over-explanation reminded me of a podcast segment where a reporter unnecessarily explains obvious things.  \n\n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n  Marketed as a murder mystery, the book spent more time lecturing about what it’s like to be a news reporter rather than focusing on the mystery. It felt like a cheesy educational movie, heavy on lecturing and weak on entertainment.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  I wanted to escape reality with a fun murder mystery involving reporters and a controversial radio star, but the book delved into actual political drama, including Trump and polarizing political takes. I hear enough about these issues in real life and didn’t want them in my fiction.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  While this book wasn’t for me, I think there will be people who enjoy it, especially if they don’t mind over-explanation or political themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was fine but fell short of my expectations.

It follows Jolene, a 29-year-old reporter at Phoenix TV-4, as she relentlessly seeks the truth behind the murder of controversial broadcaster Larry Lemmon. The fierce competition among local and national reporters to be the first to break the story heightens the tension throughout.",

However, the use of nicknames such as \"sexy,\" \"nachos,\" \"snail,\" and \"Sherlock\" feels unnecessary and undermines the characters' depth.

While multiple suspects are introduced, their storylines are abandoned as soon as the chance for an exclusive fades, leaving the mystery feeling secondary to the broader commentary on media ethics. *Off the Air* follows Jolene, a TV news reporter navigating the cutthroat world of media, with the murder of conservative radio host Larry Lemmon serving as a backdrop to explore the industry's ruthless nature.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n  - The story is a cozy mystery set in Phoenix, Arizona, featuring a controversial conservative radio talk show host, Larry Lemmon, as the victim.  \n  - The amateur sleuth, Jolene Garcia, is a TV reporter aiming to move beyond \"fluff\" pieces and take on more significant assignments.  \n\n- **Mystery and Plot:**  \n  - The mystery was intriguing, and while I suspected the police and Jolene were on the wrong track at one point, I couldn’t figure out the murderer or their motive.  \n  - The inclusion of a journalist as the sleuth was a perfect fit, offering an inside look into broadcast journalism, including the challenges posed by social media and declining live news viewership.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Jolene’s ambition to prove herself sometimes made her come across as slimy, though I felt empathy for her due to the immense pressure from her bosses.  \n  - Her friends and coworkers seemed to give up on her quickly, which added to her struggles.  \n  - A one-sided romantic subplot felt awkward and unnecessary, detracting from the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  - The story delves into hot political topics due to the victim’s ultra-conservative, shock-jock persona. This occupies a significant portion of the narrative, which readers should be aware of.  \n\n- **Potential for Series:**  \n  - If this becomes a series, I’d be interested in reading more about Jolene, as I anticipate her character will grow and become more grounded after her experiences.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Off the Air* is an engaging cozy mystery with a unique journalist protagonist and an insightful look into broadcast journalism. While some elements, like the awkward romantic subplot and Jolene’s occasionally unlikable behavior, didn’t work for me, the mystery itself was compelling, and I’d be open to reading more about Jolene in future installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I found the storyline of “Off the Air” engaging, especially for a debut novel with a mystery twist. It captured my attention, and I finished it in just a few hours. I appreciated the trigger warnings at the beginning, allowing readers to prepare as needed. The author developed a backstory for the main character that hints at a potential sequel, but it didn't significantly enhance this story. While I usually enjoy historical details, the frequent asides—such as the discussion on Native American schools—felt extraneous and disrupted the narrative flow. The book could benefit from tighter editing, as some sections seemed unnecessary or distracting, impacting the pacing.",
            "I found the main character unlikable due to her frequent whining and lack of social awareness, especially when she confronts someone at a funeral. Her incessant complaints about her rival were frustrating; I often wished she would take action instead of just venting. Additionally, Jim's unwavering support for her felt perplexing."

It held my attention, and I managed to read the entire book in a few hours. The author included trigger warnings at the beginning, which I appreciated, as it allowed readers to check the list if needed.\n\n- **Authenticity of Journalism/Reporting:**  \n  The sections relating to journalism and reporting were the most realistic, which is understandable given the author’s past experience in that field. The portrayal of the “rush to be first” versus the “rush to be accurate” in modern times felt very relevant and well-executed.\n\n- **Character Development (Main Character):**  \n  I didn’t particularly like the main character. She whines a lot and seems to lack social awareness, such as when she confronts someone at a funeral. Her constant complaints about her rival were also annoying—I kept wishing she would take action instead of just complaining. Jim’s unwavering support for her felt a bit bewildering.\n\n- **Backstory and Subplots:**  \n  The author created a backstory for the main character that felt like a setup for a follow-up book, but I’m not sure it added much to this story. Additionally, while I usually enjoy historical tidbits in books, the frequent asides in this novel (e.g., the discussion about Native American schools) didn’t seem to contribute to the overall plot and even caused the story to halt momentarily.\n\n- **Pacing and Editing:**  \n  The story could have been much tighter with more editing.

Quotes like “... isn’t that unethical? Journalists are supposed to present the facts and other people’s opinions. Not our own opinion.” highlight the tension between ambition and integrity. However, Jolene’s actions often contradict these principles, which I found confusing and somewhat disappointing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jolene is portrayed as an ambitious and driven local TV reporter, but her single-minded focus on career success detracts from her empathy and relatability. Her lack of a personal life, friendships, or even a hint of romance made it hard for me to connect with her. I would have liked to see her have an “aha” moment about the importance of balance in life.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The premise of the story—a controversial radio host’s suspicious death and Jolene’s edge as the last person to interview him—is excellent. However, the murder mystery itself wasn’t particularly compelling, despite the presence of multiple suspects. I did appreciate the minor twist in how the murder was carried out.  \n\n- **Narration and Performance (Audiobook):**  \n  Voice actress Marcella Black delivers an exceptional performance, capturing Jolene’s determination and the competitive nature of her field. Her narration added depth to the story and made Jolene’s struggles more engaging.  \n\n- **Insight into Journalism:**  \n  Written by an experienced reporter, the novel provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the cutthroat world of local news. As a journalism major, I found this aspect particularly intriguing, though it also made me grateful I minored in business.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Off the Air* is a promising debut with a strong premise and insightful portrayal of the journalism world. However, the protagonist’s lack of balance and relatability, along with a somewhat predictable mystery, detracted from my overall enjoyment.

However, I found the narrative structure distracting. The plot frequently stalled as the author explored journalistic themes, making it feel more like a reporter's daily routine than a murder mystery. Furthermore, many passages about Phoenix did not contribute to the advancement of the plot.",

Frustrated by her inability to secure exclusives, she begins to compromise her ethics in an attempt to outshine her less scrupulous rival.

This internal conflict highlights the tension between getting the story first and getting it right, which is a central theme of the book.  \n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n  The book explores timely and important topics, such as journalistic ethics, the pressure to break news quickly, and the balance between social media engagement and traditional news media. While these themes are thought-provoking, they often overshadow the plot, making the story feel more like a commentary on journalism than a cohesive narrative.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Books:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book lays a solid groundwork for understanding TV journalism. A follow-up book focusing on Jolene’s career could be intriguing if it were more plot-driven.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book offers insightful commentary on journalism and features a relatable protagonist, its narrative structure suffers from frequent digressions that detract from the plot.

            "The plot fell short of expectations. Jolene, a news journalist, struggles to adapt to social media, which feels unrealistic in today's landscape where most news outlets have already embraced it. The murder mystery surrounding a controversial radio personality lacks depth and intrigue. Jolene's ongoing defeats at the hands of her rival, JJ, are frustrating, and the resolution of the mystery is ultimately unsatisfying.",

JJ, the rival journalist, was one-dimensional, relying solely on her sex appeal to overshadow Jolene.

The author's overuse of backstory for every character, even the minor ones, felt more like a space-filling tactic than a meaningful enhancement to the narrative.",

However, the narrative leaned more towards journalism and behind-the-scenes drama than on solving the case. While this perspective was intriguing, it somewhat detracted from the mystery itself. The identity of the killer was predictable, but the motive was both understandable and well-articulated.",
            "Jolene Garcia is a driven protagonist, constantly seeking the next big story, but her readiness to harm others for her ambitions can make her unlikable. While her backstory—growing up in the foster system, being adopted by her grandmother out of obligation, and her childhood fear of dogs due to an attack—feels somewhat clichéd, it does provide context for her character. Additionally, her past mistake of filing an inaccurate report at her previous job adds depth to her current struggles.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The novel revolves around Jolene Garcia, a reporter covering the suspicious death of controversial talk show host Larry Lemmon. This event presents a significant opportunity for Jolene to elevate her career by breaking a major story. The plot delves into the competitive nature of modern journalism and the lengths reporters go to for a scoop.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Jolene Garcia is portrayed as ambitious and determined, but her methods are often unpopular and she steps on many toes. Neither Jolene nor many other characters in the book are particularly sympathetic or likable, which may affect reader engagement.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The story offers a revealing look at how modern news organizations operate, particularly in the age of social media. It highlights the pressure reporters face to make stories go viral and capture public attention. The book also critiques the hierarchical structure of TV stations, describing them as dictatorships driven by corporate and shareholder interests.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing of the novel is notably slow, which may detract from the overall reading experience. Despite this, the story has potential as a one-hour TV drama, suggesting its plot and themes could translate well to a visual medium.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel provides an insightful critique of modern journalism and the pressures reporters face, its slow pacing and lack of likable characters hinder its overall impact. The story’s premise and themes are compelling, but the execution may leave readers wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 (rounded up from 2.5)."

While the tempo picked up significantly towards the end, the overall narrative felt sluggish due to numerous tangents and historical anecdotes, such as the origins of a highway's name or local laws. Although these details offered insight into Jolene's character, they ultimately distracted from the main story.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story revolves around Jolene Garcia, a TV news reporter, who investigates the murder of a controversial radio host. While the premise is intriguing, I found the pacing to be slow at times. The book often delves into extensive background information about journalism, local and national politics, and Arizona state news, which made it feel more like an in-depth exploration of journalists' lives rather than a focused mystery plot.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Jolene Garcia is portrayed as a determined and ambitious reporter who is willing to cross ethical boundaries to get her story. While this adds complexity to her character, I personally couldn’t relate to her choices. Additionally, the use of silly nicknames for people in the news industry felt unnecessary and reminiscent of high school antics.  \n\n- **Research and Authenticity:**  \n  The author’s research into journalism, politics, and Arizona’s local news scene is evident and adds a layer of believability to the story. This attention to detail makes the book feel authentic and well-informed, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Themes and Appeal:**  \n  The book offers a fascinating look into the world of journalism, making it a great read for those interested in the field. While the mystery aspect took a backseat at times, the insights into the profession were engaging and educational.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel provides a well-researched and authentic portrayal of journalism, though the slow pacing and focus on background details over the mystery plot may not appeal to all readers. I would recommend it to those with an interest in journalism, as it offers valuable insights into the profession.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 Stars  \n\nThank you NetGalley and St. Martin's Press/Minotaur Books for the opportunity to read this ARC in exchange for my honest review."

            "The murder of shock jock Larry Lemmon serves as the central event, yet the narrative prioritizes the competitive and frenetic world of news reporting over the mystery itself. The relentless pursuit of the next sound bite overshadows the investigation, leading to a rushed and underwhelming resolution that feels like an afterthought. While the story begins strong, it loses momentum around page 100, prompting me to skim through repetitive scenes, particularly Jolene's constant racing to sites and knocking on doors. A tighter pacing would have better maintained engagement.",

I think I would’ve enjoyed the book more right off the bat if I’d known this going into it.  \n\n- **Insight into Journalism:**  \n  I had no idea how absolutely cutthroat and competitive it is for journalists! While the book sensationalized things to make it an enjoyable and humorous read, I appreciate the insight into the media world that it provides.  \n\n- **Mystery Elements:**  \n  I would’ve liked the mystery side of things to be a bit more present throughout and to have had the opportunity to explore other characters more.  \n\n- **Character Development (Main Character):**  \n  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the main character, Jolene Garcia, and that made for a bit of a slow read at times for me. Jolene frequently discusses what it means to be a true journalist and emphasizes the importance of accurate reporting, then proceeds to rush into situations and focuses on seemingly the wrong aspects to try to get ahead in her career (e.g., focusing more on trying to win an Emmy than ensuring her story is actually good).  \n\n- **Format Experience:**  \n  I alternated between reading an e-book version and listening to the audiobook and really enjoyed the audiobook version! The narrator does an excellent job at embracing the character and maintaining the reader’s attention.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book provided an insightful and humorous look into the competitive world of journalism, it fell short of my expectations as a mystery novel.

She is under immense pressure as her station shifts to digital reporting in real time with social media teases. Jolene has built good sources by being fair and releasing information only when approved, but she seems to have little life outside of her work, always on call for breaking stories.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The story intensifies with the death of a man Jolene recently interviewed, putting her under even more pressure since she possesses his last interview. The tension is palpable as she constantly pushes for more information, risking personal safety and angering her sources.  \n\n- **Moral and Ethical Choices:**  \n  I didn’t like the pressure Jolene was under or how she rationalized some of her choices, such as relentlessly pursuing people for information. Some of her \"friends\" criticized these decisions, and I agree, but Jolene faces a lose-lose situation: she risks unemployment or being taken off the air if she doesn’t push for the story.  \n\n- **Character Likability:**  \n  While I found the story interesting, it was hard to like the characters.

On this point, it was clear the author knew her stuff.  \n\n- **Characterization and Connection:**  \n  I had a difficult time connecting with Jolene.

            "The ending was intriguing, as the author effectively resolved the main storyline of Larry's murder while leaving several secondary plots open, hinting at future developments, especially in character relationships. The core narrative follows Jolene's investigation into Larry Lemmon's murder, which is skillfully crafted and offers a compelling look at the ruthless world of journalism. The mystery kept me guessing, given that the victim was a controversial shock jock with numerous enemies, resulting in a wide array of suspects and motives. I was taken aback by both the identity of the murderer and their motive, though I found it impossible to condone their actions.",
            "I had mixed feelings about Jolene. Professionally, she embodied the ideal news reporter—focused and always three steps ahead of her competition. However, her personal ruthlessness was off-putting. The qualities I admired in her work became unappealing when the narrative shifted to her personal life.",

Professionally, she was everything I thought a news reporter should be: focused and three steps ahead of her competition. However, personally, her ruthlessness didn’t do her any favors. Everything I liked about her while she was working turned me off when the author switched to her personal life.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  - The main storyline centers on Jolene’s investigation into Larry Lemmon’s murder, which was well-written and provided good insight into the cutthroat nature of reporting. The mystery kept me guessing, as the victim was a shock jock with many enemies, leading to numerous suspects and motives. I was shocked by both the identity of the murderer and their motive, though I couldn’t condone their actions.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  - I was very interested in the behind-the-scenes look at how a reporter works a story, and the book did explore this effectively alongside the murder investigation. However, the story felt a little flat when the focus shifted away from the newsroom and onto Jolene’s personal life.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  - The ending was interesting, as the author wrapped up the main storyline (Larry’s murder) but left other secondary storylines unresolved. This sets up potential for future developments in the series, particularly in how relationships evolve.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Off the Air* offered a compelling look into the world of reporting and a well-crafted mystery that kept me engaged.

The narrative has a cozy feel, with the protagonist interviewing people and ultimately attempting to solve the mystery on her own, showcasing her determination as a one-woman show. Overall, it was an engaging read.",
            "The protagonist, Jolene, left me feeling conflicted. Initially, I thought I was on her side, but her increasingly questionable and rude actions in pursuit of a story made me rethink my stance. Her journey becomes one of redemption, but only after a significant event at the end. As a non-journalist, I found myself wondering if such behavior is typical in the field—hopefully, this portrayal is an exaggerated take for entertainment purposes. Additionally, I felt the characterization of her newsroom colleagues—Alex, Gina, and Elena—was lacking. While they seemed supportive of Jolene, I didn’t get a clear sense of their personalities or motivations. I was also confused about the source of the animosity towards JJ; was it purely jealousy? More background on that dynamic would have helped me empathize with Jolene's feelings."

The different spin here is that we aren't following the detectives or police but a journalist searching for her exclusive scoop on the story. Overall, it was a good story. It gave cozy vibes because this woman was not the police but was still interviewing people, and by the end, she was trying to solve the mystery all on her own, as a one-woman show.\n\n- **Characterization (Main Character):**  \n  The FMC (Jolene) was iffy in my mind. I thought I liked her and was on her side, but then she started doing super questionable and outright rude things to try and get a story. It made her story sort of one of redemption because she realized she was wrong—but only after \"the big thing\" that happened at the end. I'm not a journalist, but is this what they do for a story? I hope not. I mean, this is fiction, so hopefully, this is going to the extreme for entertainment factor.\n\n- **Characterization (Supporting Characters):**  \n  I was missing more characterization among the newsroom friends. Alex, Gina, and Elena all seemed to be on Jolene's side, but I didn't get enough of them. I was a bit confused about where the 'hatred' of JJ came from. Was that all due to jealousy? More background on that situation might have cleared it up and made me feel more sympathetic for Jolene's feelings towards JJ.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Off the Air* by Christina Estes was an enjoyable murder mystery with a unique journalist perspective.

It’s unclear whether it’s meant to be a mystery, a day-in-the-life story of a journalist, or a satire. The mix of these elements feels uneven and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Journalism Angle:**  \n  The portrayal of journalism is well-executed, likely because the author, a journalist herself, draws from personal experience. There’s a moment where the protagonist, Jolene, attempts to ask questions at a funeral, which briefly evokes sympathy before feeling morally questionable.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The author immerses readers in Phoenix through random infodumps. While the facts shared are interesting, they disrupt the narrative flow and feel out of place.  \n\n- **Satire and Political Commentary:**  \n  The satire is decent but not groundbreaking. The frequent mentions of politics, including Trump and MAGA, stand out as unusual for a novel. While this might be tied to the election year and help sell books, it doesn’t add significant value to the story.  \n\n- **Title and Series Concept:**  \n  The title “Off the Air” is fine, but “Not A Detective” would have been more fitting. Jolene’s involvement in the case stems from her role as a journalist, not a desire for justice, which the current title doesn’t fully capture.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book struggles to define its identity, blending mystery, journalism, and satire without excelling in any one area.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The story revolves around Jolene Garcia, a local television reporter in Phoenix, who investigates the murder of a controversial conservative radio host, Larry Lemmon. While the premise is intriguing, the pace is slow, and the murder lacks the excitement I expected. The ending, though justified, didn’t leave me fully satisfied.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jolene is a determined journalist with a unique advantage—she conducted Larry’s final interview. However, many characters are unlikeable, making it hard to connect with them. This also made it plausible that anyone could have been guilty.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story provides a behind-the-scenes look at the life of a journalist and highlights the cutthroat nature of modern multimedia journalism, including the role of social media. While it includes many facts about Phoenix, AZ, these details felt like unnecessary filler and didn’t add much to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The novel explores themes of ambition, the changing landscape of journalism, and the lengths people will go to be number one. However, the heavy political undertones and triggers throughout the story were a drawback for me, as I prefer to avoid politics in my reading.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n  As a debut novel, it shows promise but could benefit from more polished writing and a juicier, less fluff-filled storyline. The slow pace and unnecessary details detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an interesting premise and offers a glimpse into the world of journalism, it falls short in execution. The slow pace, unlikeable characters, and heavy political themes made it less enjoyable for me. However, as a debut, it shows potential, and with some fine-tuning, the author could deliver a stronger story in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nI would like to thank NetGalley, Minotaur Books, and Christina Estes for providing an advanced reader copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

I enjoyed the local tidbits about Phoenix and its surrounding cities.\n\n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n  As a huge fan of thrillers and murder mysteries, the “whodunnit” aspect of this story pumped up my interest even further. Unfortunately, for me, “Off the Air” missed the mark on that front. The whole murder mystery just fell flat. What I have an issue with is the story itself, which became a study in journalism rather than the thriller/mystery I was anticipating at the onset.\n\n- **Character Engagement:**  \n  I was not at all invested in the characters, and thus, I didn’t even care enough to hate them as some other readers have voiced in their reviews.\n\n- **Themes and Ethical Dilemmas:**  \n  Though I can certainly appreciate the struggles and ethical dilemmas faced by those in the media, that was not the story I signed on to read, hence it was not the story for me.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I have no issue with the writing, per se, or even the political undertones.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I was very tempted to pull a DNF, but I pushed through, hoping to feel something other than boredom. What I ultimately came to feel is best described as indifference.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the local details and the exploration of ethical dilemmas in journalism, “Off the Air” failed to deliver the thrilling murder mystery I expected. The lack of character engagement and the shift in focus from a mystery to a study of journalism left me feeling indifferent.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.25-2.5 STARS"

I'm not a person who really watches local or mainstream news broadcasts, and this story doesn't make them seem appealing at all.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the read and would be interested to see more from this author. It was a very nice debut mystery, and I appreciated the strong sense of place and timely context.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

If you’re sensitive to political leanings (of any side), this might not be the book for you.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Off the Air* offers an engaging behind-the-scenes look at local news stations and maintains interest until the end, its frequent tangents into unnecessary background information and overt political leanings may detract from the overall experience.

The story captures the intense competition, politics, and numerous suspects surrounding Larry’s death, keeping the investigation dynamic and engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jolene Garcia is portrayed as a determined journalist racing against other reporters to secure exclusives. Her persistence and the challenges she faces in her investigation add depth to her character. The array of suspects, including those who both loved and hated Larry, adds complexity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  While the book is mostly interesting and delivers a surprising reveal of the killer, it slows down in certain sections due to unnecessary added information. This affects the overall flow of the story.  \n\n- **Authenticity and Expertise:**  \n  As a debut novel by a former news reporter, the book benefits from the author’s firsthand experience in the field, lending authenticity to the portrayal of the journalism industry.  \n\n- **Content Advisory:**  \n  The review mentions a content advisory, indicating that the book may contain material that some readers might find sensitive or triggering.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel offers an engaging and authentic look into the competitive world of journalism, with a compelling protagonist and a surprising twist in the mystery.

            "This cozy mystery was enjoyable, with a neat ending that met my expectations for the genre. However, it didn't particularly stand out.",
            "I struggled to connect with the heroine, Jolene. Her excessive chatter, impulsive decisions, and somewhat whiny demeanor made her come across as bratty. Despite her intriguing background as a former foster kid, it lacked the depth I expected. There was more telling than showing, resulting in a lack of emotion and introspection that left her feeling flat.",
            "The author’s journalism background seems to influence the story's tone and style, emphasizing the 5 W’s and H (who, what, when, where, why, and how). While this approach lends the narrative a factual and straightforward quality, it ultimately lacks emotional depth.",
            "I appreciated the insights into the competitive landscape of TV journalism and the industry's inner workings. The inclusion of historical events, like the origin of the Emmy and the media's role in the Caycee Anthony case, enriched the narrative and added authenticity. The author's expertise and firsthand experience were evident throughout the piece."

She talked way too much, made poor decisions, and came off as rather whiny and bratty. She felt like a ticket holder to the hot mess express.

            "The plot was intriguing, and the mystery captivated me as Jolene, the protagonist, pursued the story and potentially solved the murder while reporting on it.",
            "I found Jolene to be a somewhat unlikable main character. Although her cutthroat nature as a reporter is an intriguing trait, her attitude toward her colleagues often felt off-putting. The narrative highlights how her relentless pursuit of stories alienates those around her, yet they conveniently return to assist her in solving the mystery, as if nothing had transpired. This inconsistency undermines her character's credibility.",
            "The writing style didn't resonate with me. Although the mystery was intriguing, the narrative was somewhat difficult to follow.",

While she was portrayed as a cutthroat reporter, which was a great trait, her attitude toward her colleagues was annoying.  \n  - The story mentioned that her relentless drive to get the story was driving people away, but they would magically reappear to help her with the next step in the mystery as if nothing had happened.

The city’s potential as a backdrop was largely ignored.\n\n- **Pacing and Tangents:**  \n  The pacing was uneven, with the author occasionally going off on tangents that didn’t contribute to the story’s advancement. For example, while Jolene is buying painkillers, the author digresses into a discussion about the Tylenol murders, which felt irrelevant and disrupted the narrative flow.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was an okay read but fell short in several areas. The lack of character development, underutilized setting, and uneven pacing detracted from the potential of the story. While the premise was intriguing, the execution left me wanting more depth and focus.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While the book is engaging and informative about Arizona, its pacing and narrative structure could have been more focused.

It didn’t fully captivate me, and I found it difficult to stay invested in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book offered an interesting glimpse into the cutthroat world of journalism and had moments of intrigue, the slow pacing, lack of a traditional mystery structure, and the MC’s self-serving motivations made it a less engaging read. It was decent but not outstanding.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Three and a half stars downgraded to three stars.  \n\n*Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an early review copy in exchange for my thoughts.*"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Believability:**  \n  The book requires an excessive suspension of disbelief. The idea that two minor radio news reporters from Phoenix would compete for Emmy awards in the same year, let alone be nominated again the following year, is unrealistic and hard to accept. Additionally, the portrayal of a police officer who casually shares case details with a reporter without hesitation is implausible and undermines the credibility of the story.\n\n- **Character Behavior:**  \n  The characters, particularly the police officer, behave in ways that feel contrived and unnatural. The officer’s willingness to divulge case information to a reporter, justified by an \"arrangement,\" is unconvincing and detracts from the authenticity of the narrative. Readers expect investigators to act with more professionalism and discretion.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The author relies on overly convenient methods to convey information, such as the cop’s excessive openness, which feels like a shortcut rather than a thoughtful way to advance the plot. This lack of effort in crafting believable interactions and plot progression made the story unengaging.\n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  The combination of unrealistic scenarios and poorly developed characters made it difficult to stay invested in the story. As a result, I chose not to finish the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile fiction often requires readers to suspend disbelief, this novel pushes that expectation too far with its implausible scenarios and unconvincing character behavior. The reliance on contrived plot devices and lack of authenticity ultimately made the story unappealing, leading me to stop reading before finishing.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

It’s passable for casual reading but doesn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

As someone studying forensic science, I often hear about cases that are ruined by media interference, and this story felt like another example of that. I wish the media would step back and let professionals do their jobs without interference.\n\n- **Setting and Nostalgia:**  \n  The only part of the book I truly enjoyed was its setting in Arizona. Having grown up there, I appreciated the references to the state’s history and the many wonderful things it has to offer. However, I didn’t need to read a mystery novel to learn about these aspects of Arizona.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s setting evoked a sense of nostalgia for me, its portrayal of media interference in forensic cases was frustrating and overshadowed the story. The Arizona references were a highlight, but they weren’t enough to make the novel particularly enjoyable for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There was minimal character development, which made it difficult for me to connect with or care about them.\n\n- **Use of Jargon:**  \n  The frequent use of journalism jargon and lingo, without any subsequent definitions, was distracting and ultimately a turn-off. It hindered my understanding and enjoyment of the story.\n\n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n  I was excited to read a mystery comedy murder, but the elements that drew me to the genre were not effectively executed in the portion I read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial excitement for this mystery comedy murder novel, I found myself disengaged due to the lack of character development and the overwhelming use of undefined jargon. As a result, I did not finish the book, stopping at the 15% mark.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF (Did Not Finish) at 15%."

            "As a debut novel, this book is quite engaging and maintains a good pace that kept my interest throughout. However, I had two main concerns. First, while the protagonist does investigate and piece together information, her approach felt less like that of a detective in a traditional mystery novel. This made the unfolding of the mystery feel somewhat off. Overall, I enjoyed the read, but the mystery aspect could have been stronger.",
            "In this story, the main character, TV news reporter Jolene Garcia, is driven by her relentless pursuit of the story. Initially, she is portrayed as likable and relatable, but as the narrative unfolds, her obsession with breaking news becomes overwhelming. While I appreciate the importance of a compelling story in journalism, I found myself losing interest in whether she would succeed. The supporting cast is diverse and well-developed, adding depth to the narrative. I enjoy when authors create rich backgrounds and memorable characters that interact with the protagonist, as it makes the world feel more authentic and immersive.",

When one presents itself, she goes after it with dogged determination. Jolene Garcia starts off the book as nice and likeable. As the book progresses, to me, she became very much the opposite. She was too obsessed with getting the story. I understand that in the news game, the story is what matters, but I honestly stopped caring if she’d get the story or not.  \n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  As a debut novel, this was quite a readable book. It moved well and kept my interest.  \n- **Characterization and World-Building:**  \n  Its cast of characters were all varied and unique. I like it when an author builds up the background and has memorable characters interacting with the main character. It makes the world more lived in and real.  \n- **Mystery and Plot Execution:**  \n  There were two real issues I had with this book. The other issue I had was the way the mystery unfolded. Yes, she investigated. Yes, she put information together. For some reason, all of that didn’t feel like she was really investigating like a detective would in a typical mystery novel. I hope that makes sense. The whole mystery just seemed…off.  \n- **Overall Impression and Future Interest:**  \n  To sum it up, I liked the book and I’ll be interested to see what the author does with her next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was readable and had a strong start with an engaging main character and well-developed supporting cast, the protagonist’s obsession with the story became off-putting, and the mystery’s execution felt lacking.

However, the abundance of misdirection can feel overwhelming, and the resolution may leave some readers feeling underwhelmed.\n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  The novel shines in its moments of commentary on the evolving landscape of journalism, particularly in the age of social media. These insights offer a thought-provoking look at the industry's challenges and opportunities.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is generally strong, especially in its exploration of journalistic themes, but the narrative cohesion falters at times, impacting the overall reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Off the Air\" is a mixed bag. While it offers an engaging glimpse into the world of television reporting and raises important questions about the media landscape, it ultimately falls short in character development and narrative cohesion. Despite its flaws, the novel provides valuable insights into the journalism profession.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 out of 5 stars."

Determined to uncover the truth and win an Emmy, Jolene’s investigation drives the narrative. While the plot was engaging and better than expected, it didn’t quite reach a 4-star level but was certainly above a 3-star rating.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jolene Garcia is portrayed as a determined and ambitious reporter, driven by her desire to solve the mystery and achieve professional recognition. The connection to real-life reporter experiences adds depth to her character. The mention of Jessica ‘JJ’ Jackson as a rival adds an interesting dynamic to the story.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Christina Estes’ writing style is influenced by her professional background as a reporter, which lends authenticity to the narrative. The author credits J.A. Jance’s Ali Reynolds series as an inspiration, which resonated with me as a fan of Jance’s work. This connection added a personal touch to my reading experience.\n\n- **Author’s Background and Inspiration:**  \n  The author’s note at the beginning of the book provides insight into Estes’ inspiration for the story, drawn from her own experiences as a reporter in Phoenix. This added a layer of authenticity and made the story feel grounded in real-world journalism.\n\n- **Acknowledgements and Additional Content:**  \n  The acknowledgements section was thoughtful, with Estes crediting J.A. Jance for influencing her writing style. I appreciated this nod to a beloved author. The absence of suggested discussion questions in the e-galley was noted, but I expect they will be included in the final published version.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation for Future Work:**  \n  While the book didn’t fully meet my expectations for a 4-star read, it was enjoyable and better than a 3-star rating. I look forward to Christina Estes’ next novel, as her debut shows promise.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“Off the Air” is a solid debut mystery-thriller with an engaging plot and authentic characters, driven by the author’s real-life reporting experience.

The narrator did a good job, but even with the improved format, I didn’t exactly love the book.  \n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The story is heavily embedded in politics and focuses on how journalism is changing with the times. This made it feel less like a brief escape from reality, which is what I typically seek in a cozy mystery.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the author’s expertise in journalism shines through, the novel deviates from the cozy mystery genre I expected, leaning more into political commentary and the darker side of journalism. The audiobook format improved my experience, but overall, the book didn’t fully resonate with me due to its heavy themes and tone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While the story had its merits, several plot elements felt unrealistic, particularly from my background in radio and journalism. For example, the presence of three outside cameramen at the TV station seemed implausible; most reporters are trained to handle equipment, set up shots, and edit their own segments. Additionally, the depiction of radio shows with an engineer, reminiscent of *Frasier*, felt outdated. A reporter would likely face repercussions for considering a conversation with CNN before conducting a formal interview with their own station. I also found the fun fact digressions about topics like cyanide and landscapes unnecessary, as they disrupted the narrative flow. Finally, the reveal of the killer felt abrupt and left me more confused than satisfied.",
