            "The plot was repetitive and circular, making the story tedious and difficult to engage with. The pacing was excessively slow, causing the narrative to drag and struggle to progress. The ending was implausible and over-the-top, especially the notion that the mind could cure stage four cancer, which felt unrealistic and frustrating. Additionally, the new age themes were off-putting and undermined the story's credibility.",
            "The premise of a current partner seeking a new love for their significant other comes across as controlling and manipulative rather than romantic. Ben's actions, while intended to be caring, feel self-serving; he prioritizes his desire to ensure Harper's well-being and witness her art show before his death. Additionally, Harper's secrecy about her relationship with Leo adds to the frustration, appearing selfish. The characters lack complexity and depth, making them feel one-dimensional. Furthermore, Ben's stage four pancreatic cancer is portrayed inconsistently, with unrealistic moments of activity, such as hiking, that contradict his supposed hospice care."

            "The story features a unique structure, alternating between chapters titled \"What Is\" and \"What Was.\" In the second half, it shifts into the realm of Magical Realism, incorporating elements such as Tarot card readings and the manifestation of wishes during a full moon.",
            "Ben and Harper's relationship embodies a classic \"Hallmark\" romance—sweet and sentimental, featuring charming moments like the \"Name three things\" game. In contrast, Harper's connection with Liam feels more genuine than her marriage to Ben. Ben's selflessness shines through as he encourages Harper to seek new love before his passing.",
            "The first half of the book felt overly sentimental, which didn't resonate with me. However, the second half, despite its fairy-tale elements, was much more enjoyable. Central themes of love, loss, and self-discovery are well-explored. The writing style is engaging, blending emotional depth with whimsical touches. That said, the pacing is uneven, with the first half dragging a bit due to its excessive sentimentality.",

The introduction of Liam, Harper's former love, adds depth and tension to the plot. The alternate reality segment offers a refreshing departure from the main narrative, allowing a glimpse into a different life for Harper.

The final moments between Ben and Harper, along with Harper's reflections on her love for both men, are particularly poignant.",

            "This book beautifully broke my heart, leaving a profound emotional impact. The depiction of pain and illness was both striking and heartbreaking, yet it held a certain beauty. The inevitability of the ending was devastating yet uplifting, evoking tears and smiles at the same time."

            "The book was ultimately unconvincing and inconsistent. Ben, the male main character with stage four cancer, is portrayed as the healthiest terminal patient imaginable. His active lifestyle, including mountain climbing and outdoor activities despite a supposed sun allergy and weakened immune system, felt unrealistic and contradictory. The miraculous resolution of his cancer at the end, coinciding with Harper’s pregnancy announcement, seemed unearned and diminished the story's stakes. Additionally, the middle of the book dragged on with little plot progression, leading me to skim through those sections. The rushed ending left many loose ends and unanswered questions, lacking proper explanation or resolution.",

Ben, the male main character (MMC) with stage four cancer, is portrayed as the healthiest terminal cancer patient I’ve ever heard of.  \n   - His ability to live an active lifestyle, including climbing a mountain and spending time outdoors despite his supposed sun allergy due to a weakened immune system, was unrealistic and contradictory.  \n   - The miraculous resolution of his terminal cancer at the end, after Harper’s pregnancy announcement, felt unearned and undermined the stakes of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Motivation:**  \n   - Ben’s character lacked depth and believability, especially given his terminal illness. His actions, such as climbing a mountain, felt out of place for someone in his condition.  \n   - Harper’s pregnancy revelation and her declaration that Ben now “has to live” felt forced and lacked logical grounding, particularly regarding the implications of radiation treatment on fertility.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Progression:**  \n   - The middle of the book dragged, with little happening to move the plot forward. I found myself skimming through these sections.  \n   - The ending felt rushed and lacked proper explanation or resolution, leaving many loose ends and unanswered questions.  \n\n- **Themes and Message:**  \n   - The intended message of the story was unclear.

            "The time hop element felt out of place and somewhat corny, particularly the \"what was\" chapters, which came across as cheesy and unrealistic. Additionally, the rom-com-style arguments and dramatic exits—like the classic \"Wait! Don't go!\" followed by a hasty departure—were over-the-top and disrupted my immersion in the story.",
            "I found both Harper and Ben unlikable. Ben's insistence that Harper find someone else was not only pushy but also disrespectful, especially given that she was in mourning. The notion that she needed a man to be okay was off-putting, and I resented him for embodying that stereotype. Harper, too, was frustrating; her irrational jealousy and dramatic reactions over a guy she had known for just a week felt unrealistic and exaggerated.",

I loved Rea Frey's previous book, *Until I Find You*, which was a suspenseful mystery, but this romance novel did not work for me at all.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I strongly disliked both Harper and Ben. Ben's pushiness about Harper needing to find someone else was gross and disrespectful, especially since she was in mourning. The idea that \"she needs a man to make sure she's okay\" was vomit-inducing, and I hated Ben for being that kind of character.  \n   - Harper wasn't much better.

I laughed at the time hop parts because they were so unrealistic.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I almost DNF'd (did not finish) the book because of how unenjoyable it was. I was dying to finish it just to be done with it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I disliked this book due to its genre, characters, and unrealistic plot elements, I haven't given up on the author.

This is unusual for me, as I typically reserve such criticism for thrillers with ridiculous premises.\n   - Overall, I didn’t enjoy the book and felt disconnected from the story and characters. I recognize that my opinion might be in the minority, as others may find value in the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book attempted to explore themes of love, loss, and self-discovery, it fell short for me due to its unoriginal premise, unrealistic characters, and unconvincing time-traveling element. Harper’s lack of a compelling personality and the overall execution of the story left me unsatisfied. Despite some relatable themes, the book failed to engage me emotionally or intellectually.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It didn't resonate with me, and I found it to be a barrier to fully enjoying the story.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  Most of the relationships in the book felt forced to me. They lacked authenticity, which made it difficult for me to connect with the characters or their interactions.  \n\n- **Plot Concept:**  \n  The central concept of the story—trying to find someone for your wife to love before you're gone—was something I couldn't wrap my mind around. Given my personal experience as a caregiver for my 17-year-old daughter on hospice, the idea of entertaining such a thought felt preposterous. My world revolves entirely around caring for my loved one and cherishing every moment with them.  \n\n- **Moments of Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the parts of the story that focused solely on Ben and Harper's relationship. Their bond was sweet, and there were elements I could relate to, which made those sections more engaging for me.  \n\n- **Personal Timing and Context:**  \n  I recognize that my current life circumstances may have influenced my reaction to the book. Given where I am in my life right now, this story might have been poorly timed for me, which likely affected my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile there were moments I appreciated, particularly the interactions between Ben and Harper, the book as a whole didn't resonate with me.

            "The ending is disappointing, as Harper remains fixated on Liam, seeking him out even after her husband's passing, which undermines the story's potential for a meaningful resolution. While the premise of Ben encouraging Harper to find a new partner before he dies is intriguing, it is poorly executed. Harper's sudden shift in feelings for Liam comes across as unrealistic and forced. The magical realism and alternate reality elements are entertaining but feel disconnected from the main plot. Additionally, Harper's ritual to wish away Ben's cancer and her subsequent alternate life with Liam lack depth and logical progression. The pregnancy subplot feels unnecessary and contrived, particularly as Harper conveniently forgets that she skipped a period.",

She omits the truth about her brief past with Liam, a man she spent only a week with, while fantasizing about a life with him. Her indecision between Ben and Liam is frustrating, especially given the minimal nature of her relationship with Liam. Despite her claims of love for Ben, she continues to harbor feelings for Liam, even after experiencing an alternate reality with him. Her sneaking around and daydreaming about Liam ultimately undermine her professed love for Ben.",

Harper’s flip-flopping emotions and actions make her an unlikable protagonist, and the story’s emotional themes are undermined by its lack of coherence and resolution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1 star for the annoyance caused by Harper’s character, but 2.5 stars overall due to the entertaining story and good narration."

I assumed this book would be somewhat similar but doubted it would be of the same caliber. I am happy to say that I enjoyed this even more than those great books!  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I often feel emotions during books but rarely become emotional. However, there was a moment in this book where I felt in my soul the heartbreak the main characters were experiencing. My only wish is that moment had lasted a little longer and dug a little deeper. It was perfect and left me wanting more.  \n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  As a hospice worker for more than 16 years, this book really touched my heart. I appreciated the various timelines portrayed and how well thought out each life was.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I was concerned I would be let down when the ending arrived, as I was fairly certain I knew what it would be, but I was pleasantly surprised. I usually do not enjoy books with somewhat open endings, but in this case, it was well thought out and perfectly executed.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I thought this was a great audiobook and will absolutely be recommending it to others.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I would like to thank Rea Frey, Harper Muse, and NetGalley for the advanced reader’s copy of this audiobook.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations, delivering a deeply emotional and well-crafted story that resonated with me on a personal level.

            "In this story, Ben, the dying husband, comes across as unlikable. His request for his wife, Harper, to find another partner before his passing feels both disrespectful and outdated, as it disregards her feelings and denies her the space to grieve. Additionally, his decision to invite the New York Times to their home for a week without consulting her is infuriating and shows a blatant disregard for her boundaries. While Harper is admirable for her sacrifices and care for Ben, she often behaves immaturely, reminiscent of a teenager retreating to her room when faced with challenges. Her instant infatuation with Liam feels unrealistic and detracts from the story.",

As I'm not a fan of time travel stories and wasn't in the mood for a fantasy read, this aspect was disappointing. However, if you enjoy such themes, it may appeal to you. The insta-love between Harper and Liam felt unconvincing and excessive. Harper's immature reaction to Liam's ex, despite only knowing him for a week, seemed unnecessary.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n   - The story revolves around a \"what might have been\" or alternate timeline concept, which is a favorite of mine.  \n   - The premise involves Harper, a newlywed whose husband, Ben, is diagnosed with a terminal illness shortly after their honeymoon.  \n   - Ben proposes that Harper find a new partner before he dies, which initially felt like an impossible and uncomfortable idea.  \n\n- **Execution of the Premise:**  \n   - The author, Rea Frey, executed the premise beautifully, creating a parallel universe where Harper is with Liam, the one who got away.  \n   - The story alternates between two timelines: one where Ben is dying and Harper reconnects with Liam, and another where Harper and Liam are together, and Ben is not dying.  \n   - The complexity of Harper’s choice between the two timelines was deeply moving and well-crafted.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The book brought me to tears by the end, as it paid homage to both Harper and Ben’s love and the \"what might have been\" scenario.  \n   - It struck a perfect balance between being emotionally heavy and not overly burdensome.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Suitability:**  \n   - While the book is beautifully written, it might not be suitable for everyone, especially those currently grieving a major loss.  \n   - It’s not a light read but is thoughtfully balanced in its emotional weight.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Recommendation:**  \n   - This is my first Rea Frey novel, and it certainly won’t be my last.  \n   - I highly recommend this book to others, especially those who enjoy alternate timeline stories.  \n   - The book has earned a place on my special shelf, and I’m grateful to the author for gifting it to me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRea Frey’s novel is a beautifully executed exploration of love, loss, and the roads not taken. It’s emotionally impactful, thought-provoking, and perfectly balanced, though it may not be suitable for those in the midst of grief. I highly recommend it to fans of alternate timeline stories and look forward to reading more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Ben's wish for Harper to find love after his death adds significant emotional depth. The narrative explores the \"what if\" scenario, juxtaposing Harper's past love and artistic dreams with her current role as an art teacher. However, the parallel timelines and the \"what if\" concept feel less developed and thought-provoking than in the author's previous work, *The Other Year*.

While it carries the emotional depth and romance characteristic of Rea Frey's writing, it doesn't rank among my favorites from her.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Ben's insistence that Harper find a new love before his death felt inconsiderate, suggesting she needed a man to be happy. The narrative required a significant suspension of disbelief, particularly as Harper continually altered the course of her life.

The story of Ben and Harper's relationship, their grief, and their love was heartbreaking yet healing. It broke my heart and then put it back together.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ben and Harper's relationship is beautifully portrayed. They are passionate, funny, caring, and selfless. Harper's journey, as she navigates her past and present, is compelling. I particularly loved her passion for art and how it was woven into the story as a tribute to her love.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Ben's stage 4 cancer diagnosis and his desire for Harper to find love before he dies. While this premise initially seemed cheesy, the execution was far from it. The book remains focused on their relationship and the grieving process. The introduction of Liam, the guy who got away, adds a new dimension to the story.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book employs time jumps, which I love, as they provide depth and backstory. The magical realism timeline, triggered by Harper's wish, was executed perfectly and added a unique layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Realism and Authenticity:**  \n  Although I’ve never experienced a cancer diagnosis like Ben’s, the portrayal felt very real and raw. The emotions and struggles depicted were authentic and relatable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an emotional masterpiece that beautifully explores love, loss, and healing. The characters are deeply relatable, the plot is heartfelt, and the narrative structure adds richness to the story. I highly recommend it—it’s a must-read!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Ben decides to find Harper someone new to love as his final act of love. While the premise had potential, I found the story far beyond the realm of believability, often feeling inane and, at times, downright insulting.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, Harper and Ben, came across as very immature for their ages. Their actions and decisions felt unrealistic and lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with or empathize with them.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was too simplistic for my taste. It lacked the nuance and sophistication I expected from a novel with such a heavy and emotional premise.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Tone:**  \n  The tone of the story felt forced, with a mix of \"he pushes until she gives in\" dynamics and overly cheesy, sentimental moments. This combination made the emotional impact fall flat for me, despite the inherently tragic nature of the plot.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite high hopes based on glowing reviews from others, I struggled to finish the book and often considered marking it as DNF (Did Not Finish). Ultimately, the story didn’t work for me at all, and I felt like an outlier in my opinion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the novel had potential, the execution fell short for me. The immature characters, simplistic writing, and unbelievable plot made it difficult to engage with the story. Despite the emotional subject matter, the tone and execution left me feeling disconnected and unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
