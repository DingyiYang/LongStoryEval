Nami’s arc stands out, powerfully illustrating how well-meaning but naive young people can be manipulated and radicalized. The other POV characters, including Cordelia, offer brilliant and diverse perspectives that illuminate the tensions and prejudices within minority groups. The relationships are expertly crafted, and the characters are utilized in thought-provoking ways to reinforce the story's themes.",

However, I found this blend to be a genuine reflection of multicultural dynamics. The presence of Kelpies and Selkies drawn from Scottish mythology, alongside sea dragons inspired by Chinese, Japanese, and Korean folklore, enriches the narrative. With the addition of sirens and sea witches, the world becomes both rich and complex. I'd caution against choosing this book for a light read; it demands attention to fully appreciate its diverse cast and intricate storyline.",
            "This novel is far from a light-hearted exploration of Asian mythology beneath the sea. Instead, it tackles profound themes such as politics, prejudice, tension, and xenophobia.

I’m glad I went into this one with a blank slate.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  This is not a light-hearted \"under the sea\" Asian mythology novel. It delves deeply into heavy themes such as politics, prejudices, tensions, and xenophobia. The story reflects the complexities of multicultural societies, particularly the tensions between humans and Fathomfolk, as well as internal conflicts among the Fathomfolk themselves.\n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  The book incorporates a mix of mythologies and names from various backgrounds, which some reviewers have criticized as a \"mish mash.\" However, I found this blend to be a realistic representation of multicultural dynamics. The inclusion of Kelpies and Selkies (inspired by Scottish myths) and sea dragons (reminiscent of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean folklore) added depth to the world. There were also sirens and sea witches, among other characters, making the world rich but complex. I wouldn’t recommend this book if you’re looking for a light read, as it requires focus to keep up with the diverse cast and intricate world.\n\n- **Character Development and Perspectives:**  \n  The story is told through the perspectives of three distinct female characters:  \n  - **Mira:** A half-siren, half-human navigating her career while facing prejudice from both humans and Fathomfolk.  \n  - **Nami:** Initially naive and spoiled, she grows through activism and self-discovery, though she occasionally reverts to her immature tendencies.  \n  - **Serena and Cordelia:** Their storyline is best left unspoiled, but it adds another layer of intrigue to the narrative.  \n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  As a Scottish reader, I appreciated the inclusion of mythical creatures like Kelpies and Selkies, which felt familiar and added a personal touch to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its exploration of complex themes, rich world-building, and well-developed characters made it a compelling read.

It captivated me and kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Character Representation:**  \n  One of the standout features for me was that the key protagonists are essentially female characters, and the story is told from their perspective. This added a refreshing and empowering dimension to the narrative.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Eliza has created a world that is both unique and relatable. Tiankawi is very different from the real world, yet it mirrors some of the same features, issues, and problems that exist in our solely human world. This balance made the setting feel both fantastical and grounded.  \n\n- **Descriptive Writing:**  \n  The descriptive sections are concise but effective. They vividly evoke a sense of Tiankawi as a place, bringing it to life through its inhabitants, their food, and their cultural heritage. Much of this cultural richness draws from familiar elements in our world, making it easy to connect with.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the novel to be a compelling and well-crafted fantasy story with strong female protagonists, a richly imagined world, and evocative descriptions. I highly recommend it to fellow fantasy enthusiasts.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I still remember and reflect on it a week after finishing, unlike other books I’ve loved but quickly forgotten.  \n  - It raises thought-provoking questions, such as how to seek change in the world—through violence or dedication—and explores the pitfalls of both approaches.  \n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**  \n  - The novel follows multiple characters who are trying to create order in a world that distrusts and dislikes them due to their “species” (a metaphor for race).  \n  - The characters are well-developed, and their struggles are poignant and relevant to today’s modern landscape, evoking strong empathy.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  - The book provides deep and relevant examples that add richness to the world, making it feel immersive and meaningful.  \n  - It tackles themes of discrimination, identity, and the struggle for change, which resonate strongly with contemporary issues.  \n\n- **Ending and Character Choices:**  \n  - My biggest gripe is with the ending, particularly a character choice that I didn’t like but respected. This almost ruined the book for me, but it wasn’t enough to overshadow my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my dissatisfaction with the ending, I found this book to be deeply engaging, thought-provoking, and impactful. Its exploration of relevant themes and well-crafted characters left a lasting impression, and I look forward to the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

She collaborates with Kai, the water dragon ambassador, to drive meaningful change. Meanwhile, Nami, Kai’s rebellious sister, joins the rebel group The Drawbacks. Although her naivety and excessive forgiveness can be frustrating, her character undergoes significant growth throughout the story.",

            "*Fathomfolk* presents a richly imagined world dominated by ocean, where humans share the realm with mythical sea creatures known as fathomfolk. The vibrant underwater cities juxtaposed with human-controlled islands establish a striking backdrop. Central to the narrative is the environmental devastation wrought by human industry, which has resulted in climate change and polluted waters.

            "In this story, Mira, a half-siren, breaks barriers as the first fathomfolk to achieve military captaincy, symbolizing strength and progress. Kai, the ambassador for his people, is dedicated to forging a better future, while his younger sister Nami, opinionated and stubborn, finds herself exiled to Tiankawi after a failed heist. She aligns with an anti-human extremist group, seeking radical change. Cordelia, the ambitious wife of a powerful councillor, manipulates from the shadows to enhance her status, wrestling with the corruption within herself and society. A particularly enjoyable side character adds depth and queer representation, and I hope they play a larger role in future installments. However, the romance felt juvenile and resembled insta-love, which detracted from the overall experience. While the plot was somewhat predictable, the unique setting and atmospheric visuals kept the story engaging and fresh.",
            "Tiankawi is a prosperous above-water city where fathomfolk and humans coexist, embodying ideals of unity, peace, and wealth. However, beneath its polished surface lies a more complex reality. The Asian-inspired cafes and bars evoke a warm sense of community and tradition, yet they are tinged with undertones of contempt, pride, and fear. The enchanting, fairytale-like environment is visually striking and original, particularly in its portrayal of the sea and the fathomfolk.",

The Asian-infused descriptions of cafes and bars create a cozy atmosphere of familiarity, community, and roots, yet it is shadowed by contempt, pride, and fear. The magical, fairytale-like setting is visually evocative and fresh, particularly with its slant on the sea and fathomfolk.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  Mira, a half-siren, is the first fathomfolk to achieve captaincy in the military, representing strength and breaking barriers. Kai, the ambassador for fathomfolk, strives for a better future for his people. Nami, Kai’s younger sister, is opinionated and stubborn, exiled to Tiankawi after a failed heist.

            "The semi-drowned world, featuring both underwater and aerial dwellings, is refreshingly imaginative. The introduction of water shifters, humans, sirens, witches, and mythical titans enriches this complex universe. The story adeptly addresses contemporary social issues such as migration, class struggles, and climate catastrophe within a fantasy framework. The fathomfolk, portrayed as underdogs escaping their dying settlements, add significant depth to the narrative.",
            "This story powerfully explores themes of acceptance, fairness, and the freedom to be oneself. It contrasts the revolutionary approach of the Drawbacks with the more gradual systemic change advocated by Mira and Kai. While it delves into darker themes, the narrative also celebrates joy, love, and hope for a brighter future.",
            "This book features two romance plots, though it is not a fantasy romance. The relationship-in-trouble trope between Kai and Mira delves into their struggles with external pressures such as careers and social status. Meanwhile, the slow-burn romance between Nami and Firth, complicated by a hidden secret, has left me eager to see if my suspicions are confirmed in the next installment."

It masterfully blends complex world-building, thought-provoking themes, and compelling characters, making it a standout read. While the pacing started slow, the second half was action-packed and emotionally engaging.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While much of the book was engaging and enjoyable, the ending came across as abrupt and confusing. The introduction of the sand god and Kai's resolution with the dragon pearl lacked clarity and didn't integrate seamlessly with the rest of the narrative. Furthermore, the logic surrounding the whale shark's movements and demise, as well as the mechanics of the dragon pearl, raised several unanswered questions. This left me feeling dissatisfied, though I remain hopeful that the sequel will provide the clarity and closure I seek. The pacing throughout was generally good, and I was excited to keep reading, but the disjointed and rushed conclusion ultimately detracted from my overall experience.",
            "The characters were enjoyable to follow, though they initially felt somewhat flat. Nami stood out as the most well-developed, with her growth and maturity throughout the story being particularly compelling. While Mira was the least developed, I still appreciated her journey. Cordelia captivated me from the beginning; her role as a sea witch added depth to the narrative. Nami's storyline, especially her involvement in the revolutionary movement, was one of the book's most engaging aspects.",
            "The setting was captivating, merging diverse mythologies from East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe into a vibrant, melting-pot city. The premise of humans coexisting with fathomfolk in a water-covered world was intriguing, yet the worldbuilding lacked depth. While it was enjoyable and engaging, it didn't explore its potential as thoroughly as it could have.",
            "This book thoughtfully examines themes of prejudice, institutionalized racism, and the struggle for rights. It prompts readers to consider the limits of fighting for justice and the most effective methods for achieving equality. These themes are seamlessly woven into the narrative, enriching the characters’ motivations and actions."

Despite the flaws, I enjoyed the story and would recommend it to fans of fantasy with rich cultural influences.",

            "One romance subplot has generated controversy, with some readers deeming it toxic and unsettling. However, the author clearly intends to depict this relationship as manipulative and unhealthy, rather than as an aspirational love story. This subplot enhances the narrative's broader themes without romanticizing problematic behavior. The story is engrossing, though the dense world-building requires some adjustment. Once immersed, I found the narrative compelling, propelled by the characters’ struggles and the escalating tensions between humans and fathomfolk. The ideological clashes and personal stakes kept me thoroughly engaged.",
            "The story centers on three main characters: Mira, a half-siren captain in the city guard who champions gradual change; Nami, a young water dragon drawn to radical activism; and Cordelia, a sea witch who manipulates both sides for her own benefit. Nami's naivety and idealism make her a polarizing figure, embodying the passionate urgency of youth. In contrast, Mira's pragmatic approach creates compelling ideological tension. Cordelia is intriguingly duplicitous, though her ultimate motives remain ambiguous, and her storyline's parallels to *The Little Mermaid* can be somewhat distracting. Additionally, some secondary characters feel underdeveloped, particularly one introduced with potential significance who ultimately plays a minor role.",
            "The city of Tiankawi presents a fantastical setting where humans coexist with fathomfolk, magical beings capable of living both on land and underwater. The immersive world-building is initially overwhelming, as readers are introduced to a complex array of water species from various mythologies, each with unique abilities and interactions with water. Tiankawi itself feels reminiscent of 1920s-era Hong Kong or San Francisco, vibrant and culturally rich. Although I desired more insight into the broader world, the focused exploration of Tiankawi became engaging as I acclimated to its intricacies.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The city of Tiankawi is a fantastical setting that blends humans and fathomfolk, magical species who can live both on land and underwater. The world-building is immersive but overwhelming at first, as the reader is thrown into a complex environment with myriad water species from different mythologies, each with unique abilities and interactions with water. The city feels inspired by 1920s-era Hong Kong or San Francisco, bustling and culturally diverse. While I wished for more information about the broader world, the focus on Tiankawi was effective and engaging once I acclimated to its intricacies.  \n\n- **Themes and Metaphors:**  \n  The novel explores themes of immigration, discrimination, and environmental degradation through the lens of the fathomfolk, who are treated as second-class citizens despite their contributions to the city. The metaphor of the fathomfolk as immigrants facing systemic prejudice is not subtle but is powerfully effective. The story also delves into the tension between radical activism and gradual change, as represented by the characters Nami and Mira.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The story follows three main characters: Mira, a half-siren captain in the city guard who advocates for gradual change; Nami, a young water dragon drawn to radical activism; and Cordelia, a sea witch manipulating both sides for her own gain. Nami’s naivety and idealism make her a divisive character, but she embodies the fervor of youth seeking immediate change. Mira’s pragmatic approach contrasts sharply with Nami’s, creating compelling ideological tension. Cordelia is intriguingly conniving, though her endgame remains unclear, and her storyline’s parallels to *The Little Mermaid* were somewhat distracting. Some secondary characters felt underdeveloped, particularly one introduced with potential significance who ultimately played a minor role.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  One romance subplot has sparked controversy, with some readers finding it toxic and unsettling. However, it’s clear that the author intentionally portrays this relationship as manipulative and unhealthy, not as an aspirational love story. This subplot serves the narrative’s broader themes rather than romanticizing problematic behavior.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The story is engrossing, though it takes time to adjust to the dense world-building. Once immersed, I found the narrative compelling, driven by the characters’ struggles and the rising tensions between humans and fathomfolk. The ideological clashes and personal stakes kept me invested throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fathomfolk* is an immersive and thought-provoking novel that tackles themes of discrimination, immigration, and environmental crisis through a richly imagined fantasy world. While the world-building is initially overwhelming and some characters could have been more fleshed out, the story’s exploration of ideological tensions and its nuanced portrayal of systemic prejudice make it a compelling read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Thank you, Orbit and Netgalley!  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I absolutely DEVOURED this book! 😱😍 It was engrossing, with a plot that kept me on the edge of my seat for at least 50% of the story.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The book takes place in a half-submerged, Asian-inspired high epic fantasy world where humans and Fathomfolk (sea creatures such as sirens, water dragons, kappa, etc.) coexist in anything but harmony. The world-building is rich, and the setting is vividly described.  \n\n- **Characters and POVs:**  \n  The story is told through multiple POVs, focusing on main characters like Mira, Nami, and Cordelia. While I loved most of the characters (or loved to hate them), I wish we had seen more of Mira and Kai—they were my favorites! 😍🥰  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The book tackles complex themes such as racial prejudice, interracial relationships, refugee crises, and different ways to enact change. It also features deep political intrigue and a violent rebellious faction, adding layers to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The plot is heavily driven, with some twists that were easy to predict. However, this didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment, as the story remained compelling throughout.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Comparisons:**  \n  I would definitely recommend this book! It’s perfect for fans of *The Drowning Empire Series*, *The Aurelian Cycle*, and *The Little Mermaid*.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes some highly suggestive/low explicit scenes that fade to black (very end of Ch. 1 and 46) and frequent cussing, including the F word.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFathomfolk is a richly imagined, plot-driven fantasy novel with complex characters, deep themes, and a captivating world.

            "The split narrative had its uneven moments, especially around the one-third mark when Mira's perspective was notably missing for an extended period. Although her role is fairly straightforward, her absence was palpable, leaving me wishing for more consistent engagement with her storyline.",
            "**Mira:** Initially, Mira's struggles—both in her career and relationship with Kai—lacked depth. I wished for a deeper exploration of their love story earlier in the narrative to better understand their dynamic before it became strained. While I appreciated the portrayal of the challenges she faced as chinthe captain, her complacency with the system was frustrating, despite her belief in enacting change from within. By the story’s end, her growth felt satisfying and well-earned. \n\n**Nami:** Nami is the quintessential unreliable narrator. Her choices, while often understandable, frequently lead her astray, especially due to external manipulation. She could easily be seen as the primary protagonist, and her growth—though not linear—is noteworthy. \n\n**Serena:** Serena is an exasperating yet captivating character. The unraveling of her plans comes at a significant cost to Tiankawi and others, making her a love-to-hate figure. \n\n**Cordelia:** Cordelia's potential impact in the next book is intriguing, and I'm eager to see how she navigates the challenges that lie ahead.",

I appreciated how diverse cultures intertwine to form the rich tapestry of fathomfolk. Tiankawi effectively delves into the complexities and challenges of cultural integration, despite not achieving perfection.",

The urban setting grounds the story, making it fresh and exciting, while the detailed food descriptions add to the richness of the world. However, the introduction of a major entity felt rushed, and its significance wasn’t given enough time to resonate before its fate impacted the plot.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - **Nami:** A hot-headed, complex protagonist whose outrage and naivety keep the reader engaged. Her journey from confusion to committing large-scale acts of violence is compelling, even if frustrating at times.

            "Mira and Nami are compelling characters striving for better lives for the Fathomfolk, yet they pursue their goals in contrasting ways. Mira's relationship with Nami, her partner's younger sister, adds an intriguing layer to the story. Although Nami occasionally appears overly naive, her connection with Firth hints at deeper complexities that I look forward to exploring in future installments. Cordelia also stands out, though her ultimate intentions remain ambiguous, suggesting potential for further character development down the line.",
            "The writing style is accessible, though I would have preferred a more lyrical approach. At times, it resembles a YA novel, which feels at odds with the story's serious themes and tone.",
            "The portrayal of prejudice within the Fathomfolk community enriched the story, adding depth and realism. The social hierarchy, where Sirens like Mira and Sea Witches like Cordelia occupy lower ranks due to their powers, was particularly intriguing. Mira's struggle to navigate her relationship with a Dragon, the highest in the hierarchy, was engaging, although much of this dynamic was already established early in the book.",
            "The story skillfully blends folklore with pressing societal issues such as xenophobia, classism, and protest. This approach allows for a nuanced exploration of these themes without becoming overly confrontational or overwhelming, as might occur in real life. Central to the narrative is the examination of various forms of resistance—debating whether to work within the system for gradual change or to pursue more extreme measures for quicker results, even at a significant cost."

I was irritated by characters' careless decisions, enraged by betrayal, and frustrated by their inability to see through dubious charms. At the same time, I smiled at tender moments and even teared up once or twice. A story that evokes such strong emotions is one I want to read.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were very believable.

It moves slower in the beginning as the intricate world and magic system are established. Readers who enjoy being immersed in a world’s politics will appreciate this, but those who prefer simpler, feel-good novels might find it challenging.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel offers an intelligent and honest exploration of immigration, class, race, and what connects and separates us from each other and our humanity. Through multiple perspectives, it delves into the fight for equality and the right to exist in safety, reminding readers that there is more than one way to fight a war.\n\n- **Sequel Potential:**  \n  The book sets up beautifully for sequels, and I can’t wait to read them. It has all the earmarks of a first novel in a duology or series, with a rich foundation laid for future installments.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEliza Chan’s debut novel, *Fathomfolk*, is a captivating and thought-provoking read that combines enchanting storytelling with deep social commentary.

The author clearly invested significant effort into crafting both the physical and political aspects of this world, making it rich and immersive.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The story serves as a metaphor for social issues such as immigration, racism, and climate change.

The use of fathomfolk as a metaphor for race was obvious but well-executed.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The three main characters—Mira, Nami, and Cordelia—are distinct and well-developed. Mira, a half-human/half-siren, has a deep connection to the city of Tiankawi. Nami, a water dragon, often frustrated me, making me want to \"smack some sense into her.\" Cordelia, a politically motivated sea witch, was intriguing, and I wished to learn more about her backstory and plans.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot felt rushed toward the end, but it effectively set up the groundwork for a potential sequel. Despite the pacing issues, the story remained engaging.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  The novel skillfully straddles the line between YA and adult fiction, which is an impressive achievement.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fathomfolk* is a strong debut novel with rich world-building, well-developed characters, and thought-provoking themes.

I found myself confused and struggling to grasp all the information.  \n  - The second half improved significantly as the plot started to fall into place and became more engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - There was a lack of description for the characters, making it difficult to form a strong visual image of them. I never looked up generic images, and the book didn’t provide enough detail to help me visualize them.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The message of the book is important, and I’m eager to see how everything unfolds in the sequel.  \n  - With most of the extra details, character introductions, and backstory established, I expect book 2 to be a breezier and more enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had mixed feelings about the novel due to its overwhelming first half and lack of character descriptions, the second half improved significantly as the plot progressed.

Chan avoids info-dumping and instead weaves the setting into nearly every chapter, creating a vivid tapestry of visuals and experiences. I could easily picture Tiankawi and every scene's setting.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character structure is unique, featuring a romance for one main character and a stable, established relationship for another. The main characters are well fleshed out, with detailed backstories and motivations. However, secondary and tertiary characters lacked depth, leaving me wanting more dimension from them.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The plot has many loose threads that aren’t fully developed in this book, likely to be addressed in the sequel. Some twists introduced brand-new information without relying on earlier hints or foreshadowing, which felt jarring. Around 80% of the way through, I encountered a flood of new details and lore that I wished had been integrated earlier.  \n\n- **Timeline:**  \n  The timeline is challenging to follow due to the lack of explicit transitional statements. It’s hard to determine the impact of events because the timeline often jumps without clear indication.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic system is fascinating and revealed through observation rather than info-dumping. The scenes showcasing magic were stunning and added depth to the world.  \n\n- **POV Structure:**  \n  The multi-POV approach, featuring an ensemble cast rather than just two lovers, was refreshing and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book serves as a direct parallel to modern social justice efforts, making it impactful and relatable. I found it moving to see the events of Tiankawi mirroring real-world issues in my home state in the US.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Fathomfolk* is a breath of fresh air in the fantasy genre, with its rich worldbuilding, unique character dynamics, and thought-provoking themes. While there are areas for improvement, such as the timeline clarity and secondary character development, it’s a book I highly recommend.

            "I found the characters to be quite juvenile, often resorting to whining, and the romance felt similarly immature. This was surprising, as the book isn't marketed as YA. Nami stood out as my favorite character; she refused to be a follower, questioned the status quo, and showed genuine care for humans, even in their time of need. We could use more people like Nami in our world.",
            "The concept of dragons, kelpies, sirens, and other fathomfolk striving for a peaceful coexistence with humans is rich with potential. Unfortunately, the author fails to fully realize this potential, as the fathomfolk come across more as oppressed humans than as distinct species. I found myself repeatedly reminding myself that they were not human, as the narrative did not effectively convey their uniqueness.",
            "The message that being different doesn't equate to being bad, and that diverse species can coexist peacefully, is both important and resonant.",
            "I found the political unrest in the book captivating, which kept me engaged throughout. Although I had some concerns about the characters and world-building, the plot's intrigue was enough to maintain my interest.",
            "I had high hopes for this book, especially given its stunning cover and my anticipation for its release. Unfortunately, it didn't resonate with me as I had hoped."

        "conclusion": "While I didn’t connect with this book as much as I had hoped due to the juvenile characters and underdeveloped world-building, I appreciated its important message and the political intrigue that kept me engaged.

It was one of my highest anticipated reads of the year, and the cover is absolutely stunning. However, I didn’t jive with this one as much as I had hoped.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I didn’t particularly like the characters. They felt very juvenile, with a lot of whining, and the romance also came across as immature. I wasn’t expecting this juvenile feel since the book isn’t marketed as YA.\n\n- **World-Building and Concept:**  \n  The idea of dragons, kelpies, sirens, and other fathomfolk trying to forge a peaceful life with humans had so much potential. However, I don’t think the author utilized the fathomfolk effectively. They felt like oppressed humans rather than distinct species, and I had to keep reminding myself they weren’t human because nothing in the book effectively conveyed their uniqueness.\n\n- **Themes and Message:**  \n  The message about how being different does not mean you are bad, and that different species should be able to live together in peace, is very important and resonated with me.\n\n- **Plot and Engagement:**  \n  I enjoyed the political unrest in the book; it was what kept me reading. Despite my issues with the characters and world-building, the plot had enough intrigue to hold my interest.\n\n- **Favorite Character:**  \n  Nami was probably my favorite character. She didn’t want to be a follower, questioned things, and cared about humans despite everything, even in their time of need. We need more people like Nami in our world.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I will still continue this series. I’m hoping this was more of a set-up book for what’s to come, and I’m optimistic about the future installments.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t connect with this book as much as I had hoped due to the juvenile characters and underdeveloped world-building, I appreciated its important message and the political intrigue that kept me engaged. Nami stood out as a compelling character, and I’m looking forward to seeing how the series evolves.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐ (rounded up)"

            "I liked Kai, but I wish we had seen more of him and that his character had been developed further. He was genuinely good, yet I craved more depth. I loved Mira and her resilience in living without her siren, despite being mistreated for it. In contrast, Firth gave me bad vibes from the start; he struck me as a manipulative leader who used charm, particularly with women, to achieve his goals. I believe he completely played Nami, especially after his harsh treatment of her when she refused to kill the titan. He’s sneaky, and I suspect he will cause major problems in the future.",
            "Tiankawi is a fascinating setting, and I enjoyed exploring how its inhabitants have adapted to life in structures above the water. The clear divide between fathomfolk and humans is well portrayed, and I appreciated the varying perspectives that illustrate how fathomfolk navigate their world. The sand gods and titans piqued my interest, and I felt there was more to their story, particularly the intriguing concept of a world resting on the back of a giant turtle. However, some elements felt underdeveloped or were left unresolved, such as the city’s power source derived from pakalot draining and water weaving, which was mentioned but never revisited. This seemed like a missed opportunity for deeper exploration of the fathomfolk's challenges.",

However, the narrative accelerates significantly in the final third, featuring intense fantasy action and heightened suspense. Additionally, the plot deviates from the conventional quest structure typical of epic fantasy, which may not appeal to all readers.",

            "Set in the half-submerged city of Tiankawi, a pseudo-paradise where humans and Fathomfolk—water spirits and mythological creatures—are meant to coexist, the story reveals a stark reality: the Fathomfolk are treated as second-class citizens, forced to wear pakalot bracelets that suppress their magic and inflict harm for defiance. The narrative follows three main characters—Mira, Nami, and Cordelia—as they navigate this unjust society and strive to improve the lives of the Fathomfolk in their own ways. With a strong political undercurrent that reflects real-world issues, the story is both thought-provoking and engaging. It skillfully balances these themes with character-driven storytelling, maintaining a pace that keeps readers invested. However, some character arcs and relationships could benefit from further development. The bittersweet ending leaves readers anticipating what comes next without feeling like a cliffhanger.",
            "**Mira:** The first Fathomfolk to become Captain of the Border Guards, Mira faces persistent suspicion and racism due to her siren heritage, despite her commitment to the law. Her idealism and strong work ethic are both commendable and frustrating. Her heartfelt relationships, particularly with Kai (Nami’s brother) and her ailing mother, add significant depth to her character.\n\n**Nami:** A princess from the underwater city, Nami joins the rebellious Drawbacks to combat the injustices faced by the Fathomfolk. Her naivety and misplaced trust often lead her into trouble, and her romance with Firth feels manipulative and underdeveloped. Her connections with Mira and her mother, Trish, are her only authentic relationships.\n\n**Cordelia:** The Sea Witch who uses her shapeshifting magic to live a double life as the human wife of the Minister of Defense.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story is set in the half-submerged city of Tiankawi, a pseudo-paradise where humans and Fathomfolk (water spirits and creatures from global mythologies) are supposed to coexist in harmony. However, the Fathomfolk are treated as second-class citizens, forced to wear pakalot bracelets that suppress their water magic and harm them if they act against humans. The plot follows three main characters—Mira, Nami, and Cordelia—as they navigate this unjust society and attempt to improve the lives of the Fathomfolk in their own ways. The story has a strong political undercurrent that mirrors real-world issues, making it both thought-provoking and engaging.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - **Mira:** The first Fathomfolk to earn a position in the military as Captain of the Border Guards. Despite her adherence to the law, she faces constant suspicion and racism due to her siren heritage. Her idealism and belief in hard work are both admirable and frustrating. Her relationships, particularly with Kai (Nami’s brother) and her dying mother, are heartfelt and add depth to her character.  \n  - **Nami:** A princess from the underwater city who joins the rebellious Drawbacks to fight against the injustices faced by the Fathomfolk. Her naivety and trust in others often lead her into trouble, and her romance with Firth feels manipulative and underdeveloped. Her relationships with Mira and her mother, Trish, are her only genuine connections.  \n  - **Cordelia:** The Sea Witch who uses her shapeshifting magic to live a double life as the human wife of the Minister of Defense. Her arc is the most intriguing, as she navigates her secret life and makes magically binding bargains. Her carefully curated life eventually unravels, setting the stage for potential revenge and darker actions in the sequel.  \n\n- **Themes and Cultural Inspiration:**  \n  The story is rich with Asian-inspired elements, from customs and food to the creatures themselves. This cultural depth adds a unique flavor to the narrative. The themes of racism, inequality, and political struggle are woven seamlessly into the plot, making the story both relevant and immersive.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  The book balances its political undertones with compelling character-driven storytelling. The pacing keeps the reader engaged, though some character arcs and relationships could have been more developed. The bittersweet ending leaves room for anticipation of the sequel without feeling like a cliffhanger.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a richly imagined world with complex characters and thought-provoking themes. While some character arcs and relationships could have been more fleshed out, the story’s cultural depth and political relevance make it a compelling read. The bittersweet ending sets the stage for an intriguing sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

In reality, however, humans disdainfully overlook the fathomfolk, who reside in polluted waters and refugee areas. The inclusion of East and South Asian-inspired water creatures enriches the world-building, adding a unique and captivating dimension.

Eliza Chan’s gorgeous writing made me feel as though I had truly stepped beneath the sea. The depiction of Tiankawi, a city on the ocean, and the tensions between humans and Fathomfolk are richly detailed and compelling.\n\n- **Character Perspectives:**  \n  The story is told through the eyes of three women from different backgrounds, each offering a unique perspective. Serena, a human mother and wife of the Minister of Defence, provides insight into high human society. Nami, a dragon and Fathomfolk royalty, experiences a stark contrast between her sheltered upbringing and her harsh treatment in Tiankawi, learning hard truths along the way. Mira, a half-human, half-siren, struggles to find her place in either world while navigating her new role as Captain of the border guard. While Mira’s perspective is crucial, I felt her voice was somewhat overshadowed by Serena and Nami, despite the synopsis suggesting she was the main focus.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  Chan tackles themes of marginalisation, alienation, and discrimination with a heartbreaking familiarity, drawing from her own experiences. As a disabled queer reader, I found many scenes painfully recognisable. The novel features a queer normative society and addresses issues like environmental pollution, which causes Fathomfolk to develop a chronic illness called gill rot, forcing them out of their natural habitat. The inclusion of diverse marginalised identities is thoughtfully woven into the narrative.\n\n- **Narrative and Tone:**  \n  *Fathomfolk* is equal parts delight and frustration. While the story is engaging and the themes are impactful, the frustration stems from the emotional weight of the topics explored rather than any flaw in the novel. Chan’s approach to these themes through a fantasy lens is both unique and deeply resonant.\n\n- **Comparisons and Originality:**  \n  The novel draws on “Under the Sea” nostalgia and elements of fairytales, with hints of *Waterworld*. However, Chan’s creation stands on its own merits, offering a unique and original story that celebrates the beauty in difference while acknowledging the pain of being different.\n\n- **Ending and Sequel Potential:**  \n  The book ends on a dramatic note, promising an exciting sequel. The setup for future developments in the story is compelling and leaves me eager for more.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fathomfolk* is an extraordinary debut that masterfully blends rich world-building, complex characters, and poignant themes of marginalisation and identity. While the synopsis may slightly mislead about the focus of the story, the novel is a must-read for 2024, offering a unique and emotionally resonant fantasy experience. The ending sets the stage for a dramatic sequel, making this a standout addition to the genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

Her narrative tackles the gritty realities of politics, honesty, and the challenges of navigating a corrupt world. In contrast, Nami, a young dragon, is immature and conflicted, easily swayed by the allure of rebellion.

No one is purely good or evil; everyone in the city has baggage and trauma. Their motivations—whether to survive, thrive, or burn it all down—are justified, making the story messy and real.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book felt too long, and I found myself skipping a lot of exposition.

I hope the fallout is well addressed in the sequel.  \n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  The social commentary was spot-on. The city’s issues were effectively portrayed through the perspectives of characters at different levels of power. Nami’s youthful rage and ignorance being manipulated, Mira’s rise as a political token and its impact on her relationship with Kia, and Cordelia’s dual role above and below the waterline all contributed to showing a city on the brink of unrest.  \n\n- **Potential and Sequel:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I am intrigued by the hints of what may happen next and will likely pick up the sequel.

The first 25% of the book was a bit of a slog to get through, but I pushed through and I'm glad I did.\n\n- **Themes and Topics:**  \n  The book touches on so many important themes: racism, interracial relationships, being mixed race, immigration, displacement, diaspora, queerness, and climate change. You can tell just how passionately the author feels about these topics each time they come to light. While the book primarily focuses on East Asian culture, it also showcases the love of South Asian culture through one of the main characters.\n\n- **World-Building and Politics:**  \n  The book has a lot to unpack with the politics of the world, which are important to the story. However, I think taking more time to explore the magic system and the lore/history of the world would have made the ending even stronger.\n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  Romance is not the main focus of this book; it's a pretty minor subplot. However, I really loved Kai and Mira's relationship, which I honestly wasn't expecting. We enter the book with them already together, and I was initially expecting Kai to be nothing more than a plot device for a dramatic breakup. Instead, he surprised me by being an incredibly supportive partner to his hot siren girlfriend and chaotic little sister.\n\n- **Ending and Future Potential:**  \n  I really liked the ending of this book and I'm excited for book two. However, I think the ending could have been even stronger with more exploration of the magic system and world-building.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some initial reservations and a slow start, I found myself really enjoying this book by the end. It tackles important themes with passion and offers a rich cultural perspective, though it could benefit from more detailed world-building and a stronger exploration of its magic system.

The second part of the book is more active, balancing romance, family, friendship, and politics.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The universe is a mix of terrestrial and marine elements, which is complete but complex.

The story is based around a society where oppression exists between humans and “folk,” who are various creatures of the sea.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Chan weaved a fairly complicated world and society together quickly and efficiently. Despite the uniqueness of the universe, the world-building didn’t feel dense; instead, it was lush and seamlessly integrated into the reading experience. I felt up to speed and absorbed into the world really quickly.  \n\n- **Themes and Conflict:**  \n  The politics of Tiankawi, involving unique creatures, were intriguing, though the conflicts themselves felt familiar to any society with vastly different groups of people. I appreciated how Chan contrasted bureaucratic approaches to change with radicalism, highlighting the benefits and pitfalls of both. The complexity of the situation, with no simple solutions, was something I found particularly satisfying.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I liked the characters, especially Mira. However, I wished they had grown a little faster, as they felt somewhat stuck in their ways for the majority of the book. That said, they eventually reached the development I had hoped for.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  My only challenge was that the pacing lagged a bit. I attribute this to the extensive world-building and character dynamics that needed to be established, which likely contributed to the slower feel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I felt this was a super solid start to a fantasy series.

The last chapter left me emotionally broken, especially the scene where they revisit the place where they first shared a meal together.  \n\n- **Relationships (Nami and Firth):**  \n  Nami and Firth’s relationship felt forced and rushed. There wasn’t enough depth to make me root for them as endgame. In contrast, Eun and Nami had more tension and chemistry in just four chapters than Nami and Firth did throughout the entire book.  \n\n- **Character Portrayal (Lynette):**  \n  Lynette’s character was well-written, portraying her as someone determined to change the way Fathomfolk are treated. While her goals aligned with Mira and Kai’s, her methods were more violent, which added an interesting dynamic.  \n\n- **Character Complexity (Cordelia):**  \n  Cordelia’s character was intended to be a complicated mess—someone trying to survive, protect her children, and maintain her position without being discovered.

Well done to the publisher for getting this artist involved.  \n\n- **Blurb and Premise:**  \n  The blurb made the book sound intriguing enough to make me request a copy. The basic premise is compelling: the majority of the action takes place in the partially flooded city of Tiankawi, inhabited by both humans and various fathomfolk creatures (e.g., kelpies, kappas, and dragons). These creatures have come to Tiankawi due to human exploitation of their original homes, facing significant discrimination and doing the jobs nobody wants.  \n\n- **Characters and Perspectives:**  \n  Much of the story is told from the perspective of Mira, a half-siren who is the captain of the border guard. She feels conflicted, as she’s responsible for monitoring entry into Tiankawi but also used to project an image of tolerance that doesn’t reflect reality. Mira is involved in a relationship with a dragon ambassador, whose younger sister, Nami, arrives in Tiankawi. Nami quickly gets involved with fathomfolk radicals.  \n  I found Nami possibly as annoying as she was meant to be, especially when she blindly admires her radical boyfriend despite his questionable ideas. I hope the author intended this portrayal to be somewhat ironic.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  There’s a lot of world-building, with various water-related creatures introduced as characters. However, at times, it feels a bit heavy-handed.  \n\n- **Plot and Twist:**  \n  The book features a clever plot twist at the end, which elevated my rating from 3 stars to 4. It sets up intriguing ideas for the next installment in the series.  \n\n- **Expectations for the Sequel:**  \n  I hope the next book in the series is done well and has a similarly attractive cover.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Fathomfolk* is an intriguing novel with a unique premise, strong world-building, and a compelling twist.

While it has some pacing issues and an ending that may not resonate with everyone, it’s a strong start to a series, and I’m eager to see where the story goes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story centers on three strong female characters—Nami, Mira, and Cordelia—whose perspectives reveal the complexities of life in Tiankawi, a partially submerged city. Their journeys explore themes of representation, class struggles, and self-acceptance, making them both compelling and relatable.",
            "I had high expectations for *Fathomfolk* due to its inspiration from Southeast Asian cultures. As someone who values representation in literature, I found the novel to be a comforting embrace. It effectively explores the histories and connections of various Southeast Asian communities and people of color, shedding light on the struggles faced by those living under oppression. Tiankawi, a city surrounded by a vast ocean, was once a haven for the fathomfolk but has since been marred by human development and pollution. I appreciated the emphasis on political themes over magic in the world-building, though I hope future installments will incorporate more fantasy elements.",

The world-building leans more into politics than magic, which I appreciated, though I hope to see more fantasy elements in future books in the series.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel delves into class struggles and the acceptance of self, exposing the harsh realities of communities living under oppression. Chan’s storytelling brings these themes to the surface in a way that feels both poignant and thought-provoking.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fathomfolk* is a richly layered urban fantasy that excels in cultural representation, character development, and social commentary.

The author excels in developing both the setting and societal structure, leaving a strong impression. While the extensive world-building is commendable, the magic system feels somewhat convenient. Characters can suddenly perform remarkable feats when the plot demands it, yet they may just as quickly find themselves drained of energy or resources when the stakes rise. I would have appreciated a more structured or clearly explained approach to the magic system.",

            "The plot effectively adheres to its premise as a political drama exploring prejudice between humans and fathomfolk. However, the event structure is uneven; some foreshadowing is seamless, while others, like the sudden introduction of the titan, feel jarring. The climax relies on a deus ex machina with the dragon pearl, which, although mentioned earlier, comes across as a last-minute fix. The titan's inclusion is particularly problematic due to the lack of prior hints or explanations. While the resolution of prejudice through the dragon pearl’s wish—granting humans gills—is both brilliant and poetic, the epilogue's depiction of humans adjusting too quickly feels unrealistic.",
            "**Mira:** A strong, ambitious, and caring protagonist, Mira strives to change the system from within. Her healthy and communicative relationship with Kai is a refreshing aspect of the story. **Nami:** Initially naive and privileged, Nami becomes entangled with a revolutionary gang and falls into a toxic, manipulative relationship. Her growth is both realistic and frustrating, and her victimhood is portrayed with sensitivity. **Serena/Cordelia:** As a seawitch antagonist, Serena manipulates her way into human politics. Her self-loathing and ambition make her a compelling villain, and the potential for her future antagonism adds intrigue to the narrative.",
            "The first 150 pages of the book feature choppy prose, characterized by short, simple sentences that disrupt the flow and hinder readability. Additionally, there is redundant description and frequent scene interruptions. However, around the 33% mark, a tonal shift occurs, leading to a significant improvement in the writing. The prose becomes more steady and engaging, making the latter part of the book more enjoyable for readers who persevere through the rough start.",
            "The world-building begins weakly but strengthens as the story unfolds. Tiankawi's multicultural setting is well-realized, though some readers might find it underdeveloped due to the emphasis on social and political turmoil. The incorporation of diverse mythologies and species mirrors real-world diversity, although not all cultures are fully explored."

        "conclusion": "Despite its flaws, *Fathomfolk* is an engaging and thought-provoking novel. The rough start in prose and uneven plot elements are outweighed by the strong character development, compelling world-building, and satisfying resolution. While not perfect, the book shows great potential, and I highly recommend giving it a chance, especially if you can push past the initial 150 pages.",

The plot felt disjointed, and the multiple points of view made it mildly confusing to follow. It felt like I was \"dumped into the deep end\" and expected to navigate a new world, unfamiliar beings, and new characters without much exposition.  \n\n- **Cultural and Folkloric Elements:**  \n  As a white person, I spent time researching the culture and folk/fairy tales referenced in the story, as they were not part of my upbringing. The lack of initial exposition about these elements made it harder to connect with the world early on.  \n\n- **Engagement and Emotional Impact:**  \n  As the story progressed and the pieces began to come together, I found it deeply engaging and poignant.

I’ve been sitting with it for a few days to see if my opinion would change, but it remained satisfying overall. It was a buddy read with Dilliemillie, which added to the experience.\n\n- **Inspiration and Themes:**  \n  The author clearly took inspiration from Asian mythology and Disney, which added a unique flavor to the story. The book explores themes of racism and discrimination in a city built as a sanctuary for both humans and FathomFolk (mythological sea creatures). The emergence of a rebel group causing chaos further complicates the situation.\n\n- **Characters and POVs:**  \n  The story features three POVs: Mira, the Half-Siren Guard Captain; a Sea Dragon; and a Sea Witch. I most enjoyed Mira’s perspective, as she’s a hardworking and compelling character. The other two POVs felt a bit trope-y but were still insightful. The romantic subplots—BF/GF from different sides of the track, the princess falling for the bad boy, and the adoring husband to a pampered wife—added layers to the narrative, along with a sprinkle of teenage angst and gaslighting.\n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  The writing was good, and the pacing was compelling, keeping me engaged throughout. The worldbuilding was great, though I felt the story could have been refined a bit more and included additional world details. I’m hopeful these aspects will be fleshed out in future books.\n\n- **Recommendation and Future Interest:**  \n  Despite some areas for improvement, I will be buying the next book and would recommend this one to others.

Nami, a dragon, aligns herself with the extremist group The Drawbacks, while Mira, a siren, ascends the military ranks to become a captain. Cordelia, a sea witch, emerges as the most compelling character. Drawing inspiration from The Little Mermaid, she cleverly employs her cunning and shapeshifting abilities to elevate her family's status while concealing her true identity. Although she embodies a villainous role, her tragic backstory elicits empathy, leaving me eager to see how her arc develops in the second part of the duology.",

Drawing inspiration from bustling East Asian metropolises like Hong Kong and Ho Chi Minh City, the stark contrast between upper and lower-class areas, combined with vivid descriptions of the waterways, markets, and tramways, infuses the setting with color and vibrancy.",
            "The central conflict between humans and the Fathomfolk, who can transform between human and mythical water forms, is captivating. The book thoughtfully delves into the immigrant experience, portraying the challenges of relocating to an unfamiliar city and how multicultural environments embrace diverse populations. By incorporating lesser-known creatures like kelpies and kappa, alongside references to myths such as Chinese dragons and The Little Mermaid, the narrative beautifully illustrates the theme of cultural coexistence."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The partially underwater city of Tiankawi is my favorite part of the book. Inspired by sprawling East Asian metropolises like Hong Kong and Ho Chi Minh City, the contrast between the upper and lower-class areas, along with vivid descriptions of the waterways, markets, and tramways, brings the setting to life with color and vibrancy.  \n\n- **Core Conflict and Themes:**  \n  The central conflict between humans and the Fathomfolk, who can shift between human form and mythical water creatures, is compelling. The book thoughtfully explores the immigrant experience, examining what it’s like to move to a city that’s not your own, how multicultural cities absorb people, and how cultures intertwine. The inclusion of lesser-known creatures like kelpies and kappa, alongside references to myths like Chinese dragons and The Little Mermaid, enriches the theme of different cultures coexisting.  \n\n- **Characters and Their Arcs:**  \n  The three central characters—Nami, Mira, and Cordelia—each take different approaches to life in Tiankawi. Nami, a dragon, joins the extremist group The Drawbacks, while Mira, a siren, rises through the military ranks to become a captain. Cordelia, a sea witch, stands out as the most intriguing character. Inspired by The Little Mermaid, she uses her cunning and shapeshifting abilities to help her family rise in society while hiding her true identity. Though she’s a villain, her tragic story evokes empathy, and I’m excited to see how her arc unfolds in the second part of the duology.  \n\n- **Allegory and Commentary:**  \n  The real-world allegories in *Fathomfolk* are not subtle but are what make the book stand out. It offers thoughtful commentary on immigration and the immigrant experience, making it a meaningful read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fathomfolk* excels in world-building, character development, and thematic depth. Its vivid setting, compelling characters, and thoughtful exploration of immigration make it a standout epic fantasy. I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy richly imagined worlds with meaningful social commentary.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I appreciate the need to establish a foundation for upcoming books, I wish the story had maintained a faster pace to keep me more consistently engaged. The ending, however, piqued my curiosity about the direction the author will take in the next installment. Despite the pacing issues, the groundwork laid in this book has me intrigued to see how the story will evolve.",
            "The story unfolds through the perspectives of three characters: Mira, Nami, and Cordelia. I was particularly captivated by Mira and Cordelia. Mira's determination to improve the city, coupled with her struggles against setbacks, made her relatable and engaging. Meanwhile, Cordelia's cunning and secretive schemes added an intriguing layer to her chapters. However, I found Nami's perspective less compelling. While her viewpoint was essential for understanding the rebel group, her decisions often felt frustratingly predictable, which diminished my interest in her storyline.",
            "The world-building and magic system in *Tiankawi* are both immersive and expertly crafted. The city itself, with its intricate social dynamics between humans and Fathomfolk, provides a captivating backdrop for the narrative. The literal and metaphorical hierarchy, in which humans regard Fathomfolk with disdain, enriches the setting and adds significant depth to the story.",

The Illumicrate physical copy also has a lovely colorway, adding to its appeal.  \n\n- **Writing:**  \n  The book is written in third-person POV, which creates a sense of detachment and made me feel like an observer rather than being fully immersed. The world-building is rich, but some details felt lacking. The pacing starts slow but escalates rapidly, which didn’t work in the book’s favor for me. While it’s a decent debut, it needed more polish and doesn’t quite fit within the Adult fiction category.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  This is a political fantasy where agendas heavily restrict freedoms. The inclusion of mythical creatures is intriguing, but their unique abilities aren’t explored in detail, which was disappointing. Despite the complexity of the plot, I personally enjoyed the unfolding events.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I initially liked Mira, but as the story progressed, she became less of a character I wanted to root for.  \n\n- **Romance & Relationships:**  \n  The focus is more on relationship building than romance. If romance was intended, it felt misplaced and somewhat like gaslighting. This isn’t the book for readers seeking heavy romance. However, the relationships are well-developed, with each character standing independently rather than relying on others.  \n\n- **Audio & Narration:**  \n  The audiobook is well-paced, and the different POVs are easy to distinguish. Emily Woo Zeller’s narration enhanced my enjoyment of the book, making it more engaging than it might have been otherwise.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its strengths, such as a captivating cover, rich world-building, and a complex plot, it falls short in areas like pacing, character development, and romance. The audiobook narration added to my enjoyment, but overall, the story needed more polish to fully deliver on its potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars rounded to 4 stars."

The romance between Mira and Kai realistically depicts a married couple grappling with communication issues while maintaining a strong underlying bond.

Despite the abundance of water metaphors, they flowed naturally and effectively set the mood without coming off as purple prose or tryhard. The writing is vivid and immersive, focusing on every sense to create a wholly engaging experience.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**\n  - The worldbuilding is beautifully realized and highly immersive. The descriptions are vivid, allowing the reader to picture the world clearly, akin to watching a Disney movie or *Avatar*. The author’s attention to detail, from the polluted saltwater to the tantalizing foods of the marketplace, makes the setting feel deliberate and well-crafted. However, the introduction of various magical creatures (e.g., kelpies, kumiho, kappa) lacked sufficient elaboration on their appearances, which was a missed opportunity given the book’s strength in description.\n\n- **Plot:**\n  - The plot has a slow build, with a focus on political machinations, which I appreciated. However, there were some issues:\n    - The Cordelia identity reveal felt abrupt and could have benefited from more foreshadowing.\n    - The ending felt rushed, particularly the reveal about the whale, which seemed like a last-minute addition to up the stakes.\n    - Kai’s ending was polarizing; while his sacrifice was in line with his character, the use of an all-powerful object felt like a plot convenience.\n    - Despite these flaws, the twist at the end was intriguing and left me eager to see how the story develops in future installments.\n\n- **Characters:**\n  - The characters are thoughtfully written, even if some are unlikeable:\n    - Nami is an unlikeable but well-written character, representing impulsive, easily influenced teenagers.\n    - Firth is a well-portrayed slimy groomer, adding realism to the story.\n    - Mira is a realistic portrayal of a working woman navigating an unfair system, and her relationship with Kai is frustrating but believable.\n    - Kai is a pushover but represents a non-toxic, supportive masculinity.\n    - Cordelia and Serena’s motivations were unclear, which detracted from the overall characterization.\n\n- **Romance:**\n  - The romance between Mira and Kai is a realistic portrayal of a married couple with communication issues but a strong underlying bond.\n  - Nami and Firth’s relationship is intentionally toxic and cringe-worthy, serving as a critique of grooming and gullibility.

            "The plot, while not entirely original, is well-structured and centers on political intrigue. It explores power struggles and countermoves, with some characters seeking to ascend while others aim to improve the populace's lives. I appreciated the narrative's strategic focus, which allowed for a slower, more thoughtful pace rather than an adrenaline-fueled rush. However, the alternating perspectives of Cordelia, Mira, and Nami could be confusing, especially when shifts occurred within the same chapter. This structure enabled multiple storylines but left little room for secondary characters to develop. Nonetheless, the deliberate pacing aligned well with the story's strategic tone.",
            "The characters in the story present a mixed experience. Nami, one of the protagonists, often feels overly naive, which can be frustrating. In contrast, Mira and Serena/Cordelia stand out as more compelling figures. Mira is a determined and passionate woman who has fought hard for her position, while Serena/Cordelia navigates a morally gray path, manipulating events for her survival. I appreciated that all the perspectives are female, though this sometimes reinforces the stereotype of women operating in the shadows of powerful men. Eun, the librarian, is a positive character, and I hope to see more of her in future installments.",
            "The worldbuilding is visually striking, evoking a city reminiscent of Hong Kong with its unique jurisdiction and waterfront location. However, the setting lacks depth and detail. Descriptions of the city and its inhabitants, particularly the water-related creatures, are insufficient. I often found it challenging to visualize these elements and longed for more elaboration on creatures like kelpies, rusalkas, and selkies, which are frequently mentioned but not adequately explained.",
            "The novel addresses important themes such as environmental pollution, classism, migration challenges, and discrimination. While these subjects are not entirely new, they are explored with nuance and depth, avoiding oversimplification. The author skillfully integrates these issues into the narrative, ensuring they come across as organic rather than forced or preachy."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Fathomfolk* is a solid political fantasy with a well-structured plot and thought-provoking themes. While the setting and some characters could have been more developed, the novel succeeds in delivering a strategic and immersive reading experience. It’s a refreshing change from fast-paced fantasies, offering a slower, more contemplative narrative.",

Her journey reminded me of my own experiences, from growing up in a politically-minded family to raising children and making difficult decisions, such as terminating a non-viable pregnancy.

Their complex desires and interactions provoke thought about the pace and cost of progress, as well as who ultimately pays that price.

The Fathomfolk, represented by diverse sea creatures such as dragons, sirens, and sea-witches, inhabit sea havens, while humans reside in floating cities that contribute to ocean pollution. This setting highlights themes of systemic oppression, as the Fathomfolk are treated as second-class citizens above water and are forced to wear shackles that suppress their waterweaving magic. The narrative illustrates a cycle of survival and destruction: the pollution from floating cities leads to gillrot among the Fathomfolk, who then seek refuge in these cities, further entrenching the cycle. The sea-witches’ magic system is particularly captivating, involving contracts written in their own ink, which becomes toxic if promises are broken.",

Fathomfolk, represented by various sea creatures like dragons, sirens, and sea-witches, live in sea havens, while humans survive on floating cities that pollute the ocean.  \n  - The world explores systemic oppression, with fathomfolk being treated as lesser citizens above water and forced to wear shackles that bind their waterweaving magic.  \n  - The setting is a cycle of survival and destruction: the floating cities pollute the ocean, causing gillrot among fathomfolk, who then seek refuge in the cities, perpetuating the cycle.  \n\n- **Characters and Perspectives:**  \n  - The PoV characters—Mira, Nami, and Cordelia—each approach the disparities in their world differently: Mira seeks to rise within the system, Nami advocates for revolution, and Cordelia manipulates all sides to maintain power.  \n  - The complexity of their desires and interactions raises thought-provoking questions about the pace and cost of progress, as well as who bears that cost.  \n\n- **Themes and Metaphors:**  \n  - The novel uses fantasy to metaphorically explore real-world issues, such as environmental degradation, systemic oppression, and the struggle for equality.  \n  - It avoids offering simplistic solutions, instead embracing the messiness of life and progress.  \n\n- **Relationships:**  \n  - The book portrays a variety of relationships, from romantic and familial to chosen family, ranging from pure and communicative to manipulative and exploitative.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  - The sea-witches’ magic system is particularly intriguing, with contracts signed in their own ink, which poisons them if they break promises.  \n\n- **Critique:**  \n  - The human presence in the story is limited, with humans mostly represented as a broad, oppressive force or a fearful mass.  \n  - The cast is small, but the intertwining PoVs effectively reinforce the worldbuilding and story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a compelling exploration of a richly imagined world, with complex characters and thought-provoking themes. It effectively uses fantasy to amplify real-world issues while avoiding oversimplified solutions. Despite the limited human presence, the story’s depth and intricate relationships make it a standout read. I look forward to the next installment in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story started slowly, making it hard to engage with initially. Its political focus was challenging for me, as I typically enjoy fast-paced and fun fantasy. However, the second half picked up significantly, becoming more action-packed and engaging, which kept my interest throughout.",
            "**Mira:** I appreciated her as a commendable character dedicated to her city and the fathomfolk. However, I would have connected with her more if her past and family had been explored in greater depth. **Kai:** He felt one-dimensional in the first half but became more engaging and central in the second half. **Nami:** I found her frustrating and struggled to care about her. **Cordelia/Serena:** She was the most complex and intriguing character. While I disliked her, I also found myself almost admiring her, which made her compelling.",
            "The world-building in this story is exceptional—imaginative and richly descriptive. The city is intricately mapped, enabling readers to vividly envision its sights, smells, and atmosphere. Additionally, the incorporation of East Asian folklore and myth adds a profound cultural depth to the fantasy world.",

However, I'm glad I persevered, as the second half significantly improved. I would recommend it to readers who are patient and open to a slower, politically dense narrative."

It weaves together a diverse array of folklore, featuring sirens, sea witches, titans, kelpies, kappas, and dragons.

            "I appreciated the unique structure of the story, featuring three main characters (MCs) whose vastly different lives offered diverse perspectives on society. Cordelia, my favorite, was a refreshing chaotic neutral/evil female MC, and I admired her fierce dedication to protecting her family, even when her choices clashed with my own morals. Kai stood out as a character who truly deserved better, while Firth was infuriating. Nami’s arc left me wanting more depth. Although there was some character growth, it felt rushed and only became significant in the last 70 pages of the 417-page book. I longed for greater depth and development, as many characters seemed defined by a single trait, a trend I've noticed in several recent reads.",
            "The imaginative adaptation of a Chinese city, likely Shanghai, was both immersive and captivating. The depiction of racism and class disparity between humans and sea folk—such as dragons, sirens, and sea witches—was strikingly realistic yet infused with magic. While some aspects of the world-building were a bit confusing, it ultimately stood out as a highlight of the story.",

However, I ended up disagreeing with many negative reviews and thoroughly enjoyed the book.\n\n- **Themes and Comparisons:**  \n  The book gave me *Babel* vibes, particularly in its exploration of class and race, though it didn’t match *Babel* in terms of writing or style perfection. The themes were compelling and well-executed.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I loved the unique approach of having three main characters (MCs) and experiencing society through their vastly different lives. Cordelia, my favorite, was a refreshing chaotic neutral/evil female MC, and I admired her unwavering dedication to protecting her family, even when her actions conflicted with my own morals. Kai was a standout character who deserved better, and Firth was infuriating. Nami’s arc left me wanting more from her.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The fantastical adaptation of a Chinese city (possibly Shang Hai) was imaginative and immersive. The portrayal of racism and class disparity between humans and sea folk (dragons, sirens, sea witches, etc.) was both realistic and magical. Some parts of the world-building were a bit confusing, but overall, it was a highlight.\n\n- **Character Depth and Development:**  \n  While there was character growth, it felt rushed and only became prominent in the last 70 pages of the 417-page book. I wished for more depth and development, as many characters seemed defined by a single trait or aspect. This is a recurring issue I’ve noticed in recent books I’ve read.\n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n  The book was fun to read and mostly easily digestible. The ending was conclusive for a first book in a series, and I’m excited to see where the story goes next.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book despite some shortcomings in character depth and development.

I’m glad I did, even though the beginning was rough. At first, I had a hard time understanding the setting, particularly whether scenes were above or below water. The story and characters grew on me after a few chapters.\n\n- **Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The early chapters felt disjointed because they were short and jumped between perspectives without giving me enough time to connect with the characters. However, as the story progressed, everything started to make more sense, and I found my footing.\n\n- **Themes and Political Depth:**  \n  This is a very political novel, tackling themes like racism, privilege, and poverty. The characters’ actions, especially Cordelia’s, drive the political intrigue. Cordelia, the Sea Witch (who gave me strong Ursula vibes, which I loved), weaves a web of unrest in the city to benefit herself and her children. I’m still curious about her ultimate motives and want to learn more about her.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Mira, a half-siren appointed as Captain of the Guard, is a standout character. She works to bridge the gap between communities and is partnered with the ambassador, a dragon who has lived a life of privilege but strives to understand others’ perspectives, despite his flaws. His sister, Nami, gets involved with city rebels, and her naivety leads to significant consequences. The book is largely about women, with the most interesting characters being female, including background figures like Eum, the mysterious librarian. The male characters are less nuanced, but I hope to learn more about them in the next installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its rocky start, this novel grew on me with its rich political themes and compelling female characters. The story’s depth and intrigue, particularly around Cordelia and Mira, kept me engaged, and I’m eager to see where the series goes next.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The political background felt overly simplistic and black-and-white, though the actions of Mira and Kai suggested a more nuanced, gray-scale reality.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite these issues, I did enjoy reading *Fathomfolk*, particularly the second half. It was an okay YA fantasy book, but it could have benefited from more development of the world beyond its surface appearance.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Fathomfolk* had its strengths, particularly in its city-based world-building and moments of enjoyment, it fell short in character development, pacing, and thematic execution. The story had potential but needed more depth and clarity to fully resonate.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "The story was captivating, featuring themes of rebellion and politics that evoke *These Violent Delights*. These elements added depth and momentum to the plot, which was engaging and concluded satisfactorily, despite occasional predictability.",
            "This book centers on four main characters: Mira, a half-human, half-siren officer; Nami, a rebellious dragon; Serena, a social-climbing mother; and Cordelia, a scheming sea witch. While the characters are intriguing and possess well-developed backstories, some come across as somewhat one-dimensional, with one character being particularly grating. Additionally, I wouldn't recommend this book to those seeking romance, as it is not a prominent element of the story.",

This setting evokes elements of *Crescent City* with its vibrant, diverse cityscape and modern technology like trains, while also echoing aspects of *Waterworld* where land is no longer inhabited. Though the world-building could use further development, I appreciated the rich, multicultural city the author envisioned."

I was frequently able to truly visualize the elements of the city.  \n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  One of the things that carried through the entire book was the historic influences of diaspora communities and liberation movements that have arisen due to prejudices, oppression, and racism.  \n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  It took me a little while to truly get into the story. The initial pacing and characterization were a little slow. Eventually, though, as the world and the true plot started to be revealed, I found it was much easier to get caught in the story.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  At times, there was a bit too much focus on the happenings of the city rather than using that time to deepen the primary characters and their interactions. However, I did really appreciate that each character was written to show all of the different ways to approach the issues within Tiankawi.  \n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n  Like I have seen some other reviews mention, I would suggest not going into this as a mythological retelling but as a political work with mythological elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed *Fathomfolk* and am looking forward to the next one.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "The story is engaging, but the multiple points of view can be challenging to follow. Two of the three characters have similar names, while the third uses multiple aliases, which adds to the confusion. Additionally, the third perspective feels unnecessary; her motivations are unclear and seem to exist solely to create chaos without a clear purpose. While this debut fantasy has potential, the execution of the multiple POVs and character motivations could be improved.",
            "The cover design is stunning and visually captivating.",
            "The book explores political themes more deeply than I anticipated, which wasn't to my liking. I typically read fantasy to escape real-world issues, and the revolution and overthrow narrative felt clichéd in the YA genre. However, this is a matter of personal preference rather than a flaw in the book itself.",
            "The book is marketed as an \"adult\" fantasy but reads more like a clichéd YA novel. While it offers a loose retelling of *The Little Mermaid* infused with Asian mythology—an intriguing concept—the execution falls flat, resulting in a cringeworthy experience. A more transparent marketing approach could have set more appropriate expectations."

This mix of politics, wayward youth, and a YA love interest adds depth and complexity to the story.  \n\n- **Engagement and Appeal:**  \n  As someone who felt burnt out on well-written but generic fantasy, this novel helped break my reading malaise. Its originality and willingness to take risks rather than play it safe make it a standout recommendation.  \n\n- **Room for Development:**  \n  While the world-building is fascinating, it feels only partially explored, leaving room for further development in potential sequels.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Romantic Chemistry:**  \n  I am a sucker for romance and couples, but I just couldn’t bring myself to see the chemistry between Kai and Mira. They seem like great friends who communicate well, but I didn’t feel the romance. It wasn’t about passion or intimacy specifically, but perhaps they lacked enough backstory to make their relationship feel fully developed. Something was missing.\n\n- **Character Development (Mira’s Role):**  \n  Mira being appointed as captain despite being fathomfolk is something I stand for, but I felt this achievement was overlooked. It should have been a central focus because it’s such an amazing and significant milestone.  \n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n  I really enjoyed the plot and the plot twists. Everything felt vivid and engaging. The story held my attention and left a strong impression.  \n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  This novel holds a special place in my heart because I read it during my honeymoon in Edinburgh with my husband. The experience of reading it, especially while listening to the audiobook and coloring in my coloring book, made it even more enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed the novel despite feeling that the romantic chemistry between Kai and Mira was lacking and Mira’s achievement as captain wasn’t given enough focus. The vivid plot, twists, and personal connection to the story made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Instead of the typical 'will-they-won't-they' dynamic, we witness a respectful and loving partnership that continues to grow throughout the story. \n\n**Nami:** Although Nami is young and hot-headed—traits that may frustrate some readers—her character is essential. She illustrates how easily young people can be manipulated and indoctrinated into beliefs they think they support. This also highlights how younger individuals can be exploited in relationships. Rather than dismissing rash female teenage protagonists, we should consider the reasons behind their behavior and the choices they make.",

People will pick this up expecting a magical romp through underwater kingdoms and miss the complexity and importance of the book.\n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n  This story, while indeed containing magical elements, comments on the hard truths of current real-world events. The refugee crisis, extremism, migration, and the Asian diaspora experience are explored with depth and nuance.\n\n- **Characterization and Perspectives:**  \n  Using a diverse cast of characters to explore different perspectives, Chan excellently addresses a range of topics. We mainly follow three POVs: Mira, Cordelia, and Nami.  \n  - **Mira:** Mira was my favorite by far; I adored her and her partner Kai. It was so refreshing to read about an already established couple in fantasy. Rather than the turbulent 'will-they-won't-they' stage, we follow a respectful and loving partnership that only continues to grow throughout.  \n  - **Nami:** While Nami was young and hot-headed, which I can easily see as being frustrating to some readers, her character is SO necessary. She shows how easy it is for young people to be manipulated and indoctrinated into methods they think they agree with. The same goes for the ease at which younger people can be used in relationships. I do think people often look down on rash female teenage protagonists when instead we should be considering why they are this way and why they take these decisions.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I loved being immersed in the city of Tiankawi; from rickety huts built on the surface to underwater markets and towering skyscrapers, Chan successfully creates an excellent interpretation of a flooded world as a result of climate change.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFathomfolk is a timely and thought-provoking book that masterfully blends magical elements with real-world issues. With its diverse characters, imaginative world-building, and exploration of complex themes, it’s a story I wholeheartedly recommend.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25/5"

The world-building was probably some of my favorite aspects of the book. Tiankawi is a partially submerged city of stilted buildings, poverty and wealth, as well as humankind and fathomfolk—a conglomerate of uniquely described beings that can live on land or underwater.  \n- **Pacing:**  \n  The book was quite slow for me through the first half, but I understand that some of the world-building needed to progress before the storylines could develop. The second half of the book picked up for me, and I enjoyed the increased momentum.  \n- **Characters:**  \n  I didn’t find the characters to be loathsome, as some readers have, but I did have a hard time figuring out Cordelia’s motives beyond sowing chaos to increase her business opportunities. I enjoyed some of the character changes throughout the story and felt connections with some of them. However, I didn’t particularly enjoy the relationship between Nami and Firth, though I think the reasoning for that will likely be revealed in the second book of the series.  \n- **Ending:**  \n  I didn’t particularly enjoy the ending. There are a lot of political and cultural lines drawn throughout the book, and the ending felt like a bit of a cop-out way to \"bring everyone together.\" It felt out of place and rushed.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Interest:**  \n  Looking back on the entire book, I enjoyed *Fathomfolk*. Despite some pacing issues and my mixed feelings about the ending, I did enjoy the book more toward the end. I will likely read the second book to see what happens to the characters moving forward.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Fathomfolk* had some pacing issues and an ending that felt rushed, the imaginative world-building and character development kept me engaged. I look forward to reading the next installment in the series to see how the story and characters evolve.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/4 stars, rounded up.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley, Orbit Books, and Eliza Chan for allowing me the opportunity to read an advanced reader’s copy of *Fathomfolk* in return for giving an honest review!"

Events flowed naturally, ensuring I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened next. While it wasn’t perfect, any minor issues felt irrelevant because I had so much fun delving into this universe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a solid debut and a great introduction to a new series. I’m truly excited to pick up the sequel when it comes out.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to Little Brown Book Group UK and NetGalley for providing me with an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest opinions. As per the publisher’s request, my full review will be posted on Goodreads on February 15, 2024."

The author effectively conveyed how xenophobia, racism, classicism, and general bigotry affect different people in distinct ways, often driving them to react in opposite manners, sometimes to the detriment of their better judgment. The insights from the characters were extremely moving and relatable, making this aspect the highlight of the novel for me.\n\n- **Character Perspectives:**  \n  Getting to see the story from the perspectives of three different female characters was a great addition. It added depth to the narrative and allowed for a richer exploration of the themes. However, I was a bit disappointed that none of the main characters seemed to be queer themselves, especially since Tiankawi's society was portrayed as queer-normative.

Some parts seemed too Disney-esque (which I’m not a fan of) and scattered, leaving me without a solid sense of the world. I struggled to find a cohesive element to hold onto, which detracted from my overall immersion.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Unfortunately, the writing style wasn’t my preference.

The incorporation of Asian delicacies adds a layer of authenticity, making the setting come alive. However, the frequent mentions of street food hawkers become repetitive and tiresome, detracting from the overall experience.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The book explores heavy and complex themes, such as xenophobic tensions between Fathomfolk and regular humans, set against the backdrop of a decade-long civil war. These societal issues add depth to the narrative, making it politically charged and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The story is told through the perspectives of three main characters: Mira, Nami, and Serena. Unfortunately, connecting with these characters is challenging due to their inconsistent behaviors and lack of detailed history and development. This leaves them feeling underwhelming and underdeveloped.\n\n- **Romance Subplots:**  \n  The book includes two romance arcs. One evolves from an already established relationship, offering a nuanced look at mid-relationship struggles with social status. The second romance, however, feels rushed and lacks believability, with characters succumbing to insta-love. The abruptness of this connection, along with the disregard for evident red flags, makes this plotline frustrating to read.\n\n- **Overall Potential:**  \n  Despite its flaws, *Fathomfolk* remains a fascinating and politically charged read. As the first book in a series, there is potential for improvement, particularly in character development and addressing the identified issues in the sequel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Fathomfolk* delivers a rich and culturally immersive world with thought-provoking themes, it struggles with character development and certain romance subplots.

I’m not sure if it’s the world itself, the writing, or Kai and Mira making out in chapter one. Overall, life is too short to force yourself to consume so-called entertainment that isn’t entertaining.  \n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you, NetGalley and Little, Brown Book Group UK, for this ARC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel did not meet my expectations, and I found it unengaging for reasons I couldn’t fully pinpoint. While I appreciate the opportunity to read the ARC, the story failed to entertain me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The story felt unfocused and would have benefited from a tighter, more concise narrative.  \n\n- **Political Themes and Handling:**  \n  The political elements of the story were problematic. It reminded me of the Marvel approach, where legitimate grievances are undermined by portraying activists as using overly evil methods. The handling of fantasy bigotry and politics could have been more nuanced and thoughtful.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Despite my issues with the story, I became attached to several of the main characters by the end, which added emotional depth to the experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its strengths, particularly in the second half and character development, it suffered from pacing issues, an unfocused narrative, and poorly handled political themes. It would have been more effective as a standalone novel with a tighter structure and better execution of its themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  - The worldbuilding is full and rounded, though clumsy at times.  \n  - There’s a lot of terminology and description introduced early on, which felt overwhelming and confusing, especially for someone who struggles to visualize.  \n  - The contrast between underwater and above-water settings was interesting, but some of the underwater mechanics didn’t work for me.  \n  - I’d love to see an illustrated version with species concept art to help visualize the world better.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The characters are interesting in concept but poorly executed.  \n  - Nami, one of the main characters, is introduced in a cool scene, but her constant reminders of her lack of academic intelligence, rebellious nature, and comparisons to her brother became repetitive and grating.  \n  - All the main characters regularly reiterate their personality traits and struggles, which feels unnatural and artificial, as if the author doesn’t trust readers to remember these details.  \n  - Nami and Mira’s narrative voices are too similar, making it difficult to distinguish between their perspectives.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing feels more YA than adult, despite being marketed as adult fiction.  \n  - Some phrasing is incredibly awkward, with incomplete sentences, repetitive lines, and unnecessary details that need editing.  \n  - The core message feels watered down and frustratingly simplistic.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**  \n  - The introduction is overly long and grating, making the early chapters a slog to get through.  \n  - Some reveals didn’t track logically, which was disappointing.  \n  - I found myself dragging through a good portion of the book and would have likely DNF’d if it weren’t an ARC.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  - The general setting and concept are strong, with a variety of species and a unique blend of underwater and above-water elements.  \n  - The Little Mermaid references were fun and enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an intriguing concept and a richly imagined world, its execution falls short. The characters feel repetitive and underdeveloped, the writing style is awkward and overly simplistic, and the pacing drags. Despite its potential, the book didn’t live up to my expectations, and I found it difficult to stay engaged.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars, rounded up to 3 stars."

            "**Nami:** I struggled to connect with Nami's perspective. Her naivety and lack of awareness about her actions made her storyline frustrating, as she often caused more harm than good, undermining her intentions. **Cordelia/Serena:** While her manipulative nature had potential, it wasn't explored in depth, feeling more like background noise than a driving force in the narrative. **Mira:** In contrast, I found Mira's perspective much more engaging, and the ending left me intrigued about what comes next.",
            "The exploration of the various Fathomfolk species felt insufficient, as the narrative primarily centered on humans and their shapeshifting abilities. This focus diminished the distinctiveness of the magical races. Additionally, the polluted waters hindered the depiction of the Fathomfolk's true forms and powers, which was disappointing. While the idea of humans overshadowing a magical race is intriguing, it remained underdeveloped. Although I recognize the intended commentary, it came across as confusing and lacked adequate explanation."

            "The book's pacing is slow for most of its length, with much of the narrative building toward the final five chapters. Unfortunately, the ending feels awkward and could benefit from further refinement.",
            "The story presents a diverse cast, including a strict commanding officer, a naive political activist, a privileged dragon, and a sea witch who makes deals reminiscent of *The Little Mermaid*. While some characters are compelling, others lack depth due to insufficient character development.",

It was labeled as an Adult novel but came off more as a Young Adult novel, which didn’t align with my expectations.\n\n- **POV Structure and Character Connection:**  \n  I found myself lost trying to figure out which character’s POV I was reading, as the chapters weren’t labeled with the character’s name. This made it difficult to follow along and connect with each character. The POV shifts were abrupt, and by the time we returned to a character, the story had moved to a different point, making it hard to form a strong connection with any of them.\n\n- **Ending and Future Interest:**  \n  The ending did intrigue me about what could happen in book two.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Target Audience and Genre Appropriateness:**  \n  I expected an Adult novel, but this book felt more like a Young Adult (YA) novel with aged-up characters. While I don’t dislike YA, I’m frustrated when books marketed for adults turn out to be YA in disguise. This mismatch in expectations is disappointing for someone like me who is looking for genuinely mature content.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement and Satisfaction:**  \n  The book was fine, but it didn’t fully engage me as an adult reader. I can understand why it receives so many Did Not Finish (DNF) ratings—it simply didn’t meet the expectations of its intended audience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book isn’t inherently bad, it fails to deliver on its promise of being an Adult novel, instead feeling like a YA story with older characters. This disconnect left me unsatisfied and explains its high DNF rate.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The ending was satisfying, but it clearly sets the stage for a sequel, a tactic I find off-putting when so overtly done. I hope the next installment introduces more likable characters. While I appreciated the complexity of the issues and the political intrigue, the plot lost its way for me midway through. The frequent double-crossing became predictable and repetitive, diminishing the overall suspense. The pacing was generally fine, but the book felt a bit too long.",
            "The story had unrealized potential in several characters, and I wished for deeper development. Nami, in particular, is unlikable; her flaws make it difficult to empathize with her. Throughout the 430 pages, her consistently poor decisions, naivety, and perpetual victimhood come across as unrealistic. Additionally, the romantic subplot involving Nami feels uncomfortable, resembling grooming more than a genuine relationship.",
            "The world-building is exceptional. Set in a half-submerged city, the story immerses you in its unique politics and interpersonal dynamics from the start, maintaining your engagement throughout. The diverse array of mythical beings coexisting within this setting adds depth, making the conflicts feel authentic, intricate, and relatable."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book has a stunning cover and excellent world-building, with a rich, mythical setting and complex conflicts. However, the plot became muddled midway, and the unlikeable protagonist, Nami, detracted from my enjoyment. While the pacing was decent, the book felt slightly too long. The ending sets up a sequel, which I hope will improve with more compelling characters.",

As soon as I saw it, I knew I needed to read the book.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The world-building is fantastic. The story takes place in a half-submerged city with its own politics and interpersonal issues, which draw you in immediately and keep you enthralled throughout.  \n  - The abundance of mythical folk living together enriches the story, making the conflicts feel real, complex, and relatable.  \n\n- **Plot and Intrigue:**  \n  - While I enjoyed the complexity of the issues and the political escapades, the plot got lost for me midway through.  \n  - The constant double-crossing became predictable and repetitive, detracting from the intrigue and plot twists.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - There was unrealized potential in certain characters. I would have loved to see their stories develop further.  \n  - Nami, as a character, is completely unlikeable. She is extremely flawed in a way that makes her hard to root for.  \n  - Nami’s decisions throughout the 430-page book were consistently poor, and her naivety and constant victimhood felt unrealistic.  \n  - The romantic aspect involving Nami fell flat and felt uncomfortable, as it seemed more like grooming than a genuine relationship.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  - The pacing felt okay for the most part, though the book felt slightly too long.  \n\n- **Ending and Sequel Setup:**  \n  - The ending was satisfying, though it very clearly sets up a sequel, which I’m not always a fan of when done so blatantly.  \n  - I hope the sequel introduces more likeable characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book has a stunning cover and excellent world-building, with a rich, mythical setting and complex conflicts.

However, Nami felt the least convincing due to her immaturity, though I did notice some growth and am curious to see her evolution in book two. In contrast, I found Firth to be a character I strongly disliked. The relationship between Kai and Mira was a standout, reminiscent of *Crazy Rich Asians* in the best way. While I typically prefer to see how a couple forms, their dynamic won me over, and I’m eager to see how their story unfolds in the next installment.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was pretty incredible. The author presented a detailed reality filled with a variety of species and intricate mythology. It took me a few chapters to understand more about who was who, how the world worked, and to keep up with some terminology, but I then really enjoyed learning more about this new reality.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - **Mira:** Mira's POV was probably my favorite. Her strive for a better world while struggling to be respected as a Fathomfolk captain of the guards among humans, her relationships with people around her, and her secrets made her a rather likeable character. I especially loved her relationship with Kai, who was probably my favorite character of all.  \n  - **Nami and Cordelia:** Nami and Cordelia's POVs felt a bit too one-dimensional, even when their motivations were explained and some character development occurred. It never felt quite enough for me. Characters surrounding them also didn’t strike me hugely, with things left unexplained (perhaps hinting at a sequel?) and limited depth.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The premise of the book was really interesting, and I had high hopes. However, I was not quite blown away. While *Fathomfolk* was an enjoyable read, I was not particularly taken with the events of the story and the style with which they were recounted. It felt quite jumpy at times, with abrupt transitions from one situation to the next (or at times between paragraphs).  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  All in all, it was an enjoyable read, but not one that kept me glued to the pages. I would still recommend reading it, especially for fans of great world-building.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fathomfolk* is a political fantasy with impressive world-building and a compelling premise, though it falls short in character depth and narrative pacing. While Mira’s storyline and the richly crafted world stood out, the one-dimensionality of other characters and the jumpy transitions detracted from the overall experience.

The story had great potential, and the connections between elements were satisfying. However, Nami's character prevented it from reaching its full strength.",
            "Nami's character was a significant drawback for me. She often came across as overly childish and naive for an adult protagonist, which made her cluelessness feel exaggerated and unbelievable. While her innocence served a purpose in the plot, it would have been more effective if she had been cleverly manipulated rather than easily swayed by superficial charm and failing to ask meaningful questions. This naivety skewed the book's tone, making it feel younger than intended. In contrast, Cordelia was a standout character. Though manipulative and unlikable, her actions were understandable and compelling, adding depth to the story and keeping me engaged. Without her, I might have lost interest before the plot fully developed.",

I've been trying to steer clear of YA, and this book seemed to fall into the same trap of misleading advertising. The lack of clarity regarding the characters' ages—never explicitly mentioned—only added to the confusion. I assumed Nami was intended to be an adult, yet her behavior suggested otherwise."

I’ve been trying to move away from YA, but this book seemed to fall into the same trap of false advertising. The ambiguity around the characters' ages (which are never mentioned) added to this confusion, making me assume Nami was meant to be an adult, though her behavior suggested otherwise.\n\n- **Characterization (Nami):**  \n  Nami’s character was a major issue for me. She acted like she was 12, which felt overly childish and naive for an adult protagonist. While her cluelessness was necessary for the plot, it was exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable. She could have been cleverly manipulated instead of being easily led astray by superficial charm and failing to ask meaningful questions. Her naivety skewed the book’s tone, making it feel younger than intended.\n\n- **Characterization (Cordelia):**  \n  Cordelia, on the other hand, was a highlight for me. She was manipulative, unlikable, and often lashed out, but her actions were understandable and compelling. She added depth to the story and kept me engaged. Without her, I might have stopped reading before the plot fully came together.\n\n- **Plot and POVs:**  \n  Despite my issues with Nami, I enjoyed the overall plot and how the different POVs intertwined. The story had potential, and the way everything connected was satisfying. However, Nami’s character held it back from being as strong as it could have been.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I’m undecided about continuing the series. I’ll wait to see reviews for the second book before making a decision.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an engaging plot and a standout character in Cordelia, Nami’s unbelievable naivety and the misleading genre marketing detracted from my overall enjoyment.

The history, political dynamics, socioeconomic issues, food, and the physical city were so well done. I found these parts of the book absolutely immersive and fascinating. There were moments I couldn’t put the book down.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are well on their way to being three-dimensional. Mira, Nami, and Cordelia each had their moments as well-developed fathomfolk with varying, and sometimes conflicting, motivations. Each of the women brought their own layers and depth to the story, and their individual plotlines dueled with each other to provide sufficient tension. I found myself sympathizing with each character at different points throughout the book.  \n\n- **Narrative Consistency:**  \n  Unfortunately, I was frequently thrown out of the story. Each character would have thoughts or actions that felt uncharacteristic of the compassionate individuals Chan was building. While compassionate people can have moments of doubt, anger, or malice, the abrupt shifts in tone to advance the plot disrupted my immersion. These plot points often felt forced and were later discarded, which undermined the overall consistency.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book needed more polishing, particularly in addressing the abusive relationships present throughout the story. This aspect felt underdeveloped and detracted from my enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fathomfolk* is a novel with immense potential, featuring intricate world-building and compelling characters.

I even considered DNF’ing (Did Not Finish) due to the confusing start. However, the story eventually picked up and became easier to follow.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  As the story progressed, each character developed their own clear personality, making it much easier to like them and become invested in their individual journeys.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The story covered a number of important messages, which added depth and relevance to the narrative.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Unfortunately, I felt the ending was a bit rushed, too convenient, and ultimately unfulfilling.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal:**  \n  This is a rich and luscious fantasy story with a lot going for it. However, I think it will divide readers—some will absolutely love it, while others may feel it didn’t quite meet their high expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its slow and overwhelming start, *Fathomfolk* grew into an engaging and character-driven fantasy story. While the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying, the novel’s depth and thematic richness make it a worthwhile read, though it may not resonate equally with all readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 ⭐️⭐️⭐️  \n\n*Thank you to Netgalley and Little Brown Book Group UK/Orbit for my early digital copy of the book.

The story explores the oppression of the fathomfolk and contrasts their lives with those of humans, which is an intriguing concept.\n\n- **Narrative Structure (POVs):**  \n  The story is told through multiple points of view (POVs) to highlight different facets of the narrative and the contrasting lives of humans and fathomfolk.

Each character’s perspective highlighted the unique challenges they faced as fathom-folk creatures, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book delves into politics and social issues, reflecting real-world problems such as racism, power dynamics, and class struggles. These themes were woven into the story effectively and added a layer of complexity to the world-building.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  Unfortunately, the ending undid much of the complexity built throughout the story. It felt rushed and cheapened the overall impact of the narrative. I was so disappointed that I wished I could erase the last hour of reading and imagine a different conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has many strengths, including engaging action, well-developed characters, and thought-provoking themes, the ending significantly detracted from my overall enjoyment. It left me feeling unsatisfied and wishing for a more fitting resolution.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Initially, the book was challenging to engage with, as it begins from Mira's perspective, suggesting she is the main character. However, the narrative quickly shifts to four different points of view within the first few chapters, making it hard to discern the primary focus, especially since the chapters often lack clear POV indicators. The middle section of the book felt slow and dragged on, prompting me to consider abandoning it. At times, I found myself confused about the motivations behind certain events, leaving me uncertain whether this was due to my limited English proficiency or insufficient context within the story.",

The ending was unexpected and satisfying, delivering pure fantasy brain candy.\n  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Certain characters and their actions mirrored those in the Disney movie *The Little Mermaid* to a fault, which I felt cheapened their development.

The magic system, particularly the focus on water magic, was intriguing and well-crafted. However, the melding of different Asian cultures and folklore references from several countries was confusing at times, though not necessarily off-putting.\n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  - The book highlights Asian folklore and water magic, which was a refreshing theme. However, the conglomeration of references from various Asian cultures was noticeable and might be confusing for readers with limited exposure to Asian folklore.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite my initial reservations, I found the book engaging and unique, especially in its portrayal of the magic system and folk characters. I’m excited to see what the next installment in the Drowned World Series brings.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a slow start and some elements felt derivative of *The Little Mermaid*, it ultimately delivered an action-packed, politically charged fantasy with a unique magic system and diverse characters.

It felt like there was potential for deeper exploration that wasn’t fully realized.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Style:**  \n  The narrative often relied on telling rather than showing. Issues were introduced and resolved very quickly, with not enough page space dedicated to developing these moments. This made the pacing feel rushed at times.  \n\n- **Overall Potential:**  \n  Despite these critiques, the story itself is fantastic, and I’m eagerly looking forward to the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel has a brilliant premise and strong thematic relevance, making it a great choice for discussions. However, the world-building and pacing could have been more developed. Nonetheless, it’s a compelling story with immense potential, and I’m excited for the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Personally, I appreciated the book but not excessively.  \n  - Many readers couldn’t even finish it, and I can understand why.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The book felt very cumbersome to me. In my opinion, having three points of view was excessive and made the narrative harder to follow.  \n  - The first 200 pages seemed practically useless, and I, too, considered abandoning the book at that point.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  - A positive note goes to the worldbuilding, which was executed masterfully and in great detail.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The character of Kai is the only one I truly liked, making him my favorite.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - Would I recommend it? If you enjoy fantasy novels that start slow and gradually become rich, if you appreciate strong themes, and if you’re drawn to maritime worlds and oriental culture, then this book is for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its strengths, particularly in worldbuilding and thematic depth, its pacing, structure, and multiple perspectives made it a challenging read for me.

            "This political fantasy explores the governance of Tiankawi and its internal power struggles through three distinct perspectives. Mira, a half-siren and newly appointed captain of the border guard, works to ease tensions among humans, marine creatures, and extremists while advocating for greater rights. Nami, the naive younger sister of Kai, is a privileged water dragon unaware of the world's complexities. Meanwhile, Cordelia, a cunning sea witch, employs manipulation and deceit to secure her position in human society. The story tackles relevant themes such as racism, classism, migration, cultural adaptation, labor exploitation, and environmental issues.",
            "The three perspectives provide a varied insight into the socio-political landscape, yet they feel underutilized. The characters lack distinctiveness, often blending into one another. Furthermore, the frequent and abrupt shifts between narrators, coupled with the short, fast-paced chapters, result in a chaotic narrative rather than a dynamic one. Many plot points are introduced but remain unresolved or are wrapped up too quickly.",

The underwater scenes are particularly confusing, as it is often unclear when the action occurs in the submerged areas of the city.",

The novel, a literary debut, shows promise and potential but doesn’t fully deliver as it should. The plot is relatively simple, set in the city of Tiankawi, a partially submerged city resembling Asian metropolises like Singapore and Taipei. It is cohabited by humans on the surface and the Fathomfolk, the underwater dwellers, in its depths.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story is a political fantasy that delves into the governance of Tiankawi and the power struggles within it. It is told through three perspectives: Mira, a half-siren recently promoted to captain of the border guard, who strives to ease tensions between humans, marine creatures, and extremists while advocating for greater rights; Nami, Kai’s younger sister, a water dragon raised in privilege but naive about the world’s complexities; and Cordelia, a sea witch who uses manipulation and deceit to secure her place in human society. The themes are highly relevant, addressing racism, classism, migration, cultural adaptation, labor exploitation, and environmental issues.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is fascinating but lacks depth. The city and its inhabitants are not adequately described, which can be disorienting, especially for readers unfamiliar with Asian mythology. A glossary or brief descriptions of the creatures, as well as a map of the city, would have been helpful. The underwater scenes, in particular, are confusing, as it’s often unclear when the action is taking place in the submerged parts of the city.  \n\n- **Characterization and POVs:**  \n  The three POVs offer a diverse understanding of the socio-political situation, but they are not fully utilized. The characters lack distinctiveness, making them feel interchangeable at times. Additionally, the frequent and abrupt shifts between narrators, combined with the short, fast-paced chapters, create a chaotic rather than dynamic narrative. Many plot points are introduced but left unresolved or concluded too abruptly.  \n\n- **Political Intrigue and Prose:**  \n  The political intrigue is the book’s strongest element, well-managed and engaging. The prose is simple and direct, making for a smooth and accessible read. However, I would have preferred a deeper focus on the political aspects.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws, the book intrigued me enough to look forward to the second volume, especially with its open-ended finale hinting at new troubles ahead.

            "The story begins slowly, emphasizing intricate political machinations and detailed worldbuilding, which made the first 40% less engaging for me. I initially found it difficult to connect with some characters due to their underdeveloped characterization. However, as the plot gains momentum, it becomes captivating and immersive. Ultimately, the characters' growth and the unfolding narrative won me over.",
            "The novel unfolds through three distinct perspectives, each providing a unique lens on its central themes. Mira, a half-mermaid, endures humiliation yet confronts her challenges with diplomacy. Nami, a dragon, embodies impulsiveness and revolution, often acting without regard for the consequences. Cordelia, a sea witch, is strategic and manipulative, orchestrating events from the shadows. Secondary characters, particularly Kai, also leave a lasting impression; his sweetness and generosity make him my favorite.",
            "The novel presents a richly detailed and immersive world inspired by East and Southeast Asian cultures. The underwater city of Tiankawi, populated by sea witches, mermaids, water dragons, and other fantastical beings, stands out as one of its greatest strengths. The vivid descriptions invite readers to fully immerse themselves in this enchanting setting.",
            "The story delves into pressing themes like immigration crises, exploitation, the dehumanization of immigrants, and environmental pollution. These elements are intricately woven into the narrative, enriching the plot and enhancing its emotional impact.",
            "The novel elicits a spectrum of emotions, from admiration for Mira's resilience and sacrifices for her mother to intrigue in Cordelia's cunning determination. Nami's questionable choices and subtle growth also evoke sympathy. The exploration of love in its many forms—between mothers and daughters, partners, and siblings—adds significant emotional depth to the narrative."

        "conclusion": "Despite a slow and somewhat turbulent start, *Fathomfolk* proved to be a rewarding journey. The immersive worldbuilding, compelling themes, and eventual character development made it a memorable read. I am eager to see how the story evolves in the sequel and will definitely purchase the physical copy of this first volume upon its release.",

The underwater urban landscape of Tiankawi, with its sea witches, mermaids, water dragons, and other fantastical elements, is one of the book's strongest points. The descriptions are vivid, allowing me to fully immerse myself in this magical setting.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The story explores deeply relevant and timely themes such as immigration crises, exploitation, dehumanization of immigrants, and environmental pollution. These themes are woven seamlessly into the narrative, adding depth and resonance to the plot.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The novel is told through three distinct perspectives, each offering a unique approach to the central themes. Mira, a half-mermaid, faces humiliation but fights her battles diplomatically. Nami, a dragon, is impulsive and revolutionary, often acting without considering the consequences. Cordelia, a sea witch, is strategic and manipulative, moving pieces without their knowledge. Secondary characters, like Kai, also leave a lasting impact, with Kai becoming my favorite character due to his sweetness and generosity.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story starts slowly, with a focus on intricate political machinations and detailed worldbuilding, which made the first 40% of the book less engaging for me. I initially struggled to connect with some characters due to their less-developed characterization early on. However, after the initial chapters, the plot picks up momentum, becoming captivating and immersive. The characters' growth and the unfolding of the story ultimately won me over.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The novel evokes a range of emotions, from admiration for Mira's resilience and sacrifices for her mother, to fascination with Cordelia's cunning determination, and even a soft spot for Nami's questionable decisions and small growth arc. The exploration of love in its various forms—between mother and daughter, partners, and siblings—adds emotional depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a slow and somewhat turbulent start, *Fathomfolk* proved to be a rewarding journey. The immersive worldbuilding, compelling themes, and eventual character development made it a memorable read.

            "The story begins with a slow pace, dedicating considerable time to world-building and character development. While this background is essential, it can feel tedious at first. The plot picks up momentum halfway through, becoming more engaging, yet it remains somewhat jumbled and confusing. The ending feels rushed and contrived, resolving key issues too quickly with a deus ex machina. Additionally, the epilogue leaves many questions unanswered, particularly regarding the future of the fathomfolk’s pakalot bands and human efforts to clean the water.",

Mira, a half-siren and the first fathomfolk captain of the guard; Nami, a privileged dragon entangled in an extremist group; Cordelia, a seawitch focused on survival; and Serena, a politician’s wife who manipulates events, each offer unique perspectives. Nami’s descent into extremism is particularly compelling, though at times frustrating. While the multiple points of view enrich the narrative, the sudden shifts within chapters can be disorienting.",
            "The world is vibrant yet somewhat cluttered, featuring a diverse array of fathomfolk species, including selkies, water dragons, kelpies, seawitches, and kappas, each with unique abilities like waterweaving and shapeshifting. Set in a human city where fathomfolk are treated as second-class citizens, they are forced to wear bands that restrict their powers. The polluted waters and ongoing refugee crisis enrich the narrative, although the absence of a map can lead to confusion regarding the city's layout."

It was a decent read with potential, but it fell short of what I had anticipated.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding, particularly the city of Tiankawi and the fantastical marine beings known as fathomfolk, is lush, rich, and easily the best part of the book. I would have loved a collection of short stories exploring the lives and cultures of the fathomfolk.\n\n- **Characterization and Representation:**  \n  The book follows three POVs that mirror real-life struggles and identities.  \n  - **Mira:** As a half-siren, half-human, Mira’s struggles reflect those of biracial individuals, caught between two worlds.

Her love for her daughter is her only redeeming trait.  \n  - **Nami:** A water dragon youth radicalized by a group of revolutionaries, Nami’s storyline is marred by her deeply problematic relationship with Firth, an emotionally abusive and manipulative figure. Their interactions were aggravating to read.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book doesn’t shy away from depicting prejudice, which is meant to be gut-wrenching and thought-provoking.

The sacrifice that leads to this resolution doesn’t feel justified or impactful.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFathomfolk is a book with rich worldbuilding and strong potential, but it falls short in delivering a satisfying narrative.

I even pictured it in an animation style that highlighted the unique features of the fathomfolk.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Unfortunately, the plot felt lacking for me. The story was too long, and the pacing was slow, especially in the middle, which made it hard to stay engaged. While the ending picked up and brought all the characters and plotlines together in an exciting way, the majority of the book lacked enough plot to keep me invested. I tend to prefer plot-driven stories, and this one leaned more toward character- and world-driven storytelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character exploration and development were well done. The story delves deeply into the characters' lives and struggles, which I appreciated. However, I would have enjoyed it more if the stakes were lower and the story leaned into a cozy, slice-of-life fantasy vibe rather than the high-stakes ending and pervasive allegorical racism.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  While parts of the story felt like a cozy, slice-of-life fantasy, the high-stakes ending and the heavy themes of racism toward the fathomfolk made it difficult to categorize it as such. I think I would have enjoyed it more if it had maintained a lower-stakes, cozier tone throughout.  \n\n- **Ending and Sequel Potential:**  \n  The ending was a highlight for me. The plot finally gained momentum, and the characters came together in an exciting way. It set up an intriguing premise for the sequel, and I’m looking forward to picking up the next book, primarily because the worldbuilding was so captivating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fathomfolk* excels in worldbuilding and character development, creating a vivid and immersive setting. However, the slow pacing and lack of plot in the middle made it difficult for me to fully enjoy the story. While the ending was strong and set up an interesting sequel, the book’s tone and stakes didn’t align with my expectations of a cozy fantasy. Despite these issues, the worldbuilding was compelling enough to make me want to return for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The slow pace, coupled with shallow character development and unclear worldbuilding, made the middle of the novel feel like a slog.",
            "The story revolves around three main POV characters: Mira, a half-siren, half-human scholar and captain of the border guard; Nami, the youngest daughter of a sea dragon family; and Cordelia, a cunning sea witch with shapeshifting abilities. The diversity among these characters, both in species and political perspectives, is a notable strength of the novel. The author skillfully highlights the complexities within the fathomfolk community and delves into broader themes of prejudice. However, despite this rich diversity, the characters often come across as one-dimensional. The slower pacing of the plot fails to deepen their personalities, motivations, or aspirations, making it challenging for readers to connect with them or invest in their journeys.",
            "The author creates an expansive and imaginative world filled with a diverse array of sea creatures, both real and mythical. However, the worldbuilding often feels unwieldy and confusing, requiring readers to conduct additional research—such as Googling sea creatures—to fully understand the details. The novel introduces a captivating concept set in a unique fantasy realm inspired by Eastern Asian culture, particularly in the partially submerged city of Tiankawi, where humans and fathomfolk coexist. This rich backdrop is marred by underlying tensions stemming from systemic inequality, as fathomfolk are relegated to the lower echelons of society while humans maintain control over the government."

While the diversity among characters and the imaginative setting are commendable, the lack of character development, unwieldy worldbuilding, and slow pacing dampen the reading experience. I remain hopeful that the sequel will address these issues and expand on the characters and world in a more engaging way. However, as a standalone recommendation, I cannot strongly endorse this first book, as its best aspects feel like they are yet to come.",

It started strong, but for nearly 300 of the 417 pages, the plot felt stagnant, only to rush through significant developments in the final 50 pages. This made the reading feel drawn out, taking me a week to finish.

Mira stood out as the only character I truly connected with, while Kai, my favorite, deserved his own POV. Cordelia and Serena's perspectives were intriguing but lacked depth and background, making it difficult to fully engage with them.

The narration effectively maintains each character's uniqueness while intertwining their arcs.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Plot Potential:**  \n  I loved the idea of different Fathomfolk, such as sirens, seawitches, kappas, and sea dragons, making up the water population. It felt like a wonderful mix of mythology and fantasy. The plot had potential too, with Tiankawi being portrayed as a safe haven that ultimately becomes a center of oppression and racism. Mira’s fight for equality within the system and Nami’s rebellion with an anti-human group could have made for a complex and sensitive narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n  The themes of oppression and racism are relevant and hard-hitting, but they didn’t feel as well thought out or executed as they could have been. The story touched on important issues, but the handling of these themes lacked depth and sensitivity.  \n\n- **Action and Pacing:**  \n  The fight scenes and action at the end of the book were engaging and well-done. However, I struggled to stay invested in the story leading up to those moments. The pacing felt uneven, making it harder to fully immerse myself in the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The characters had a lot of promise but ultimately felt flat. Some of the relationships felt rushed, which made it difficult to connect with the characters on a deeper level.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFathomfolk by Eliza Chan had a lot of potential with its blend of mythology, fantasy, and political themes. While the concept and plot were intriguing, the execution fell short. The themes of oppression and racism, though relevant, weren’t handled with the depth they deserved. The action scenes were a highlight, but the pacing and character development left me wanting more. Overall, it was a promising story that didn’t quite deliver.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 Stars"

            "The story aims for a fast-paced, tension-filled narrative and succeeds at times. However, the pacing is inconsistent, with traumatic moments either depicted in vivid detail or hinted at without resolution. This inconsistency leads to a jarring experience, as emotional stakes often feel absent until they are abruptly introduced.",
            "The story revolves around three main characters: Mira, Nami, and Cordelia. Mira, a half-siren police officer, starts off with promise but quickly becomes cold and unengaging. Nami, the ambassador’s sister, embodies the stereotype of a reckless teenage girl, often making foolish decisions and serving more as a plot device than a fully developed character. Cordelia stands out as the most intriguing figure, skillfully navigating various allegiances for her own benefit; however, her storyline is heavily spoiler-laden and lacks detailed exploration. Overall, the characters feel distant and disconnected, leading to minimal emotional impact during key events.",
            "The writing style struggles to establish a consistent tone, oscillating between whimsical and serious. This inconsistency creates distance, undermining the story's ability to convey its deeper truths.",
            "The novel presents a captivating blend of promising themes and a beautifully crafted world. Set in a whimsical, water-soaked version of Babel, it offers a unique and intriguing backdrop. The exploration of political tensions between the Fathomfolk and humans, viewed through the lens of the Fathomfolk, provides a fresh perspective on conflict and compromise."

        "conclusion": "While *Fathomfolk* has a promising premise, beautiful world-building, and intriguing themes, its cold and distant characters, inconsistent pacing, and uncertain writing style hinder its emotional impact and overall effectiveness.

The setting is described as \"Babel, but make it wet and a touch whimsical,\" which is intriguing and unique. The political tensions between the Fathomfolk and humans are explored through the Fathomfolk lens, offering a fresh perspective on conflict and compromise.  \n\n- **Characters and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The three primary characters—Mira, Nami, and Cordelia—are central to the story. Mira, a half-siren police officer, starts interestingly but quickly becomes cold and uninteresting. Nami, the ambassador’s sister, is portrayed as a young, impetuous teenage girl stereotype, often acting \"too stupid to live\" and serving more as a plot device than a fully realized character. Cordelia is the most intriguing, playing all sides for her own gain, but her story is largely spoiler-heavy and not discussed in detail. Overall, the characters feel distant and disconnected, resulting in little emotional impact when significant events occur.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**  \n  The story should be fast-paced and tension-filled, and it does achieve this at times. However, the pacing is inconsistent, with traumatic moments either shown in stark detail or teased without payoff. This creates a jarring experience, as emotional stakes are often absent until suddenly thrust upon the reader.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style struggles to find its tone, vacillating between whimsical and serious. This inconsistency keeps the reader at arm’s length and detracts from the story’s ability to convey its deeper truths.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Fathomfolk* has a promising premise, beautiful world-building, and intriguing themes, its cold and distant characters, inconsistent pacing, and uncertain writing style hinder its emotional impact and overall effectiveness.

Eliza Chan’s descriptive prose vividly paints sea-scapes and a world being consumed by water, capturing my imagination from the start. The premise hinted at the potential for a complex and immersive narrative, which initially drew me in.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the premise was promising, the plot meandered, with sporadic bursts of action that failed to sustain a consistent level of engagement. The pacing left much to be desired, and the narrative lacked the tight, compelling structure that characterizes other standout fantasy series. The potential for an epic tale was present, but the execution fell short of delivering the immersive experience I anticipated.\n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  One of the novel’s key drawbacks was the lack of connection I felt with the main characters. Despite their individual motivations and varied approaches to a shared goal, none emerged as a character I could truly gravitate towards. The absence of a compelling protagonist hindered my investment in their journeys, and by the book’s conclusion, the lack of true success for any of them left the narrative feeling unresolved and somewhat unsatisfying.\n\n- **Overall Potential and Future Prospects:**  \n  *Fathomfolk* showcases Eliza Chan’s potential as a storyteller in the realm of Asian-inspired fantasy. The world and premise hold promise, but the meandering plot and lack of standout characters prevent the novel from reaching the heights of its comparisons. With room for growth and refinement, Chan’s future works may yet deliver the immersive and captivating experience readers crave in this genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Fathomfolk* is a promising debut with a richly imagined world and premise, but it falls short in execution due to its meandering plot, uneven pacing, and lack of compelling characters.

While the world-building is rich and intriguing, it feels somewhat underdeveloped. The coexistence of creatures from different ecosystems (saltwater and freshwater) is left unexplained, and the portrayal of East and Southeast Asian cultures risks perpetuating stereotypes of them being monolithic.  \n\n- **Power Dynamics and Social Hierarchy:**  \n  Fathomfolk, who have sought refuge in Tiankawi due to civil war or collapsing ecosystems, face significant discrimination and must wear devices that suppress their magic. The power dynamic between magically-gifted fathomfolk and non-magical humans is inadequately explained, with the Great War cited as the reason but failing to address why magic didn’t grant fathomfolk the upper hand. Additionally, there’s internal strife among fathomfolk, with dragons enjoying higher status while those without shapeshifting abilities occupy the lowest rungs of the social hierarchy.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The beginning of the book is confusing, slow, and dense, but I eventually settled into the world. The multiple POVs come together well, and the plot-driven narrative is engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While the characters are enjoyable, there’s potential for more immersive development, which I hope will be explored further in the sequel.  \n\n- **Politics and Themes:**  \n  The politically charged nature of the book is a highlight, and it’s the reason I gave it a higher rating.

            "I only felt a true connection to the characters during Mira and Kai's emotional wedding proposal, which was genuinely touching. However, Samnang's revelation that he had known Serena was Cordelia all along—revealed 86% into the book—felt completely unconvincing. There needed to be a build-up of suspicion or resistance from Cordelia to make this twist more believable.",
            "I would have preferred the beginning to include two or three chapters from Mira’s perspective to enhance world-building and sustain interest during the sudden shift in viewpoint. The introduction of the Titan plot felt abrupt; given its importance to the story's conclusion, earlier hints or research on Titans would have been beneficial. Furthermore, several subplots, such as Lynette’s drug addiction, were left unresolved, contributing to a disjointed narrative.",

I didn't become invested in the characters or storyline until about halfway through, and even then, it felt more like a chore than an enjoyable read.

I didn’t feel invested in the characters or storyline until about 50% of the way through, and even then, it felt like a task to read. Towards the end, I did start to get into it, but it took me too long to care about the welfare of the characters.\n\n- **Character Development and Attachment:**  \n  I didn’t feel attached to the characters until Mira and Kai’s proposal/wedding, which was very emotional and sweet. It was the first time I actually connected with them. However, Samnang’s revelation that he knew Serena was Cordelia all along (86% into the book) made zero sense to me. There should have been a build-up of suspicion or resistance on Cordelia’s side to make this revelation more believable.\n\n- **World-Building and Clarity:**  \n  I wish the beginning had included 2 or 3 chapters from Mira’s point of view to help with world-building and maintain interest when the perspective suddenly shifted. The Titan plot came out of nowhere, and since it was vital to the story’s end, there should have been some prior mention or research into Titans. Additionally, several other plots, like Lynette’s drug addiction, were forgotten, making the story feel jumbled.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and POV Clarity:**  \n  While I expected the story to be told by three separate characters, the lack of clear indicators (e.g., the character’s name as the chapter header) made it confusing. I often thought I was reading from Mira’s POV, only to realize it was Cordelia’s. This lack of clarity disrupted my reading experience.\n\n- **Themes and Enjoyable Elements:**  \n  I enjoyed the Little Mermaid vibes from Cordelia being a cephalopod and having Mira’s siren song imbued into a gemstone. This was a unique and intriguing aspect of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I struggled with this book.

Key plot points, such as the inconsistencies surrounding the dragon pearl and the titan's death, created confusion. The ending felt rushed and unrealistic, with characters resolving conflicts in an overly simplistic manner, including sudden transformations like growing gills. This lack of meaningful development and clear consequences left me feeling unsatisfied.",

The character relationships were underdeveloped and unconvincing, especially the one-sided dynamic between Kai and Mira, as well as the uncomfortable connection between Nami and Firth.",

While the idea of a city on a titan's back is intriguing, the rationale behind it—such as why the city doesn't sink when the titan dies—was inadequately explained. Additionally, the reliance of the inhabitants on humans felt forced, as the vastness of the ocean should have offered alternative solutions."

I thoroughly enjoyed imagining the semi-submerged city, the differences between its various parts, the Peak, the engine of Onseon, Jingsha’s restaurant, Qilin, the Nurseries, and so much more. This aspect alone gives the book incomparable value.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The theme of social differences (the humans settled on the island vs. the deep-sea creatures arriving as immigrants, and the second-generation natives of Tiankawi) is central and remains consistent from the beginning to the end of the book.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters, with their substantial divergences, each have their own vulnerabilities, which for some of them resurface frequently throughout the book—frustrating but sensible. There were some characters I expected to play a more significant role based on their introduction, and I kept wondering when they would reappear.  \n\n- **Writing and Clarity:**  \n  Keeping in mind that the NetGalley version is an unedited draft of the translation, the writing didn’t fully satisfy me. Certain transitions in space and time were unclear, and (having just finished it) I was left with a sense of incompleteness that isn’t solely due to the open ending. Many charged moments were left to the reader’s imagination, which I found anticlimactic, and not all loose ends were tied up. Perhaps the author left room for a sequel? It’s plausible, but I was left with many unanswered questions.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending... was not at all what I expected. The twists in the book weren’t particularly shocking, but the ending relates more to the story’s structure. It surprised me, raised a lot of “whys?”, but not all of them were answered. The Solution to the Problem, however, satisfied me greatly.  \n\n- **Re-readability:**  \n  Would I re-read it? If a sequel were released in the future, yes (also to follow the threads of all the characters more closely).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excels in its immersive setting and compelling themes, the writing and clarity of certain transitions left me wanting.

            "Set in Tiankawi, a semi-flooded city intended as a sanctuary for fathomfolk—such as sirens, seawitches, kelpies, and kappas—the novel reveals a stark reality where humans dominate and treat these beings as second-class citizens. The author skillfully explores themes of racism, colonization, class disparities, and the diaspora experience within this imaginative fantasy world.

The action at the end was engaging and fun.\n\n- **Character Perspectives:**  \n  I enjoyed Mira's and Nami's POVs, but at the beginning, the different POVs were confusing and hard to distinguish. Mira and Nami became more likable towards the end, though some of their choices felt dumb at moments. Cordelia's POV felt unnecessary, as she contributed little to the story other than providing a \"villain\" perspective.\n\n- **Themes and World-Building:**  \n  The book explores themes of freedom, political struggle, identity, and belonging in a divided society. It is well-written and detailed, though at times it was hard to imagine the world.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  Any romance in the book felt unnecessary and didn't add much to the story.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was sadder than I expected, and while it was engaging, I'm unsure if I'll read the next book in the duology.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I had a good time reading \"Fathomfolk,\" but it dragged on at points, and I almost didn’t finish it at the beginning. While some readers may love this book, it wasn’t entirely for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated the political dynamics, reminiscent of *Jade City*, as characters navigated their roles and expectations in Tiankawi. The challenges they faced, particularly Mira's career setbacks, felt authentic and relatable. I also resonated with the frustrations stemming from the racial tensions between the folk and humans.",
            "The characters in the story feel one-dimensional, divided into clear categories of good and bad. Their emotions are presented in extremes—either unconditional love or outright hatred. I would have preferred a deeper exploration of their personalities through interactions rather than being told about their feelings. Nami, in particular, lacks character development, which may reflect the broader theme of growing up and the tendency to revert to old patterns and make impulsive choices.",
            "The concept of fathomfolk is a refreshing rarity in literature, and I thoroughly enjoyed the portrayal of various ocean species coexisting with humans. The descriptions and atmosphere were both imaginative and captivating.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Premise and World-Building:**  \n  The idea of fathomfolk is quite rare in books I have read, and I really enjoyed the integration of different species of ocean creatures living amongst humans. The descriptions and atmosphere were creative and beautiful.  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  I enjoyed the politics—it reminded me of *Jade City*, where characters had to navigate their roles and expectations in Tiankawi. The challenges the characters faced, like Mira’s career, were realistic and full of setbacks. I felt the frustration of dealing with the racial tensions between the folk and humans.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Characters are quite one-dimensional; they are either good or bad. Someone is in love without conditions or they hate someone entirely. I wish characters were shown more through their interactions as opposed to the author telling the reader about their personality or feelings. Nami especially did not grow as a character, although perhaps that’s just speaking to growing up in general (falling back into patterns, making rash decisions).  \n- **Tone and Genre Expectations:**  \n  Parts of the book were not as adult fantasy as I expected. The YA aspect of this book stood out more than I anticipated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Fathomfolk* has an intriguing premise, beautiful world-building, and engaging political themes, its one-dimensional characters and YA tone detracted from my overall enjoyment. Despite these flaws, I am curious about the sequel and look forward to seeing how the story progresses.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nInitially rated 4 stars, but after reflection, I dropped it to a high 3 stars.  \n\nThank you, NetGalley and Orbit Books, for this ARC in exchange for an honest review!"

For instance, Mira and Kai are an established couple, but their relationship didn’t feel compelling or deeply developed.

The themes of rebellion, oppression, racism, magic, and change are intriguing and well-suited to the fantasy genre.  \n\n- **Characterization and Complexity:**  \n  The first half of the book was confusing due to the sheer number of characters.

While I understand this was the author’s intent, I found the relentless focus on oppression to be draining. I wish there had been more balance with the beautiful magic and some lighthearted storylines to provide relief.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The first half of the book was slow and difficult to get through due to the confusion with characters and the heavy themes.

It made up for some of the earlier negatives and left me curious enough to want to read the second book to see what happens next.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is gorgeous and immersive, capturing the essence of East Asian mythology and ocean folklore. This aspect of the book was a highlight for me and added depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book wasn’t entirely my cup of tea due to its heavy focus on oppression and the initial confusion with characters, I appreciate its strong premise, beautiful worldbuilding, and the way the ending redeemed the story for me. I can see how many readers would love this book, even if it didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐️"

            "The story struggled with its shifting viewpoints, which undermined the depth of key relationships. I found it difficult to connect with Mira and Kai, as their lack of meaningful conversation left their abrupt marriage feeling unconvincing. Additionally, the handling of the titan was disappointing; there was little buildup to this shocking reveal, and the ensuing chaos left many of my questions unanswered. When will Nami recognize that Firth was orchestrating the Drawbacks? What is his ultimate goal? How did he become aware of the titan?",
            "Reading Nami’s chapters was quite challenging. Her immediate, unwavering attraction to Firth felt unrealistic, especially since it was clear he was manipulating her for his own benefit. I had hoped she would recognize this and find some redemption, but instead, she relapsed in the end. Nonetheless, the portrayal was realistic; anyone who has experienced an abusive or manipulative relationship in their youth can likely relate to Nami’s behavior. Among the various perspectives, I found Cordelia/Serena’s story the most engaging. It reminded me of Ursula from *The Little Mermaid*, but with the opportunity to share her side. I’m curious to see how her story unfolds in the future.",

Relationships that were supposed to have significant meaning didn’t make sense to me. I failed to understand Mira and Kai. It seemed as if neither one bothered to have a real conversation with the other. Their abrupt marriage was unexpected.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Intrigue:**  \n  I have qualms with the way the titan was handled. There was no real intrigue leading up to this shocking reveal. And then chaos ensued, and the questions I most wanted answers to never came. When will Nami realize Firth was the one pulling the strings for the Drawbacks? What was his end goal? How did he know about the titan?  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  It was truly hard to read Nami’s chapters. I couldn’t buy her immediate undying lust for Firth. It was so plainly obvious that he was manipulating her and using her for his own gain. I had hoped she would realize that and get some sort of redemption, but she just relapsed in the end.

However, I wished for more exploration of this aspect.\n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Focus:**  \n  The first third of the book felt slow and overly dominated by Nami's journey, which hindered my overall enjoyment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile \"Fathomfolk\" had moments of promise, particularly in its world-building and Mira's character, it ultimately fell short for me due to Nami's unrelatable actions, the jarring choice of character names, and the slow, Nami-centric pacing. Despite some enjoyable elements, the book wasn’t able to fully recover from these issues.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She skillfully unravels the layers of naïveté surrounding the teen protagonist, Nami, whose idealistic choices lead to harsh consequences. However, Nami's misplaced trust and reckless disregard for her family's guidance, while realistic for a teenager, can be frustrating to read. Additionally, the villains lack depth; Cordelia's motives remain unclear, and Nami's infatuation with Firth, who largely ignores her, is never fully explained.",

This oversight feels like a missed opportunity.",

While I think the issues are mostly with me rather than the book, the pacing and engagement didn’t quite work for me.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Chan has a remarkable way of writing both believable teen characters and more established ones (in their 30s). She skillfully peels back the layers of naïveté wrapped around the teen character, Nami, whose idealistic actions have truly brutal repercussions. However, Nami’s misplaced trust and reckless disregard of her family’s guidance, while believable as teen behavior, were too annoying to read. Additionally, the villain characters lack depth: Cordelia’s endgame is unclear, and it’s never clear why Nami is infatuated with Firth, who mostly ignores her.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I love the idea of Tiankawi, with sea creatures from mythologies around the world living together. However, aside from sirens’ ability to sing, sea witches’ magical bargains, and sea dragons being at the top of the Fathomfolk hierarchy, we learn very little about individual creatures’ abilities, which feels like a missed opportunity.\n\n- **Themes and Politics:**  \n  The politics in the book were too heavy-handed for my taste, which made it harder to connect with the story.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is fine, and Chan’s ability to craft believable characters and explore their growth is commendable. I appreciate moments like Nami realizing the power of kindness through her brother’s reaction to words of appreciation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this particular book wasn’t for me due to its heavy-handed politics, pacing issues, and lack of depth in some characters, I admire Chan’s ideas and writing.

However, the information feels hastily presented, almost as if it’s thrown out there without enough depth or integration into the narrative.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Pacing:**  \n  The narrative style feels sparse, akin to a screenplay where much of the impact relies on visual cues. This approach doesn’t translate well to a novel, as it lacks the necessary descriptive legwork to fully immerse the reader. For instance, a major reveal involving a POV character changing their appearance would work visually but falls flat in the book due to insufficient setup and distinct character idiosyncrasies.\n\n- **Character Voices and Perspective Shifts:**  \n  The characters largely speak in the same way, which becomes confusing during in-chapter perspective shifts. It’s often unclear whose perspective we’re in until the narration explicitly names them. This lack of distinctive voices makes the story feel more like a summary of events rather than an engaging narrative.\n\n- **Reader Engagement and Exhaustion:**  \n  While I have a vivid imagination and can fill in some gaps, the constant effort required to do so became exhausting over time.

I hope an editor can help the author refine their writing, particularly in developing more distinctive character voices and a richer narrative style.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author and Initial Expectations:**  \n  I really wanted to like this book after attending the To Be Continued book event at Bedford Corn Exchange, where I saw Eliza Chan on a panel discussion. She seems lovely, which heightened my expectations for the novel.\n\n- **World-Building and Premise:**  \n  The world and basic premise of the book are original and compelling, earning a 4 or 5-star rating. It tackles important contemporary themes like immigration, exploitation, and climate change, which are relevant and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Storytelling and Plot Development:**  \n  The storytelling, however, falls short with a 1-star rating. There are numerous \"wait, what?\" moments where new plot points are introduced late and feel convenient rather than naturally integrated into the extensive world-building. For example, the reveal that Serena and Cordelia are one person felt clumsy and forced. The narrative requires a lot of effort from the reader to piece together information, and I eventually decided to just go with it rather than constantly backtracking to understand crucial details.\n\n- **Comparison and Series Potential:**  \n  Similar to Shannon Chakraborty's *City of Brass*, I might give the rest of the series a chance to see how the story develops, hoping for improvements in future installments.\n\n- **Publishing and Editing:**  \n  I believe publishers do both readers and authors a disservice by not supporting a thorough edit and strengthening of the manuscript. A more polished edit would allow the nuanced, twisting, and interesting world to truly shine. Thanks to Katy at Close Encounters for providing insight into the current publishing world.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a strong premise and world-building, its storytelling and plot development are hindered by clumsy execution and a lack of cohesive editing. Despite these flaws, I remain open to continuing the series in hopes of improvement.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- World and basic premise: 4 or 5 stars  \n- Storytelling: 1 star  \n- Overall: 2.5 stars"

This dystopian fantasy setting, combined with magical elements, creates a vivid and imaginative world that feels distinct from anything I’ve read before. I could easily picture it in my mind, and I think it would make a fantastic film adaptation. However, while the world-building was impressive, I found it inconsistent—sometimes lacking detail and at other times overly complex, which left me confused about certain events.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style leans more toward “show, not tell,” which I generally enjoyed. It helped immerse me in the world, but the pacing felt uneven. At times, the story moved too slowly, which detracted from my overall enjoyment. A slightly quicker pace would have improved my experience.\n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  The novel features multiple POVs, including Mira, a captain striving to improve the lives of the Fathomfolk; Nami, her sister-in-law who joins a rebel group for a more radical approach to equality; and Cordelia, a sea witch manipulating situations for power. While the characters were interesting, I didn’t feel a strong emotional connection to any of them.

I was intrigued by the blurb and couldn’t wait to dive into it.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  - There were times when I was completely drawn into the story, but there were also moments where I found myself checking how many pages I still had to go through.  \n  - The first half of the book felt sluggish, and I often felt like I was just reading words rather than being pulled into the narrative. However, the second half was much more engaging and drew me in.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  - The worldbuilding was rich and immersive, perfectly capturing the vibes of a city drowning in its own struggles.  \n\n- **Character Development and Investment:**  \n  - As a fantasy lover, I want to be able to live the story through the characters' eyes, but I wasn’t invested in any of the characters.  \n  - I wasn’t fully sure of Cordelia’s motives in this book. It felt like she didn’t care about anything apart from herself.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - I’d say this book is more political than anything else, so for anyone wanting to read it, do be aware of that.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Critique:**  \n  - I didn’t dislike this book, nor did I 100% like it, hence the 3 stars. It stands in the middle for me.  \n  - Despite its faults, there were times when I did enjoy it, and I applaud Eliza for writing this story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its strengths, such as rich worldbuilding and an engaging second half, it also struggled with sluggish pacing in the first half and a lack of character investment.

Nami came across as naive at times, some of her decisions didn’t make sense to me, and she was easily manipulated by Firth.

Whether I’ll read the sequel when it comes out, I’m not sure yet, but it’s definitely a possibility.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Book:**  \n  Although I struggled with this book at times and took over a month to finish it, it was far better than the previous book I received from Illumicrate.

The premise sounded extremely promising, and the book explores great themes such as climate change/pollution, classism, a caste system/hierarchy, and oppression.  \n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n  While the themes are compelling, the writing itself doesn’t quite do them justice. The first 30% of the narrative was a haul to get through, and I had trouble understanding who each of the characters were and where they fit into the political structure of Tiankawi. There was a general lack of momentum in moving the plot forward.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The story is a slow-burn with more political maneuvering than true action. I kept having to force myself to keep going, which shows how the story failed to truly engage me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I do think the characters are all well-developed, which is a positive aspect of the book.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  The conclusion was unsatisfying and simplistic for the complexity of the plot. While I appreciate the general creativity of the characters and world, I’m not invested enough to want to read a sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its promising premise and well-developed characters, *Fathomfolk* struggled to engage me due to its slow pacing, lack of plot momentum, and unsatisfying conclusion.

However, the extensive world-building at the beginning of the book slows the pace, making it a bit of a challenge to get into initially.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The pacing starts slow due to the heavy focus on world-building but picks up significantly in the middle, making the story more engaging. While the plot feels somewhat predictable, the ending is satisfying and ties the narrative together well.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The book features a diverse cast of interesting characters, each contributing to the richness of the story. The three main fathomfolk protagonists are compelling, and their journeys to find their place in the human world are central to the narrative.  \n\n- **Execution and Enjoyment:**  \n  While the concept of the book is strong and the themes are impactful, the execution feels a bit lacking at times. Despite this, the book remains an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a thought-provoking exploration of identity, prejudice, and social issues through the lens of fathomfolk in a human-dominated world. While the pacing starts slow and the plot is somewhat predictable, the vibrant world-building, compelling characters, and satisfying ending make it an enjoyable and worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It effectively highlights themes of privilege, poverty, and political exploitation, offering a thought-provoking commentary on these topics.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building in \"Fathomfolk\" is thorough and richly detailed, immersing readers in its fantastical elements. However, this level of detail sometimes detracts from the pacing, making the story feel bogged down.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The characters, including half-siren Mira, her water dragon partner Kai, his aristocratic sister Nami, and the enigmatic sea-witch Cordelia, navigate a complex society in turmoil. Their interactions and development add depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  While there were concepts I enjoyed, I found the overall story difficult to connect with. The writing felt tedious at times, and the slow pacing made it challenging to remain engaged throughout the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Fathomfolk\" offers a richly detailed world and a compelling exploration of social issues, but its slow pacing and occasionally tedious writing hindered my overall enjoyment. Despite its strengths, I struggled to stay engaged with the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise:** The central premise is interesting but ultimately devolves into well-trodden tropes.  \n- **Character Dynamics:** The character dynamics felt too familiar and lacked originality.  \n- **Plot and Intrigue:** The political intrigue wasn't particularly engaging, and the story only became compelling in the final 10%.  \n- **Pacing and Engagement:** The novel felt overly long and failed to capture my attention for the majority of its duration.  \n- **Target Audience:** This could serve as a great entry point for readers new to larger fantasy stories outside the romantasy genre, especially those not ready for a +500-page multi-book series. However, for seasoned fantasy readers, it didn’t offer anything new or impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel isn’t bad, it relies too heavily on familiar tropes and lacks the depth and originality to engage experienced fantasy readers. It may, however, be a suitable introduction for newcomers to the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I felt like I barely knew the characters, which made it hard to care about their struggles.  \n- **Pacing and Resolution:** The ending felt abrupt, as if things just kind of happened without a satisfying resolution.  \n- **Overall Balance:** The book needs less in some areas but also more in others to achieve a better balance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story has potential and isn’t a bad book, it falls short in execution, particularly in character development and pacing. The lack of emotional connection to the characters made it difficult to fully engage with the world and its escalating conflicts.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nHovers between 2 and 3 stars.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to NetGalley and Orbit Books for the eARC in exchange for an honest review."

I’m unsure what the author was trying to convey with these themes.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I didn’t connect with most of the characters. Mira’s POV was the only one I enjoyed, especially because she was in an established relationship. Nami’s POV made the book feel more YA than adult, which detracted from the story. Cordelia’s POV seemed unnecessary, as she contributed little to the narrative.  \n\n- **Tone and Target Audience:**  \n  The characters acted much younger than I expected for an adult book, and I think the story would have been better marketed as YA.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book didn’t meet my expectations. While the world-building was detailed, the lack of a compelling plot, underdeveloped themes, and unrelatable characters left me disappointed. I’m unsure if I’ll continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

While the characters are intriguing, I found it difficult to connect deeply with any of them, and their arcs occasionally lost momentum.

The different paths of defiance and the flaws in each character’s methods are well-explored.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The concept of Fathomfolk and half-drowned cities is unique and intriguing.

The richly detailed world is populated by enchanting sea creatures and mythical beings, including kelpies, sirens, sea witches, and mermaids. Vivid descriptions of street vendor stalls, comforting foods, and ramshackle living arrangements create a tangible sense of place. Subtle nods to a classic Disney film add an extra layer of familiarity and charm.",

The author did a great job of creating detailed neighborhoods and showcasing how different communities lived and were raised.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Mira was the only character I found truly interesting. Cordelia, in particular, didn’t seem to add much to the story, which made her feel underdeveloped.  \n- **Plot and Ending:**  \n  While I enjoyed reading the book overall, the ending fell flat and ultimately diminished my overall satisfaction with the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its strong world-building and moments of enjoyment, the book fell short due to uneven character development and a disappointing ending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nInitially considered 4 stars, but the ending lowered my overall rating."

However, despite the initial interest, I couldn’t fully immerse myself in the world. Some descriptions were hard to understand, and after repeated attempts, I grew tired of trying to grasp them.\n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The themes were the strongest part of the story. The exploration of immigration policies, integration, discrimination, and poverty felt incredibly relevant and reflective of our own reality. It was almost too close to real life, which left me conflicted about whether I appreciated this aspect or not.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I couldn’t connect with any of the characters. There was no one I liked, rooted for, or even a villain I found compelling. Most of the characters annoyed and frustrated me, which made it difficult to stay engaged with the story.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book isn’t badly written, but the combination of elements felt chunky and mismatched. While the writing itself wasn’t the issue, the overall execution didn’t work for me.\n\n- **Personal Expectations:**  \n  I was really looking forward to this book, so it’s disappointing that it didn’t resonate with me. I had hoped to enjoy it, but it just wasn’t a good fit for my tastes.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you’re interested in East Asian mythology with a whimsical tone, you might still want to give this a try. However, if you’re a subscriber to a monthly box featuring this book, my advice would be to skip it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has strong themes and an intriguing premise, I couldn’t connect with the worldbuilding or characters. The execution felt mismatched, and it ultimately didn’t meet my expectations. It’s not a bad book, but it just wasn’t for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

Rather than passing judgment, she illustrates the consequences of their actions and words within her crafted world. With clear motivations, goals, and thought processes, the characters come to life as three-dimensional and deeply empathetic figures.",

The powerful scenes are both impactful and unflinching. However, I found the analogy between the abyssal folk and marginalized communities somewhat inconsistent. While real-life discrimination stems from unfounded fears and hatred toward fundamentally equal individuals, depicting folklore creatures—such as sirenes, kappas, kelpies, and Eastern dragons—with inherent superior traits risks making their fear and subsequent discrimination seem partially justified. This is a personal perspective, but overall, the author skillfully navigates this complex theme."

The strong scenes are impactful and unflinching. However, I found the analogy between the abyssal folk and marginalized communities somewhat inconsistent. While discrimination in real life is based on unfounded fears and hatred toward people who are fundamentally equal, portraying folklore creatures (like sirenes, kappas, kelpies, and Eastern dragons) with inherent superior traits risks making their fear and subsequent discrimination seem partially justified. This is a personal perspective, though, and the author handles this complex theme skillfully overall.  \n\n- **Character Development and Empathy:**  \n  The author excels in portraying resistance and the fight for rights, with each character approaching these struggles differently.

The characters are given clear motivations, goals, and thought processes, making them three-dimensional and deeply empathetic.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing is generally smooth and engaging, though there are some flaws.

The socio-political context is extremely well-developed, and the world-building is strong.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing itself is beautiful, which added to my appreciation of the book despite its flaws.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has strong themes, beautiful writing, and impressive world-building, its inconsistent pacing, lack of character connection, and insufficient contextual explanations made it a miss for me. However, readers who prioritize socio-political themes over a detailed plot might still enjoy it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There’s also some interesting parallels to modern politics in the plot line of the Fathomfolk seeking a better life in the cities, but being exploited for political gain.  \n\n- **Writing and Editing:**  \n  Unfortunately, the book feels unpolished, for lack of a better description. Chapters end abruptly, the metaphors don’t always make perfect sense, and a number of major plot points are skipped through in mere sentences or introduced far too late to have the impact the author intended.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  This made it very hard to connect with the characters, and sometimes their motivations and actions seemed inconsistent. I found myself struggling to engage with the story at many points, and desperately wishing things were made just a little clearer.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Fathomfolk* has an amazing concept and intriguing world-building, it is let down by its unpolished execution, abrupt pacing, and underdeveloped characters. The story had potential but needed more clarity and refinement to fully engage the reader.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Integration of Folklore:**  \n  The book attempts to mix various Asian folklores but fails to provide sufficient context or integration. The creatures from different mythologies are introduced without balance or depth, leaving the reader confused and struggling to follow, especially if they are unfamiliar with the referenced cultures. While other books have successfully blended folklores by using commonalities as a foundation, this one lacks that cohesive base, relying solely on the shared theme of water creatures, which is too broad and insufficient for meaningful storytelling.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding in \"Fathomfolk\" lacks support and interest. The story begins by throwing information at the reader without adequate depth or explanation, making it difficult to engage with the setting. The lack of clarity forced me to seek external explanations, which I was unable to find. This approach felt like being thrown into the water without learning to swim first, leaving me disoriented and disconnected from the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters in the book are uninteresting, which further contributed to my lack of investment in the story. Without compelling characters to anchor the plot, the book failed to hold my attention, ultimately leading me to consider it a \"did not finish\" read.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Eliza Chan’s writing skills are commendable, as her prose is well-crafted and engaging. However, the strength of her writing does not compensate for the weaknesses in worldbuilding and character development.\n\n- **Target Audience and Cultural Assumptions:**  \n  The book seems to target young adults, but it assumes a level of familiarity with multiple East Asian cultures that is unlikely among its intended audience. While many readers may be familiar with individual cultures like Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, expecting knowledge of all of them simultaneously is unrealistic. This oversight alienates readers who might otherwise enjoy the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial excitement for \"Fathomfolk,\" the book fell short of my expectations. The lack of cohesive folklore integration, weak worldbuilding, and uninteresting characters made it difficult to stay engaged. While Eliza Chan’s writing is strong, the story needed more thoughtful structuring and simplification to appeal to its target audience. Ultimately, the book left me feeling disappointed and disconnected.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

At first, I thought there were two points of view (POVs), then realized it was four, and by the end, I understood there were actually three. While I could have written down their names to keep track, I believe a well-written story should allow readers to differentiate characters without needing to remember their names.

The complexity of the plot and the maturity of the characters align more with YA than adult fiction.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  I enjoyed the worldbuilding and look forward to exploring it further in the next book. However, in the first half, I struggled to understand how much of the story was literal versus figurative, particularly when it came to the mentions of dragons.\n\n- **Plotlines:**  \n  - **Cordelia’s Plotline:** I really enjoyed Cordelia’s storyline and am excited to see where it goes next.  \n  - **Nami’s Plotline:** Nami’s plotline reminded me of every freedom fighter/rebel episode of *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, to the point where I assume the author drew inspiration from there.

I didn’t anticipate the plot to be so heavily political, and it read like a YA novel, which I didn’t think it was going to be.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  Unfortunately, I didn’t click with the plot or the setting. That said, the concept of the submerged city and the presence of so many different sea creatures was very interesting.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I also didn’t connect with the characters, which further contributed to my lack of engagement with the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing concept and a visually appealing cover, it didn’t meet my expectations due to its heavy political focus, YA-like tone, and lack of connection with the characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I looked forward to immersing myself in a new world with intriguing characters and settings.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The first quarter of the book felt painfully slow, and I struggled to stay engaged. I wondered if my lack of interest was due to a \"reading hangover\" from a previous fantasy duology that deeply impacted me. Despite powering through, the story never picked up for me.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, particularly Firth, didn’t resonate with me. While I understand he was meant to be morally grey, his actions came across as manipulative and abusive, making it frustrating to read his interactions with Nami. Kai and Eun were the only characters I found somewhat compelling.\n\n- **Emotional Depth and Reflection:**  \n  Major events in the book felt rushed, with characters resolving their thoughts and emotions within a paragraph. This lack of depth made the story feel more suited to a YA audience than the intended demographic.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was overwhelming and disjointed. The author introduced numerous places without fully exploring their significance, making it hard to grasp the setting of Tiankawi. The mix of modern and traditional elements felt jarring and confusing.\n\n- **Social and Political Themes:**  \n  I appreciated the exploration of social issues like poverty, racism, and class inequality. These themes felt relevant and reminiscent of *The Hunger Games*, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Desire for More Historical Context:**  \n  The frequent mention of a past war left me wanting more historical background. It felt like the world could have benefited from more detailed mapping and development.\n\n- **Physical Presentation:**  \n  While the story didn’t meet my expectations, I’m happy to own a visually stunning edition of the book. I also wished for a tram map of the city, which might be included in the regular paperback version.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its beautiful presentation and promising themes, the book fell short for me due to its slow pacing, underdeveloped characters, and disjointed world-building. While I appreciated the social and political commentary, the overall execution left much to be desired.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars (rounded up from a lower score)."

I kept wondering if this was a staple of folklore I’d missed or something the author created for the story.  \n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  - The audiobook version was decent, though Emily Woo Zeller’s man voice was a bit distracting.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  - The cover is stunning and my favorite part of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some intriguing elements, such as its mythological creatures and world-building, it fell short in character development and originality.

Nami’s POV adds little value and could have been eliminated to focus more on Mira and Kai.\n\n- **Character Relationships:**\n  - The relationships between characters are poorly developed. For example, the supposed sisterly bond between Nami and Mira is unconvincing, as they barely interact. Similarly, Kai and Nami’s relationship lacks depth. The narrative tells rather than shows these connections, making them feel hollow.\n\n- **Political Themes:**\n  - The book’s political messaging is frustrating and misguided. It promotes the idea that systemic oppression can be ended through passive, non-confrontational means, while portraying characters who fight back as villains. This approach is unrealistic and dismissive of the necessity of active resistance in achieving social change.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel had a promising concept but was let down by weak execution. The world-building lacked depth, the plot was poorly paced, and the characters were underdeveloped and inconsistent. The use of multiple POVs was unbalanced, and the political themes were frustratingly naive. While the setting of Tiankawi was intriguing, the lack of cultural differentiation and meaningful character relationships made the story fall flat. The rushed resolution and misguided messaging further diminished the overall experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Unfortunately, the final 20% feels rushed and unsatisfying, ending on a cliffhanger that leaves key conflicts unresolved and compels readers to continue the series for closure.",
            "The book presents four points of view, but one character's dual identity effectively narrows it to three. Mira's perspective stands out as the most engaging; she is a hardworking and morally upright character whose increasing weariness resonates deeply. In contrast, the other viewpoints fall short. Nami comes across as impulsive and politically extreme, with a romantic relationship that raises concerns of grooming and gaslighting. Cordelia, characterized by her vanity and chaos, lacks the depth needed to be a compelling morally grey figure. Additionally, Kai, though not a POV character, feels underutilized and would benefit from further development.",
            "While marketed as an adult novel due to its political themes, the book often resembles a YA story infused with anime and manga influences. This tonal inconsistency is disappointing, as it falls short of delivering the depth and complexity typically expected from adult fiction.",

The story creatively blends Asian mythological creatures, primarily from Southeast and East Asia, with European beings like Kelpies. While the premise is captivating, the world-building in the first 35% of the book feels overly detailed, slowing the pacing and making it a tedious read.",
            "The novel delves into themes of immigration, racism, and class differences, offering a critique of how established societies confront these challenges.

The ending diminishes the moral complexities and necessary actions to tackle these issues, opting for a simplistic resolution that feels unsatisfying and dismissive."

However, the execution fell short, resulting in a mix that ultimately lacked appeal.",

The book spans 416 pages and is divided into 60 chapters, resulting in a POV shift approximately every six pages. Compounding the issue, these shifts often coincide with jumps in the timeline.

Having a collector's edition in English, I was able to compare both versions, and there are truly no weak points in the Italian one.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  I greatly appreciated the political and social impact the author aimed to convey regarding the themes of minorities and ethnic repression. However, the execution, especially in the final resolution of this theme, leaves little room for cultural differences and instead pushes toward ethnic globalization.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  The writing is confusing for my taste and my needs as a neurodivergent reader. I had extreme difficulty interacting with the numerous POV changes. The book consists of 416 pages divided into 60 chapters, meaning the POV changes approximately every 6 pages. Often, not only does the POV change, but so does the timeline. For example, if event X happens at the end of a chapter with POV 1, the next chapter with POV 2 begins days later, assuming the resolution of the previous event without explanation. This leaves the resolution to the reader's imagination.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I found no affinity with the main characters. They felt flat, interchangeable, naïve, and unrealistic. The author could have done MUCH more; the basic idea was there (even the idea of borrowing from multiple cultures and blending them, though it may not be appreciated overseas, I don’t mind), but the result was a mix that honestly wasn’t very appealing.  \n\n- **World-Building and Additional Resources:**  \n  I would have appreciated a mini glossary explaining some specific terms and mythological creatures.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  I really dislike the idea of Nami’s toxic relationship, which is clearly meant to set up the next book. It’s unrealistic that, despite numerous red flags and Mira’s proximity, Nami continues to choose this relationship.  \n\n- **Creativity and Originality:**  \n  The sea witch is reminiscent of Ursula from *The Little Mermaid*, so even the request for the voice leaves much to be desired in terms of the author’s creativity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential with its unique underwater fantasy setting and themes of social and political commentary, the execution fell short for me.

Nami, in particular, is predictably written, making it difficult to connect with her. While Cordelia is more intriguing, she deserves more focus in the narrative. The sheer number of characters, including those mentioned only once, adds to the chaos of the novel. Ultimately, the characters fail to evolve, remaining two-dimensional and interchangeable, which hinders readers' ability to empathize with them."

They feel flat, and their dialogues are sometimes unrealistic and forced. Nami, in particular, is terribly predictable, making it nearly impossible to connect with her. Cordelia is more interesting, but she deserved more space in the story. Additionally, there are too many characters, including those mentioned only once, which makes the novel chaotic. The characters do not evolve throughout the story, remaining two-dimensional and sometimes interchangeable, which prevents readers from empathizing with them.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The political intrigue was the main reason I kept reading, as it intrigued me from the start. However, the plot alone wasn’t strong enough to carry the novel, especially given the issues with characterization. I don’t plan to read the sequel.\n\n- **Translation:**  \n  The translation seems to be very well done. Given the challenges posed by the book’s structure and character issues, Miccoli must have faced a significant task, and they handled it admirably.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the political fantasy premise initially intrigued me, the novel fell short due to its weak characterization and chaotic narrative. The translation was a highlight, but the story’s flaws overshadowed its potential. I won’t be continuing with the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This made it feel like I was stuck in exposition or introduction for far too long. Additionally, there were some jarring jumps between chapters that left me checking frequently to see if I had skipped pages. It often felt like scenes were cut off mid-thought, which disrupted the flow of the story.  \n\n- **Personal Engagement:**  \n  If this hadn’t been an ARC, I would have put the book down earlier.

It didn’t have the intensity or nuance I was hoping for, and the pacing didn’t help elevate the stakes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this book underwhelming. The plot felt unoriginal, the characters lacked depth, and the conflict didn’t deliver the impact I expected from an adult novel. While the writing style was passable, it didn’t compensate for the other shortcomings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I found myself waiting nearly half the book for significant events to unfold, as it took a long time to progress beyond the plot outlined in the blurb. While the boat race day was an exciting and pivotal moment, the lengthy buildup felt unnecessary. Additionally, the frequent time skips and shifts in point of view hindered my ability to engage with the narrative; just as something intense occurred, we would quickly move on, leaving me wanting more.",

Serena initially gave me evil rich mom from a K-drama vibes, which I loved, but this perception changed swiftly when we found out how she actually is.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  My main problem is the slow pace. I spent almost 50% of the book waiting for something to happen. It took half the book to move past the plot described in the blurb. The boat race day was a great part of the story and a good catalyst for the rest, but I don’t understand why we had to wait so long for anything to happen.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  Time skips and POV changes made it difficult to build interest because the moment something intense happened, we moved past it almost immediately.  \n\n- **Writing and Editing:**  \n  Eliza Chan is a talented writer, but this book could’ve used another round of editing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has strong elements like world-building and interesting characters, its slow pacing, abrupt narrative shifts, and lack of momentum made it a challenging read.

Ultimately, the story failed to engage me or evoke any sense of urgency or interest.",
            "I found it difficult to connect with any of the three main characters, as they often came across as annoying, naïve, and biased. Their inconsistent worldviews and goals made it challenging to engage with their journeys. Ultimately, the absence of relatable or compelling characters left me feeling detached from the story.",

            "The worldbuilding in this story is both creative and detailed, drawing inspiration from various cultures to craft a unique setting. I particularly enjoyed the small touches, such as the vivid descriptions of street vendors and their foods, which enhanced the immersive experience. However, as the narrative progressed, the worldbuilding became disjointed, with an overload of elements that detracted from the core story. Additionally, the cover art misled me regarding the time period and setting, suggesting a historical backdrop while the story featured modern elements like cable cars and trams. While there's nothing inherently wrong with this approach, it felt like a bait-and-switch compared to my initial expectations.",
            "I eagerly anticipated this read, especially as it was on my spring TBR list. The book's summary promised a complex, immersive world that I was excited to explore. The cover art hinted at a romantic, fairytale-like tone, which I often seek in fantasy novels. Additionally, its marketing as an adult fantasy novel set it apart from others in the genre, piquing my interest even further."

Despite its promising premise and creative worldbuilding, the lackluster plot, unlikable characters, and slow pacing made it feel like a chore to read. I won’t be continuing with this and can’t strongly recommend it. While it might appeal to those with a strong interest in Asian folklore, I believe there are better examples of this type of story out there.",

While this isn’t necessarily a criticism, the tone or writing style felt more aligned with YA fantasy, which might not appeal to everyone.  \n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  Despite the imaginative world and interesting characters, I didn’t feel deeply connected to the story. There was something about the narrative and characters that didn’t fully draw me in, though I can see how others might enjoy it more if they feel a stronger connection.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Fathomfolk* boasts an imaginative world, diverse characters, and some unexpected twists, the uneven pacing and lack of personal connection left me feeling disappointed. It’s a unique fantasy novel that many might enjoy, but it didn’t fully captivate me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars"

            "The book would have benefited from centering on Mira, the half-siren guard captain, as the sole narrator rather than shifting between multiple viewpoints. This approach disrupted the flow and diminished tension and intrigue. While the politics of Fathomfolk and themes of racism and environmentalism held potential, they were executed too simplistically. Key plot points felt inconsequential, and character reactions often appeared choppy and illogical. Additionally, the portrayal of the anti-human rebel group lacked nuance, coming off as cartoonishly evil and overly heavy-handed in its messaging.",

Their thoughts and motives were presented too overtly, eliminating any sense of mystery or tension. The multiple third-person perspectives weakened the narrative, and Nami's alternating POV was especially frustrating. Her character was reduced to reckless impulsiveness, ineptitude in magic and combat, and a lackluster romance with a problematic figure.",

Afterblossom's artwork captures a fantastical twist that enhances any piece of work attached to it.  \n\n- **Premise and Setting:**  \n  The story about sea folk intrigued me, especially with its Asian twist. As someone who loves the sea and sea life, I was excited to dive into this book.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The story is structured around three POVs: Nami, Cordelia, and Mira. Each woman is distinct in stature, class, species, and role in life.  \n  - Nami is a dragon princess.  \n  - Mira is a half-siren captain from Tiankawi, who is in a relationship with Kai, Nami’s brother. She is dedicated to justice but is aware of the city’s flaws.  \n  - Cordelia is an octopus shifter skilled in medicine and potions, with a hidden agenda.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing feels very technical, giving off an urban fantasy vibe. However, much of the story felt dry and chaotic. The actions and direction of the writing were hard to follow, and I struggled to grasp the motive or direction of the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The politics in the story were uninteresting, and there were several unnecessary scenes that didn’t add value.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Cordelia was the most interesting character, with morally grey undertones to her actions and motives. Her sacrifice at the end felt unresolved.  \n  Nami and Mira, on the other hand, lacked positive character growth. Nami, in particular, still ticks me off.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the cover art and premise were captivating, the story itself fell short.

While I enjoy YA, I need to be in the mood for it, and this book leaned heavily into YA characteristics and tropes, which affected my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **World-Building vs. Character Development:**  \n  The first half of the book focused extensively on world-building, leaving the characters underdeveloped and the plot moving sluggishly.

Additionally, one of the romance subplots came across as instalove, which had significant issues and lacked depth.  \n\n- **Political Intrigue and Nuance:**  \n  As someone who loves political intrigue, I found the politics in this book frustrating. The portrayal of politics was overly simplistic, with characters and actions being categorized as purely good or bad. There was a lack of nuance, and the story didn’t delve into the reasons behind characters’ or groups’ actions. For example, the refugee situation was vaguely explained without providing deeper context or details.  \n\n- **Exploration of Themes:**  \n  Given the book’s focus on xenophobic themes, I hoped for a more complex exploration of societal issues. Instead, the treatment of these themes felt superficial. The ending, in particular, provided an answer that was questionable and lacked the depth and nuance I was hoping for.  \n\n- **Potential for Improvement:**  \n  Despite these issues, I hope the next books in the series can address some of these shortcomings, as they made finishing this book a challenge.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Fathomfolk* had potential and seemed like a story I would enjoy, it fell short in several areas, including its YA-like tone, underdeveloped characters, simplistic politics, and lack of nuanced exploration of its themes.

I appreciated the growth of Mira and Kai; their past experiences created tension in their relationship but ultimately led to a deeper understanding of the world.

I studied folklore and mythology in modern pop culture during my Master's program and have a soft spot for authors who incorporate their native myths into their writing.\n\n- **Pacing and Editing:**  \n  Unfortunately, the book desperately needs more rigorous editing. The world-building is rich but overly dense, with a massive cast of mythological creatures that can be overwhelming to keep track of. The first 200 pages, in particular, could have been significantly trimmed down to improve the pacing.\n\n- **Narrative Complexity and Political Messages:**  \n  While I appreciate the complexity of the political messages woven into the narrative, the author attempts to cover too many historical events (e.g., concentration camps, arm bands, ghettos) in great detail. While this is realistic in depicting the oppression of a minority group, it slows down the narrative. Some of these details could have been introduced more lightly or saved for subsequent books to maintain a smoother reading experience.\n\n- **Character Development and Nuance:**  \n  I loved the characters, especially Mira and Nami, whose opposing responses to their world’s realities felt very realistic and nuanced. Their differing perspectives, shaped by their upbringings, were well-explored and added depth to the story. This level of nuance is not always common in narratives like this one.\n\n- **Potential for Improvement:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the story has many strengths, and I believe it could shine with a more condensed and refined message. I’m eager to see how the author, Chan, grows in her writing and will keep an eye on her future works, especially potential sequels to this story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a rich world and compelling characters, its dense narrative and lack of editing make it a challenging read. With some refinement, it has the potential to be a standout story. I plan to revisit it eventually but found it overwhelming to continue at this time.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 (rounded down)."

Neon is a new publisher that intrigued me from the start, and I couldn’t miss their first title, especially since it deals with mermaids and politics—two themes I absolutely love.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n  - Unfortunately, the characters didn’t resonate with me at all. I would have preferred more in-depth characterization and description. Additionally, being from a Western background while the author is Eastern, I felt I missed some cultural nuances that the author might have assumed were obvious. For instance, it took me a while to understand the concept of sea dragons in Eastern culture, as they were poorly described physically, making it hard for me to visualize them.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n  - What kept me reading until the end was the political aspect and the struggles faced by the underwater society throughout the narrative. This part intrigued me from the very first page. The highlight of the book was seeing not only the message Eliza Chan wanted to convey but also a situation that isn’t too far from the reality we live in today.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Suitability:**\n  - Despite the intriguing premise, the book didn’t satisfy me in most aspects. It’s not the type of series I would continue or that generally appeals to me.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book had a promising premise with its blend of mermaids and politics, it fell short in character development and cultural clarity for me as a Western reader. The political narrative was engaging and thought-provoking, but overall, the book didn’t meet my expectations, and I wouldn’t continue with the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The library loan almost expired before I could finish, so I ended up speed-reading the last 15% of it.  \n\n- **Premise and Themes:**  \n  I’ve always been a mermaid-girl, and this book had elements I was thrilled by: a half-submerged city, water-based magical creatures/half-creatures as characters, and neat water powers. I really liked the premise and themes—it had some cool stuff going for it!  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  One character stood out as a potential Joffrey-Baratheon-level despicable villain. He threw red flags like a flashing police siren from the beginning, and I don’t regret sticking it through to see more of him. Validation is a drug.  \n  However, I could NOT handle Nami. While I could maybe understand her character at the beginning, by the end, I couldn’t empathize with someone so frustratingly dumb. She kept making the same mistakes over and over without facing significant consequences, which was beyond frustrating, especially in the last chapter.  \n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n  The execution didn’t work for me. It seemed sloppily edited, with lots of fragmented sentences and oddly framed paragraphs. There were also weird and jarring writing decisions that didn’t make sense in the general flow of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise, exciting themes, and a standout villain, the execution fell short due to poor editing, jarring writing choices, and an unlikable protagonist.

The development of the world was strong, and there were cool creatures introduced. However, I wish these creatures had been given more detail, as it would have made the world and magic system easier to understand and more engaging.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was slow at the beginning, which I generally expect for a new fantasy world. However, it then became too fast, lacking seamless transitions. The overall structure felt chaotic, and the direction of the book seemed lost at points.\n\n- **Target Audience and Tone:**  \n  While marketed as adult fantasy, the book read more like YA to me. It felt like it needed another round of edits to refine its tone and align it more closely with the adult fantasy genre.\n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  If you're looking for romance, be aware that it is very much a subplot and not a central focus of the story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  Despite its potential, the book fell flat for me. I struggled to get through it and almost immediately forgot about it after finishing. The only reason I completed it was because I don’t DNF books.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had a promising premise and strong world-building, but its chaotic pacing, lack of detail in key elements, and mismatched tone made it a disappointing read for me. While it had potential, it ultimately failed to engage me or leave a lasting impression.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The craftsmanship in these areas is top-tier.\n\n- **Character Connection:**  \n  I didn’t connect with any of the characters throughout the entire 417-page book. I didn’t like a single one, which made it difficult for me to engage with the story on a deeper level.\n\n- **Genre Preference:**  \n  It’s possible that political fantasy just isn’t for me. This book might have highlighted that preference, as I found myself disliking the genre more as I read.\n\n- **Physical Edition:**  \n  Illumicrate created a stunning special edition of this book, which I own. The beautiful design was the reason I picked it up in the first place. However, in hindsight, I wonder if I should have skipped this month’s selection based on others’ opinions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excels in world-building and descriptive writing, it failed to resonate with me emotionally or through its characters. The reading experience was more of a struggle than an enjoyment, and it made me question my preference for the genre. Despite the beautiful special edition, I regret not heeding others’ advice to skip this book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe book received extra stars for its world-building and descriptions, but overall, the emotional and character disconnect significantly impacted my enjoyment."

It felt a little separated.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The middle part of the book became a little boring, and that’s where it lost me. I had to really push myself to read the rest. Fortunately, the story picked up again later, which made me want to read the next installment.\n\n- **Genre Preferences:**  \n  I enjoy political intrigue more than romance-heavy tropes, and this book was good for that aspect.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the world-building and initial intrigue were strong, the disjointed POVs and slow pacing in the middle dampened my overall enjoyment.

However, the complexity of its multiple plotlines and characters made it challenging to follow, and while the story eventually becomes more engaging, it didn’t fully hold my interest throughout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Whenever something significant occurred, the tension was lost due to abrupt POV changes or the introduction of new storylines. The fallout of major events was never thoroughly examined, leaving many threads half-finished and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  All three POV characters provided different perspectives on life in the city, but they felt flat and underdeveloped. Cordelia’s role seemed unclear, serving only to add general chaos. Nami came across as an incredibly immature and prejudiced 16-year-old, which was exacerbated by her toxic love interest.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Tone:**  \n  Despite being marketed as an adult novel, the tone and character dynamics felt very YA (young adult), which was disappointing and mismatched with my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a promising and unique concept, its execution fell short due to poor pacing, underdeveloped characters, and a tone that didn’t align with its intended audience.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  The book is heavily criticized for its anti-revolution sentiment and racial \"pickmeism.\" The reviewer finds the rhetoric about violent resistance being inherently evil, particularly concerning innocent white people, to be frustrating and unnecessary. They express disappointment in the author, an Asian writer, perpetuating such narratives.\n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The Asian-inspired fantasy world is praised for its beauty, including the magic system, different species, and the military/government structure. However, the reviewer feels these elements needed more elaboration and clarity. They are ambivalent about the mashup of different mythologies and find the \"friendship is magic\" core of the dragon pearl storyline out of place in an adult fantasy.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  While the plot is described as dense and not boring, the reviewer admits to losing interest in it halfway through, primarily due to their dislike of the resistance storyline. They found the setting more compelling than the plot itself.\n\n- **Writing, Pacing, and Structure:**  \n  The book is criticized for cramming too much information without delivering substance. The pacing feels off, with events that span several months seeming to occur in just two weeks. The multiple POVs are not well-distinguished, making it hard to differentiate between characters' thoughts and dialogue.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are a major point of contention. The reviewer appreciates Cordelia for her self-awareness as an antagonist but finds Mira insufferable due to her internalized racism and anti-resistance stance. Nami, the only character with potential, is portrayed as a deranged radical whose redemption involves betraying the resistance, which the reviewer finds problematic. They compare these characters unfavorably to Wren from *Girls of Paper and Fire*, whom they now appreciate for her revolutionary spine.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance is deemed unimportant and unenjoyable, with the reviewer specifically disliking the Kaimira pairing.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  The reviewer did not enjoy the book overall, citing its themes, characters, and messaging as major detractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book has a visually stunning world and a dense plot, but its anti-revolution sentiment, poorly developed characters, and problematic messaging overshadow these strengths. The pacing and structure are flawed, and the romance adds little value. Ultimately, the reviewer found the book disappointing and unenjoyable.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nOverall Rating: 10/30 • 1.66/5  \n(Advance copy received from NetGalley in exchange for a review.)"

The idea that knocking down one domino can topple the entire set creates a sense of disorder rather than a cohesive narrative. The ending was especially disappointing and ultimately unworthy of further exploration.",
            "**Mira:** I appreciated Mira’s struggle as a biracial half-siren, half-human character caught between two worlds—neither fully accepted by humans nor by the Fathomfolk. Her experience resonates with the real challenges faced by mixed-race individuals. **Serena:** Serena was an intriguing character, skillfully orchestrating events from the shadows to achieve her personal goals. **Nami:** In contrast, Nami was frustrating. As Kai’s younger sister, her brashness and naivety serve as the catalyst for many of the book's conflicts. Her impulsive decisions lead to dire consequences, and while there seems to be a commentary on young activists acting without full understanding, this theme isn’t explored deeply enough to justify her actions. **Kai:** Kai, however, stood out as a beacon of goodness, too virtuous for the chaos surrounding him.",

The intricate political systems, diverse races, and hierarchical structures within the military and government are meticulously crafted, creating a rich backdrop of history and lore. It immerses readers in a fantastically flawed world that reflects our own discussions on politics, immigration, history, and activism. This depth of detail showcases the author's remarkable writing skills.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building in *Fathomfolk* is immaculate. The political systems, Fathomfolk races, hierarchical classes within their military and government, background machinations, history, and lore are all incredibly detailed and well-established. It feels like stepping into a fantastically flawed world that mirrors our own in its discourse around politics, immigration, history, and activism. This level of detail is a testament to Eliza Chan's skills as a writer.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - **Mira:** I appreciated Mira’s struggle as a biracial half-siren, half-human character, caught between worlds—not human enough to be respected by humans and not Fathomfolk enough to be respected by Fathomfolk. Her experience resonated with real feelings that mixed people often contend with.  \n  - **Serena:** Serena was an interesting character with her own plans and machinations, pulling strings in the background to achieve her personal goals.  \n  - **Nami:** Nami, however, was frustrating. As Kai’s younger sister, she’s young, brash, naive, and the catalyst for half the problems in the book. Her headstrong nature and lack of critical thinking lead to repeated mistakes that literally kill people. While there might be a statement about young, impressionable people jumping into activism without all the facts, this theme wasn’t explored deeply enough to justify her actions.  \n  - **Kai:** Kai was a standout character, an angel amongst hellions, and too good for everyone else in the book.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot felt chaotic, with half of it revolving around characters not realizing the consequences of their actions. Knocking down one domino takes out the whole lot, which doesn’t feel like a cohesive plot but rather uncontrolled chaos. The ending was particularly disappointing and not worth delving into.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book tackles heavy themes like racism (speci-ism?), classism, torture, death, murder, blood, injury detail, drug abuse, addiction, sexism, death of a parent, fetishization, and mentions of sexual assault. While these themes are relevant, their execution didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Fathomfolk* was an absolute disappointment. While the world-building was strong and some characters were compelling, the chaotic plot, frustrating character decisions, and lack of depth in exploring its themes made it a miss for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a low rating."

The execution of the world-building within the story was disappointing.\n\n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  The book was so boring and inconsequential that I decided to stop reading at 20%. I never DNF books, but this one was an exception because it felt like a story a third grader might write after watching Mako Mermaids and learning about Atlantis. It lacked depth and failed to hold my interest.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the beautiful cover and promising blurb, the book fell short in almost every aspect.

While the interconnected POVs were a positive aspect, the lack of an engaging inciting incident and character investment led me to stop reading at 27%.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

However, it falls short of its potential due to scattered storytelling. The plot stagnates for the first two-thirds, heavily emphasizing political intrigue, which slows the pace considerably.

The lack of clarity in scenes, such as whether they were underwater or on land, was frustrating. Additionally, the descriptions of the world and fantasy creatures were minimal, often reduced to just listing names without any meaningful explanation or detail.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were naive, stereotypical, and boring. Mira and Kai lacked chemistry, and their relationship felt forced and unconvincing. Nami and F’s relationship was toxic and unrealistic, with Nami’s naivety being hard to believe unless F used some form of magical enhancement. Nami and Dan’s friendship also felt shallow, as their interactions didn’t demonstrate any genuine connection.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  While the world had a great concept, its execution was lacking. There was little description of the setting, making it hard to visualize the environment. The excessive focus on listing food names and fantasy creatures without elaboration made the world feel underdeveloped and confusing.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was okay, but the ending was disappointing. The pacing was uneven, with significant events happening abruptly and then being ignored for several chapters before resurfacing without proper context or explanation. This made the narrative feel disjointed and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was a struggle to finish, primarily due to its poor writing, underdeveloped characters, and lackluster world-building. While the plot had potential, the execution fell flat, especially with the unsatisfying ending and inconsistent pacing. I do not plan to continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n1.5 stars"

This book achieved that distinction, which is an accomplishment in itself. I’m happy to be done with it.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around humans, half fathom-folk, sea witches, kelpies, and political worlds. When I tried to explain it to my boyfriend, he just looked at me and didn’t ask any further questions.\n\n- **Narrative Style and POV:**  \n  The story is told in a third-person POV, alternating focus on different characters across land and sea. I found it extremely difficult to connect with the characters because of the detached, outside lens. The multiple perspectives were confusing at times, especially when the focus shifted frequently, sometimes within a chapter. This made it hard to discern which character and location were being described.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was very rich, but in my opinion, it was too much. The beginning of the book failed to grab my attention, and I struggled to stay engaged.\n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  I listened to the audiobook without reading along, which made it even harder to follow. I often felt lost, unsure of who or what was happening.\n\n- **Motivation to Finish:**  \n  The only reason I kept going with the book was because it’s September, and I need to read 39 more books to complete my end-of-year goal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book left me speechless, but not in a good way. The confusing narrative style, lack of character connection, and overwhelming world-building made it a challenging and unsatisfying read.

I got to chapter 15 but couldn’t bring myself to continue.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book features three points of view, which felt overwhelming, especially since I disliked two of the characters. Mira was the only respectable one, while Nami came across as a spoiled brat, and I couldn’t stand Cordelia.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I found the choice of third-person past tense narration jarring and questioned why it was written in this style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book failed to hold my interest due to its unlikable characters, overwhelming multiple perspectives, and a writing style that didn’t resonate with me.
