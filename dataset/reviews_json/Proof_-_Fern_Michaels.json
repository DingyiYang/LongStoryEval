The repetitive elements are starting to wear on me.\n\n- **Spiritual/Philosophical Themes:**  \n  I don’t like how Luna and other characters in the stories reference “the Universe” as the cause of events rather than God. This theme is consistent throughout the entire series, and it doesn’t resonate with me.\n\n- **Anticipation for Future Sequels:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I’m sure if the author writes another sequel, I’ll still read it. There’s something compelling enough to keep me coming back.\n\n- **Target Audience and Writing Style:**  \n  The book seems to be written for young adults, with a very youthful and simplistic writing style. While this might appeal to younger readers, it feels less engaging for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the book, I’m growing weary of the series due to its repetitive themes and youthful writing style. The frequent references to “the Universe” instead of God also detract from my enjoyment. However, I’m likely to continue reading if another sequel is released.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
